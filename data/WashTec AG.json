In addition to financial aspects, supplementary disclosures must also be provided on certain non-financial aspects to the extent that they are material within the meaning of Section 289c (3) HGB. The non-financial aspects on which information must be provided comprise environmental, employee-related and social matters, respect for human rights, and combating corruption and bribery. It is stated in the report whether each aspect is material to the Company and the general public. The reporting obligations under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation can be found under \"Disclosures on Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\"\n\nPreparation of the \"Separate Non-Financial Report\" was based on the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards, 2016 version). Policies are described in accordance with the requirements of GRI 103: \"Management Approach\".\n\nA detailed report on risk management and a description of prevailing risks that could have a material impact on the further development of the WashTec Group can be found in the Combined Management Report in Section 4 \"Outlook, opportunities and risk report\" [starting on page 82. No material risks from th](#page-81-0)e Company's business activities, business relationships, products and services have been identified that are highly likely to have, or will have, severe adverse impacts on the foregoing aspects. The impacts of climate-related matters on the business model and the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the WashTec Group are explained in the Combined Management Report under [section 1, \"General information about the Group\" starting on page 56 a](#page-55-0)nd i[n Note 2 o](#page-116-0)f the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe WashTec Group began implementing the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) in fiscal year 2023. This includes developing a project plan for implementation and reporting in accordance with the CSRD from fiscal year 2024 and analyzing the requirements of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). Work has also begun on the materiality analysis. In addition, a voluntary sustainability report was once again prepared for fiscal year 2022, providing information about activities and goals in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability. This is based on the Global Reporting [Initiative \\(GRI\\) standards, 2021 version, and is available on the Company's website at](https://ir.washtec.de/en/sustainability/)  *https://ir.washtec.de/en/sustainability*.\n\nThe content of the Separate Non-financial Report is reviewed by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board is supported in this by Internal Audit.\n\n### Description of the business model and diversity policy\n\nDescriptions of the business model, external factors influencing the business, strategy, and research and development activities can be found [in the Combined Management Report in](#page-55-0)  section 1 \"General information about the Group,\" starting on page 56.\n\nThe diversity policy is described i[n the Combined Management Report in section 8.1](#page-96-0)  \"Declaration of Conformity\" starting on page 97.\n\n### Human rights and anti-corruption\n\nIn a thorough revision of the WashTec Code of Conduct (previously the WashTec Code of Ethics) in 2023, WashTec further developed the clear guidelines for law-abiding conduct and compliance with high ethical standards that the Company has had in place since 2005 and adapted them to new requirements such as the German Supply Chain Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz). The WashTec Code of Conduct includes key guidance on how employees are expected to interact both with each other and with customers, suppliers,\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nconsultants and authorities. All WashTec Group managers and employees in sensitive areas such as Sales, Procurement, Human Resources and Finance receive regular training, which concludes with a test and certification.\n\nAmong other things, the WashTec Code of Conduct also sets out rules for combating corruption and bribery. WashTec expects employees and business partners worldwide to comply with all legal requirements. The WashTec Code of Conduct for Suppliers, which likewise underwent thorough revision in the reporting year, requires business partners to comply with high ethical standards, including clear requirements regarding respect for human rights and the environment.\n\nThe project to implement the Supply Chain Act at WashTec included not only a thorough revision and update of the WashTec Code of Conduct and WashTec Supplier Code of Conduct, but also a review and adjustment of internal structures and processes in order to fully comply with the requirements for responsible supply chain management, even though WashTec does not reach the thresholds for application of the Supply Chain Act as of January 1, 2024.\n\nAs a machinery and mechanical engineering company, the WashTec Group is subject to numerous international rules and regulations, all of which are directed towards transparent and responsible supply chains. Most suppliers are located in Europe and America. WashTec thus largely operates with its production and supply chain in countries that maintain high standards in terms of respect for human rights.\n\nWith their legally binding signature on the WashTec Supplier Code of Conduct, WashTec obtains the commitment of all material business partners to comply with the principles and rules it contains. Any deviation from the rules on responsibility and integrity in corporate governance is identified in audits – such as supplier audits – that are an integral part our business activities.\n\nIn further support of the compliance system, a whistleblower system introduced in 2016 allows employees and others to raise concerns – anonymously if they prefer – and to report circumstances that may indicate a violation of the law or Company policies. Any such indications are investigated and appropriate action taken if grounds for suspicion or violations are found. As part of the implementation of the Supply Chain Act, the existing whistleblower system was supplemented with options for reporting human rights and environmental violations. In addition, processes were reviewed and adjusted as needed for implementation of the EU Whistleblower Directive (Directive EU 2019/1937) and the national implementing legislation in all countries where WashTec has subsidiaries.\n\nThe processes in place are considered to be appropriate and viable for the identification and elimination of questionable ethical and human rights matters.\n\n### Environmental matters\n\nThe Separate Combined Non-Financial Report 2022 assessed environmental matters as material. This assessment remains valid for the present report. In fiscal year 2023, water consumption was assessed as a new material aspect alongside the reduction of carbon emissions.\n\nIn addition, planning continued as to when and under what conditions the WashTec Group can become climate-neutral in the countries where it has production sites (including service and sales). The largest source of energy consumption and carbon emissions at WashTec is the vehicle park. Technological developments with regard to how vehicles are powered and the related infrastructure are therefore crucial to the achievement of climate neutrality. A further factor is the implementation of projects of our own. These include projects to further reduce energy consumption, convert heating systems, modernize the equipment and technologies used and expand photovoltaic electricity generation. Conditions in each country and region also influence the achievement of climate neutrality. This includes charging infrastructure and a country's general philosophy with regard to climate-friendly transportation. Another, primarily regional factor is utilities' energy mix and CO2 equivalent in the supply of heat and power.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Outcomes\n\nOne of the most important metrics in management reviews is the accident rate. This is determined for the entire Group. Continuous improvement of HSE processes and management systems over the years has ensured that the number of occupational accidents is consistently below the industry average reported by the employers' liability insurance association. There were no occupational accidents in fiscal year 2023 with fatal or serious injuries, meaning with lasting injury or resulting in a pension entitlement.\n\nThe number of occupational accidents per million hours worked, at 4.2 in the 2023 reporting year as in the prior year, was well below the industry average for 2022 (20.4) reported by the employers' liability insurance association.\n\n### Social matters\n\nAll activities surrounding responsible management of the working relationship with employees fit together in a closely interlocking package of measures. Factors shaping the human resources strategy include the globalization of the business activities, rapid adaptation of work processes, workforce age structure and needs relating to digitalization and new ways of working. In collaboration with management at our individual operating sites, this results in a detailed picture of the measures needed.\n\nSuccessful corporate development is rooted in detailed awareness of the needs and potential of our workforce at all locations. The Human Resources (HR) function, which is under the direction of the CEO, coordinates cross-cutting measures. These are implemented by local HR managers. The principles guiding the development of our HR strategy are based on the Corporate Philosophy, the Corporate Guidelines and national legal requirements at our operating locations.\n\nIn 2021, a diversity policy was formulated for WashTec in close collaboration with the diversity team. This sets out rules for respectful interaction. Activities to promote respectful interaction among the workforce are headed by the diversity team, which is made up of two\n\ndiversity officers and three additional members from the Management Board, the Works Council and HR. In addition, diversity ambassadors disseminate the subject of diversity together with related guidance across all corporate units and levels.\n\nThe development of our employee and social program is based in particular on:\n\n- W Participative working methods, such as cross-departmental teams\n- W A consistent and long-term employment policy\n- W Constructive communication between employer and employees\n- W Intensified training and professional development\n- W Equal treatment, equal opportunities and diversity.\n\nIn addition to our employee development activities, the Company has also selected a number of social projects for support, primarily involving local non-profit organizations.\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Disclosures on Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation\n\n### General disclosures/principles\n\nWith its Sustainable Finance Action Plan, the European Commission pursues the goal of channeling capital flows into environmentally sustainable activities. One measure towards this goal is the introduction of a uniform classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities (under the EU Taxonomy Regulation). Under delegated acts and pronouncements by the European Commission supplementing Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088), companies that are subject to an obligation to publish non-financial information pursuant to the CSR Directive (EU Directive 2014/95/EU) are required to comply with continuously increasing reporting obligations.\n\nThey are required to disclose, with reference to six specified objectives (Article 9 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation), how and to what extent their business activities are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable. In particular, non-financial reporting must include the following performance indicators:\n\n- W The proportion of turnover (i.e., revenue) derived from products or services associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable under the Taxonomy Regulation.\n- W The proportion of capital expenditure (CapEx) and the proportion of operating expenditure (OpEx) related to assets or processes associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable under the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nThe six environmental objectives in the EU Taxonomy Regulation are:\n\n- I. Climate change mitigation\n- II. Climate change adaptation\n- III. Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- IV. Transition to a circular economy\n- V. Pollution prevention and control\n- VI. Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nEconomic activities are Taxonomy-eligible if they fall under the economic activities listed in Annex I and II and the associated amendments of the Climate Delegated Act or Annex I to IV of the Environmental Delegated Act (referred to in the following as the \"Delegated Acts issued in this connection\").\n\nUnder Article 3 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, economic activities are Taxonomy-aligned if they:\n\n- W Make a substantial contribution to one or more of the six objectives in accordance with Articles 10 to 16 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation,\n- W Do no significant harm (\"DNSH\") with regard to any of the five additional objectives in accordance with Article 17 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation,\n- W Are carried out in compliance with the minimum safeguards (for occupational safety and health and human rights) laid down in Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and\n- W Comply with technical screening criteria established by the European Commission.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Reporting in fiscal year 2023\n\nFor fiscal year 2023, with regard to the two climate objectives, it is necessary to report on the proportion of turnover, CapEx and OpEx associated both with economic activities that are Taxonomy-eligible and those that are not Taxonomy-eligible and with economic activities that are Taxonomy-aligned and those that are not Taxonomy-aligned. With regard to the four remaining environmental objectives, it is necessary to report for fiscal year 2023 on the proportion of turnover, CapEx and OpEx associated with economic activities that are Taxonomy-eligible and those that are not Taxonomy-eligible. Qualitative explanations must additionally be provided for all six objectives.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation contains language and terms that remain subject to interpretation and could lead to changes in reporting if clarified by the EU at a later date. There is a risk that this would change the assessment of the reported figures. Our interpretation is presented below.\n\n### Economic activities\n\nOn the basis of its business model, the WashTec Group has assessed all economic activities listed for the six objectives listed in the Delegated Acts issued in this connection.\n\nThe WashTec Group's economic activities are based on the aggregation of product groups. These comprise:\n\n- W The development, manufacture and sale of vehicle wash equipment, including peripherals, and water recovery systems together with related services (hereafter \"Equipment and Service\")\n- W The development, manufacture and sale of carwash chemicals (hereafter \"Chemicals\")\n\nA detailed assessment of the WashTec Group's business activities has shown that they fall partly within the scope of the Delegated Acts issued in this connection.\n\nThe climate objectives – \"climate change mitigation\" and \"climate change adaptation\" – primarily relate to those economic activities and sectors which have the greatest potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The business model of the WashTec Group does not fall under these sectors.\n\nThe Equipment and Service business activity is partially Taxonomy-eligible with regard to the environmental objective \"Transition to a circular economy.\" The water recovery systems product corresponds to economic activity 2.2 \"Production of alternative water resources for purposes other than human consumption\" listed in Annex II of the Environmental Delegated Act.\n\nThe water recovery systems manufactured by WashTec enable the collection and treatment of grey water\\* and, by thus producing an alternative water resource, reduce the fresh water consumption of the equipment in operation on customer sites.\n\nThe three remaining environmental objectives – \"Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources,\" \"Pollution prevention and control\" and \"Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\" – primarily relate to those economic activities and sectors which have the greatest potential for significant improvements in environmental protection in relation to these three objectives. The WashTec Group's business model does not fall under these sectors.\n\nThe WashTec Group does not engage in any economic activity related to energy generation from fossil gas or nuclear energy. Accordingly, templates 2 to 5 under the Regulation are not presented. Template 1 is provided on p. 50.\n\n*\\*Grey water includes waste water from bathtubs, showers, bathroom sinks, clothes washing machines and laundry sinks.*\n\nW Other\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Accounting policy\n\nThe WashTec Group has determined the key performance indicators under the EU Taxonomy Regulation, comprising turnover, CapEx and OpEx, in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in force as of the reporting date together with the interpretations of the IFRS IC (IFRIC) as adopted by the European Union. The disclosures on the performance indicators relate to the companies fully consolidated in the WashTec Group's financial statements.\n\nWith regard to the climate targets, the WashTec Group's business activities are not Taxonomy-eligible and not Taxonomy-aligned. For this reason, no disclosures are provided in the following for categories (a) and (b) of points 1.1.2.2 and 1.1.3.2 of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act. The measures set out in the following relate to the purchase of intermediate products and services from potentially Taxonomy-aligned economic activities that lead to greenhouse gas reductions (category (c) of points 1.1.2.2 and 1.1.3.2 of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act). The measures were identified on the basis of the WashTec Group's Environment and Energy Roadmap 2025 (see also under \"Environmental matters\") and the climate change mitigation objective.\n\nThe WashTec Group reports in this regard on the Taxonomy eligibility of purchased intermediate products and services. It was not possible to assess their Taxonomy alignment because verification of compliance with the technical screening criteria resides with the suppliers and service providers and not with WashTec. This applies in particular to the \"DNSH\" criteria and compliance with the minimum safeguards.\n\nWith regard to the environmental objective \"Transition to a circular economy,\" the Equipment and Service business activity is partially Taxonomy-eligible. The water recovery systems product corresponds to economic activity 2.2 \"Production of alternative water resources for purposes other than human consumption\" listed in Annex II of the Environmental Delegated Act.\n\nDouble counting in the allocation of turnover, CapEx and OpEx in the numerator to economic activities is avoided by allocating the various measures to the individual activities and objectives. In addition, no separate CapEx or OpEx has been identified for the climate change adaptation objective that contributes to this objective in particular.\n\n### Performance indicators\n\nFor fiscal year 2023, the three key performance indicators turnover, CapEx and OpEx must be disclosed in relation to Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-non-eligible economic activities (all objectives) and in relation to Taxonomy-aligned and Taxonomy-non-aligned economic activities (climate objectives) (Article 5 (2) of the Environmental Delegated Act).\n\nThe turnover key performance indicator is calculated as the proportion of revenue derived from products or services associated with economic activities that qualify as Taxonomyeligible or Taxonomy-aligned under the Taxonomy Regulation (numerator), divided by the consolidated revenue in fiscal year 2023 (denominator) (point 1.1.1 of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act).\n\nThe water recovery systems product is assigned to the \"Equipment and Service\" business activity. This business activity corresponds to economic activity 2.2 \"Production of alternative water resources for purposes other than human consumption\" under the environmental objective \"transition to a circular economy\" and is thus Taxonomy-eligible (Annex II of the Environmental Delegated Act). Turnover from water recovery systems has been determined on the basis of revenue from the individual product groups. Turnover generated with water recovery systems amounted to €8,209k in fiscal year 2023.\n\nThe numerator for Taxonomy-eligible revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation is €8,209k.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe denominator is net turnover within the meaning of Article 2 (5), of Directive 2013/34 and is €489,468k (see \"Revenue\" in the Consolidated Income Statement).\n\nThe CapEx key performance indicator is calculated as the proportion relating to assets or processes that are associated with economic activities that qualify as Taxonomy-eligible or Taxonomy-aligned under the Taxonomy Regulation (numerator), divided by the total additions to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use assets in fiscal year 2023 (denominator) (point 1.1.2 of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act).\n\nThe WashTec Group has invested in two laser welding systems to improve the energy efficiency of the metalworking processes at its plants in Augsburg and the Czech Republic. The new systems reduce electricity consumption. They also reduce compressed air consumption, which further reduces electricity consumption. This measure aims for a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The final payment amounted to €111k and was recognized in the technical equipment and machinery asset category. This qualifies as a measure in accordance with category (c) of point 1.1.2.2 of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act. The economic activity to which the measure is allocated under the \"climate change mitigation\" objective in accordance with Annex I of the Climate Delegated Act is 3.6 \"Manufacture of other low carbon technologies\".\n\nIn the area of industrial trucks, LPG forklifts have begun to be replaced with electric forklifts. This measure aims for a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The associated CapEx amounted to €144k and was recognized in the \"right-of-use assets: other plant, fixtures and fittings\" asset category. This qualifies as a measure in accordance with category (c) of point 1.1.2.2 of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act. The economic activity to which the measure is allocated under the \"climate change mitigation\" objective in accordance with Annex I of the Climate Delegated Act is 3.6 \"Manufacture of other low carbon technologies\".\n\nThe new car policy in particular contributes to the further electrification of the Company vehicle fleet and thus to the reduction of carbon emissions. The CapEx associated with the leasing of category M1 and N1 electric vehicles amounted to €244k and was recognized in the \"right-of-use assets: other plant, fixtures and fittings\" asset category. This qualifies as a measure in accordance with category (c) of point 1.1.2.2 of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act. The economic activity to which the measure is allocated under the \"climate change mitigation\" objective in accordance with Annex I of the Climate Delegated Act is 6.5 \"Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles\".\n\nIn connection with the electrification of the fleet, charging infrastructure for electric vehicles and electric industrial trucks has been installed at all production sites in Germany. The CapEx associated with the installation of charging stations for electric vehicles amounted to €34k and was recognized in the \"Land, land rights and buildings\" asset category. This qualifies as a measure in accordance with category (c) of point 1.1.2.2 of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act. The economic activity to which the measure is allocated under the \"climate change mitigation\" objective in accordance with Annex I of the Climate Delegated Act is 7.4 \"Installation, maintenance and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings (and parking spaces attached to buildings)\".\n\nThe numerator of the total Taxonomy-eligible CapEx for the economic activity 3.6 \"Manufacture of other low carbon technologies\" is €255k.\n\nThe numerator of the total Taxonomy-eligible CapEx in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation is €533k. Of this amount, €145k relates to additions to property, plant and equipment and €388k to right-of-use assets.\n\nThe denominator comprising CapEx consists of additions to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use assets in fiscal year 2023 and is €26,969k (see Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, [Note 14, un](#page-140-0)der additions to cost, an[d Note 15,](#page-142-0)  Right-of-use assets).\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nThe OpEx key performance indicator is calculated as the proportion relating to assets or processes that are associated with economic activities that qualify as Taxonomy-eligible or Taxonomy-aligned under the Taxonomy Regulation (numerator), divided by OpEx for fiscal year 2023 in accordance with point 1.1.3 of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act (denominator). This covers direct non-capitalized costs that relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment that are necessary to ensure their continued and effective functioning.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, in order to reduce energy consumption and thus improve the environmental performance of its operations, the WashTec Group continued the project launched in fiscal year 2021 for the gradual conversion of the German sites to energy-efficient LED lighting. The attributable OpEx amounted to €4k and was recognized in the consolidated income statement under \"cost of sales\". It was determined on the basis of the costs recorded in the relevant account. This qualifies as a measure in accordance with category (c) of point 1.1.3.2 of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act. The economic activity to which the measure is allocated under the climate change mitigation objective in accordance with Annex I of the Climate Delegated Act is 7.3 \"Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment, category (d) installation and replacement of energy efficient light sources\".\n\nThe numerator of the total Taxonomy-eligible OpEx in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation is €4k.\n\nThe denominator comprising OpEx as defined above is €16,837k.\n\nThe templates presented in the following correspond to the requirements in Annex V of the Environmental Delegated Act.\n\nImage /page/41/Picture/7 description: The image shows a close-up of a car wash machine with large, rotating brushes.

In their respective KPIs, where the use of proceeds from the financing is not known, financial undertakings shall compute the financing of economic activities contributing to multiple environmental objectives under the most relevant environmental objective that is reported in bold in this template by non-financial undertakings. An environmental objective may only be reported in bold once in one row to avoid double counting of economic activities in the KPIs of financial undertakings. This shall not apply to the computation of Taxonomy-alignment of economic activities for financial products defined in point (12) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. Non-financial undertakings shall also report the extent of eligibility and alignment per environmental objective, that includes alignment with each of environmental objectives for activities contributing substantially to several objectives, by using the template below:\n\n(d) EL Taxonomy-eligible activity for the relevant objective N/EL Taxonomy-non-eligible activity for the relevant objective\n\nPrior-year information in relation to the Climate Delegated Act; for the Environmental Delegated Act, prior-year information is to be provided for the first time for reporting on fiscal year 2024.\n\n|     | Taxonomy-aligned per objective | Taxonomy-eligible per objective |\n|-----|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| CCM | 0%                             | n/a                             |\n| CCA | 0%                             | n/a                             |\n| WTR | 0%                             | n/a                             |\n| CE  | n/a                            | 2%                              |\n| PPC | 0%                             | n/a                             |\n| BIO | 0%                             | n/a                             |\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\nProportion of CapEx from products or services associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities – disclosure covering year 2023 / 1 (continued on next page)\n\n| Financial year 2023                                                        |         |       |                                |                                 | Substantial contribution criteria |                     |                     |                     |                     |                                 | DNSH criteria (\"Does not Significantly Harm\") |       |           |                     |                   |                       |                                                                                            |                                  |                                      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Economic Activities                                                        | Code(a) | CapEx | Proportion<br>of CapEx<br>2023 | Climate<br>Change<br>Mitigation | Climate<br>Change<br>Adaptation   | Water               | Pollution           | Circular<br>Economy | Bio-<br>diversity   | Climate<br>Change<br>Mitigation | Climate<br>Change<br>Adaptation               | Water | Pollution | Circular<br>Economy | Bio-<br>diversity | Minimum<br>Safeguards | Proportion<br>of<br>Taxonomy-<br>aligned<br>(A.1) or<br>eligible<br>(A.2)<br>CapEx<br>2022 | Category<br>enabling<br>activity | Category<br>transitional<br>activity |\n| (1)                                                                        | (2)     | (3)   | (4)                            | (5)                             | (6)                               | (7)                 | (8)                 | (9)                 | (10)                | (11)                            | (12)                                          | (13)  | (14)      | (15)                | (16)              | (17)                  | (18)                                                                                       | (19)                             | (20)                                 |\n|                                                                            |         | €k    | %                              | Y;N;<br>N/EL(b) (c)             | Y;N;<br>N/EL(b) (c)               | Y;N;<br>N/EL(b) (c) | Y;N;<br>N/EL(b) (c) | Y;N;<br>N/EL(b) (c) | Y;N;<br>N/EL(b) (c) | Y/N                             | Y/N                                           | Y/N   | Y/N       | Y/N                 | Y/N               | Y/N                   | %                                                                                          | E                                | T                                    |\n| A.

The quoted market price of financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are classified in level 1.\n\nLevel 2: The fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market (such as OTC derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable market data and minimize the use of company-specific estimates. If all significant inputs for measurement of an instrument at fair value are observable, the instrument is classified in Level 2. The derivative financial liabilities in Level 2 in fiscal year 2023 comprise interest rate swaps, which are measured at the fair value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.\n\nLevel 3: If one or more of the significant inputs are not observable, the instrument is classified in Level 3.\n\nThere were no reclassifications of recurring fair value measurements between the individual levels during the fiscal year. Reclassifications into and out of levels in the fair value hierarchy are made at the end of the reporting period.\n\nDue to their short terms, the fair values of current trade receivables, trade payables and cash and cash equivalents as well as other financial assets, other financial liabilities and interest-bearing loans generally match their carrying amounts. The fair value of noncurrent trade receivables and lease liabilities is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at current market interest rates. The fair value of long-term interestbearing loans is based on the discounted cash flows using the current market interest rate for such loans.\n\nDerivative financial instruments in the form of long-term interest rate swaps have been entered into during the year. These are used to hedge the interest rate risk on the bank loans taken out to finance the purchase price of the site of the US subsidiary. They are valued on the basis of the banks' market valuation.\n\n### Net gains and losses by category\n\nThe following table shows the net gains and losses on financial instruments based on the IFRS 9 categories:\n\n| in €k                                                                                      | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Financial assets at amortized cost (AC)                                                    | 192    | -19    |\n| Financial liabilities at amortized cost (FLAC)                                             | -4,112 | -1,210 |\n| Financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value through profit<br>or loss (FVthP/L) | 62     | 0      |\n\nThe net gains or losses in the financial assets at amortized cost (AC) category are primarily attributable to foreign currency measurement and those in the financial liabilities at amortized cost (FLAC) category are primarily attributable to interest expenses and foreign currency measurement. The assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVthP/L) category relates to interest income on derivative financial instruments.\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Other information\n\n### 34.

This was mainly due to the chemicals business, where new customers were acquired, while revenue performance was stable in Equipment and Service.\n\n### Significant increase in EBIT\n\nMainly as a result of the implemented price increases and active cost management, the EBIT of €41.9m was significantly higher than the prior year (€38.0m). The EBIT margin improved to 8.6% (prior year: 7.9%).\n\n### Significant rise in free cash flow\n\nFree cash flow increased significantly to €46.1m (prior year: €16.2m) despite the €9.5m acquisition of the site occupied by the American subsidiary.\n\n{2}------------------------------------------------\n\n### The EBIT margin increased to 11.3% in the fourth quarter\n\n| Q4                              |       | Q4 2023    | Q42022     | Change   |      |\n|---------------------------------|-------|------------|------------|----------|------|\n|                                 |       |            |            | absolute | in % |\n| Revenue                         | €m    | 132.8      | 143.7      | -10.9    | -7.6 |\n| EBIT                            | €m    | 15.0       | 15.4       | -0.4     | -2.6 |\n| EBIT margin                     | %     | 11.3       | 10.7       | 0.6      | 5.6  |\n| EBT                             | €m    | 14.2       | 15.2       | -1.0     | -6.6 |\n| Net income                      | €m    | 11.1       | 11.6       | -0.5     | -4.3 |\n| Number of shares in circulation | units | 13,382,324 | 13,382,324 | –        | –    |\n| Earnings per share              | €     | 0.83       | 0.87       | -0.04    | -4.3 |\n\n### Revenue down in fourth quarter\n\nRevenue of €132.8m was 7.6% down on the record prior-year quarter (€143.7m).\n\n### EBIT at high prior-year level with higher EBIT margin\n\nDespite the lower revenue, the EBIT of €15.0m was on the same high level as in the prior year (€15.4m). The EBIT margin increased to 11.3% (prior year: 10.7%). The implemented cost increases and active cost management contributed to this positive outcome.\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Contents\n\nImage /page/3/Picture/5 description: A close-up shot depicts a series of green, textured strips hanging vertically from a metallic structure above.

Persistently high inflation and the resulting key interest rate hikes, coupled with a generally high level of economic uncertainty, significantly slowed consumption and investment. Tensions with China, the ongoing war in Ukraine and the Middle East conflict also had a noticeable impact on economic development. The German economy has cooled significantly since the end of last year. Contrary to expectations last summer, a recovery failed to materialize in the second half of the year. This ongoing crisis mode has led to increased general economic uncertainty and also made our customers cautious about investing.\n\nWashTec responded to these successive crises in the fiscal year, among other things by adjusting its strategy. In the summer, together with the Supervisory Board, we defined and confirmed the following priorities for the years ahead:\n\n- Total customer care: We continue to focus on maximum customer benefit in everything we do. Based on our portfolio of superior equipment and biodegradable wash chemicals and on our advanced digital platform, we offer carwash operators and consumers the most profitable and most sustainable carwash. With the coordinated, integrated system of carwash equipment, water treatment and chemicals, we enable our customers to achieve the best possible wash results. We see the integration of our entire product and service portfolio – equipment, service and chemicals, embedded in digital solutions – as a source of major growth potential.\n- In regional terms, we will primarily focus on our core regions of Europe and North America in order to better exploit the market potential available there.\n\nFollowing the changes on the Supervisory Board and the Management Board in the new fiscal year, the implementation of this strategic direction will be accelerated in 2024.\n\nIn connection with the regional focus on our defined core markets, we sold the majority of our Chinese subsidiary to the existing management at the end of 2023. The Chinese market will continue to be developed as a distributor market.\n\nOur focus in the ongoing expansion of our digital capabilities is on systematically implementing additional customer benefits. To this end, WashTec entered into a cooperation on in-car payment with Ryd Wash in January 2024. In February 2024, we announced a strategic partnership with Superoperator. This partnership will embed the most advanced digital subscription solution for consumers into our digital service portfolio.\n\nThese realignments will lead to a strengthening of our profitable business growth. The Service and Chemicals business lines will have above-average growth and will benefit from digitalization.\n\nThe WashTec Group achieved a new revenue record of €489.5m in fiscal year 2023, an increase of€7.3m or 1.5% on the prior year (€482.2m). At constant exchange rates, the growth in revenue was 3.4%.\n\nThe revenue growth compared to the prior year was mainly due to a larger contribution from the aftersales business with service and chemicals. Revenue with our chemical products especially developed very positively due to the acquisition of new customers, increasing by 15.6% year on year.\n\nDue to an improvement in gross profit, EBIT rose by 10.3% to €41.9m (prior year: €38.0m). The EBIT margin was 8.6% (prior year: 7.9%). We have therefore delivered, and met our guidance for 2023.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\nOrders received were lower in the reporting year than in the prior year due to the drop in demand in the market as a whole. The lower level of orders received meant that the order backlog at the end of December 2023 was down on the prior year, but it is still high overall compared to the long-term average and secures capacity utilization for the first few months of the new fiscal year.\n\nIn Europe, the equipment business was mainly affected by the general economic uncertainty and by changes in strategic orientation at major customers – such as Total Energies selling all of its service stations in Germany and the Netherlands to Couche-Tard. Renewal of the product portfolio involves start-up and ramp-up costs. Measures such as training for our service employees and design-to-cost issues were addressed in the fourth quarter and are having an impact in the new fiscal year. The good service business and, above all, the very good chemicals business helped to compensate for these issues. In total, EBIT in Europe remained at the prior year's level of €36.2m.\n\nRevenue in North America was maintained at the same level in US dollars as in the prior year. The WashTec Group's business in this region was also adversely affected by the generally subdued demand. Earnings in North America increased significantly by €4.3m to €5.7m. This is mainly due to the efficiency improvement projects launched and successfully implemented in fiscal year 2023, particularly in the areas of supply chain and service.\n\nDespite the uncertain overall economic situation described above, we achieved our targets in 2023 and met our guidance in all respects. With the more sharply focused strategy and accelerated execution, we have laid the basis for further profitable growth.\n\nWe will be helped here not only by the collaborations with digital service partners described above, but also by the high level of research and development expenditure maintained in fiscal year 2023. The focus of this R&D was on developing additional features and functions for the new gantry carwash platform. The new competition-beating digital gantry carwash offers outstanding washing and drying performance at maximum process speed. At the same time,\n\nwe are continuously reducing the ecological footprint. We have made further improvements here through a better understanding of the biological and chemical interrelationships in water treatment, further reducing the amount of fresh water needed and thus helping to address the water shortages caused by climate change in many regions. Another focus was the successful introduction of a modular system for the new JetWash generation, which ensures fast assembly and easy commissioning at customers' sites. As of December 31, 2023, around 70 people were employed in research and development. This represents 4.1% of the workforce and illustrates the importance of innovation to our future success.\n\nFocusing on the entire integrated system of equipment, water treatment and biodegradable chemicals places an increased emphasis on sustainability. Consumers want to wash their cars in the most environmentally friendly way possible, and our own customers – the operators of carwash equipment – are also increasingly concerned about sustainable and cost-effective use of resources. We address this need. With our automated carwashes, water treatment and Green Car Care chemicals, we provide customers with the products they require for this purpose. It is our corporate responsibility to continuously improve and further develop the sustainability aspects of our business model.\n\nSustainability is also an integral part of our business processes. This is very important to us. We therefore continued our extensive reporting in fiscal year 2023, compiling our second voluntary Sustainability Report, the WashTec Sustainability Policy and the WashTec Group Environmental Policy. These documents can be viewed at any time on the Company website a[t https://ir.washtec.de/en/sustainability/. They provide information on our activities and goals](https://ir.washtec.de/en/sustainability/)  in the areas of economic, environmental and social sustainability.\n\nNone of this would have been possible without our employees and their tireless commitment to WashTec. In challenging times like these, it is all the more important that we at WashTec pull together and demonstrate on a daily basis that drive and solidarity are core elements of our corporate culture. On behalf of my colleagues on the Management Board and myself, I would like to thank all our employees for their dedication and hard work in 2023.\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\nFiscal 2023 was not an easy year. Nevertheless, we have steered our company well through these challenging times and worked intensively on our future direction. By adjusting our strategy, we have laid the groundwork for our company to return to a double-digit EBIT margin in the coming years, and our consistent focus on maximizing customer benefit will lead to increasing earnings contributions. We are sure that we have taken the action needed.\n\nThank you very much for your trust and loyalty.\n\nAndreas Pabst CFO/Member of the Management Board\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/9 description: The image shows a close-up of blue, cloth-like strips hanging down, possibly part of a car wash.

The Supervisory Board was directly involved in all decisions of fundamental significance to the Company. It regularly obtained updates on the condition of the Group throughout fiscal year 2023.\n\ndynamism and conviction.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nstances.\n\nThe Supervisory Board also supervised the managerial activities of the Management Board of WashTec AG. This work was based on timely written and verbal reporting by the Management Board to the Supervisory Board. Among other things, the Management Board reported each month in writing to the Supervisory Board about the development of the business. As needed, the Supervisory Board also requested additional reports from the\n\nManagement Board and inspected other relevant Company documentation. Any departure of the actual business development from plans and targets was explained to the Supervisory Board in detail and examined by the Supervisory Board based on the documents presented. The Management Board notably coordinated with the Supervisory Board with regard to the Company's strategic orientation. The Supervisory Board extensively discussed transactions of importance to the Company on the basis of the reports issued by the Management Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board voted on all reports and draft resolutions submitted by the Management Board wherever required by law, the Company's Articles of Association or rules of procedure, after thorough examination and discussion. Beyond the extensive work conducted during the Supervisory Board meetings, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board maintained constant contact with the Management Board and consulted between Supervisory Board meetings in numerous one-on-one discussions with the Management Board on the Company's strategy, planning, business development, risk situation, risk management and compliance. The remaining Supervisory Board members also exchanged information with the Management Board outside of meetings. All members of the Supervisory Board reported in detail to the remaining members on their one-on-one consultations with the Management Board. In fiscal year 2023, notably in light of the ongoing global macroeconomic crises, the plenary Supervisory Board held a total of thirteen meetings (five in-person meetings and eight hybrid meetings, i.e. in-person with virtual attendance option).\n\nThe Supervisory Board and its committees held at least one meeting in each quarter. In addition, various resolutions were adopted outside of meetings by circulation. In plenary meetings, the committee chairpersons regularly informed the Supervisory Board about the work of the committees. A separate report on the work of the committees is provided below. All members of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board additionally convened for a two-day strategy workshop. The Supervisory Board also regularly met without the Management Board.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\nAlongside Management Board and Supervisory Board matters, topics of regular Supervisory Board consultations included market trends, the competitive situation, product development, the development of revenue, earnings and human resources, finances, capital allocation, the main Group companies, the risk management system and the strategic orientation and development of the WashTec Group. The Management Board reported regularly and comprehensively to the Supervisory Board about corporate planning, the course of business, strategic development and the current situation of the Group. The Supervisory Board consequently had a detailed understanding of all major business events and developments at the WashTec Group at all times.\n\nFurthermore, the Supervisory Board examined transactions and actions of the Management Board requiring approval and decided upon the granting of such approval. The current business situation and the Company's financial performance, financial position and cash flows were discussed on a regular basis in comparison to budgeted figures.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Supervisory Board also addressed succession planning for the Management Board. On February 28, 2024, the Supervisory Board appointed Mr. Michael Drolshagen as the Company's new Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) with effect from May 1, 2024. He succeeds Dr. Ralf Koeppe, whose membership of the Management Board ended by mutual agreement on February 29, 2024.\n\nOther individual topics addressed in meetings were as follows:\n\n- Discussion, audit and adoption of the annual and consolidated financial statements, the combined management report and the non-financial statement of WashTec AG for fiscal year 2022 (first quarter)\n- Use of net profit (first quarter)\n- Resolution on the agenda for the Annual General Meeting (first quarter)\n- Strategy workshop (second quarter)\n- Consultation on the quarterly statements (second and fourth quarters)\n- Consultation on the half-year report (third quarter)\n- Selection and proposal procedure for auditor from 2024\n- Supervisory Board matters (ongoing)\n- Management Board matters (ongoing)\n- Changes on the board\n- Management Board and Supervisory Board remuneration\n- Review and approval of the non-financial statement and the diversity policy\n- Declaration of Conformity and regular compliance update\n- Sales and marketing strategies and projects; global service\n- Digital transformation\n- Sustainability/ESG\n- WashTec Obeya Initiative\n- Status, strategy and processes in North America and China\n- Product development, processes and projects, in particular with regard to SmartCare\n- Annual planning for 2024 and medium-term planning\n\nKey topics at the March 25, 2024 meeting for adoption of the financial statements comprised discussion of the annual financial statements of WashTec AG, of the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2023 together with adoption and approval of the annual and consolidated financial statements, and of the combined management report. It also addressed the Remuneration Report for fiscal year 2023.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Composition of the Supervisory Board\n\nIn accordance with the Articles of Association of WashTec AG, the Supervisory Board consists of six members elected by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Chairman of the Company's Supervisory Board, Dr. Günter Blaschke, notified the Company's Management Board on November 8, 2023 that he would be stepping down from the Supervisory Board effective December 31, 2023. The decision was made for personal reasons and by mutual agreement with the Supervisory Board and the Management Board.\n\nOn December 19, 2023, the Supervisory Board unanimously elected Ulrich Bellgardt – member of the Supervisory Board since 2014 and Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board – as the new Chairman of the Supervisory Board of WashTec AG effective January 1, 2024. Peter Wiedemann, member of the Supervisory Board since 2022, was elected as the new Deputy Chairman of the Company's Supervisory Board effective January 1, 2024.\n\nFollowing Dr. Blaschke's departure from the Supervisory Board, a resolution on the election of a new member of the Supervisory Board will be adopted at the 2024 Annual General Meeting.\n\n### Report on the work of the committees\n\nIn the reporting year, there were six committees (Audit Committee, Personnel Committee, Nomination Committee, Innovation and Production Committee, Sales Strategy Committee and Corporate Strategy and Sustainability Committee) whose primary purpose was to prepare Supervisory Board meetings and resolutions for the plenary Supervisory Board. The committees can also be assigned decision-making powers within the scope of mandatory [statutory provisions. The composition of the committees is shown on](#page-100-0) page 101. A brief overview of the work of the committees in the reporting year is provided in the following.\n\nThe Audit Committee convened six times in the fiscal year under review. Four meetings of the committee were held in person, while one was held as a hybrid meeting and one as a virtual meeting by video conference. Two meetings were held in the presence of the auditor. The Committee primarily consulted on the annual financial statements of WashTec AG and the consolidated financial statements along with the combined management report, the non-financial statement, supervision of the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of the internal control system, risk management system, the work of Internal Audit and capital allocation. Other topics of the meetings were the upcoming change of auditor for fiscal year 2024 together with the selection and proposal procedure required by law for this purpose. Based on the proposal of the Audit Committee, the entire Supervisory Board will propose KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft to the Annual General Meeting as the auditor for 2024.\n\nWithout exception, the Audit Committee discussed the Group's quarterly reports and halfyear financial report in detail prior to publication. It also defined the focal points of the audit for the reporting year, issued the audit engagement to the auditor, addressed new accounting and reporting requirements (EU taxonomy) and consulted on compliance matters.\n\nThe Personnel Committee met ten times during the reporting year. Four meetings of the committee were held in person and six meetings were held as virtual meetings by video conference. Its meetings focused on changes on the Management Board, Management Board remuneration and long-term succession planning.\n\nThe Nomination Committee met twice during the reporting year held as a virtual meeting. One meeting was held in connection with the expiration of the Supervisory Board mandates for Dr. Blaschke and Mr. Bellgardt at the end of the 2023 Annual General Meeting. The Nomination Committee decided to recommend that the Supervisory Board should nominate Dr. Blaschke and Mr. Bellgardt for re-election at the 2023 Annual General Meeting. The committee also met in connection with the resignation of Dr. Blaschke.\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Innovation and Production Committee convened three times in the fiscal year under review, in one case for a two-day meeting. All meetings of the committee were held in person. The focus was primarily on organization, processes, strategic product development projects, digitalization and product sustainability.\n\nThe Sales strategy committee met twice during the reporting year, both times in person. The main focus was on sales and marketing activities, developments in a number of core markets and the outlook and targets for sales and marketing activities, primarily in the North America region.\n\nThe Corporate Strategy and Sustainability Committee met twice during the reporting year, with one meeting held in person and one in hybrid form. In addition to the continuous improvement of sustainability reporting, key topics included the preparation of the annual strategy workshop and the further development of WashTec's sustainability strategy.\n\nGood collaborative working relationships were assured at all times.\n\n### Individualized disclosure of meeting attendance\n\nMembers' attendance at the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees was 99% in fiscal year 2023.

No such conflicts of interest were disclosed in the reporting period.\n\n### Corporate governance\n\nThe Management Board and the Supervisory Board regard corporate governance as an ongoing process and regularly address compliance with the stipulations of the German Corporate Governance Code. They have conducted a joint review of corporate governance. On December 19, 2023, the Management Board and Supervisory Board submitted an up[dated Declaration of Conformity, which is reprinted beginning on page 97. The Audit Com](#page-96-0)mittee also consulted in-depth on the compliance organization and corporate audits. Compliance updates are a regular topic of Audit Committee meetings. The new members also had the opportunity to have discussions with senior management.\n\nThe Company subscribed to a specialist periodical on apprenticeship training and professional development on behalf of the Supervisory Board in the 2023 reporting year. Supervisory Board members also took part in various internal and external professional development events. As a fundamental part of the onboarding process for the newly elected members of the Supervisory Board, the Company provides onboarding information and personal discussions are held with members of the Management Board.\n\n### Remuneration system for the Management Board\n\nIn its meeting of March 24, 2021, the entire Supervisory Board updated and adopted the Management Board remuneration system. The remuneration system for the Management Board was approved by the 2021 Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Management Board remuneration system is geared to the responsibilities and performance of the Management Board members and to the situation of the Company. The overall remuneration of members of the Management Board is made up of monetary and non-mon-\n\netary as well as fixed and variable components and is linked overall to sustained growth of the Company.\n\nAll remuneration components are structured in such a way that they are appropriate, both individually and in the aggregate, and do not encourage the taking of unreasonable risks. The remuneration of Management Board and Supervisory Board members is described in greater detail in the Remuneration Report, which is available on the Company's website.\n\n### Audit of the 2023 annual and consolidated financial statements\n\nIn accordance with the resolution of the Annual General Meeting on May 15, 2023, the Audit Committee engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH, Munich, to audit the annual financial statements of WashTec AG and the consolidated financial statements and combined management report of WashTec AG and the Group.\n\nThe auditor audited the annual financial statements for fiscal year 2023 prepared in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB), the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) applicable in the EU and the combined management report of WashTec AG and the Group, and issued an unqualified audit opinion in each case. In the process, the auditor addressed in depth the focal points of the audit specified by the Audit Committee for the reporting period in the audit engagement. No material weaknesses were reported in the internal control and risk management systems.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers also audited the annual financial statements of the main Group companies of WashTec AG.\n\nThe Audit Committee verified and monitored the independence and qualification of the auditor and addressed audit quality both before and during the course of the audit.\n\nIn addition, the auditor verified and confirmed that the Management Board has established an appropriate monitoring system in accordance with Section 91 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) that is capable of identifying, at an early stage, any developments that might affect the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Supervisory Board examined in detail the annual financial statements, the consolidated financial statements, the combined management report, the non-financial statement of WashTec AG and the Group and the Management Board's proposal on the appropriation of distributable profit. The auditor's audit reports were made available to all members of the Supervisory Board in good time and were discussed in detail both by the Audit Committee at its meeting on February 29, 2024 and at the Supervisory Board meeting for adoption of the financial statements on March 25, 2024. Both meetings were attended by the auditor. All questions posed by members of the Supervisory Board were answered in detail. During preparation and performance of the audit, the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee regularly exchanged information with the auditor without the involvement of the Management Board. The Chairman of the Audit Committee regularly discussed the progress of the audit with the auditor and reported on this to the Audit Committee.\n\nNo objections were raised during the Supervisory Board's review. At its meeting for adoption of the financial statements, the Supervisory Board approved the annual financial statements of WashTec AG and the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Management Board. The annual financial statements of WashTec AG are thus formally adopted. The Management Board's proposal on the appropriation of distributable profit was approved by the Supervisory Board following in-depth review.\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board, I would like to thank the members of the Management Board and all of our employees for their active commitment and constructive teamwork during the past fiscal year. The Supervisory Board would also like to thank Dr. Günter Blaschke, our long-standing Chairman of the Supervisory Board, who stepped down on December 31, for his unwavering commitment and dedicated service. In his almost 10 years as Chairman of the Supervisory Board, he has defined an era.\n\nThe Supervisory Board would also like to thank Dr Koeppe for his great commitment, with which he has positioned WashTec well in economically challenging times, and wishes him all the best for the future, both professionally and personally.\n\nAugsburg, March 2024\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board\n\nUlrich Bellgardt Chairman of the Supervisory Board\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-16-0\"></span>Sustainable success with our integrated system.\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/5 description: The image shows a car wash machine with large rotating brushes and water.

In addition, the Company is subject to legal requirements with respect to environmentally relevant activities and takes appropriate measures to ensure compliance.\n\nLong before the energy crisis forced companies to actively address the issues of energy economy and sustainability, WashTec established a cross-site and cross-functional environment and energy team. This team continued in 2023 to help identify matters of relevance to the environment and energy and to implement related improvement measures. This contributed to improvements in sustainability and reductions in energy demand, resource consumption and waste. The necessary human, financial and capital resources were quantified and allocated in budget planning. On a higher level, country organization and cluster management teams are informed at regular meetings about the various environment-related projects and their status and outcomes. The full Management Board is regularly briefed on environment-related measures and approves budget-relevant measures.\n\nLessons were also learned from last year's energy crisis and suitable action was taken. Among other things, the energy task force established in response to the crisis was retained and now remains in place alongside the existing energy and environment team. The energy task force develops, evaluates, coordinates and monitors the implementation of various energy-saving measures, primarily during the heating periods.\n\n### Objective/policy\n\nWashTec targets a sustained 30% reduction in carbon emissions in the countries with production sites by 2025 relative to the 2019 baseline. The emission figures for 2023 amounted to 5,779t CO2e\\* (prior year: 7,008t CO2e\\*). This figure is calculated from energy use in production, administration and the service units and includes all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG) in Germany, the Czech Republic, USA and China. In the period from 2019 to 2023, the WashTec Group reduced carbon emissions by 2,746t CO2e\\* or 32%\\*. The prior-year figure, for the period from 2019 to 2022, was a reduction in carbon emissions by 1,519t CO2e\\* or 18%\\*.\n\nThe sale of the Chinese subsidiary in 2023 has virtually no impact on the above target for reducing carbon emissions. In recent years, the Chinese company's carbon emissions constantly accounted for around 1% of the total carbon emissions of the production sites included in the target.\n\n### Measures\n\nAs part of the Environment and Energy Roadmap 2025, an array of measures are being implemented to reduce the WashTec Group's carbon footprint. The focus is on the electrification of the entire fleet. The current car policy, which includes a system of incentives via mobility budgets, a car allowance and all-electric vehicles, provides the basis for needs-based personal mobility. With regard to motor vehicles, additional hybrid and all-electric vehicles were procured in 2023. In addition, the car policy was revised so that only all-electric vehicles can be ordered alongside diesel vehicles. The proportion of electric vehicles increased significantly in 2023 compared to the prior year. A further increase in the share of electric vehicles in the fleet is expected by 2024. Charging infrastructure for electric vehicles and\n\n*<sup>\\*</sup>Full billing data is not yet available for 2023 as some providers do not bill WashTec until later in the year. The figures are therefore partly based on the prior year, extrapolation or self meter readings. The carbon emissions for 2022 have been restated for the same reason as the necessary billing data was not available at the time.*\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\nelectric industrial trucks has been installed at all production sites in Germany. Specific challenges related to fleet electrification include the market availability of efficient and economically viable electric vehicles, the expansion of the charging network and the differing tax treatment of electric vehicles in the countries where subsidiaries operate. Full conversion to electric forklifts in Augsburg was planned for 2023. This cannot be completed until 2024 due to delivery delays by manufacturers.\n\nAs planned, WashTec conducted an initial analysis of opportunities to reduce carbon emissions in the US in 2023 as part of a project under the Environment and Energy Roadmap 2025. Particularly important factors include local conditions such as vehicle size requirements, long distances compared to European countries and available infrastructure. The biggest challenges here are the lack of nationwide charging infrastructure for electric vehicles and the lacking widespread availability of diesel fuel, which is far more efficient than gasoline. In addition, how the companies are supplied with energy depends on the local conditions. This means that carbon-neutral energy is not universally available due to a lack of infrastructure. There is expected to be further potential for reducing the Group's carbon emissions in the US, as the US subsidiary is one of the Company's largest single carbon emitters. Depending on fleet replacement cycles and delivery lead times for more efficient vehicles, improvements may not be fully realized until subsequent years.\n\nCars, vans and forklifts are only part of the Company's mobility. Accordingly, WashTec continues to work on implementing the mobility policy for the Augsburg plant. This aims to optimize mobility throughout the plant and includes national and international travel as well as on-site transportation. Its recommendations and measures are designed to realize the available potential for improvement in the carbon footprint. All aspects of intermodal mobility – the use of different modes of transport for a single trip – must be considered here in accordance with legal requirements. In addition, the dialog on mobility solutions is being continued with city center businesses and the City of Augsburg.\n\nImplementation of the zero-emission strategy that follows from the operational mobility management policy has already begun and will make the vehicle fleet in Germany 100% carbon-neutral by 2030. Across Europe, the WashTec Group vehicle fleet is to consist of over 80% alternative propulsion vehicles by 2030. Trials are underway within the scope of what is technically feasible.\n\nThe production plants in Germany have been supplied exclusively with certified green electricity since the beginning of 2021. Moreover, the extension of district heating to additional buildings at the Augsburg site continued in 2023. The heating in the production facilities was replaced with radiant heating panels. These are significantly more energy-efficient and make for less carbon-intensive heating. Their installation at other locations and in other buildings is currently being examined. This contributes significantly to reducing the WashTec Group's carbon footprint.\n\nData transparency and validity are crucial to ensuring continuous reductions in energy consumption. For this purpose, WashTec implemented energy data software in 2021. The software was supplemented to include additional meters in 2023. This makes it possible to analyze, for example, the specific electricity consumption of each building at the Augsburg site or the main energy consumers. The resulting transparency enables even more detailed consumption analysis in order to identify further potential energy savings and take action to realize them. This led to a 23% reduction in energy requirements (power and heat) compared to 2022 at the production plants in Germany and the Czech Republic. WashTec plans to install more meters on an ongoing basis. The possibility is currently being examined of metering other significant energy forms (heat, compressed air, etc.).\n\nEmployees are continually educated and motivated with regard to the importance of environmentally conscious conduct. Suggestions for energy savings and environmentally conscious conduct have been received through the employee suggestion scheme.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Processes/due diligence\n\nThe global carbon footprint analysis for the WashTec Group covers all global production sites, meaning those in Germany, the Czech Republic, the United States and China, including their sales and service activities. Calculation of the data is done on the basis of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG) and, among other things, with the aid of databases such as \"GEMIS\" and \"DEFRA\". The categories covered are, in Scope 1 (\"Direct GHG emissions and removals\") and in Scope 2 (\"Indirect GHG emissions from imported energy\"). Specifically, these comprise emissions from in-house heat generation, the corporate vehicle fleet, air conditioning, purchased district heat and purchased electricity.\n\nThe company is working on optimizing the processes for data collection, data validation and completeness for the determination of Scope 3 emissions for Germany according to the GHG. This process is at an advanced stage but has not yet been concluded. For this reason, information on Scope 3 emissions is not published.\n\n### Outcomes\n\nMulti-year comparison of carbon emissions in the countries with production sites (Germany, Czech Republic, USA and China):\n\nImage /page/33/Figure/6 description: The image contains two bar charts comparing CO2 emissions. The first chart, titled \"CO₂e Tons total - Scope 1 & 2\", shows the total CO2 emissions in tons for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from 2019 to 2023. In 2019, Scope 1 emissions were 6,117 tons and Scope 2 emissions were 2,408 tons. In 2020, Scope 1 emissions were 5,778 tons and Scope 2 emissions were 1,907 tons. In 2021, Scope 1 emissions were 5,742 tons and Scope 2 emissions were 1,478 tons. In 2022, Scope 1 emissions were 5,795 tons and Scope 2 emissions were 1,213 tons. In 2023, Scope 1 emissions were 4,996 tons and Scope 2 emissions were 783 tons. The second chart, titled \"CO₂e Tons/€m revenue - Scope 1 & 2\", shows the CO2 emissions per million euros of revenue for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from 2019 to 2023. In 2019, Scope 1 emissions were 14.0 tons/€m and Scope 2 emissions were 5.5 tons/€m. In 2020, Scope 1 emissions were 15.3 tons/€m and Scope 2 emissions were 5.0 tons/€m. In 2021, Scope 1 emissions were 13.4 tons/€m and Scope 2 emissions were 3.4 tons/€m. In 2022, Scope 1 emissions were 12.0 tons/€m and Scope 2 emissions were 2.5 tons/€m. In 2023, Scope 1 emissions were 10.2 tons/€m and Scope 2 emissions were 1.6 tons/€m.\n\nThe main factors contributing to the year-on-year reduction in carbon emissions in fiscal year 2023 were the ongoing conversion of the heating systems in Augsburg to district heating, maintaining the new lower indoor temperature level, vehicle fleet optimization (such as the use of alternative powertrains) and temperature optimization in the painting process. These measures were already partially implemented by the end of 2022 in connection with the acute energy crisis and reached the targeted savings potential in 2023. Replacing additional LPG forklifts with electric forklifts, active use of waste heat and investment in\n\n*\\*Full billing data is not yet available for 2023 as some providers do not bill WashTec until later in the year. The figures are therefore partly based on the prior year, extrapolation or self meter readings. The carbon emissions for 2022 have been restated for the same reason as the necessary billing data was not available at the time.*\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\nenergy-efficient production machinery and infrastructure such as LED lighting, lighting sensors and compressors contributed to a further reduction in carbon emissions. The latter measures apply to all sites in Germany and the Czech Republic. As they were implemented over the course of the year, their full contribution to carbon reduction will not be realized until 2024.\n\n### Water consumption\n\nThe most important resource for the operation of WashTec vehicle wash equipment is water – primarily the water used in carwashes operated by customers. Automated wash equipment, especially when operated in combination with water treatment, contributes significantly to reducing water consumption associated with washing vehicles. By recycling process water, our water treatment systems can significantly reduce the consumption of fresh water.\n\nDepending on the carwash configuration, the dimensioning of the water treatment system, the selected wash programs, the number of washes and the types of vehicles, significant volumes of fresh water can be saved. A WashTec gantry carwash with a water treatment system uses only about one-fifth as much water as manual washing.\n\n### Objective/policy\n\nWashTec aims to promote the resource-efficient operation of vehicle wash equipment by minimizing the water consumption of systems in use with customers. The goal is for customers to be convinced by the sustainability approach of WashTec water treatment systems by 2025.\n\n### Measures\n\nOne key measure to convince customers of the sustainability approach of WashTec water treatment systems is to promote such systems more prominently in sales activities.\n\nFollowing activities in 2022 to define sales targets and communication measures, produce information material and conduct mailing campaigns, WashTec launched an international certification program for sustainable carwash sites in June 2023.\n\nThe certification program aims to provide consumers with additional transparency for carwash purchase decisions and to help operators to successfully publicize their commitment to sustainable vehicle washing.\n\nCertification as a sustainable carwash site requires the satisfaction of three criteria: the use of sustainable washing chemicals from the AUWA Green Car Care product range, efficient operation through the use of modern WashTec carwash equipment and the deployment of a water treatment system.\n\nThis prominent positioning of water treatment systems as one of three key factors for certification as a sustainably operated carwash site creates additional incentives for our customers to invest in water treatment equipment.\n\nThe digital integration of WashTec water treatment systems into the mywashtec platform introduced in 2023 and the resulting benefits for operators in terms of transparency, monitoring and convenience with regard to water provide extensive additional scope for convincing new and existing customers of the sustainability approach in our water treatment systems.\n\n### Processes/due diligence\n\nThe Group monitors the proportion of the installed base of WashTec automatic vehicle wash equipment in the field that is equipped with a water treatment system. An increase in this proportion reflects the extent to which our customers are convinced by the sustainability approach of our water treatment systems.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe proportion of the installed base of WashTec automatic vehicle wash equipment in the field that is equipped with a water treatment system increased slightly in 2023 compared to the prior year.\n\n### Employee-related matters\n\nThe Separate Combined Non-Financial Report 2022 assessed employee-related matters as material. This assessment remains valid for the present report. Close teamwork with our employees and related matters are key factors in our corporate success. In particular, workplace safety and health are a high priority that WashTec is committed to ensuring for employees. This also reflects the Company's responsibility towards employees.\n\n### Objective/policy\n\nAttractive human resources policies are a basis of the WashTec Group's business success and key to holding our market position. Our social contribution includes providing and creating a secure supply of jobs and apprenticeships. This is done in compliance with the respective national legal requirements. In Germany, these include:\n\n- W Collective bargaining agreements at each site and minimum wage requirements\n- W Equal treatment laws and anti-discrimination regulations (in Germany, the General Act on Equal Treatment)\n- W Rules on the assignment of management positions, on employee rights and on leadership positions in the private and public sectors\n- W Workplace regulations\n- W Requirements of employers' liability insurance institutions.\n\nThe main objective in occupational safety and health is to protect the health of employees. This is ensured by maintaining the highest possible safety standards throughout the business. Reducing accidents, accident severity and injuries is the goal of all managers and employees. Despite all preventive measures, there is still a residual risk that unfortunately cannot be completely eliminated. WashTec is nevertheless committed to a vision zero philosophy based on the conviction that every accident is avoidable.\n\n### Measures\n\nRegular review of potential or existing hazards leads to a reduction in incidents, near misses and accidents. On the basis of the identified potential hazards, measures are derived, planned and implemented. A further aim alongside occupational safety is to identify and implement aids that reduce physical effort as part of health management. These analyses are supported by training courses and workplace-specific instruction provided on a mandatory schedule in our training tool.\n\n### Processes/due diligence\n\nAll activities for maintaining high standards of occupational safety are managed using the WashTec Message app. This integrates the entire reporting chain and has the standard features for reporting accidents and near misses. On the basis of the reported incidents, scope for improvement and risks are identified in order to take targeted action to enhance occupational safety. In addition, all accidents are analyzed in terms of the type of accident and injury. This makes it possible to identify accident blackspots and counteract them with training, instruction, or additional personal protective equipment. The WashTec Message app can also be used to carry out workplace inspections and report vehicle accidents. A digital solution is used to prepare risk assessments. The entire process for ensuring high occupational safety standards is part of our Integrated Management System.\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-50-0\"></span>The WashTec Share\n\n### Stock market performance in 2023\n\nAfter the challenges of 2022, when almost all forecasts had to be revised significantly during the year, 2023 proved to be a calmer year overall. Global economic growth in 2023 was thus around 3%. The nevertheless moderate overall growth of the global economy in 2023 was mainly due to the still high (though declining) inflation rates and to restrictive central bank monetary policies. Germany's economy contracted by 0.3% in 2023 according to the\n\nImage /page/50/Figure/4 description: This image shows a line graph comparing the stock performance of WashTec and SDAX in Euro over a period of time from January to February. The y-axis represents the stock value, ranging from 30.00 to 45.00. The x-axis represents the months from January to February. The blue line represents the stock performance of WashTec, while the orange line represents the stock performance of SDAX in Euro.\n\nPrice performance of WashTec shares 2023/2024 compared to the SDAX (indexed)\n\nGerman Federal Statistical Office and the German government forecasts that it will grow by just 0.2% year on year in 2024. Business sentiment has deteriorated above all in the mechanical engineering, automotive and electrical industries. While supply chain problems gradually eased as the year progressed – which made it possible to work off existing order backlogs – the business environment deteriorated with a decline in new orders.\n\nDespite a large number of negative factors, such as the terrible wars on or near Europe's doorstep, weak economic growth in many European countries and also in China as a key sales market, together with high inflation rates, most stock markets recovered much the previous year's losses over the course of 2023. Falling inflation rates in particular fueled hopes of interest rate cuts in the near future and thus boosted the performance of shares in the technology sector especially. The DAX recovered most of all towards the year-end and gained 20% in value over the year as a whole. The more defensively oriented STOXX Europe 50 showed a somewhat smaller gain of 16%. Both the mid-cap MDAX and the small-cap SDAX had a successful year with increases of 8% and around 17% respectively.\n\n### WashTec AG share performance in 2023\n\nThe WashTec share price began 2023 at €34.55 and marked its high for the year at €41.75 on April 6. On October 27, 2023, the share price reached its low of €29.75. The end-of-year share price was €32.00. This was 7.4% down on the prior year-end closing price. The share thus underperformed the SDAX (+15.5%). These figures relate to closing prices on the Xetra trading platform.\n\nAs of February 29, 2024, WashTec shares were trading at €36.40 per share.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Attractive dividend policy\n\nPursuant to a resolution adopted by the Annual General Meeting on May 15, 2023, the Company paid its shareholders a dividend of €2.20 per share for fiscal year 2022. Dividend distributions thus totaled €29.4m in 2023. Based on the year-end share price, the dividend yield was 6.88%. This places WashTec among the strongest performers on the German stock market in terms of dividend yield.\n\nWashTec aims to maintain an attractive dividend policy under which shareholders duly participate in the Company's success.\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board are proposing a dividend of €2.20 per share for fiscal year 2023.\n\n### Changes in shareholder structure\n\nThe majority of WashTec AG shares are held by institutional investors.

The direct subsidiaries of WashTec AG are AUWA-Chemie GmbH, WashTec Holding GmbH and WashTec Carwash Management GmbH. WashTec AG has control and profit (loss) pooling agreements with AUWA-Chemie GmbH and WashTec Carwash Management GmbH and a profit transfer agreement with WashTec Holding GmbH.\n\n### WashTec Holding GmbH\n\nWith the exception of AUWA-Chemie GmbH and WashTec Carwash Management GmbH, the WashTec Group's ownership interests in operating companies are held by WashTec Holding GmbH, based in Augsburg, Germany. WashTec Holding GmbH has control and profit (loss) pooling agreements with WashTec Financial Services GmbH and WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH.\n\n### WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH\n\nThe bulk of the operating business is conducted by WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH, Augsburg, Germany. This is where the main products of the WashTec Group are developed, manufactured, sold and serviced. WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH also supplies and supports the subsidiaries and independent foreign distributors.\n\n### AUWA-Chemie GmbH\n\nAUWA-Chemie GmbH produces chemical products for carwash equipment. Distribution is via WashTec subsidiaries and independent distributors in Germany and Europe.\n\n### Foreign subsidiaries\n\nThe WashTec Group is represented, and WashTec products are sold and serviced, by the Company's own subsidiaries in the Netherlands, France, Denmark, Norway, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Austria, Poland, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In the reporting year, WashTec also still had a subsidiary in China. The Chinese market will be developed in the future as a distributor market. In addition, the previously independent distributor in New Zealand was taken over in 2023 in order to commence direct sales and service activities there. An overview of the production locations is provided under the heading \"Production, sourcing and logistics.\"\n\n### WashTec Financial Services GmbH and WashTec Carwash Management GmbH\n\nWashTec Financial Services GmbH and WashTec Carwash Management GmbH provide services relating to the sale and operation of carwashes, such as brokering individual financing arrangements and services in connection with the operation of carwash equipment.\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/58/Picture/3 description: This image is a world map showing the distribution of WashTec, distributors, and production sites. The map shows that WashTec has distribution in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The map also shows the locations of distributors and production sites. There are production sites in Denver, Augsburg, Grebenau, Recklinghausen, and Nyrany. The legend indicates that the distribution by WashTec is represented by a dark blue color, distributors are represented by a light blue color, and production sites are represented by black dots.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\nements Further Information\n\n60\n\nThe WashTec Group's global footprint is a clear competitive advantage. WashTec has around 1,700 employees worldwide and subsidiaries in all major markets.\n\nIn addition, WashTec has a broad network of independent distributors and is thus on the map in over 80 countries throughout the world.\n\n### Production, sourcing and logistics\n\nWashTec has a global procurement and production network with production facilities in Germany, the Czech Republic and the USA. Most of the equipment for worldwide distribution is assembled at the main plant in Augsburg, Germany. Gantry carwashes are produced for the North American market in Denver (USA). Much of the sheet metal production takes place in the Nyrany (Czech Republic), where components are also preassembled and the basic gantry carwash system is assembled. The Company has two other sites in Germany producing control units for the entire Group (Recklinghausen) and wash chemicals (Grebenau).\n\n### Segments\n\nThe WashTec Group's global business is divided into three geographical regions. European business activities and exports to other countries are combined in the Europe region. The North America region comprises the activities in the USA and Canada. The Asia/Pacific region mainly includes the business activities of the subsidiaries in Australia and China.\n\n### Management and control\n\nAs an Aktiengesellschaft (a German stock corporation), WashTec AG has a two-tier management and supervisory structure comprising the Management Board and the Supervisory Board. The Management Board is responsible for managing the Company, sets the strategic direction and pursues the goal of sustained growth in shareholder value. The Supervisory Board, which consists of six members in accordance with the Articles of Association, advises and supervises the Management Board.\n\nAs the Group parent company, WashTec AG determines corporate strategy and overall control, resource allocation and communication with key stakeholder groups in the business environment, primarily comprising the capital market and shareholders. The Company's internal management and control is based on a value-oriented management system. This encompasses an integrated planning and control strategy, target ratios for management of the Company as well as measures for ensuring sustained and profitable growth, efficiency improvements and efficient capital management. The Company's Management Board and Supervisory Board define corporate strategy and related targets, which are implemented at all business units across all of levels of responsibility in the Group.\n\nMonitoring is performed by way of regular meetings involving all reporting units. These include fortnightly Management Board meetings at which the divisional heads report, monthly meetings with the main divisional heads, regular international management meetings with heads of the operating companies, strategic and annual planning including capital expenditure, production and capacity planning, regular reporting and forecasting, ongoing market analysis, and regular analyses of revenue, sales, order backlog and market share. All capital expenditure projects are continuously reviewed and monitored in the same connection.\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\n### External factors influencing the business\n\n### Mobility transition\n\nThe major economic and social trend toward individualization is a key driver of continued growth in demand for mobility. The resulting traffic volumes are still largely based on individual travel. In line with the need to decarbonize and the global mobility trends, this is resulting in changes in vehicle fleets. While autonomous driving and shared mobility mean a reduction in the vehicle fleet, they also lead to increasing passenger mileage with shorter vehicle life cycles.\n\nIn addition to the size of the fleet, the type and intensity of vehicle use will also determine carwash demand in the future. Vehicles need to be cleaned no matter how they are powered and regardless of the ownership model. \"Shared mobility\" vehicles tend to be washed more frequently.\n\n### Decarbonization and sustainability\n\nCompanies' sustainability performance is crucially important to all stakeholders, creating a growing need for information and transparency. As well as the environmental compatibility of products, this also includes companies' carbon footprint.\n\nThe use of recirculating water recovery systems in automated vehicle washing significantly reduces the consumption of mains water compared to hand washing or to a carwash without a water recovery system. In wash chemicals, the Green Car Care product range uses biogenic detergents without any fossil resources. These are agents that reduce the surface tension of the water for improved wetting performance.\n\nWith a binding commitment to reduce its own carbon footprint, WashTec is contributing to the global efforts to limit global warming (for further information, please see under \"1.2 Corporate objective and strategy\").\n\n### Economy\n\nA key factor influencing the uptake of automated vehicle washing is a country's average per capita income. As this increases, it creates sustainable market potential worldwide, especially in regions that are transitioning from manual to automated washing. Progress here is being slowed down, however, by various factors such as inflation and the resulting high interest rates, and global crises such as the war in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\n### Customer expectations\n\nCustomer expectations continue to focus on optimal wash results while conserving resources. Customers also expect the equipment to be easy to use. Automated carwashes are far more environment-friendly than manual washing because they use less water and chemicals. This is especially true of carwashes with water treatment systems. Modern digital systems allow operators to conveniently access and remotely monitor and control plant parameters anytime, anywhere. For the end user, speed, convenience, quality and the wash experience remain key factors.\n\nAccordingly, the Company continues to operate on the basis that clean cars will remain a key quality criterion and hence a driver of the business model. The WashTec Group nevertheless expects changes in the operating environment, in particular with regard to the future importance and conceptual design of existing operator sites. At the same time, these developments also harbor opportunities, most of all from the provision of digital, environment-friendly solutions for carwash.\n\nThe Company closely monitors the development of external factors affecting the business in order to respond to changes in a timely manner and make the appropriate strategic choices.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1.2 Corporate objective and strategy\n\nThe focus of our activities is on offering the maximum possible benefit to people who wash cars professionally. This requires not only specialization to meet customer needs, but also product and service leadership to ensure the best possible technology and quality for our products. The environmental and economic sustainability of our products is a further strategic and operational focus.\n\nOur strategy is based on four main pillars:\n\n- W Total customer care\n- W Optimum integrated system for carwash\n- W Primary focus on the core regions of Europe and North America\n- W Sustainability\n\n### Total customer care\n\nWith total customer care, the WashTec Group places the focus on maximum customer benefit and, based on the superior equipment and wash chemicals portfolio and advanced digital platform, offers car wash operators and consumers the most profitable carwash. Integrating the entire product and service portfolio – equipment, service and chemicals, embedded in digital solutions – is a source of major growth potential.\n\n### Optimum integrated system for carwash\n\nWith the integrated system of equipment, water treatment and biodegradable chemicals, carwash operators and consumers are ensured the most sustainable carwash. The coordinated components of the washing process also enable our customers to achieve the best possible wash.\n\n### Focus on core regions\n\nIn regional terms, the focus is on Europe and North America in order to better exploit the market potential available there.\n\n### Environmental sustainability\n\nEnvironmental sustainability is a high priority for WashTec and relates both to our operations and to the environmental impact of our products. This strategy includes reducing the carbon emissions of our own production facilities, together with their sales and service operations, as well as reducing the amount of water used at customer carwashes.\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1.3 Control system\n\n### Financial and non-financial key performance indicators\n\nThe key financial and non-financial performance indicators used by the Company for planning and control are as follows:\n\nKey financial performance indicators\n\n- W Revenue\n- W EBIT\n- W Free cash flow\n- W ROCE\n\nThe free cash flow performance indicator is defined as cash inflow from operating activities less cash outflow from investing activities.\n\nReturn on capital employed (ROCE) is defined as the ratio of EBIT to capital employed. We define capital employed as non-current assets (non-current assets including goodwill and right-of-use assets) plus net operating working capital (NOWC), calculated as the average of the reporting date figures for the last five quarters. NOWC is defined as the sum of inventories and trade receivables less trade payables and prepayments on orders.\n\n### Key non-financial performance indicator\n\nThe following non-financial performance indicator is used at Group level:\n\nW Accident rate: Work accidents/million hours worked\n\nThe Separate Non-financial Report contains a detailed description of the accident rate as WashTec's k[ey non-financial performance indicator \\(see \"Separate Non-financial Report\"](#page-29-0)  beginning on page 30).\n\n### Separate non-financial report in accordance with Sections 289b (3) and 315b (3) HGB\n\n[The Separate Non-financial Report in accordance with Sections 289b \\(3\\) and 315b \\(3\\) HGB](https://ir.washtec.de/en/financial_reports/)  is published on the Company's website at https://ir.washtec.de/en/financial\\_reports/ as a separate section of the [Annual Report 2023, beginning on page 30.](#page-29-0)\n\n### Opportunities and risk management\n\nResponsible management of business risk is one of the basic principles of good corporate governance. The Management Board has at its disposal comprehensive Group-wide and Company-specific reporting and management systems that permit it to identify, assess and manage such risk. These systems are continuously developed and adapted to changes in the operating environment. The Management Board regularly informs the Supervisory Board about existing risks, any measures taken and their development.\n\nDetails of risk management are found in the risk report, which is part of the management report. The management report contains the report required under Sections 289 and 315a of the German Commercial Code (HGB) on the internal monitoring and risk management system.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1.4 Research and development\n\nA major thrust of research and development during the year related to the development of additional SmartCare features and functions. The focus was on improvements in washing and drying quality and in process speed and on further reducing the environmental footprint. Further progress was made here through a better understanding of the biological and chemical interrelationships in water treatment, further reducing the amount of fresh water needed and thus helping to address the drought periods caused by climate change in many regions. Another focus was the successful introduction of a modular system for the new JetWash generation, which ensures fast assembly and easy commissioning at customers' sites.\n\nIn total, some 70 employees work in research and development at the WashTec headquarters in Augsburg on solutions that maximize modularity and reusability. International patents secure the future solution space for WashTec.\n\nTotal operating research and development expenditure in the WashTec Group amounted to approximately €14.2m in 2023 (prior year: €14.2m). The Group's capitalized development costs came to €1.6m in fiscal year 2023 (prior year: €2.0m) and mainly related to the development of software for the digitalization and service platform.\n\nImage /page/63/Picture/7 description: A white car is being washed by large, green brushes in a car wash.

Inflation peaked in 2023 as a result of monetary policy tightening and began to fall as the year progressed, but is still above the target levels aimed at by central banks. Uncertainties and tensions in relation to China, the war in Ukraine and the Middle East conflict also had a notable impact on economic development.\n\nIn its forecast for 2024, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) believes that the high interest rate levels maintained by central banks to curb inflation and the scaling back of fiscal support in the face of mounting debt will weigh on economic activity and that underlying\n\nproductivity growth will remain low. The IMF nevertheless expects positive impetus, particularly from the USA and several large emerging and developing countries, as these are developing more resiliently than initially expected and the Chinese economy is receiving fiscal support. Accordingly, the IMF expects global economic growth in 2024 to be at the same level as in 2023.\n\n### Industry development (mechanical engineering and chemicals)\n\nThe German economy has cooled significantly since the end of last year. Inflation eased over the course of the year and wage increases picked up compared to the prior year. Contrary to expectations in the summer, however, a recovery failed to materialize in the second half of the year. According to the German Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA), the persistently weak global economy and low domestic investment in particular led to a year-on-year decline in incoming orders in the German machinery and mechanical engineering sector throughout the year. Private consumption also failed to recover.\n\nAccording to forecasts by the ifo Institute, the German economy will slowly recover from last year's recession in 2024. The German government's forecast is significantly more cautious with growth of 0.2%. At present, the main factors holding back economic growth are weak foreign demand in industry, the higher borrowing costs for investment as a result of monetary policy tightening, and sluggish private consumption. These issues should become gradually less important with exports expected to increase as foreign markets rebound and private consumption anticipated to rise on the back of higher wages and a stable labor market.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Market for carwash equipment\n\n### Customer groups\n\nWashTec's customers are predominately operators of filling stations that offer on-site carwashes, with which they generate a substantial part of their earnings. These customers include multinational petroleum companies, retailers (convenience stores), individual filling station operators and operator chains. Additional key customer groups include carwash operators, automobile repair shops, supermarket chains, road freight companies and public transport operators.\n\n### Competition\n\nWashTec is the global market leader with an installed base of over 50,000 units. In Europe – a developed market with intense competition – WashTec's own research shows the Company to lead the market by a wide margin in terms of market coverage and market share. The North American market, with a large proportion of conveyor tunnel carwashes, is more fragmented on the customer and supplier side than Europe. European and American competitors contend for a developed market in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n### Sales markets\n\nGermany and the rest of Europe remain the largest sales markets. Based on the Group strategy, North America in particular is targeted to account for a higher percentage of the Group's total revenue in the medium to long term. In addition, the aftersales business with service and chemicals should contribute to the overall growth of the WashTec Group through new products and stronger focus on this area of business.\n\n### 2.2 Group business performance\n\n[The following section examines the WashTec Group's business performance. WashTec AG](#page-78-0)  is discussed separately in section 2.6.\n\nThe general economic environment has not changed significantly in fiscal year 2023 compared to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts presented in the Annual Report 2022. High inflation and higher interest rates in particular dampened consumption and investment.\n\nThe German economy has been contracting since the end of last year. In the German machinery and mechanical engineering sector, the downward trend in order intake that set in at the beginning of the fiscal year continued throughout the year. Supply bottlenecks continued to ease and the ongoing high level of orders on hand supported the development of the economy. However, investment was held back significantly by higher financing costs. This also affects the WashTec Group.\n\n|                                                        |    | 2022  | Guidance 2023          | 2023  | Change year<br>on year   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----|-------|------------------------|-------|--------------------------|\n| Revenue                                                | €m | 482.2 | ±3%                    | 489.5 | 1.5%                     |\n| EBIT                                                   | €m | 38.0  | ≥10%                   | 41.9  | 10.3%                    |\n| Free cash flow                                         | €m | 16.2  | ≥10%                   | 46.1  | 184.6%                   |\n| ROCE                                                   | %  | 20.2  | ≥1 percentage<br>point | 21.5  | 1.3 percentage<br>points |\n| Accident rate<br>(work accidents/million hours worked) |    | 4.2   | <4.2                   | 4.2   | 0.0                      |\n\nThe WashTec Group achieved a new revenue record of €489.5m in fiscal year 2023, an increase of €7.3m or 1.5% on the prior year (€482.2m). The target communicated in the Annual Report 2022 of revenue in the range of ±3% of the prior year was thus met. Adjusted for exchange rate effects, the growth in revenue was 3.4%.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe year-on-year revenue growth was mainly due to the very positive performance in the chemicals business, where new customers were acquired. At €418.5m, Equipment and Service revenue was level with the prior year (€420.0m). Revenue was reduced mainly due to the weaker sales figures for equipment as a result of the difficult market conditions. The price increases implemented in response to the rising price of materials – primarily last year – were unable to fully compensate for the overall market trend. Revenue was also impacted by negative currency effects, particularly in relation to the Norwegian krone and the US dollar.\n\nAs forecast, revenue in the Europe region was on a par with the prior year. Revenue growth on an exchange rate adjusted basis was not achieved in North America due to the general decline in market demand. In US dollars, revenue amounted to USD 111.1m (prior year: USD 112.0m). In the Asia/Pacific region, the forecast of revenue growth at constant exchange rates was met.\n\nLargely due to an improvement in gross profit, EBIT rose by 10.3% to €41.9m (prior year: €38.0m). The EBIT margin was 8.6% (prior year: 7.9%). In its guidance, the Company forecast a significant increase in EBIT by ≥10%, which was thus achieved.\n\nThe forecast made at the beginning of the year of a significant EBIT increase of ≥10% in the Europe region was not met. EBIT in North America increased significantly and met the forecast improvement in EBIT compared to the prior year. The same applies to the Asia/Pacific region.\n\nIn the final quarter of the year, revenue fell by 7.6%to€132.8m (prior year:€143.7m). Revenue in Europe and North America in particular was down on the record prior-year quarter, mainly due to lower output volumes. EBIT in the fourth quarter, at €15.0m, was on the same high level as in the prior year (€15.4m). Active cost management made it possible in this period to generate a double-digit EBIT margin of 11.3% (prior year: 10.7%).\n\nFree cash flow increased due to significantly reduced net operating working capital to €46.1m (prior year: €16.2m). Performance was positively impacted in particular by the measures initiated at the beginning of the year to reduce the amount of capital tied up in inventories. This means that the forecast of a significant increase in free cash flow by ≥10% was clearly exceeded.\n\nROCE stood at 21.5% (prior year: 20.2%). The target of a significant improvement in ROCE by ≥1 percentage point was thus achieved, mainly due to the significantly higher EBIT. The denominator, capital employed, increased by €6.3m or 3.3% year on year. This increase is mainly due to the rise in non-current assets on the acquisition of the site occupied by the American subsidiary.\n\nThe accident rate, at 4.2 as in the prior year, was significantly below the industry average reported for recent years by the employers' liability insurance associations (Berufsgenossenschaften). The target set for 2023 of an accident rate less than 4.2 was not met. WashTec continues to target further reductions in the number of occupational accidents.\n\nOverall, the difficult economic environment and the resulting reluctance of customers to invest had a significant negative impact on the WashTec Group's business development in the reporting year. By way of active cost management throughout the year, the company successfully responded to changing market conditions and significantly improved earnings despite the challenges.\n\n### Order backlog\n\nOrders received in the reporting year were down year on year due to the drop in demand in the market as a whole. Due to the lower level of orders received, the order backlog at the end of December 2023 was significantly down on the prior year, but is still high overall compared to the long-term average.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 2.3 Group financial position and cash flows\n\n### 2.3.1 Results of operations\n\n### Income statement\n\nThe following table shows the income statement of the WashTec Group:\n\n| In €m                             | 2023   | 2022   | Change   |        |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|--------|\n|                                   |        |        | absolute | in %   |\n| Revenue                           | 489.5  | 482.2  | 7.3      | 1.5    |\n| Cost of sales                     | -352.9 | -352.8 | -0.1     | -0.0   |\n| Gross profit                      | 136.5  | 129.4  | 7.1      | 5.5    |\n| Gross profit margin in %          | 27.9   | 26.8   | 1.1      | –      |\n| Research and development expenses | -14.2  | -14.2  | 0.0      | 0.0    |\n| Selling expenses                  | -62.5  | -62.1  | -0.4     | -0.6   |\n| Administrative expenses           | -18.6  | -17.1  | -1.5     | -8.8   |\n| Other income and expenses         | 0.5    | 2.0    | -1.5     | -75.0  |\n| EBIT                              | 41.9   | 38.0   | 3.9      | 10.3   |\n| EBIT margin in %                  | 8.6    | 7.9    | 0.7      | –      |\n| Financial result                  | -3.5   | -0.7   | -2.8     | -400.0 |\n| EBT                               | 38.4   | 37.3   | 1.1      | 2.9    |\n| Income taxes                      | -10.4  | -10.9  | 0.5      | 4.6    |\n| Net income                        | 28.0   | 26.4   | 1.6      | 6.1    |\n| Earnings per share (€)            | 2.09   | 1.97   | 0.12     | 6.1    |\n\n### Group revenue\n\nThe WashTec Group generated revenue of €489.5m in the year ending December 31, 2023, an increase of €7.3m or 1.5% on the prior-year figure (€482.2m). This is a new annual record.\n\nImage /page/67/Figure/8 description: This bar chart titled \"Revenue in €m, multi-year comparison\" shows the revenue in millions of euros from 2019 to 2023. In 2019, the revenue was 436.5 million euros. In 2020, the revenue was 378.7 million euros. In 2021, the revenue was 430.5 million euros. In 2022, the revenue was 482.2 million euros. In 2023, the revenue was 489.5 million euros.\n\nAdjusted for exchange rate effects, full-year revenue was €498.8m, an increase of 3.4% on the prior year (€482.2m). The negative exchange rate effects relate to movements in the Norwegian krone, the US dollar and the Australian dollar. Detailed discussion of the devel[opment of the individual regions is provided under \"Reporting by region\" in section 2.3.2.](#page-70-0)\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Revenue by product    |       |       |          |      |\n|-----------------------|-------|-------|----------|------|\n| In €m                 | 2023  | 2022  | Change   |      |\n|                       |       |       | absolute | in % |\n| Equipment and Service | 418.5 | 420.0 | –1.5     | –0.4 |\n| Chemicals             | 65.8  | 56.9  | 8.9      | 15.6 |\n| Others                | 5.2   | 5.3   | –0.1     | –1.9 |\n| Total                 | 489.5 | 482.2 | 7.3      | 1.5  |\n\nEquipment and Service revenue fell slightly by €1.5m compared to the prior year, mainly due to the general decline in demand in the market as a whole. Both key account business and the direct sales business were down on the prior year. Chemicals revenue grew very strongly. New customer wins made it possible to achieve significant revenue growth of 15.6% despite a mainly weather-related fall in carwash volumes.\n\nOther revenue, mainly from the arrangement of financing and the operations business, accounts for around 1.1% of the WashTec Group's total revenue and was stable relative to the prior year.\n\n### Further information on the income statement\n\n### Gross profit\n\nAt€136.5m, gross profit was 5.5%higher than the prior-year figure of€129.4m. Gross profit thus increased at a higher rate than revenue. The gross profit margin improved from 26.8%in the prior year to 27.9%. This improvement was mainly due to the price increases implemented in response to material price rises, primarily last year, and to a favorable product mix. Price rises for purchased parts and wage cost increases were partly offset by reduced prices of raw materials.\n\n### Research and development expenses\n\nAt €14.2m, research and development expenses were on a par with the prior year (€14.2m). New product development costs of€1.6m were capitalized in the reporting year (prior year: €2.0m) and will be amortized in subsequent periods. Amortization of research and development expenditure capitalized in prior years totaled €0.2m (prior year: €0.3m). The capitalization ratio was 11.3% (prior year: 14.1%). The focus was on developing additional features and functions for SmartCare. This included improvements to washing and drying quality and to process speed, and further reducing the ecological footprint, particularly with regard to the quantity of fresh water required. As of December 31, 2023, around 70 employees (prior year: around 70 employees) worked in research and development. This represents 4.1% (prior year: 3.8%) of the workforce.\n\n### Selling expenses\n\nSelling expenses, at €62.5m, were on the same level as in the prior year (€62.1m). Freight costs in this function area increased by €1.1m, due partly to higher costs for freight forwarders and partly to the higher proportion of business accounted for by chemicals. In contrast, advertising and trade fair costs went down by €0.7m. The prior-year figure here was significantly increased, primarily due to the resumption of trade fairs skipped during the pandemic.\n\n### Administrative expenses\n\nAdministrative expenses in the reporting year, at €18.6m, were€1.5m higher than in the prior year (€17.1m). The increase was mainly due to expenditure for cost optimization on the new product generation. Other than this, the item mainly includes personnel expenses and other costs of recruitment, professional development, communication and auditing.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Other income and expenses\n\nOther income and expenses were significantly lower than the prior year at €0.5m (prior year: €2.0m). The reduction in this item is mainly due to lower proceeds from the sale of non-current assets (€−0.5m) and the effects, recognized in this item, of the deconsolidation of the subsidiary in China (€−0.5m).\n\n### EBIT\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) were up 10.3% to €41.9m (prior year: €38.0m).\n\n#### EBIT in €m, multi-year comparison\n\nImage /page/69/Figure/9 description: The image is a bar graph showing data from 2019 to 2023. In 2019, the value is 36.3. In 2020, the value is 20.1. In 2021, the value is 45.7. In 2022, the value is 38.0. In 2023, the value is 41.9.\n\nA presentation of EBIT by regions is provided under \"Reporting by region\" in section 2.3.2.\n\n### EBIT margin\n\nThe EBIT margin decreased due to the improved gross profit margin to 8.6% (prior year: 7.9%).\n\n### Financial result\n\nThe financial result was €−3.5m (prior year: €−0.7m). The significant change is mainly due to higher expense on interest-bearing loans as a result of higher interest rates. In addition, average total debt was higher than in the prior year, partly due to borrowing to acquire the site of the US subsidiary.\n\n| Analysis of financial result                        |             |             |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| In €m                                               | 2023        | 2022        |\n| Other interest income                               | 0.2         | 0.5         |\n| <b>Financial income</b>                             | <b>0.2</b>  | <b>0.5</b>  |\n| Interest-bearing loans                              | 2.8         | 0.7         |\n| Interest expense from discounting lease liabilities | 0.4         | 0.2         |\n| Other interest expense                              | 0.5         | 0.4         |\n| <b>Financial expense</b>                            | <b>3.7</b>  | <b>1.3</b>  |\n| <b>Financial result</b>                             | <b>-3.5</b> | <b>-0.7</b> |\n\n### EBT\n\nEarnings before tax (EBT) increased to €38.4m (prior year: €37.3m).\n\n### Income taxes\n\nThe income taxes of €10.4m (prior year: €10.9m) consist of current taxes and deferred taxes mainly relating to temporary differences. The tax rate (relative to EBT) was 27.2%, slightly lower than in the prior year (29.3%). The lower tax rate compared to the prior year is primarily due to the utilization of loss carryforwards in the US and higher earnings contributions from foreign subsidiaries, which tend to have lower tax rates.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-70-0\"></span>Net income\n\nNet income improved by €1.6m to €28.0m (prior year: €26.4m). On the basis of the average number of shares (13,382,324), earnings per share (basic = diluted) increased by 6.1% to €2.09 (prior year: €1.97).\n\n### Net income in €m, multi-year comparison\n\nImage /page/70/Figure/4 description: This bar chart shows the values for the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.

The Management Board and Supervisory Board intend to recommend to the Annual General Meeting, which is scheduled for May 14, 2024, to appropriate the distributable profit of €30,073,713.43 shown in the Company's annual financial statements for fiscal year 2023 as follows: Distribution of €2.20 per eligible share, totaling €29,441,112.80, with the remaining distributable profit of €632,600.63 to be carried forward.\n\n### 2.3.2 Reporting by region\n\nImage /page/70/Figure/8 description: The image shows two donut charts comparing revenue by region in millions of euros for 2023 and 2022. For 2023, the total revenue is €489.5m, with Europe contributing €378.9m (+2.0%), North America contributing €102.9m (-4.5%), and Asia/Pacific contributing €19.2m (+9.1%). For 2022, the total revenue is €482.2m, with Europe contributing €371.6m, North America contributing €107.7m, and Asia/Pacific contributing €17.6m.\n\n\\* cross-segment consolidation eects are disregarded.\n\nEBIT by regions in €m\\*\n\nImage /page/70/Figure/10 description: The image shows two donut charts, one for 2023 and one for 2022.

The 2022 donut chart shows that Europe accounts for €36.4m, North America accounts for €1.4m, and Asia/Pacific accounts for €0.4m, with a total of €38.0m.\n\n\\* cross-segment consolidation eects are disregarded.\n\n### 71\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Europe\n\n| Europe region key figures |         |       |       | 2023  | 2022 | Change |\n|---------------------------|---------|-------|-------|-------|------|--------|\n| Revenue                   | €m      | 378.9 | 371.6 | 2.0%  |      |        |\n| EBIT                      | €m      | 36.2  | 36.4  | -0.5% |      |        |\n| EBIT margin               | %       | 9.6   | 9.8   | -0.2  |      |        |\n| Employees (as of Dec. 31) | persons | 1,398 | 1,486 | -88   |      |        |\n\n### Market environment\n\nAlongside North America, the wash equipment market in Europe is one of the most developed vehicle wash markets in the world. It has the highest number of installed carwashes and well-developed provider services and distribution structures.\n\nWashTec's customers in Europe are predominately operators of filling stations that offer on-site carwashes, with which they generate a substantial part of their earnings. These customers include multinational petroleum companies, retailers (convenience stores), individual filling station operators and operator chains. Additional key customer groups include carwash operators, supermarket chains, car dealerships and repair shops, road freight companies and public transport operators.\n\nCompetition in Europe is intense and limited to only a small number of manufacturers. A key factor is a market-wide service network and installed base. New competitors face correspondingly high barriers to entry. According to its own research, WashTec is the clear market leader in terms of market coverage and market share, and has by far the most well-established sales and service network and by far the largest installed base of gantry carwashes in Europe's core markets.\n\nBusiness performance in the reporting year was negatively impacted by the ongoing difficult economic situation, particularly in Germany, which is the region's most important market.\n\n### Revenue\n\nIn Europe, revenue increased by 2.0% to €378.9m (prior year: €371.6m). At constant exchange rates, the revenue increase was 2.9%, mainly due to the development of the Norwegian krone. Equipment and Service revenue remained level with the prior year. While equipment revenue was down, there was an increase in service revenue. Of particular note, the Chemicals division achieved strong double-digit growth in the region thanks to the acquisition of new key accounts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEBIT in the Europe region, at €36.2m, was on the same level as the prior year (€36.4m). The EBIT margin was 9.6% (prior year: 9.8%). In this region in particular, lower revenues from equipment sales and the resulting inability to cover fixed costs led to challenges in terms of earnings performance.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n### North America\n\n| North America region key figures |         |       |       |        |\n|----------------------------------|---------|-------|-------|--------|\n|                                  |         | 2023  | 2022  | Change |\n| Revenue                          | €m      | 102.9 | 107.7 | -4.5%  |\n| EBIT                             | €m      | 5.7   | 1.4   | 307.1% |\n| EBIT margin                      | %       | 5.5   | 1.3   | 4.2    |\n| Employees (as of Dec. 31)        | persons | 243   | 282   | -39    |\n\n### Market environment\n\nNew registrations of cars and light trucks have increased significantly in North America in recent years. Slight population growth and growth in the number of vehicles continue to be expected for the years ahead.\n\nThe key customer groups in North America – alongside a number of major customers – are independent small or medium-size carwash chains and retailers (convenience stores). The share of conveyor tunnel carwashes relative to gantry carwashes and growth in this product segment are above the global average.\n\n### Revenue\n\nRevenue in North America decreased from €107.7m in the prior year to €102.9m. In US dollars, revenue was USD 111.1m and thus at the same level as in the prior year (prior year: USD 112.0m). The WashTec Group's business in this region was also adversely affected by the generally subdued demand in the market as a whole.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEarnings in North America increased significantly by €4.3m to €5.7m (prior year: €1.4m). This is mainly due to the efficiency improvement projects launched last year and successfully implemented in fiscal year 2023, particularly in the areas of supply chain and service efficiency.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Asia/Pacific\n\n| Asia/Pacific region key figures |         |      |      |        |\n|---------------------------------|---------|------|------|--------|\n|                                 |         | 2023 | 2022 | Change |\n| Revenue                         | €m      | 19.2 | 17.6 | 9.1%   |\n| EBIT                            | €m      | 0.6  | 0.4  | 50.0%  |\n| EBIT margin                     | %       | 3.1  | 2.3  | 0.8    |\n| Employees (as of Dec. 31)       | persons | 46   | 56   | –10    |\n\n### Market environment\n\nTo further expand the WashTec Group's market position in the Asia/Pacific region and commence direct sales and service activities in New Zealand, WashTec New Zealand Limited was established in fiscal year 2023 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH. The previously independent distributor was taken over as of December 1, 2023.\n\nWashTec has a good market position in Australia and New Zealand. There, the major American and European manufacturers are in direct competition.\n\nAs described in the Annual Report 2022, the Company reviewed its market approach in China over the course of the year. As a result, the WashTec Group decided on a strategic realignment in the Asia/Pacific region and sold 90% of the shares in its Chinese subsidiary. The Chinese market will be developed in the future as a distributor market. This will enable WashTec to continue providing strong local customer support while maintaining the same high level of service for all WashTec carwash equipment installed in the Chinese market.\n\n### Revenue\n\nAt €19.2m, revenue in the Asia/Pacific region was higher than in the prior year (€17.6m). €6.4m is accounted for by China (prior year: €4.4m) and €0.3m by New Zealand (prior year: €0m). Adjusted for exchange rates, revenue in the region was €20.7m. The growth in the region in fiscal year 2023 is primarily due to increased volume with local oil companies in China. Business performance there in the prior year was notably impacted by measures in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue in Australia was on a par with the prior year.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs in previous years, the positive EBIT of€0.6m (prior year: €0.4m) was mainly due to the earnings contribution from Australia.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 2.3.3 Net assets\n\n### Asset and capital structure\n\n| Condensed consolidated balance sheet: assets   |                 |                 |          |       |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|-------|\n| In €m                                          | Dec 31,<br>2023 | Dec 31,<br>2022 | change   |       |\n|                                                |                 |                 | absolute | in %  |\n| Non-current assets (incl. right-of-use assets) | 102.9           | 91.9            | 11.0     | 12.0  |\n| Receivables and other assets                   | 93.5            | 102.8           | -9.3     | -9.0  |\n| Inventories                                    | 54.8            | 71.6            | -16.8    | -23.5 |\n| Deferred tax assets                            | 3.5             | 3.9             | -0.4     | -10.3 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                      | 16.7            | 14.2            | 2.5      | 17.6  |\n| Total assets                                   | 271.3           | 284.5           | -13.2    | -4.6  |\n\n|                                              |         |         | change   |       |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|----------|-------|\n| In €m                                        | Dec 31, | Dec 31, |          |       |\n|                                              | 2023    | 2022    | absolute | in %  |\n| Equity                                       | 85.8    | 88.1    | -2.3     | -2.6  |\n| Interest-bearing loans                       | 39.1    | 41.4    | -2.3     | -5.6  |\n| Liabilities and provisions                   | 115.6   | 117.0   | -1.4     | -1.2  |\n| of which provisions (including income taxes) | 27.1    | 28.3    | -1.2     | -4.2  |\n| of which trade payables                      | 24.0    | 22.7    | 1.3      | 5.7   |\n| Contract liabilities                         | 29.1    | 36.4    | -7.3     | -20.1 |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                     | 1.7     | 1.6     | 0.1      | 6.3   |\n| Total equity and liabilities                 | 271.3   | 284.5   | -13.2    | -4.6  |\n\n### Condensed consolidated balance sheet: equity and liabilities\n\nThe WashTec Group's balance sheet total went down from €284.5m to €271.3m.\n\n### Assets\n\nThe goodwill included in the WashTec Group's non-current assets amounted to €43.3m (prior year: €42.3m). The increase compared to the prior year is due to the acquisition of the New Zealand distributor. Property, plant and equipment primarily consists of the items land and buildings in the amount of €21.7m (prior year: €12.5m) and technical equipment and machinery in the amount of €8.9m (prior year: €8.4m). The increase in the land and buildings item is mainly due to the acquisition of the site occupied by the US subsidiary for €9.5m in January 2023. Also included are right-of-use assets in the amount of €18.4m (prior year: €17.3m). This increase is mainly due to the extension of a contract with a logistics service provider.\n\nReceivables and other assets went down from €102.8m in the prior year to €93.5m. This is mainly due to the reduction in trade receivables compared to the prior year following the record revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nAt €54.8m, inventories were significantly lower at the end of the year than in the prior year (€71.6m). The decrease is mainly due to planned inventory optimization, as the considerable uncertainties on procurement markets in recent years have now cleared.\n\nDeferred tax assets totaling €3.5m (prior year: €3.9m) mainly relate to temporary differences between the tax base and IFRS carrying amounts.\n\nCash and cash equivalents went up from €14.2m in the prior year to €16.7m.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\nEquity went down from €88.1m to €85.8m. Details regarding income and expenses recognized directly in equity in accordance with IFRS are shown in the Statement of Changes in Consolidated Equity (p.115). The equity ratio increased to 31.6% (prior year: 31.0%) [because of the lower balance sheet total compared to the prior year, primarily due to the](#page-114-0)  reduction in working capital.\n\nInterest-bearing loans fell slightly compared to December 31, 2022 from €41.4m to €39.1m. This includes a long-term loan in the amount of €5.2m taken out in the fiscal year to finance the acquisition of the site occupied by the American subsidiary. The €7.5m yearon-year decrease in short-term interest-bearing loans resulted from the significant improvement in cash flow.\n\nLease liabilities amounted to €19.4m as of the reporting date (prior year: €18.1m).\n\nNet financial debt (cash and cash equivalents less financial liabilities) stood at €41.9m as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: €45.2m). The decrease by €3.3m is mainly due to the increase in cash and cash equivalents and the reduction in interest-bearing loans.\n\nProvisions (including income tax provisions) in the amount of €27.1m (prior year: €28.3m) primarily consist of provisions for personnel, partial retirement obligations and warranties.\n\nTrade payables rose slightly from €22.7m to €24.0m.\n\nContract liabilities decreased to €29.1m (prior year: €36.4m). This item includes prepayments on orders from customers, although these have fallen significantly compared to the prior year, and deferred income for full maintenance, extended guarantees and prepaid service agreements.\n\nAt€1.7m, deferred tax liabilities were at the same level as the prior year (€1.6m). They relate to temporary differences between the tax base and IFRS carrying amounts.\n\n### Unrecognized internally generated intangible assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments\n\nThe main unrecognized internally generated intangible assets benefiting WashTec's business are the immense experience and expertise of the workforce. Know-how about the wash process and the ability to deploy that expertise in research and development constitute a key competitive advantage. Another key success factor for the WashTec Group is the sales and service network built up over many years.\n\nThere are no off-balance sheet financial instruments.\n\n### 2.3.4 Financial position\n\n### Capital structure\n\nAs part of centralized financial management, the companies of the WashTec Group are financed through WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH. The Company's liabilities are denominated in euros and US dollars. The base interest rate on the loans is variable and linked to EURIBOR, €STR and SOFR. As of December 31, 2023, the Group had one credit line for a total amount of €99.7m (prior year: €92.8m). The increase was in connection with borrowing to finance the acquisition of the site occupied by the US subsidiary.\n\nThe undrawn amount of the credit line available for future operating activities and to meet obligations was €56.5m as of the reporting date (prior year: €46.1m).\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Capital expenditure, depreciation and amortization, and impairments\n\nAs planned, capital expenditure, at €14.7m, was higher in the reporting year than in the prior year (€7.5m), mainly due to the acquisition of the site occupied by the American subsidiary in the amount of €9.5m (prior year: €0.1m). The focus of capital expenditure, accounting for €4.8m (prior year: €7.2m) was on Europe. Capital expenditure in Asia/ Pacific amounted to €0.5m (prior year: €0.2m).\n\nIn addition, there was an addition of €1.4m from the acquisition of the New Zealand distributor.\n\nDepreciation and amortization of non-current assets is applied in accordance with statutory requirements and WashTec's accounting policies. Assets are generally depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic useful life.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment. The impairment test is based on the Group-level internal planning for 2024 to 2029.\n\nRecognized intangible assets were tested for impairment. The impairment testing did not lead to the recognition of any impairment losses.\n\n### Cash flow statement\n\n| In €m                                      | 2023  | 2022  | Change   |        |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------|-------|----------|--------|\n|                                            |       |       | absolute | in %   |\n| EBT                                        | 38.4  | 37.3  | 1.1      | 2.9    |\n| Net cash inflow from operating activities  | 61.8  | 22.7  | 39.1     | 172.2  |\n| Net cash outflow from investing activities | -15.7 | -6.5  | -9.2     | -141.5 |\n| Free cash flow                             | 46.1  | 16.2  | 29.9     | 184.6  |\n| Net cash outflow from financing activities | -34.4 | -48.5 | 14.1     | 29.1   |\n| Net change in cash funds                   | 11.8  | -32.2 | 44.0     | 136.6  |\n| Net foreign exchange difference            | -0.2  | 0.6   | -0.8     | -133.3 |\n| Cash funds as of Jan. 1                    | -27.1 | 4.5   | -31.6    | -702.2 |\n| Cash funds as of Dec. 31                   | -15.6 | -27.1 | 11.5     | 42.4   |\n\nThe net cash inflow from operating activities increased significantly by €39.1m to €61.8m (prior year: €22.7m). This was mainly due to the reduction in net operating working capital by €21.6m to €83.5m (prior year: increase by €18.3m to €105.1m). The improvement is mainly due to the lower level of trade receivables following the record revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. Inventories were also reduced by €16.8m compared to the prior year. This was due to a significant decrease in uncertainty in the procurement markets.\n\nThe net cash outflow from investing activities was €−15.7m in fiscal year 2023 (prior year: €−6.5m). The increase in the cash outflow is mainly due to the acquisition of the site occupied by the US subsidiary. This was purchased effective January 2, 2023 following the termination of the previous lease agreement. The purchase price was USD10.3m. This was financed by long-term, five-year US dollar bank loans in the same amount. The cash inflows and outflows in connection with the sale of the Chinese subsidiary and the acquisition of the New Zealand subsidiary amounted to €−1.2m.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\nFree cash flow (cash inflow from operating activities – cash outflow from investing activities) increased significantly to €46.1m (prior year: €16.2m).\n\n#### Free cash flow in €m, multi-year comparison\n\nImage /page/77/Figure/3 description: The image is a bar graph with the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 on the x-axis. The y-axis is not labeled. The bar for 2019 has a value of 15.0. The bar for 2020 has a value of 45.6. The bar for 2021 has a value of 42.3. The bar for 2022 has a value of 16.2. The bar for 2023 has a value of 46.1.\n\nThe net cash outflow from financing activities was €−34.4m (prior year: €−48.5m). The cash outflow was €43.8m (prior year: €48.6m) and mainly consisted of the dividend payout of €29.4m (prior year: €38.8m) and the repayment of lease liabilities. That was offset by a €9.5m cash inflow from taking out interest-bearing loans (prior year: €0.1m).\n\nCash funds increased overall, mainly due to the higher free cash flow as a result of significantly improved working capital management, to €−15.6m as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: €−27.1m). The Company was able to meet its payment obligations at all times.\n\n### 2.4 Non-financial performance indicator\n\n| Accident rate                       |      |                  |      |                    |\n|-------------------------------------|------|------------------|------|--------------------|\n|                                     | 2022 | Guidance<br>2023 | 2023 | Change<br>absolute |\n| Work accidents/million hours worked | 4.2  | <4.2             | 4.2  | 0.0                |\n\nWashTec uses the number of work accidents per million hours worked as a key non-financial performance indicator. As in the prior year, the figure of 4.2 for 2023 was below the industry average reported for recent years by the employers' liability insurance associations (Berufsgenossenschaften). This meant that the target set for 2023 of an accident rate less than 4.2 was not met. WashTec targets further reductions in the number of occupational accidents.\n\n### 2.5 Employees\n\n#### Average number of employees by year, multi-year comparison\n\nImage /page/77/Figure/11 description: This image is a bar chart that shows the values for the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. The value for 2019 is 1,880. The value for 2020 is 1,798. The value for 2021 is 1,767. The value for 2022 is 1,806. The value for 2023 is 1,768.\n\nThe number of employees fell by 137 to 1,687 as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: 1,824). When comparing with the prior year, it should be noted that the December 31, 2022 figure included 50 employees of the subsidiary in China. Seven employees were added as of\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-78-0\"></span>December 31, 2023 on the initial consolidation of the New Zealand subsidiary. The average number of employees at WashTec during the year was 1,768 (prior year: 1,806).\n\nThe WashTec Group ensures that its employees receive appropriate remuneration. In Germany in particular, with the exception of AUWA-Chemie GmbH, the WashTec Group is subject to collective agreements with trade union IG Metall. Collective agreements with trade union IG Bergbau, Chemie, Energie serve as benchmarks at AUWA-Chemie GmbH.\n\n### 2.6 WashTec AG\n\nWashTec AG has its registered place of business in Augsburg and is the ultimate parent company of the WashTec Group. As such, it is responsible for the strategic management and control of all its subsidiaries. Since the Company does not have any operations of its own, its results of operations, financial position and cash flows are determined by the business performance of its subsidiaries.\n\nThe business performance of WashTec AG to a large extent corresponds to that of the WashTec Group, which is described in detail under \"Business performance\". The forecast for WashTec AG of a significant increase in net income for the period by ≥10% in fiscal year 2023 was not achieved. This is mainly due to the effects of the disposal of the Chinese subsidiary.\n\n| Income statement of WashTec AG (condensed) |      |      |          |       |\n|--------------------------------------------|------|------|----------|-------|\n| In €m                                      | 2023 | 2022 | Change   |       |\n|                                            |      |      | absolute | in %  |\n| Revenue                                    | 3.5  | 2.7  | 0.8      | 29.6  |\n| Personnel expenses                         | 2.0  | 2.1  | –0.1     | –4.8  |\n| Other operating expenses                   | 3.8  | 2.8  | 1.0      | 35.7  |\n| Investment result                          | 37.2 | 40.4 | –3.2     | –7.9  |\n| Net income for the period                  | 29.7 | 28.3 | 1.4      | 4.9   |\n| Profit carried forward                     | 0.4  | 1.5  | –1.1     | –73.3 |\n| Distributable profit                       | 30.1 | 29.8 | 0.3      | 1.0   |\n\n### Earnings\n\nRevenue at WashTec AG – HGB-basis, meaning as measured in accordance with the German Commercial Code – increased to €3.5m (prior year: €2.7m) and related to management costs charged on to subsidiaries.\n\nWashTec AG's personnel expenses (HGB-basis) of €2.0m (prior year: €2.1m) include Management Board remuneration and personnel expenses for the Legal and Investor Relations functions.\n\nOther operating expenses (HGB-basis), at €3.8m, were up on the prior year (€2.8m). The increase was partly due to consulting services related to the cost optimization of the new product generation.\n\nThe investment result (HGB-basis) comprises income under control and profit (loss) pooling agreements and a profit transfer agreement in the total amount of €24.1m (prior year: €35.8m) and interest income in the total amount of €0.2m (prior year: €0.1m). In addition, WashTec Holding GmbH paid a dividend in the amount of €13.0m (prior year: €4.5m).\n\nNet income for the period (HGB-basis) increased to €29.7m (prior year: €28.3m).\n\n| Balance Sheet of WashTec AG (condensed) |              |              |          |       |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------|-------|\n| In €m                                   | Dec 31, 2023 | Dec 31, 2022 | Change   |       |\n|                                         |              |              | absolute | in %  |\n| Non-current assets                      | 128.2        | 128.2        | 0.0      | 0.0   |\n| Receivables and other assets            | 39.0         | 40.9         | -1.9     | -4.6  |\n| Equity                                  | 159.2        | 158.9        | 0.3      | 0.2   |\n| Provisions                              | 4.9          | 7.9          | -3.0     | -38.0 |\n| Liabilities                             | 3.1          | 2.3          | 0.8      | 34.8  |\n| Balance sheet total                     | 167.2        | 169.1        | -1.9     | -1.1  |\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Financial position and cash flows\n\nNon-current assets (HGB-basis) mainly consist of shares in affiliated companies in the amount of €128.1m (prior year: €128.1m). Management tests the shares in affiliated companies annually for impairment. No impairment has been identified.\n\nThe receivables and other assets (HGB-basis) in the amount of €39.0m (prior year: €40.9m) primarily resulted from general clearing transactions with affiliated companies under control and profit (loss) pooling agreements and a profit transfer agreement.\n\nEquity (HGB-basis) was €159.2m (prior year: €158.9m). This yields an equity ratio of 95.2% (prior year: 94.0%).\n\nProvisions (HGB-basis) stood at €4.9m (prior year: €7.9m) and mainly related to taxes, legal and consulting expenses, auditing costs, Management Board remuneration and Supervisory Board remuneration. The decrease is mainly due to the lower provisions for income taxes.\n\nWashTec AG is financed by means of cash pooling with WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH.\n\n### Opportunities and risk report\n\nWashTec AG's opportunities and risks as the Group's ultimate parent company are derived from the opportunities and risks of its operating subsidiaries. WashTec AG is integrated into the Group-wide risk management system. Further information is provided in the opportunities and risk report. That section also provides a description of the internal control system as required under Section 289f (1) HGB.\n\nWashTec AG's main risks relate to the recoverability of the carrying amount of investments. In addition, there are risks associated with the amount of the profits and losses from subsidiaries under the control and profit (loss) pooling agreements and the profit transfer agreement.\n\n### Other\n\nThe salient features of the remuneration system for the Management Board and the Super[visory Board are explained in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\(Note 37\\).](#page-165-0)  In addition, detailed descriptions of the remuneration system and the remuneration of the Management Board and Supervisory Board are contained in the Remuneration Report, which is published on the Company's website under \"Remuneration of Board of Management and Supervisory Board.\"\n\n[The Corporate Governance Statement is reprinted in section 8 and published on the website](#page-96-0)  [https://ir.washtec.de.](https://ir.washtec.de/en/)\n\n### Guidance\n\nThe expectations described under \"WashTec business development\" in the Outlook for the [WashTec Group \\(section 4.1\\) also apply to the business development of WashTec AG as the](#page-81-0)  ultimate Group parent company.

The focus is on maximum possible benefit to people who wash cars professionally. To strengthen its market and technology leadership in carwash, the Company will step up investment in products and digitalization in the short term.\n\n### Markets and products\n\nThe Company intends to further increase its presence and market share in the Group's main sales regions and product and service segments worldwide. This applies to all markets in which WashTec intends to occupy a leading position in every customer, product and service segment. Special emphasis is placed on Europe and North America. WashTec generates a significant portion of revenue in Europe and aims to further extend its market position there. In addition, North America in particular is planned to account for a higher share of the Group's revenue in the medium to long term.\n\n### General economic conditions\n\n[A detailed description of the overall economic development can be found in section 2.1 of](#page-64-0)  the management report. The WashTec Group has prepared its outlook against the general backdrop of a continuing uncertain economic and geopolitical environment and expects global economic growth in 2024 to be on a similar level to 2023. Uncertainties and tensions in relation to China, the war in Ukraine and the Middle East conflict may also have a negative impact on economic development.\n\n### WashTec business development\n\nThe outlook for fiscal year 2024 is subject to uncertainties that could have a material effect on the planned development of key performance indicators.\n\nWhen specifying the planning assumptions, it was assumed in particular that interest rates would decline slightly over the course of the year. Inflation rates will remain high, weighing on consumption and investment. Against this backdrop, the WashTec Group expects low economic growth this year. The forecast does not incorporate any significant increase in tensions with China or any significant escalation of the war in Ukraine or the conflict in the Middle East, or the possibility of these conflicts spreading to other countries.\n\nBased on a largely stable price level on the sales side and a solid order backlog at the end of 2023, the Company expects business to remain stable in 2024. The cost optimization measures initiated for the new product generation will contribute to a further increase in profitability. With regard to material prices, the WashTec Group expects the costs of purchased parts and labor to remain at their current high level and anticipates a lower price level for raw materials than in the prior year.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Management Board aims to actively further the development of the Group's strategy together with the entire workforce and to continuously improve operating performance. The focus for 2024 will be on further optimizing existing processes, product optimization, and investing in the development of digital solutions and products. We see the integration of our entire product and service portfolio – equipment, service and chemicals, embedded in digital solutions – as a source of major growth potential. In regional terms, we will focus on our core regions of Europe and North America in order to better exploit the market potential available there.\n\nTo accelerate this process, the Company will incur additional capital expenditure in the low single-digit million range in 2024.\n\nIn summary, the Management Board expects in its guidance that the Group-level key performance figures will develop as follows:\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, WashTec expects Group revenue on a similar level to the prior year (2023: €489.5m), with an increase in EBIT in the mid-single-digit percentage range (2023: €41.9m).\n\nRevenue and EBIT in Europe and North America are expected to develop in line with the targeted Group performance.\n\nThe Company expects net operating working capital to further normalize in 2024, particularly with regard to trade receivables/payables and inventories. As a result, the Company expects a free cash flow of between €30m and €40m (2023: €46.1m).\n\nWashTec aims to employ the capital available to it profitably and efficiently. Return on capital employed (ROCE) is our central measure of capital efficiency. In the medium term, the WashTec Group aims for ROCE of over 25%. For the coming year, the Company expects ROCE to remain at the prior-year level (±1%).\n\nThe accident rate (work accidents/million hours worked), which is already low compared with the industry average, is expected to fall further in fiscal year 2024 (2023: 4.2).\n\nEarnings in the separate financial statements of WashTec AG depend to a substantial extent on the profit transfers from subsidiaries. The key financial performance indicator is net income for the period. The forecast described for the WashTec Group therefore also applies to the business development of WashTec AG as the ultimate Group parent company.\n\n| Revenue on a similar level to the prior year | $\\pm$ 3%                          |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Increase in EBIT                             | Mid single-digit percentage range |\n| Free cash flow                               | €30m–€40m                         |\n| ROCE                                         | $\\pm$ 1 percentage point          |\n| Accident rate                                | <4.2                              |\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 4.2 Opportunities and risk report\n\nRisks are possible future developments or events that could lead to negative variation from projections or targets for the Company. Risk is intrinsic to any business venture.\n\nOpportunities are possible future developments or events that could lead to positive variation from projections or targets for the Company. A potential favorable outcome of a risk is also referred to as an opportunity.\n\nThe WashTec Group's international business activities give rise to opportunities and risks that are inextricably linked with its business. To address these opportunities and risks in a timely and controlled manner, the Company's key business processes are subject to an internal monitoring and control system. This enables timely action to be taken as necessary.\n\n### 4.2.1 Opportunities and risk management\n\n### Risk management\n\nRisks are identified, analyzed, assessed, managed, documented and communicated, and these activities monitored, using a uniform, Group-wide, multi-level risk management system. The purpose of this system is to identify risks posed by future events on the basis of short-term and mid-term planning (with both a 12-month and a two-to-three-year planning horizon) and to initiate any action needed to adequately address them. The aim of including risk analysis beyond the next twelve months is to aid in timely identification of potential future risks even if their impact is not material for the coming fiscal year. In the opinion of the Management Board, this risk early warning system is capable of suitably identifying all material and going-concern risks. The risk management system used by the Group allows systematic risk recording, documentation, assessment and aggregation on the basis of recognized statistical methods.\n\nAll identified risks are reported by divisional heads and analyzed within the risk management system on a semi-annual basis. Risks are assessed for EBIT impact – either as an absolute maximum impact figure or as a three-point estimation of a best-case, expected and worst-case impact figure – and for probability of occurrence and the effectiveness of possible countermeasures. Risks are assessed using uniform criteria. The EBIT impacts are presented in a gross/net analysis. The gross figure is the amount before any measures taken. Risk mitigation measures may comprise, for example, existing provisions, insurance policies, or planned projects and activities for preventive risk minimization. They are specified, implemented and monitored for effectiveness by divisional managers. The risk management system is also audited annually by Internal Audit.\n\nIn the risk analysis, all net individual risks are simulated using Monte Carlo simulation. They are simulated and aggregated both at Group level and at risk category level. Any correlations are taken into account. The simulation is used to determine both the expected loss (net) and value-at-risk with a confidence level of 95%. Value-at-risk represents the WashTec Group's overall potential risk and is used to determine risk-bearing capacity. Risk-bearing capacity is assessed in relation to Group liquidity, equity and operating earnings (EBIT). This is done by comparing value-at-risk with the corresponding risk coverage potential.\n\nIn individual risk analysis, individual risks and opportunities that have a similar cause-effect relationship are aggregated in the risk analysis.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe simulated expected loss (net) per risk category is classified according to financial impact and probability of occurrence as follows:\n\n| Financial impacts on Group EBIT in €k: |                    |               |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------|\n| 1                                      | Insignificant      | <499          |\n| 2                                      | Minor              | 500–4,999     |\n| 3                                      | Material           | 5,000–9,999   |\n| 4                                      | Serious            | 10,000–19,999 |\n| 5                                      | Existential threat | >20,000       |\n\n### W The probability of occurrence is indicated as follows:\n\n| 1 | Very unlikely | 1-15%  |\n|---|---------------|--------|\n| 2 | Unlikely      | 15-40% |\n| 3 | Possible      | 40-60% |\n| 4 | Likely        | 60-85% |\n| 5 | Very likely   | 85-99% |\n\nThere were no changes in risk classification compared with the prior year.\n\nBased on the combination of these two factors, all risks, aggregated by risk categories, are classified by threat potential as negligible (N), relevant (R), major (M) or threat to survival (S). This forms the basis for the subsequent management of risks.\n\n| Risk matrix        | Probability of occurrence |        |        |        |        |\n|--------------------|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Impacts            | 1–15%                     | 15–40% | 40–60% | 60–85% | 85–99% |\n| Existential threat | R                         | M      | M      | S      | S      |\n| Serious            | R                         | R      | M      | M      | M      |\n| Material           | R                         | R      | M      | M      | M      |\n| Minor              | N                         | R      | R      | R      | M      |\n| Insignificant      | N                         | N      | R      | R      | R      |\n\n### Opportunity management\n\nThe purpose of opportunity management is to identify, assess and manage positive future potential at an early stage and to take suitable measures for the implementation of new strategies and innovations. The identification and exploitation of opportunities (opportunity management) is an ongoing task of business geared to securing the long-term success of the Company and capitalizing on short-run advantages.\n\nOpportunities are collated, assessed and, to the extent possible, materialized for all divisions in regular budget planning and update sessions as well as in management meetings.\n\n### 4.2.2 Opportunities and risks\n\nThe opportunities and risks that could have a material impact on the development of the WashTec Group as of the December 31, 2023 balance sheet date are described in the following.\n\n### Uncertainties in financial markets and in overall economic development\n\n### Risks\n\nUncertainties and unforeseeable changes in the global economy, financial markets and the political landscape could adversely affect capital spending patterns in individual customer groups. Access to markets and terms of delivery can also change at short notice.\n\nIn view of the current economic situation, including the geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties, there continues to be uncertainty with regard to material prices and availability. The situation has eased compared to the last few years, which is why these risks are rated lower in terms of probability of occurrence and financial impact for the coming fiscal year.\n\nPersistently high interest rates and high construction costs give rise to a risk of further market contraction and may lead to a further weakening of investment behavior, particularly in the direct sales segment. The difficult market environment and instability in Central and\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\nEastern Europe due to the war in Ukraine may also have a negative impact on customer investment behavior.\n\nIn addition, the current Middle East conflict could lead to various risks for the Group. Supply conditions could become more difficult as a result. This could lead to higher logistics costs or reduced availability of materials, which in turn could be reflected in rising material prices. As little revenue is generated in this region, the direct impact on the Group's business development is considered to be non-material.\n\n### Opportunities\n\nThe easing of inflation and interest rates observed at the end of the year could continue in the coming fiscal year and lead to greater customer demand.\n\nThe general economic slowdown and the associated decline in demand could result in lower procurement prices for the Group.\n\n### Climate and environmental risks\n\n### Risks\n\nClimate change, regional droughts and water scarcity, increasing road congestion, rising fuel costs, the proliferation of inner-city vehicle-free zones and greater general environmental awareness could all lead to fewer vehicles on the road in order to protect the environment or comply with regulations. Such a trend could diminish carwash use and, accordingly, reduce capital spending on vehicle wash equipment.\n\nCar washing bans due to droughts, as seen in Southern Europe during past years, could have a negative effect on the Group's service and chemicals business. The impacts of climate change may also result in such bans on car washing being enshrined in law in the near future.\n\nThe WashTec Group does not currently consider shifts in consumer preferences towards low-emission or zero-emission products to be significant with regard to the carwash business model, as more conscious consumer behavior only affects the choice of means of propulsion and is of secondary importance for how frequently cars are washed.\n\nPotential changes in the way vehicles are utilized in the future, such as the increase in car-sharing models, will not materially affect WashTec's business model in the short term. In the medium term, such changes could lead to a shift from individual washing in gantry carwashes to autonomous washing in conveyor tunnel systems.\n\nNew mobility concepts could lead in the future to increased use of the existing vehicle fleet. In addition to the size of the fleet, the nature and intensity of vehicle use would then determine carwash demand. Vehicles need to be cleaned no matter how they are powered and regardless of the ownership model.\n\n### Opportunities\n\nThe scarcity and rising cost of fresh water as a resource could lead to an increase in automated vehicle washing. This is far more environment-friendly if the carwash has a water treatment system. According to the system, wash program and vehicle type, water recovery systems that recirculate wash water can reduce mains water consumption by up to 90%.\n\nAdditional countries adopting stricter legislation could drive a rise in demand for carwash systems with water recovery equipment. Similarly, rules and regulations such as the prohibition of hand car washing could have a positive effect on demand for carwash equipment.\n\nWashTec contributes significantly to environmental sustainability as a pioneer in the development of eco-friendly carwash chemicals.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Customers, competition and market\n\n### Risks\n\nA freeze on capital spending by individual major customers or the listing of other suppliers due to major customers launching new bid requests for framework supply agreements could lead to a decrease in revenue and/or to losses of market share for WashTec in virtually all regions. These risks could affect revenue performance in the North America region in particular in the years ahead.\n\nGiven the intensive competition in the industry, there are potential risks associated with price-based competition that could lead to increased price pressure in certain markets or market segments. WashTec has implemented a comprehensive and systematic market tracking system. Revenue risks that could arise from a potential decline in demand are monitored on an ongoing basis. Appropriate measures are taken as necessary to adapt products, optimize the product range and adjust capacity.\n\nReduced supply and higher prices for fossil fuels are driving demand for electric vehicles. This could lead to reduced use of filling stations as they exist today. At present, however, it is not possible to predict which recharging model will prevail for electric vehicles. However, our major customers believe that due to the existing vehicle fleet, this option will not have a significant impact on the number and use of filling stations over the next five to ten years.\n\nA further risk can arise if major customers sell some or all of their (filling station) networks. If stations or networks are then acquired by more than one purchaser, then this could lead to higher selling effort and render existing long-term contacts with decision makers obsolete. Similarly, the termination of partnerships with distributors or service providers could lead to increased costs for sales, service or installation.\n\n### Opportunities\n\nThe trend towards high-quality automated car washing will continue, including in regions outside of the developed markets. The Company's solid structure also allows it to invest in new products and markets. Local presence with the Company's own production plant in the North America region could lead to a positive outcome above the internally budgeted figures in the mid-term. The increasingly global procurement activities could enable further efficiency potential to be realized in the future procurement and production of individual components.\n\nCloser collaboration with our independent distributors in countries where WashTec does not have subsidiaries of its own could increase sales volumes in growth regions.\n\n### Capital expenditure\n\nCapital expenditure decisions are based among other things on assumptions and estimates about future developments. The assessment of risks and opportunities plays a significant role when reviewing potential capital expenditure.\n\n### Risks\n\nThere is a risk of the assumptions or estimates made about future market developments not materializing as expected, leading to a misallocation of investment spending or development projects not resulting in the expected contributions to earnings. Such misallocation could have a negative impact on the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the WashTec Group due to interest expense for tied-up capital and/or due to impairments. A significant increase in the duration of investment projects can also have a negative impact on the Company's earnings as a result of tied-up resources and/or cost overruns. To adequately address such risk, the Company has a detailed policy for approving capital expenditure and related spending.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Opportunities\n\nCapital expenditure offers numerous opportunities. Depending on the type of capital expenditure, these include opportunities to strengthen WashTec's market and competitive position and/or to improve earnings. Investment in digitalization in particular could open up new opportunities in terms of products and solutions for our customers and thus generate a competitive advantage. Smart technology optimizes carwash operation, for example, and allows operators to precisely meet customer needs. Remote services can also be used to increase machine availability and enhance carwash profitability.\n\n### Innovations and patents\n\n### Risks\n\nProduct innovations carry the risk of not being taken up by the market as expected. This could result in innovations not performing and generating revenue as expected and in them falling short of market expectations. To avoid this, WashTec keeps a close watch on new market launches and tests product effectiveness at an early stage.\n\nFor any company, launching new products on the market involves additional effort and risks. As well as the additional product placement effort and the aforementioned customer acceptance risk, there is further risk potential in managing the phase-out of existing products and in quality-related problems that only become apparent after market launch.\n\nIncreasing requirements for compliance with technical and country-specific standards result in higher financial and technical expense, but this is currently not considered material to the Group's business.\n\nInnovations by competitors, developments in the automotive industry and the emergence of new substitute technologies in related industries can have a significant and long-term impact on demand for WashTec products. However, the associated risks are primarily seen in the medium to long term and are therefore of secondary importance to risk assessment for the coming fiscal year.\n\n### Opportunities\n\nThe WashTec Group's research and development activities are aimed at adding to the existing product range, developing new wash systems and quickly and efficiently meeting individual customer requirements. WashTec innovations have received numerous past awards at industry trade fairs and have been successfully launched on the market.\n\nInnovative products could outperform customer expectations, generate new demand and win new customer groups or lead to a shift in market share among existing customer segments.\n\nWashTec has a large number of patents and licenses that are highly important to the Group's business and can therefore confer a competitive advantage.\n\n### IT security, quality and processes\n\n### Risks\n\nCyber risks are all risks to which computer and information networks and all IT-assisted business and production processes are exposed. The use of IT inevitably entails risks, which cannot ultimately be ruled out, for the stability of business processes and for the availability, confidentiality and integrity of information and data. Cyberattacks and ransomware attacks continue to grow in number and professionalism around the world. The risk in the context of cybercrime is classified as relevant overall.\n\nIT security, quality and process risks can arise in connection with new product launches and with improvements in internal processes and the introduction of new IT systems. The Company's operating processes critically depend on continuous availability of all technical systems. Were this to be at risk, it would have an overall negative impact on WashTec.\n\nWashTec has taken appropriate measures (training, implementing improved safety systems, etc.) to reduce these risks as far as possible. In the opinion of the Company, the stability of the IT systems in recent years indicates that they are robust. Significant effort and continuous investment will nevertheless be made in the coming year to further reduce these risks.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nQuality problems in the development or production of carwash equipment can result in subsequent costs for the Group. Any defects or problems are continuously recorded, monitored and corrected by quality assurance.\n\n### Opportunities\n\nContinuous improvement of business processes and the use of new technologies can have a positive impact on customer satisfaction. In addition, it may lead to process efficiency gains that have not been taken into account in normal planning.\n\n### Suppliers\n\n### Risks\n\nThe purchase of raw materials, components or services involves risks related to delivery delays, insufficient product availability, quality defects and price fluctuations.\n\nGiven the current economic situation, including the geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties, there continues to be uncertainty regarding material prices and availability.\n\nIn addition, rising diesel prices and road tolls, a shortage of skilled logistics workers, unsafe transportation conditions and trade route disruption of the kind being caused by the Middle East conflict can lead to rising transportation and logistics costs.\n\n### Opportunities\n\nCompetition among suppliers and their innovation potential makes it possible to achieve both technical and price improvements for the procurement of products or services.\n\nThe increasingly global procurement activities could enable further efficiency potential to be realized in the future procurement and production of individual components.\n\n### Capacity risks\n\nDemand fluctuations and varying production capacity utilization over the course of the year require corresponding capacity adjustments. The fact that sales volumes are higher in the final months of the year creates particular challenges in production planning.\n\nAbsences of production personnel due to illness can result in a sudden loss of production capacity for several days.\n\nOn the basis of internal sales volume planning, capacity risks at the production sites are identified as far as possible and mitigated by the deployment of temporary workers and flexible annual working time arrangements or, in the event of extreme fluctuations, by short time working. A significant shift in the course of the fiscal year could result in sales risks due to potential difficulties in adjusting capacity with temporary workers.\n\nDemand growth is met by continuous improvement of production processes and by timely capital expenditure on capacity expansion.\n\n### Takeover risks or changes in ownership structure\n\nIf its stock market valuation fails to sufficiently reflect the Company's long-term intrinsic value or the WashTec Group's performance sparks the interests of new investors, then this could lead to significant changes in ownership structure or a takeover.\n\nSuch events may lead to changes in the WashTec Group's established strategy, the composition of its executive bodies and its previously communicated expectations. Some of the WashTec Group's contractual agreements (such as loans agreements) include a change of control clause.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Financial and legal risks\n\nThe base interest rate on the existing financing arrangements is variable. Further interest rate rises could negatively impact the WashTec Group's earnings. However, given the increases in recent years, the Company does not anticipate any further significant interest rate hikes. Increased utilization of the credit lines, combined with the current high level of interest rates, poses the risk of higher financing costs.\n\nWashTec is also exposed to risks arising from different product-specific and country-specific rules, regulations and laws that affect its business activities and processes. There is a possibility that new litigation may arise and that existing litigation with contracting parties may be resolved. The Group manages these risks by involving the legal department in critical legal transactions at an early stage, by engaging external experts as necessary and by recognizing appropriate provisions.\n\n### Exchange rate changes\n\n### Risks\n\nDue to transactions with subsidiaries, exchange rate changes could affect operating performance. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations may affect the Group's income statement through the measurement of open foreign currency positions. To mitigate such effects when necessary, WashTec hedges against major risk with derivatives. The operational risk arising from individual transactions in foreign currencies is immaterial to the Group due to the small volume of such transactions.\n\n### Opportunities\n\nA weakening of the euro could lead to positive currency effects on revenue in the North America or Asia/Pacific regions.\n\n### Liquidity risk\n\nEnsuring that the subsidiaries are solvent at all times is essential for WashTec. The implemented cash management systems enable potential shortfalls to be identified in good time and appropriate action to be taken. Undrawn credit lines ensure the supply of liquidity.\n\nA liquidity risk could arise in that there might not be adequate cash to discharge financial obligations as they fall due, for example due to payments not factored into cash planning.\n\nExisting credit lines can be extended in the event that the development of the business results in additional financing requirements.\n\nThe company considers itself well positioned with regard to liquidity risks. With the currently available credit lines, the Company has sufficient liquid resources and borrowing lines to be able to be flexible and also to invest in future growth.\n\n### Credit and default risks\n\nThe WashTec Group exclusively conducts business with creditworthy third parties. To minimize credit risk, order limits are imposed in cases where customers do not have first-class credit standing. For new regional customers, the Company requests evidence of credit standing or financing. The recognized allowances for trade receivables are considered sufficient to cover the actual default risk. There is no material credit risk concentration within the Group. For selected customers, insolvency coverage is taken out with reputable credit insurers when receivables exceed a certain level.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Tax risks\n\nThe WashTec Group mostly recognizes deferred taxes in relation to temporary differences. Changes in tax legislation that affect the tax rate could result in expense from the remeasurement of recognized deferred tax assets and thus adversely affect consolidated equity and/or earnings per share.\n\nFurther risks could arise due to ongoing pending tax audits at Group companies. Due to the international nature of the WashTec Group's business activities, tax risks cannot be ruled out until tax audits have been concluded.\n\n### Employee risks\n\nWashTec is highly dependent on qualified employees and specialists, especially in development, customer care and carwash equipment programming and operation. The unexpected loss of employees, changes in the age structure of the workforce or difficulties finding qualified employees could have an adverse effect on WashTec's development. This is notably exacerbated by the current shortage of skilled labor.\n\n### 4.2.3 Overview of corporate risks\n\nThe following table shows the risks aggregated by risk category:\n\n|                                        | Probability of<br>occurrence | Change |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------|\n| Overall economic development           | relevant                     | →      |\n| Climate and environmental risks        | relevant                     | →      |\n| Customers, competition and market      | relevant                     | →      |\n| Capital expenditure risks              | relevant                     | →      |\n| Innovations and patents                | relevant                     | →      |\n| IT security, quality and process risks | relevant                     | →      |\n| Supplier risks                         | relevant                     | →      |\n| Capacity risks                         | relevant                     | →      |\n| Takeover risks                         | negligible                   | →      |\n| Financial and legal risks              | relevant                     | →      |\n| Currency risks                         | negligible                   | →      |\n| Liquidity risks                        | negligible                   | →      |\n| Credit and default risks               | negligible                   | →      |\n| Tax risks                              | relevant                     | →      |\n| Employee risks                         | relevant                     | →      |\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 4.2.4 Overall risk assessment\n\nThe established risk management system is appropriate in the assessment of the Management Board and is subject to continuous improvement. The solid business model also limits business risks and opens up additional opportunities. Aggregation of the most significant individual risks across all corporate divisions and functions provides an indication of the Group's overall risk assessment, even though it is considered unlikely that the individual risks will materialize simultaneously. The cumulative expected loss (net) across all individual risks is €22.7m as of the end of 2023 (prior year: €25.9m) and is thus slightly down on the prior year, mainly due to the lower material price risks.\n\nBased on the individual risks set out above, the overall assessment is as follows:\n\nThe total number of risks that have a material impact on the WashTec Group is at the same level as in the prior year. Risks related to material prices and availability decreased in the reporting year, but continue to apply in view of the current economic situation, including the geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties. In the long term in particular, ongoing conflicts in the Middle East could complicate transportation conditions and thus lead to rising material and logistics costs. The Group does not currently expect this to have any material impact on business development in the coming year. Risks associated with overall economic development are classified as lower than in the prior year. However, a continuation of the high interest rates and high construction costs could lead to a further contraction of the overall market, resulting in lower revenue, particularly in the direct customer business. The\n\ndifficult market environment and instability in Central and Eastern Europe due to the Ukraine war may also have a negative impact on customer investment behavior. Given the intensive competition in the industry, the risks in relation to customers, competition and market remain unchanged. As in the prior year, the number of ransomware attacks and cyberattacks continues to increase, as a result of which IT security risks continue to be relevant for WashTec. However, this risk is considered to be lower than in the prior year due to improvements in the IT security system and other measures.\n\nBased on the findings of the risk management process, the Management Board is not currently aware of any risks that could cast doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nIn accordance with Section 317 (4) HGB, the risk early warning system set up in accordance with Section 91 (2) AktG is audited by the auditor as part of the audit of the annual financial statements. The audit showed that the Management Board has taken the measures required in accordance with Section 91 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), in particular for the establishment of a monitoring system in suitable form. In all material respects, the monitoring system is capable of ensuring, with reasonable assurance, timely identification of any risks that may raise doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Risk reporting is also provided to the Supervisory Board.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-92-0\"></span>5\n\nWashTec's risk management system (RMS) is described in the Risk Report under 4.2. Opportunities and risk report.\n\nThe internal control system (ICS) comprises all systematically defined controls and monitoring activities. It monitors principles and procedures using preventive and detective controls.\n\nAn effective and efficient internal control system is critical to the successful management of risk in business processes. The ICS covers all WashTec companies. The scope of activities to be performed by each entity varies, depending among other things on the entity's materiality to the consolidated financial statements and the specific risks associated with it. Overall responsibility for the ICS lies with the Management Board. In the manner of a compliance management system, the purpose of WashTec's ICS is to ensure effectiveness and efficiency in business activities, orderly and reliable accounting, and compliance with the legal provisions and requirements relevant to the WashTec. Accordingly, WashTec's internal control system covers all key business processes and goes beyond controls in the accounting process.\n\nIn the accounting process, various monitoring measures and controls help to ensure, for example, that the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with requirements. WashTec uses a uniform Group consolidation system to ensure consistency. This also minimizes the risk of misstatements in accounting and external reporting. Adequate functional segregation and application of the dual control principle reduce the risk of fraudulent conduct. The coordinated processes, systems and controls provide sufficient assurance that the accounting process complies with IFRS, the\n\nGerman Commercial Code (HGB) and other accounting-related requirements and laws. Group-wide accounting policies ensure the uniformity of accounting throughout the WashTec Group. New accounting requirements and changes in existing accounting requirements are examined for their impact on the WashTec Group and applied on a timely basis.\n\nWashTec regularly performs system backups in the case of relevant IT systems in order to prevent data loss and system downtime as far as possible. The security policy also includes in-built system controls, manual spot checks by experienced staff, role-based permissions and physical access restrictions.\n\nWashTec continuously develops the requirements for the internal control system and adapts the control landscape to changing processes. Internal Audit is involved in the entire process and regularly reviews the effectiveness of the internal control system as part of the riskbased annual audit plan.\n\n### *Note: The following paragraph was not subject to an audit by the auditor.*\n\n*WashTec's Management Board evaluates the output of the RMS and the ICS at Management Board meetings and conducts an annual assessment of their appropriateness and effectiveness. The Management Board has no indication that the RMS and ICS (including the CMS), taken as a whole, were not adequate or effective in any material respect as of December 31, 2023. However, as part of a continuous improvement process, the Management Board recognizes the need for ongoing optimization to ensure effectiveness and efficiency. Irrespective of this, there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any RMS or ICS. No system considered to be adequate and effective is guaranteed to identify all risks or rule out process or control violations in all circumstances. The Audit Committee is systematically integrated into WashTec's RMS and ICS (including the CMS). In particular, the Audit Committee monitors accounting and the accounting process as well as the appropriateness and effectiveness of the ICS and the RMS.*\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-93-0\"></span>Risk reporting in relation to the use of financial instruments 6\n\nThe main risks for the WashTec Group arising from derivative financial instruments comprise credit, liquidity and market price risks. Company policy is to avoid or limit such risk as far as possible. The management of interest rate, currency, liquidity, credit and default risk has already been described in the risk report. When necessary, the Company also considers the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge market price risks. Interest rate and currency risks are the main market price risks. At the inception of a hedging relationship, both the hedging relationship and the Group's risk management objectives and strategies with regard to the hedge are formally designated and documented. This is described in detail in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with Group policy, there is no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes.\n\nImage /page/93/Picture/5 description: In a close-up shot, a car is being washed in a car wash.

Under Section 7.1 of the Articles of Association, the Management Board consists of one or more members. The number of members of the Management Board is determined by the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn accordance with the Company's Articles of Association read in conjunction with the current Management Board rules of procedure, the Management Board currently comprises three members. The Articles of Association do not lay down any special requirements with respect to the appointment and removal of one or all of the members of the Management Board. The Supervisory Board is responsible for appointments and removals. Members may be reappointed to the Management Board or have their term of office extended.\n\nAmendments to the Articles of Association are made pursuant to Section 179 and 133 AktG and to Sections 9.14 and 9.15 of the Articles of Association. The Company has not made use of the option to lay down further requirements for amendments to the Articles of Association.\n\nSection 9.14 of the Articles of Association reduces the statutory minimum requirements to the extent permitted by law. The Supervisory Board is authorized to make solely formal amendments to the Articles of Association.\n\n### Powers of the Management Board to issue or buy back shares\n\n### Authorized Capital (Section 5.1 of the Articles of Association of WashTec AG)\n\nBy resolution of the Annual General Meeting on May 16, 2022, the Management Board is authorized, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to increase the registered share capital on one or more occasions on or before June 30, 2025 by a total amount of up to €8,000,000 (Authorized Capital) by issuing new no-par-value bearer shares in exchange for cash and/or non-cash contributions. The shareholders must be granted preemptive rights in\n\nthis connection unless otherwise stipulated. The new shares may also be underwritten by one or more banks designated by the Management Board with the obligation to offer them to the shareholders for subscription (indirect subscription right). However, the Management Board is authorized (subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board) to exclude shareholders' preemptive rights in certain cases as set out in Section 5.1 of the Articles of Association of WashTec AG. The Management Board has not made use of these authorizations to date. The authorized capital is intended to enable the Company to act rapidly and flexibly as needed in order to raise equity capital on favorable terms.\n\n### Share buy-back\n\nUnless expressly permitted by law, the Company cannot acquire or make use of treasury shares except with authorization from the Annual General Meeting. By resolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 16, 2022, the Company is authorized to acquire, on or before June 30, 2025 and for purposes other than to trade in the Company's own shares, the Company's own shares in the amount of up to 10% of the share capital of €40,000,000 at the time of the resolution or – if lower – at the time the authorization is exercised. The Management Board may opt to acquire such shares on the stock exchange, by means of a public purchase offer to all shareholders or by means of a public invitation directed at all shareholders to tender shares for sale. The precise terms and conditions for the purchase and use of treasury shares are set out in item 8 of the agenda in the 2022 Invitation to the Annual General Meeting of WashTec AG. Following completion of the share buyback offer in September 2015, and including shares previously held, WashTec AG now holds a total of 594,646 of treasury shares, representing approximately 4.25% of its registered share capital.\n\n### Significant agreements subject to a change of control of the company following a takeover bid\n\nIndividual contractual agreements entered into by the WashTec Group (such as loan agreements) provide for the option of extraordinary termination in the event of a takeover (change of control). In that event there may also be a change of management.\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Corporate Governance Statement\n\n### In accordance with Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board of WashTec AG operate in accordance with the principles of good and responsible corporate governance. In this Corporate Governance Statement in accordance with Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, or HGB), the Management Board reports on corporate governance at WashTec AG and in the WashTec Group. The Corporate Governance Statement also includes the declaration on the German Corporate Governance Code (the \"Code\") in accordance with Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, or AktG).\n\n### 8.1 Declaration of Conformity\n\n<span id=\"page-96-0\"></span>8\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board of WashTec AG identify with the objectives of the Code, which encourage responsible, transparent corporate management and supervision directed at sustained growth in shareholder value.\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board regularly direct their attention to satisfying the Code's requirements, which comprise principles, recommendations and suggestions. The recommendations of the Code are largely complied with.\n\nThe Declaration of Conformity in accordance with Section 161 AktG as submitted jointly by the Management Board and Supervisory Board on December 19, 2023 is reprinted below. [All submitted declarations are published in the Investor Relations section of the Company's](https://ir.washtec.de/en/)  website at www.washtec.de.\n\n### *\"WashTec AG, Augsburg*\n\n### *Declaration of Conformity of December 19, 2023 under Section 161 AktG*\n\n*The Management Board and Supervisory Board submitted the last Declaration of Conformity on December 15, 2022.*\n\n*The Management Board and Supervisory Board hereby declare that since submission of the last Declaration of Conformity on December 15, 2022, WashTec AG has complied with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (the \"Code\") issued by the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code as amended on April 28, 2022, and will continue to comply with those recommendations in the future, with the following exceptions:*\n\n*In the first sentence of Recommendation G.10, the Code recommends predominantly share-based variable remuneration for the Management Board. The long-term variable remuneration under the Long Term Incentive Program (LTIP) contains significant share price-based components. These include the total shareholder return target weighted at 30% under the LTIP, which is used to assess the share price performance over the duration of the three-year incentive period. In light of this, the Management Board and Supervisory Board, as a purely precautionary measure, declare an exception from the first sentence of Code Recommendation G.10. It should be noted in this connection that the LTIP provides for the possibility, subject to fulfillment of specified conditions, of increasing the remuneration under the LTIP by up to a maximum of twofold by means of a corresponding personal investment in WashTec AG shares. This option provides a clear incentive for members of the Management Board to take a stake in the risks and rewards of the share price performance.*\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\n*Furthermore, the second sentence of Code Recommendation G.10 recommends that granted long-term variable remuneration amounts should be accessible to Management Board members only after a period of four years. The incentive period under the LTIP is three years and is based on the regular term of Management Board contracts, which is likewise three years. In view of this three-year cycle, the Management Board and the Supervisory Board consider a three-year period under the LTIP to be appropriate. Accordingly, the Supervisory Board and Management Board declare an exception from the second sentence of Code Recommendation G.10. The Code is complied with to the extent that one-sixth of the final cash award from the personal investment LTIP component is subject to an obligation to purchase shares with a three-year holding period.*\n\n*The remuneration system for the remuneration of members of the Management Board of WashTec AG adopted by the Supervisory Board in its meeting of March 24, 2021 and approved by the Annual General Meeting of WashTec AG of May 18, 2021 applies to all Management Board contracts entered into or renewed after the Annual General Meeting on May 18, 2021. The applicable LTIP 2021– 2023 for the Management Board, which includes a negative bonus/clawback arrangement, was adopted effective January 1, 2021 and applies to all members of the Management Board. This is intended to be retained in the subsequent LTIP 2024-2026. With regard to the Management Board contracts current at the time of the 2021 Annual General Meeting, these have continued or will continue to apply under the conditions there specified. Recommendations G.11 sentence 2 (retention and reclaiming of variable remuneration) and G.13 sentence 2 of the Code (severance payment taken into account against compensation payments in the event of a post-contractual non-compete clause) are not implemented in these Management Board contracts. This is due to the fact that the Management Board* \n\n*contracts current at the time of the 2021 Annual General Meeting were entered into on the basis of the previous remuneration system adopted by resolution of the Supervisory Board on December 19, 2019.*\n\n*The second sentence of Code Recommendation G.18 specifies that any performance-related remuneration for the Supervisory Board should be geared to the long-term development of the Company. The Supervisory Board of WashTec AG is granted annual performance-based remuneration under the Articles of Association and long-term performance-based remuneration in accordance with the resolution of the 2021 Annual General Meeting (\"Supervisory Board LTIP\"). The current Supervisory Board LTIP applies for the period January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The Management Board and the Supervisory Board are proceeding on the assumption that the recommendation will be complied with and, as a precautionary measure, declare that the maximum achievable cash award under the Supervisory Board LTIP, broken down pro rata for each year, will generally exceed the maximum achievable annual performance-based remuneration.*\n\n*Augsburg, December 19, 2023*\n\n*Management Board and Supervisory Board\"*\n\n*Further information about corporate governance can be found on the Internet at www.washtec.de.

As the Company's executive body, it is required to act in the Company's best interests, in furtherance of which it seeks to deliver sustained growth in shareholder value. It is responsible for establishing the principles of the Company's corporate policies in consultation with the Supervisory Board. The Management Board is also responsible for the strategic direction of the Company, the planning and setting of the Company's budget, the allocation of resources and the oversight of the business units. In addition, the Management Board is responsible for ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and with internal corporate guidelines or directives, and it works to ensure compliance by all Group companies. It reports to the Supervisory Board regularly, promptly and comprehensively on all issues of relevance to the Company and the Group relating to strategy and strategy implementation, planning, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows, compliance, risks and risk management.\n\nThe work of the Management Board is governed by rules of procedure for the Management Board, which are issued by the Supervisory Board. In particular, the rules of procedure define the portfolios of the members of the Management Board, specify the matters reserved for decision by the full Management Board, determine the matters requiring the approval of the Supervisory Board and establish the majority voting requirements for Management Board resolutions.\n\nThe members of the Management Board in the reporting period were Dr. Ralf Koeppe, Mr. Sebastian Kutz, Mr. Andreas Pabst and Mr. Stephan Weber.\n\nThe Management Board membership of Dr. Koeppe was terminated by mutual agreement on February 29, 2024. He will be succeeded by Mr. Michael Drolshagen, who the Supervisory Board has appointed as new the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) with effect from May 1, 2024.\n\n| Name                           | Period                            | Portfolio                                                                                                                                                         |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dr. Ralf Koeppe<br>(CEO & CTO) | January 1 to<br>December 31, 2023 | Corporate Culture, Communication and Philosophy, HR,<br>R&D, Supply Chain, Production, Quality, Sustainability,<br>AUWA-Chemie GmbH                               |\n| Sebastian Kutz (CSO)           | March 1 to<br>December 31, 2023   | Global Sales and Service, Key Account Management,<br>Marketing, Business Units/Product Management, Service<br>Support, WashTec Carwash Management GmbH            |\n| Andreas Pabst (CFO)            | January 1 to<br>December 31, 2023 | Finance/Controlling, IT, Procurement, Investor Relations,<br>Legal and Compliance, Risk Management, Internal Audit,<br>Insurance, WashTec Financial Services GmbH |\n| Stephan Weber (CSO)            | January 1 to<br>February 28, 2023 | Global Sales and Service, KAM/CWM, Marketing and<br>Product Units/Product Management                                                                              |\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Succession planning and diversity policy\n\nTogether with the Management Board, the Supervisory Board ensures that long-term succession planning is in place for the Management Board. The CEO and the Chairman of the Supervisory Board hold regular discussions on this topic as part of such planning. This issue is also regularly addressed by the Supervisory Board in its meetings. Long-term succession planning is based in particular on discussions between the Supervisory Board and the members of the Management Board and on contacts with senior executives of the Company. Terms of office and renewal options for current Management Board members are discussed along with potential successors.\n\nWashTec aims as a matter of policy for the composition of the Management Board to be based on qualification.\n\nThe Supervisory Board pays particular attention to diversity as part of the selection process for new Management Board members. In connection with filling vacancies on the Management Board, the Supervisory Board prepares a requirements profile and conducts interviews with suitable candidates. When making appointments to the Management Board, efforts are made to ensure that candidates have experience in the same or a similar industry. Based on this, the Supervisory Board decides on appointments to fill vacant Management Board positions taking into account the requirements profile and specific qualification requirements. Where necessary, the Supervisory Board and the Personnel Committee are assisted by external consultants in the preparation of requirements profiles and the selection of candidates.\n\nGiven suitable experience, people of all age groups can be members of the Management Board. In accordance with recommendation B.5 of the Code, the Supervisory Board has set a standard age limit of 65 for members of the Management Board. Information on targets [for the percentage of women on the Management Board is provided under heading 8.6 on](#page-105-0)  page 106.\n\n### 8.4 Supervisory Board\n\n### Supervisory Board procedures\n\nThe Supervisory Board of WashTec AG advises and monitors the Management Board in its management of the Company, including the management of the Group. Management Board decisions of major significance – for example, acquisitions, divestments and financing measures – are subject to Supervisory Board approval. The Supervisory Board regularly discusses business development and planning, as well as the Company's strategy and its implementation. The Supervisory Board reviews the Company's quarterly statements and half-year report and approves the annual financial statements of WashTec AG and the consolidated financial statements. As there is no resolution of the Annual General Meeting pursuant to Section 172 AktG, the annual financial statements of WashTec AG are adopted on approval by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board monitors the Company's compliance with the law, regulatory requirements and internal corporate guidelines. Its scope of responsibilities also includes appointing the members of the Management Board and defining their portfolios. In addition, the Supervisory Board adopts resolutions on, among other things, the remuneration system for the Management Board (cf. section 87a AktG), on the basis of which the specific remuneration of individual Management Board members is determined. The Supervisory Board submitted a revised remuneration system for members of the Management Board to the 2021 Annual General Meeting of WashTec AG for approval, which was granted by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe work of the Supervisory Board is governed by internal rules of procedure, in particular pertaining to the convocation and conduct of meetings, the adoption of resolutions and the [manner in which any conflicts of interest are handled. The rules of procedure are available](https://ir.washtec.de/en/corporate-governance/)  on the Company's website at: Rules of Procedure for the *Supervisory Board – WashTec AG.*\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-100-0\"></span>The Supervisory Board regularly reviews the efficiency of its work in a self-assessment. The self-assessment is based on a questionnaire that is regularly updated and revised in accordance with the requirements of the Code. The most recent self-assessment was carried out in the first quarter of 2023. The results of the assessment were also presented and discussed in depth in the first quarter of 2023. Those findings confirm a professional, constructive working relationship characterized by a high degree of trust and openness both within the Supervisory Board and in its dealings with the Management Board. A number of suggestions were also taken up and put into practice during the course of the year. No notable deficits were identified.\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board work closely together in the best interests of the Company. No conflicts of interest requiring disclosure to the Supervisory Board arose on the part of members of the Management Board or Supervisory Board. The independent advice and monitoring of the Management Board by the Supervisory Board has been and continues to be ensured at all times.\n\n### Composition of the Supervisory Board and of Supervisory Board committees\n\nIn accordance with the Articles of Association of WashTec AG, the Supervisory Board consists of six members elected by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Chairman of the Company's Supervisory Board, Dr. Günter Blaschke, notified the Company's Management Board on November 8, 2023 that he would be stepping down from the Supervisory Board effective December 31, 2023. The decision was made for personal reasons and by mutual agreement with the Supervisory Board and the Management Board.\n\nOn December 19, 2023, the Supervisory Board unanimously elected Ulrich Bellgardt – member of the Supervisory Board since 2014 and Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board – as the new Chairman of the Supervisory Board of WashTec AG effective January 1, 2024. Peter Wiedemann, member of the Supervisory Board since 2022, was elected as the new Deputy Chairman of the Company's Supervisory Board effective January 1, 2024.\n\nFollowing Dr. Blaschke's departure from the Supervisory Board, a resolution on the election of a new member of the Supervisory Board will be adopted at the 2024 Annual General Meeting on May 14, 2024.\n\nIn order to perform its duties efficiently and in accordance with the requirements of the Code, the Supervisory Board has established an Audit Committee, a Personnel Committee, a Nominating Committee, a Corporate Strategy and Sustainability Committee, a Sales Strategy Committee, and an Innovation and Production Committee.\n\n*Committee composition until December 31, 2023*\n\n|                                                     | Audit<br>Committee | Personnel<br>Committee | Nomination<br>Committee           | Innovation<br>and<br>Production<br>Committee | Sales<br>Committee          | Corporate<br>Strategy and<br>Sustainability<br>Committee |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dr. Günter Blaschke<br>(until December 31,<br>2023) |                    | C                      | C (until<br>November<br>13, 2023) | M                                            | C                           | M                                                        |\n| Ulrich Bellgardt                                    |                    | M                      | C (from<br>November<br>14, 2023)  | M                                            | M                           | C                                                        |\n| Dr. Hans Liebler                                    | M                  |                        | M                                 |                                              |                             |                                                          |\n| Heinrich von Portatius                              | M                  |                        |                                   |                                              | M (from<br>May 15,<br>2023) |                                                          |\n| Dr. Alexander Selent                                | C                  | M                      |                                   |                                              |                             | M                                                        |\n| Peter Wiedemann                                     |                    |                        | M                                 | C                                            |                             |                                                          |\n\n*C: Committee chairperson M: Committee member*\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *Committee membership from January 1, 2024*\n\n|                        | Audit<br>Committee | Personnel<br>Committee | Nomination<br>Committee | Innovation<br>and<br>Production<br>Committee | Sales<br>Strategy<br>Committee | Corporate<br>Strategy and<br>Sustainability<br>Committee |\n|------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Ulrich Bellgardt       |                    | C                      | C                       | M                                            | M                              | C                                                        |\n| Dr. Hans Liebler       | M                  |                        | M                       |                                              | M                              |                                                          |\n| Heinrich von Portatius | M                  | M                      |                         | M                                            | C                              |                                                          |\n| Dr. Alexander Selent   | C                  | M                      |                         |                                              |                                | M                                                        |\n| Peter Wiedemann        |                    |                        | M                       | C                                            |                                | M                                                        |\n\n*C: Committee chairperson M: Committee member*\n\nThe primary purpose of the committees is to prepare Supervisory Board meetings and resolutions for the plenary Supervisory Board. Their responsibilities are set out in detail in section 10 onwards of the Rules of Procedure for the Supervisory Board. Within the scope of the overall responsibility of the Supervisory Board, each member performs certain duties on the committees based on the member's expertise. The committee chairpersons each report regularly to the Supervisory Board on the work of the committees.\n\nThe membership of the Supervisory Board, meeting attendance and details of the Supervisory Board's work together with that of its committees in the reporting year are presented [in the Report of the Supervisory Board beginning on page 11.](#page-10-0)\n\nIn March 2022, taking into account the legal requirements and the recommendations of the Code, the Supervisory Board of WashTec AG adopted specific objectives for its composition, including a profile of skills and expertise and a diversity policy for the Supervisory Board.\n\n### Independence\n\nThe Supervisory Board is required to include what it considers to be an appropriate number of independent members within the meaning of the Code. For this purpose, more than half of the shareholder representatives are required to be independent from the company and the Management Board. If the company has a controlling shareholder, at least one of these shareholder representatives is also required to be independent from the controlling shareholder. The Chair of the Supervisory Board, the Chair of the Audit Committee, as well as the Chair of the Personnel Committee, are required to be independent from the company and the Management Board. The Chair of the Audit Committee is also required to be independent from any controlling shareholder.\n\n### Diversity policy\n\nDiversity contributes to a broad range of experience, perspectives, knowledge and skills within the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board therefore seeks to ensure sufficient diversity in terms of personality, gender, internationality, educational or professional background, expertise, experience and age distribution, taking particular account of the following criteria for its composition:\n\n- W The Supervisory Board as a whole is required to have a balanced age structure, including both younger professionals and older members with greater professional and life experience.\n- W In elections to the Supervisory Board, the aim is to ensure that, in addition to suitability in terms of personal and professional skills and expertise, the Supervisory Board includes both male and female members. The composition of the Supervisory Board must be based on the applicable legal requirements and on the target quotas established on the basis of the Act on Equal Participation of Women and Men in Leadership Positions (Führungspositionengesetz).\n- W The Supervisory Board is composed of individuals who, in addition to their personal and professional skills and expertise, preferably also have different educational and occupational backgrounds – such as engineering, business, law or the humanities.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe guiding principle for the composition of the Supervisory Board is to ensure professional monitoring and advice of the Management Board of WashTec AG. Its members as a whole are required to possess the knowledge, skills and professional expertise necessary to properly perform the duties of the Supervisory Board of WashTec AG as an internationally operating listed company in the mechanical engineering sector.\n\nCandidates proposed for election to the Supervisory Board are required to have the personality, knowledge and experience to properly perform the duties of a member of the Supervisory Board of WashTec AG as an internationally operating listed company in the mechanical engineering sector. Each member of the Supervisory Board is required to possess the integrity and independence of judgment to fulfill his or her responsibilities of oversight and control. For the purpose of advising and monitoring the Management Board, each member of the Supervisory Board is also required to have appropriate experience from management functions or to have otherwise acquired the necessary skills.\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board are each responsible for ensuring that they have sufficient time at their disposal to properly perform their duties. It is necessary to take into account in this connection that at least four ordinary Supervisory Board meetings are held each year, each of which requires adequate preparation, that sufficient time must be available for the review of the annual and consolidated financial statements, and that membership of one or more Supervisory Board committees requires additional time.\n\nSupervisory Board members are required to comply with the limit on the number of supervisory board offices held as recommended by the Code.\n\nThe normal age limit for membership of the Supervisory Board, as laid down in the rules of procedure for the Supervisory Board, is 75 years.\n\nThe Supervisory Board as a whole is required to possess all skills and expertise considered material in view of WashTec's activities. This includes, in particular, knowledge and experience in the following areas of expertise:\n\n| Area of expertise                                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Leadership experience/management                                         | Leadership/management experience through holding an executive<br>position or as a member of a supervisory board or similar body in<br>a (listed) company                                                                                                                 |\n| Technology and innovations (including<br>engineering and digitalization) | Knowledge and experience in the areas of technology and<br>innovations (including engineering and digitalization)                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Production, sales and marketing                                          | Knowledge and experience in the areas production, sales and<br>marketing                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Finance                                                                  | Knowledge and experience in the application of accounting<br>principles and the application of internal control procedures and<br>auditing                                                                                                                               |\n| Risk management and compliance                                           | Knowledge and experience in risk management and in the area of<br>general corporate compliance                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Human resources                                                          | Knowledge and experience in personnel leadership, personnel<br>management and personnel development                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Sustainability (ESG)                                                     | Knowledge and experienced of ESG factors and their significance<br>and of sustainability issues of importance to the WashTec Group,<br>and knowledge of corporate governance in listed companies<br>(German Corporate Governance Code, Market Abuse Regulation,<br>etc.) |\n| Internationality                                                         | Knowledge and experience (including non-native language skills)<br>in international business activities                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Capital market and investor relations                                    | Knowledge and experience (including non-native language skills)<br>in international business activities                                                                                                                                                                  |\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition, in view of the requirements in Section 100 (5) AktG, at least one member of the Supervisory Board must have expertise in the field of accounting and at least one other member of the Supervisory Board must have expertise in the field of auditing. According to the Code, the expertise in the field of accounting consists of special knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control and risk management systems, and the expertise in the field of auditing consists of special knowledge and experience in the auditing of financial statements. Accounting and auditing also include sustainability reporting and its audit and assurance. The chairman of the audit committee is required to have appropriate expertise in at least one of the two areas. The members as a whole must be familiar with the sector in which the company operates.\n\n### Implementation/composition of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board of WashTec AG in the reporting period was composed in accordance with its objectives and the above requirements. All members of the Supervisory Board in office in the reporting period have diverse professional and educational backgrounds, international experience and many years of management experience. The members as a whole are familiar with the sector in which the Company operates and have the knowledge, skills and experience that are material to WashTec. The expertise of the Supervisory Board and the Corporate Strategy and Sustainability Committee on sustainability issues relevant to the Company enables the Supervisory Board, in its monitoring and advisory capacity, to monitor the inclusion of environmental and social sustainability in corporate strategy and planning. Following Dr. Blaschke's departure from the Supervisory Board on December 31, 2023, the Supervisory Board will submit a nomination for the election of a new member of the Supervisory Board to the 2024 Annual General Meeting and will take the aforementioned objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board and the profile of skills and expertise for the entire Supervisory Board into account in that nomination.\n\nThe Supervisory Board and its Audit Committee each have at least one member with expertise in accounting in the person of Dr. Liebler and at least one additional member with expertise in auditing in the person of Dr. Selent. Dr. Selent, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, has expertise, special knowledge and experience in the fields of accounting and auditing, notably by virtue of his professional training as auditor and tax advisor and his many years of service as Chief Financial Officer of Fuchs Petrolub AG.\n\nDr. Liebler has special knowledge and experience in the field of accounting, in particular due to his academic qualifications and his many years as managing director of various international companies.\n\nDr. Selent and Dr. Liebler consequently qualify as financial experts within the meaning of Section 100 (5) AktG and Recommendation D.3 of the Code.\n\nIn addition, during the reporting period, the Supervisory Board had what it considers to be an appropriate number of independent members, as it considers all six members of the Supervisory Board to be independent within the meaning of the Code.\n\nBased on the requirements for members of the Supervisory Board, the following qualification matrix shows the expertise present and the status of implementation of the profile of skills and expertise and of the diversity policy as of December 31, 2023:\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                                             | Dr. Günter Blaschke                  | Ulrich

German Corporate Governance Code 2022*\n\n *Based on a self-assessment by the Supervisory Board (a check mark indicates at least good and in-depth knowledge, exceeding the minimum legal requirements for Supervisory Board members, on the basis of existing qualifications or acquired in the course of service as a Supervisory Board member, such as through many years of service on the Audit Committee or regular participation in professional development measures).*\n\nWhen selecting and nominating candidates for the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board and the Nomination Committee take into account, in addition to the requirements of the law and the Code, the above-mentioned objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board and strive to fulfill the profile of skills and expertise for the Supervisory Board as a whole. The selection process is also required to consider the diversity aspect at an early stage. The Supervisory Board's decision on election nominations to the Annual General Meeting is always based on the interests of the Company, taking into account all circumstances of the individual case.\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-105-0\"></span>8.5 Shareholders and the Annual General Meeting\n\nWashTec AG regularly provides detailed information on the Company's business development, financial position, financial performance and cash flows and on non-financial subject matter to its shareholders in the form of reporting, in individual discussions and at investor conferences.\n\nThe shareholders exercise their rights at the Annual General Meeting. The Annual General Meeting of WashTec AG is generally held in the second quarter of the year. The Annual General Meeting adopts resolutions regarding, among other things, the appropriation of distributable profit, ratification of the acts of the Management Board and Supervisory Board, and election of the auditor. Amendments to the Articles of Association and the granting of authorization to take measures that have the effect of changing the share capital are decided exclusively by resolution of the Annual General Meeting and implemented by the Management Board. Absent shareholders may have their voting rights exercised by proxies.\n\nWashTec AG held the Annual General Meeting in person in the 2023 reporting year. All documents of relevance to its Annual General Meeting were published online in German and in English. The WashTec AG website thus provides an information platform for both national and international investors, including with regard to the Annual General Meeting.\n\n### 8.6 Targets for the percentage of women on the Boards\n\nThe Supervisory Board is required to set targets for the percentage of women on the Company's Management Board and Supervisory Board, together with dates for their achievement. In the fiscal year 2018, the Supervisory Board set targets for the percentage of women in the Management Board and Supervisory Board, to be achieved by June 30, 2023. On July 26, 2018, the Supervisory Board resolved to set a target of at least 25% as the female quota for the Management Board. This target was not met by the June 30, 2023 target date. The reasons are as follows: Following the departure of Dr. Reden from the Management Board, there were no female members of the Management Board from September 1, 2022 onward. Based on this, in the Company's interests, the Supervisory Board decides on appointments to vacant Management Board positions taking into account the requirements profile and specific qualification requirements. When doing so, the Supervisory Board considers diversity in terms of factors such as age, gender and educational or professional background. In appointing the current members of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board decided on the basis of a careful and structured selection process on the best candidates for each position.\n\nOn July 26, 2018, the Supervisory Board resolved to set a target of 0% as the female quota for the Supervisory Board for the period until June 30, 2023. This decision was intended to create the greatest possible flexibility for constituting the Board on the basis of qualification. There were no women members of the Supervisory Board as of the June 30, 2023 target date.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, the Supervisory Board set new targets for the number of women on the Management Board and Supervisory Board from July 1, 2023 for achievement by June 30, 2028. The Supervisory Board has set the target figure for the number of women on the Management Board at zero (0) and the target figure for the number of women on the Supervisory Board at one (1) person.\n\nThe Supervisory Board's reasoning for setting the target for the Management Board in this way was as follows: The setting of a target of zero for the Management Board is intended to retain the greatest possible flexibility for constituting the Management Board on the basis of qualification. The Supervisory Board decides on appointments to Management Board positions in the interests of the Company based on qualifications, experience and professional and personal suitability. The Supervisory Board pays particular attention to diversity as part of the selection process for new Management Board members. Elements of the diversity policy with regard to the composition of the Management Board include factors such as\n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\nage, educational and professional background and gender. In the interests of maximum flexibility, however, no priority is to be given to gender in future appointments to the Management Board. With the Management Board in its new composition since last year, WashTec AG has a highly motivated and dynamic management team. Accordingly, in the interest of future-oriented and sustainable management of the Company and of confidence in the current composition of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board does not wish to send out the wrong signals by setting a higher target, nor does it wish by setting such a target to commit itself in advance – or give the impression of committing itself in advance – with regard to its appointment decisions for the next five years. The Supervisory Board's decision on appointments to Management Board positions will always continue to be based on the interests of the Company, taking into account all circumstances of the individual case.\n\nIrrespective of the statutory targets for the percentage of women on the Management Board and Management Board and Supervisory Board, the WashTec Group attaches great importance to equal treatment, equal opportunities and diversity in when filling management positions and all other positions in the Company. In particular, the goal of further promoting the percentage of women in leadership positions within the WashTec Group continues to apply for the future.\n\nThe Management Board considers diversity when making appointments to executive positions. In fiscal year 2022, the Management Board of WashTec AG set itself the goal of further promoting the percentage of women in leadership positions within the WashTec Group and decided to set a voluntary female quota for one management level across the entire Group. The target is 18% (equivalent to 32 people); the date for achievement of the target is June 30, 2027. The need to set targets for the percentage of women at levels of management within WashTec AG does not arise, because WashTec AG as the Group parent has no such levels due to the very small number of employees.\n\n### 8.7 Corporate governance practices\n\n### Transparency and communication\n\nProviding comprehensive and timely information to shareholders and stakeholders is a high priority for WashTec. WashTec reports on its business situation and its results of operations through financial reporting, the annual press conference and conference calls. Once annually, WashTec voluntarily publishes a comprehensive sustainability report, which is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website, www.washtec.de. WashTec also publishes press releases and ad-hoc disclosures. All notices and disclosures, the Articles of Association of WashTec AG, all Declarations of Conformity and further documents concerning corporate governance (such as the WashTec Code of Conduct) are available for downloading from the [Investor Relations section of the Company's website, www.washtec.de.](https://ir.washtec.de/en/) \n\nUnder Article 19 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board, as well as persons closely associated with them, are required to disclose any purchase or sale of securities in WashTec AG or of related financial instruments once the purchase and sale transactions reach a total amount of €20,000 within a calendar year. The reportable securities transactions reported to WashTec AG in the reporting period (managers' transactions) have been duly published and are available in the [Investor Relations section of the Company's website, www.washtec.de under News –](https://ir.washtec.de/en/news/)  Managers' Transactions.\n\n### Compliance\n\nWashTec has established a Group-wide compliance organization to ensure that all relevant requirements are observed. The compliance organization is subject to continuous development and improvement. The Management Board and Supervisory Board regard the compliance organization as a major element of WashTec's management and control structure. Detailed reporting on compliance is thus a regular subject of meetings of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee. A detailed compliance report is also prepared each year.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\nStatements Further Information\n\nThe strategic guidelines and the WashTec AG Code of Conduct form the basis of the Company's compliance program. The Code of Conduct was thoroughly revised in the reporting year. It contains binding rules on legally compliant conduct as well as precise directions on matters such as compliance with competition law and anti-corruption law, handling donations, avoiding conflicts of interests, complying with the prohibition on insider trading, and protecting the Company's assets, as well as requirements for the protection of human and environmental rights within the meaning of the German Supply Chain Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz). The Code of Conduct is binding for all employees of the WashTec Group worldwide and for the members of the Management Board. It is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect social and regulatory changes.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board observe the rules to the extent that they apply to them. All WashTec Group managers and employees in sensitive areas such as Sales, Procurement, Human Resources and Finance receive regular online training on the Code of Conduct, with a concluding test and certification. Regular online training, likewise with a concluding test, is also provided on the General Data Protection Regulation, especially for new employees. As part of the compliance system, a whistleblower system in place since 2016 allows employees and others to raise concerns – anonymously if they prefer – and flag circumstances that may indicate a violation of the law or Company policies. This has also been updated in connection with the changes in the law. Any such indications are investigated and action taken as appropriate if grounds for suspicion or violations are identified. [The WashTec Group Grievance and Reporting Procedure is available in the Investor Rela](https://ir.washtec.de/en/corporate-governance/)tions – Corporate Governance section of the Company website, www.washtec.de.\n\nThe insider list to be drawn up under Article 18 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 is updated in accordance with the law. The individuals recorded in the insider list are informed of the duties entailed.\n\n### Opportunities and risk management\n\nResponsible management of opportunities and risks is part of good corporate governance. The Management Board has established an internal control system and risk management system that is appropriate and effective having due regard to the scope of the Company's business activities and its risk situation. The Management Board and the Supervisory Board regularly discuss existing opportunities and risks, their development and action to be taken. The internal control system and the risk management system are subject to continuous de[velopment and adaptation to changing conditions. Details are presented in the opportunities](#page-81-0)  and risk report starting on page 82.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Augsburg, March 22, 2024\n\nSebastian Kutz CSO/Member of the Management Board\n\nAndreas Pabst CFO/Member of the Management Board\n\nImage /page/108/Picture/7 description: A close-up shot captures a car undergoing a wash, with soap and water cascading over its surface.

Statements of WashTec AG (IFRS) for Fiscal Year 2023\n\n### General\n\n### 1. General information on the Group\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the WashTec Group for the fiscal year January 1 to December 31, 2023 were prepared and submitted to the Supervisory Board for review on March 22, 2024. They were approved at the Supervisory Board meeting on March 25, 2024 and subsequently released for publication by the Management Board. The consolidated financial statements and Group Management Report may be accessed via the [Bundesanzeiger \\(Federal Gazette\\) and the Unternehmensregister \\(Company Register\\)](https://ir.washtec.de/en/financial_reports/)  and downloaded from our website at https://ir.washtec.de/en/financial\\_reports/.\n\nThe ultimate parent company of the WashTec Group is WashTec AG, which is entered in the commercial register of the Local Court of the City of Augsburg, Germany, under registration number HRB 81.\n\nThe Company's registered office is located at Argonstrasse 7, 86153 Augsburg, Germany.\n\nThe Company's shares are in free float and are listed on the Open Market in the Prime Standard segment of Frankfurt stock exchange.\n\nThe purpose of the WashTec Group comprises the development, manufacture, sale and servicing of carwash products and washing chemicals, as well as leasing and all related services and financing solutions required in order to operate carwash equipment.\n\n### 2. Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of WashTec AG have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in force as of the balance sheet date together with the interpretations of the IFRS IC (IFRIC). They comply with the accounting standards applicable in the European Union for fiscal year 2023 and are also supplemented by additional information required under section 315e of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, or HGB) and by the Group Management Report.\n\nThe requirements under section 315e HGB are met, exempting the Company from the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with German commercial law.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis except with respect to non-current trade receivables, share-based payment and derivative financial instruments, which are measured at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros. Unless otherwise indicated, all figures are rounded to the nearest thousand (€k); this may result in rounding differences. The fiscal year is the calendar year.\n\nThe WashTec Group's business development in fiscal year 2023 was influenced by the macroeconomic environment. Persistently high interest rates resulted in higher interest expenses on drawn credit lines. The WashTec Group therefore used derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk in the reporting year. In addition, the higher level of interest rates compared to the prior year was taken into account accordingly when determining the discount rates for non-current balance sheet items and the measurement parameters used in goodwill impairment testing. Impairment testing did not reveal any need for adjustment in the reporting period.\n\nClimate-related issues affect the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the WashTec Group as follows:\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\n- <span id=\"page-117-0\"></span>W Measures by the Company to reduce carbon emissions in Germany focus on capital expenditure on electric charging infrastructure, energy efficiency improvements in heating systems and the purchase of green electricity for production sites. In addition, the Company has adopted the target of making fleet operations in Germany 100% carbon-neutral by 2030.\n- W The property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of relevance for replacement investment are fully depreciated or amortized as of fiscal year 2023. Consequently, there is currently no indication of any impact on useful lives or residual values.\n- W With regard to the recoverability of inventories, order-based production and procurement make it possible to minimize any impairment risks going beyond those arising in the normal course of business.\n- W It is not currently necessary to recognize provisions for environmental or asset retirement obligations or to recognize contingent liabilities or contingent assets due to climate-related obligations.\n- W All climate-related factors that could affect value in use have been assessed in goodwill impairment testing. The impairment testing included possible impacts on the WashTec Group's business model and sales markets, changes in the regulatory environment and changes in the intended use of assets due to climate-induced obligations. This did not reveal any need for adjustment in the reporting period.\n- W Overall, no significant impacts on the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the WashTec Group were identified on the basis of estimates, assumptions or judgments.\n\n### 3. Basis of consolidation and consolidated group\n\n### Basis of consolidation\n\n The The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of WashTec AG and its subsidiaries as of December 31 of each fiscal year. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as those of the parent company, using uniform accounting policies.\n\n Subsidiaries are fully consolidated as of the acquisition date, which is the date when the Group obtains control. WashTec AG controls an investee from the point in time when WashTec AG is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Subsidiaries cease to be consolidated when the parent company no longer has control.\n\n All intragroup balances, transactions, income, expenses as well as unrealized gains and losses resulting from intragroup transactions are eliminated in full.\n\n### Consolidated group\n\nIn addition to the parent company, the consolidated financial statements of WashTec AG also contain the following group entities as of December 31, 2023 (shareholdings in accordance with 315e in conjunction with section 313 (2) HGB). Figures for companies in Germany are based on annual financial statements prepared in accordance with German commercial law; for foreign companies they are generally based on IFRS financial statements before consolidation.\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Consolidated entities as of December 31, 2023                            | Shareholding in % | Parent | Business

Limited was established on June 23, 2023 as a subsidiary of WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH, with 100% of the voting rights, in order to commence direct sales and service activities in New Zealand. The New Zealand subsidiary was consequently consolidated for the first time in fiscal year 2023.\n\nWashTec New Zealand Limited took over the assets and liabilities of the previously independent New Zealand sales partner, Car Kleen New Zealand Ltd. as of December 1, 2023. This investment in the New Zealand market is intended to reinforce the WashTec Group's presence in the Asia/Pacific region and strengthen cooperation with local customers.\n\nThe purchase price for the acquisition was €1,624k. Of this amount, €797k was paid by the December 31, 2023 reporting date. Payment of the balance is subject to the satisfaction of certain contractual conditions and is expected to be made in the first half of 2024. Incidental acquisition costs were not material and were accounted for in other expenses in the income statement.\n\nThe acquired net assets were measured at a fair value of €649k, resulting in goodwill of €974k. The goodwill mainly relates to the expected synergies based on Car Kleen New Zealand Ltd.'s proven track record in vehicle wash technology and the team's many years of experience.\n\nThe following table shows the assets and liabilities recognized at the acquisition date:\n\n| in €k                                              | Fair value |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Non-current assets (including right-of-use assets) | 642        |\n| Receivables and other assets                       | 340        |\n| Inventories                                        | 607        |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                          | 28         |\n| Assets acquired                                    | 1,617      |\n| Liabilities and provisions                         | 647        |\n| Contract liabilities                               | 322        |\n| Liabilities assumed                                | 969        |\n| Net assets                                         | 649        |\n| Goodwill                                           | 974        |\n| Consideration                                      | 1,624      |\n\nThe fair value of the acquired trade receivables was €335k at the acquisition date. This corresponds to the gross amount of the trade receivables. No impairment was recognized at the acquisition date.\n\nConsolidated net income as of December 31, 2023 includes revenue of €310k and net income of €44k.\n\nHad the acquisition been made as of January 1, 2023, revenue of €3,969k and net income of €379k would have contributed to the consolidated net income of the WashTec Group in fiscal year 2023.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs of December 14, 2023, WashTec sold 90% of the shares in its Chinese subsidiary, WashTec Car Cleaning Equipment (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., to the existing management. The sale was registered by the competent authorities in China effective December 19, 2023. It took place as part of a strategic realignment by the WashTec Group in the Chinese market, which will now continue to be developed as a distributor market. This will ensure the best possible market position for the future while maintaining and further intensifying longstanding customer relationships. WashTec will retain a 10% stake in the company.\n\n€–504k was recognized as expense in the consolidated income statement in connection with the deconsolidation of the Chinese subsidiary. The sale of the subsidiary resulted in a disposal of assets in the amount of €2,764k, mainly comprising inventories and trade receivables. It also resulted in the disposal of €2,107k in liabilities, mainly to suppliers and employees.\n\nUp to the deconsolidation date, revenue of €6,446k and operating profit (EBIT) of €–738k were recognized in the consolidated income statement of the WashTec Group in 2023.\n\n### 4. Effects of new financial reporting standards\n\nNew or amended financial reporting standards entered into force in the reporting period.

Initial application of the standards is planned when they are recognized and endorsed by the European Union.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-121-0\"></span>\n\n| Standards | and | amendments not yet applied |\n|-----------|-----|----------------------------|\n|-----------|-----|----------------------------|\n\n| Standard/<br>inter-<br>pretation | Title                                                                            | Mandatory<br>application | EU<br>endorse-<br>ment  | Material effects on the<br>Group |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| IAS 1                            | Amendments to IAS 1 – Classification of<br>Liabilities as Current or Non-Current | January 1,<br>2024       | December<br>20, 2023    | None                             |\n| IAS 1                            | Amendments to IAS 1 – Non-current Liabilities<br>with Covenants                  | January 1,<br>2024       | December<br>20, 2023    | None                             |\n| IFRS 16                          | Amendments to IFRS 16 – Lease Liability in a<br>Sale and Leaseback               | January 1,<br>2024       | November<br>21, 2023    | None                             |\n| IAS 7                            | Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 – Supplier<br>Finance Agreements                  | January 1,<br>2024       | Yet to be<br>determined | None                             |\n| IAS 21                           | Amendments to IAS 21 – Lack of Exchangeab-<br>ility                              | January 1,<br>2025       | Yet to be<br>determined | None                             |\n\n### 5. Accounting policies\n\nThe adopted accounting policies are (unless otherwise specified below) consistent with those applied in prior years. For the accounting policies applied in the prior year, please see the prior-year Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n### Currency translation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, the euro being the Group's functional and reporting currency.\n\nForeign currency annual financial statements of subsidiaries are translated by applying the functional currency approach. The functional currency of a foreign company is normally its national currency. The items in the separate financial statements of each entity are measured in the entity's functional currency.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the reporting date exchange rate. All exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss with the exception of exchange differences relating to net investments in a foreign operation and adjustment items for currency translation. These are recognized in other comprehensive income until disposal of the net investment, when they are recognized as income or expense in the period. Deferred taxes arising from such exchange differences are likewise recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nNon-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the transaction date. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured. Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of resulting assets and liabilities are accounted for as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the reporting date exchange rate.\n\nAssets and liabilities of subsidiaries that do not report in euros are translated at the reporting date exchange rate, and their income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the fiscal year. Resulting exchange differences are accounted for separately in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount recognized in other comprehensive income relating to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item when the cost is incurred, if the recognition criteria are met. In addition to directly attributable costs, the cost of self-constructed assets also includes an allocation of material and production overheads and depreciation. Repair and maintenance costs are immediately recognized in profit or loss. Depreciation is applied pro rata temporis on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is mostly depreciated using the following useful lives:\n\n| Property, plant and equipment      | Useful life    |\n|------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Buildings                          | 20 to 50 years |\n| Technical plant and machinery      | 5 to 14 years  |\n| Other plant, fixtures and fittings | 3 to 8 years   |\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising from derecognition (measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in profit or loss when the item is derecognized. At the end of each fiscal year, an asset's residual value, useful life and method of depreciation are reviewed and, if necessary, adjusted.\n\n### Business combinations and goodwill\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. For this purpose, the cost of the acquisition is determined as the fair value of the consideration transferred, meaning the sum of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are normally accounted for as expense.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost. It is measured as the excess of the cost of the business combination over the acquirer's share in the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. It is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, from the acquisition date, to the Group's cash generating units (segments) that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination.\n\n### Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets mainly comprise acquired patents, technologies, capitalized development costs, licenses and software.\n\n| Intangible assets                 | Useful life  |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------|\n| Acquired patents and technologies | 8 years      |\n| Licenses and software             | 3 to 8 years |\n| Capitalized development costs     | 6 to 8 years |\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\nIntangible assets not acquired in a business combination are measured at cost on initial recognition and subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated amortization and impairment losses.\n\nA distinction is made between intangible assets with finite useful lives and those with indefinite useful lives. In the reporting period, the Group exclusively held assets with finite useful lives.\n\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their economic useful life. The amortization period and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each fiscal year and adjusted accordingly if expectations have changed. There were no changes in fiscal year 2023.\n\nInternally generated intangible assets (research and development costs)\n\nResearch costs are recognized as expense in the period in which they are incurred. Development costs for a given project comprise all directly attributable costs (mainly personnel expenses) as well as allocated overheads. They are capitalized as an intangible asset only if the asset can be identified, a future economic benefit is expected and the cost can be measured reliably during development. In addition, development costs are only capitalized if completion of development and subsequent use or sale are technically and financially feasible and intended.\n\nAfter initial recognition of development costs as an asset, the cost model is applied, meaning that the asset is carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization begins when development is complete and the\n\nasset is available for use. The asset is amortized over the period of the expected future economic benefits. During the development phase, when the useful life is indefinite, the asset is tested annually for impairment.\n\n### Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAssets with a finite useful life are tested as of each balance sheet date for indications of impairment. If there is such an indication, the Group estimates the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is fair value less costs of disposal or value in use, whichever is higher. Value in use is determined by applying an appropriate valuation model. For this purpose, the expected future cash flows are discounted to present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects market expectations concerning the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Recoverable amount is estimated for each individual asset or, if it cannot be estimated for an asset, for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. An impairment loss recognized in earlier reporting periods is reversed to income if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The increased carrying amount may not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized in the past. Impairment reversals are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nIntangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are tested for impairment annually and if there are events or circumstances that indicate that an asset may be impaired.\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\nGoodwill is tested for any impairment by estimating the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated. The Group's cash generating units correspond to the operating segments identified in accordance with IFRS 8. These are divided into the regions Europe, North America and Asia/Pacific.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. Impairment losses recognized for goodwill cannot be reversed in subsequent reporting periods. The Group performs annual impairment testing of goodwill after completing the budgeting process.\n\n### Financial instruments\n\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Initial recognition takes place when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.\n\nAll regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are accounted for at the trade date, which is the date when the Group commits itself to purchase or sell the asset. Regular way purchases or sales require delivery of the asset within the timeframe established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.\n\n### Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets primarily comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, derivatives with a positive market value and other financial assets.\n\nFinancial assets are classified as at amortized cost (AC), at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVthOCI) or at fair value through profit or loss (FVthP/L). They are categorized on initial recognition on the basis of the company's business model for managing financial assets and of the contractual cash flow characteristics of each financial asset, and are measured at fair value. Financial assets not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset.\n\n### Financial assets at amortized cost (AC):\n\nThis category comprises financial assets held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows where the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. After initial recognition, the financial assets are measured at amortized cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Receivables with a significant financing component are discounted at current market interest rates if the effect is material. Such receivables are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less any accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on derecognition or impairment of the financial assets are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and bank balances that have a term of less than three months from the date of acquisition and are carried at face value. For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash funds consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above plus any utilized bank overdrafts.\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVthOCI): This category comprises financial assets held within a business model whose objective is both to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets where the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nAfter initial recognition, these are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVthP/L):\n\nFinancial assets not measured at amortized cost (AC) or at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVthOCI), and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments for which hedge accounting is applied, are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVthP/L). In addition, financial assets can be voluntarily designated in certain circumstances as at fair value through profit or loss (FVthP/L). The Group does not currently make use of this option. All changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss.\n\n### Impairment of financial assets:\n\nThe Group tests financial assets, and groups of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, for impairment as of each balance sheet date.\n\nA risk allowance is normally recognized on the basis of the general approach using a three-stage model in relation to changes in the default risk on a financial asset. On initial recognition, all financial assets are normally classified in stage 1 and their 12-month expected credit loss determined. If the credit risk on a financial asset has significantly increased since the previous reporting date, the asset is transferred to stage 2. WashTec assumes a significant increase in credit risk if the financial asset is more than 30 days past due. Where there is additionally objective evidence of impairment, a financial asset is transferred to stage 3. Objective evidence of impairment includes the initiation of legal action and receivables past due by more than one year. In stage 2 and 3, the risk allowance is recognized in the amount of the lifetime expected credit losses.\n\nImpairment losses on trade receivables without a significant financing component are accounted for using the simplified approach. In addition, an entity can likewise elect to apply the simplified approach to trade receivables with a significant financing component. For this purpose, the risk allowance is recognized in the amount of the lifetime expected credit losses. The Group makes use of this election for trade receivables with a significant financing component and calculates the impairment losses on the basis of an impairment table.\n\nTrade receivables have similar credit risk characteristics. For the measurement of lifetime expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on days past due. The impairment rates are based on credit loss rates over the past three years and are adjusted for forward-looking macroeconomic factors affecting customer solvency.\n\nThe risk allowance for other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents is recognized using the general approach. Expected credit losses on other financial assets and on cash and cash equivalents are immaterial and are not recognized.\n\n### Derecognition of financial assets:\n\nA financial asset (or a part of a financial asset or a part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognized when contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the financial asset is transferred and the transfer meets the criteria for derecognition under IFRS 9. In the event of objective evidence that a receivable is impaired, an impairment loss is recognized. If a receivable is classified as uncollectible, it is derecognized.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Financial liabilities\n\nThe financial liabilities mainly comprise liabilities to credit institutions, trade payables, derivatives with a negative market value and other financial liabilities. Financial liabilities are classified as non-current if their remaining term is more than twelve months; they are classified as current if their remaining term is less than twelve months.\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as at amortized cost (FLAC) or at fair value through profit or loss (FVthP/L).\n\nFinancial liabilities are normally initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost (FLAC) using the effective interest method. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, derivatives with a negative market value and financial liabilities designated on initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVthP/L). Financial liabilities not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss are initially measured at fair value less transaction costs.\n\n### Derecognition of financial liabilities:\n\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, canceled or expires.\n\n### Derivative financial instruments and hedging\n\nThe WashTec Group used derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk in the reporting year. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized and subsequently measured at fair value and, according to their market value, are accounted for as other financial assets or other financial liabilities. Changes in fair value are accounted for according to whether a derivative financial instrument is designated in an effective hedge. Derivatives without hedge accounting are recognized through profit or loss (FVthP/L).\n\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument is accounted for in full in other non-current financial assets or other non-current financial liabilities if the remaining term of the derivative is more than twelve months. It is accounted for in full in other current financial assets or other current financial liabilities if the remaining term of the derivative is less than twelve months.\n\nAt the inception of a hedging relationship, both the hedging relationship and the Group's risk management objectives and strategies with regard to the hedge are formally designated and documented. The documentation includes the identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the hedged risk and how the entity assesses whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including an analysis of the reasons for any hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined).\n\nA hedging relationship meets all hedge effectiveness requirements if there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship and the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Cash flow hedges\n\nA cash flow hedge is the hedge of exposure to variability to cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with all, or a component of, a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction and could affect profit or loss.\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges is recognized in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in profit or loss. The amounts recognized in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the period during which the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when hedged financial income or expense is recognized or a forecast sale occurs.\n\nIf a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or if the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred amounts at that time remain in equity for as long as the hedged item continues to exist. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative amounts recognized in equity are reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n### Net investments in foreign operations\n\nA monetary item in the form of an outstanding receivable from a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely is a part of the net investment in that foreign operation. Such monetary items are non-current receivables from foreign subsidiaries of the Group. Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognized in profit or loss in the separate financial statements of the subsidiary. In the consolidated financial statements, such exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the subsidiary.\n\n### Inventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated proceeds from a sale in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\nThe cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies is determined on a rolling average basis. The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes directly attributable costs as well as a reasonable allocation of material and production overheads on the basis of normal capacity utilization. Borrowing costs are not included in the cost of inventories.\n\n### Treasury shares\n\nThe cost of any treasury shares purchased by WashTec AG is accounted for as a single adjustment in equity. Purchases, sales and retirements of treasury shares are not recognized in profit or loss.\n\n### Provisions\n\n### Other provisions\n\nOther provisions are recognized for all legal or constructive obligations to third parties as of the balance sheet date whose timing or amount is uncertain. They are measured at the present value of the best estimate of the expenditures required to settle the obligations. If the Group expects reimbursement of some or all of a provision (such as through an insurance policy), the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset if it is virtually certain. Non-current provisions are discounted at current pre-tax market rates if the effect is material. The effect of the time value of money is accounted for in the financial result. Provisions are normally reversed to the same item in the income statement for which they were recognized.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\nProvisions for pensions are measured using the projected unit credit method (IAS 19 revised). This takes into account the pensions known and vested as of the balance sheet date as well as expected future increases in salaries and pensions. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in their entirety in other comprehensive income net [of deferred taxes. Service cost and interest are accounted for in](#page-151-0) the operating result. For further details, please see Note 26.\n\n### Provisions for partial retirement arrangements\n\nPartial retirement arrangements are primarily based on the block model. They result in two types of obligations that are measured at present value in accordance with actuarial principles and are accounted for separately: The first type of obligation relates to the accumulated outstanding settlement amount, which is recognized pro rata over the active/working phase. The accumulated outstanding settlement amount is based on the difference between the compensation earned by an employee prior to the partial retirement arrangement (including the employer's share of social security contributions) and the compensation for the part-time employment (including the employer's share of social security contributions, but not including top-up payments). The second type of obligation relates to the employer's obligation to pay the top-up payments plus an additional amount towards statutory pension insurance. In accordance with IAS 19 (revised), this is recognized as a provision pro rata over the working phase.\n\n### Share-based payment\n\nIFRS 2 distinguishes between equity-settled share-based payments and cash-settled share-based payments. For their service, the Management Board and Supervisory Board of WashTec AG receive cash-settled share-based remuneration comprising both components.\n\nIn the case of cash-settled share-based remuneration, the resulting liability is recognized at fair value through profit or loss over the period of time in which the service is performed. Fair value is estimated using a suitable option price model. Conditions relating to the WashTec AG share price (market conditions) are included in measurement. Performance-related exercise conditions are also included. The equity-settled sharebased payment component is recognized directly in equity. Obligations from cash-settled share-based payment are recognized in other liabilities at fair value taking into account the remaining duration of the progr[am. Please see Note 37 for further details.](#page-165-0) \n\n### Leases\n\nA lease is a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an asset (the underlying asset) for a certain period of time in exchange for consideration. For all leases, the Group normally recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for the lease payments. Leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at present value from the time the underlying asset is made available to the Group.\n\nLease liabilities comprise fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate and are initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date, amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase option if it is reasonably certain to be exercised and payments of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.\n\nLease payments are discounted at the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. The lessee's incremental borrowing rate is determined over various maturities on the basis of a riskfree interest rate plus a margin and a country-specific risk premium. Each lease payment is separated into principal and interest components. The interest expense is recognized in profit or loss in each period over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease liability.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee and the estimated cost relating to dismantling obligations.\n\nMost leases are entered into for fixed terms of one to three years. Some leases of office and warehouse buildings are for longer terms. Leases may also include implicit extensions or extension and termination options. The Group makes use of such arrangements to obtain maximum operational flexibility. Either party can exercise the existing extension and termination options. The notice periods agreed for the termination options are sufficient for alternatives to be found in good time where necessary.\n\nWhen determining the lease term for buildings, Management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise any options to extend or not to exercise any option to terminate. The main factors considered are the terms, satisfaction with the working relationship with the lessor and logistical considerations in connection with the Group's forward strategy. If the Group is satisfied with the working relationship and these factors are also expected to be compatible with the corporate strategy looking ahead, it is considered reasonably certain that the leases will be extended/not terminated. Changes in the lease term due to the exercise of options to extend or options to terminate are only included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain that the option to extend will be exercised or the option to terminate will not be exercised.\n\nThis is reassessed upon the occurrence of any significant event or any significant change in circumstances that affects the previous assessment and is in the control of the lessee. Lease terms are negotiated individually and include a large variety of different conditions.\n\nIn the subsequent measurement of lease liabilities, the carrying amount is increased by the interest expense for the lease liability and reduced by the lease payments made. For potential future increases in variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, the lease liability and the right-of-use asset are remeasured when the adjustment to the lease payments takes effect.\n\nRight-of-use assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of useful life and lease term. If a purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised, they are depreciated over the useful life of the asset underlying the lease.\n\nIn the case of leases that include an extension or termination option, the lease liability is remeasured and the right-of-use asset adjusted if a significant event or significant change in circumstances occurs that is within the Group's control and was assessed differently on initial measurement.\n\nThe Group makes use of the exemptions for short-term leases and for leases of lowvalue assets that are not short-term leases and recognizes their lease payments on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. In addition, the provisions of IFRS 16 are not applied to leases of intangible assets.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn order to provide customers, and in particular large operator groups or oil companies, with equipment as part of the carwash management business in return for compensation based on the number of washes, equipment manufactured by WashTec is sold to a leasing company and repurchased under sale and leaseback transactions or hire purchase agreements. For these transactions, a right-of-use asset and a lease liability are recognized for the equipment concerned. No revenue is recognized from the sale of the equipment. Under the contracts with the customers, revenue is realized on the basis of the number of washes and the right-of-use asset is depreciated.\n\n≡\n\n[Please refer to Notes 10,](#page-138-0) [15 a](#page-142-0)n[d 29 f](#page-154-0)or information on right-of-use assets, lease liabilities, depreciation and interest expense.\n\n### Contract liabilities\n\nPerformance obligations that are satisfied over time are recognized as contract liabilities in the balance sheet (see also Revenue Recognition). The items presented as contract liabilities in the Group are prepayments on orders and deferred income, which mostly relate to full maintenance, extended guarantees and prepaid service agreements.\n\n### Income taxes\n\nThe current income tax charge is calculated for the consolidated financial statements on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where subsidiaries operate and generate taxable net income. For recognized tax provisions, the expected tax payment is used as a best estimate. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to\n\napply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Current and deferred taxes are recognized in profit or loss unless tax relates to transactions that are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences at consolidated entities between IFRS-basis carrying amounts of assets or liabilities and their tax base and for consolidation adjustments in profit or loss.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are not recognized for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred taxes are also not recognized for temporary differences if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which at the time of the transaction affects neither IFRS-basis accounting profit (before income taxes) nor taxable profit and which is not a business combination. Deferred taxes are recognized for transactions in which equal deductible and taxable temporary differences arise.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries unless the entity holding the investment is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future (\"outside basis differences\").\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if, and only if, there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority.\n\n### Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue is recognized when a performance obligation has been satisfied by transfer of a promised good or promised service (i.e., an asset) to a customer. An asset is transferred when the customer obtains control of the asset.\n\nPerformance obligations from the sale of equipment, accessories, merchandise and services are satisfied at a point in time when the promised asset has been transferred and/or the customer has obtained control of the asset. This is normally the case when finished goods or merchandise are delivered, sent or collected and when equipment is installed. The payment period usually granted is 30 days.\n\nFor financing components, the Group makes use of the practical expedient of not taking into account the effects of a financing component if the period between when the goods or services are transferred and when the customer pays for them is one year or less or if the financing component is not material in both absolute and relative terms.\n\nPerformance obligations mainly arising from full maintenance agreements, extended guarantees and prepaid service agreements are satisfied over time and accounted for as contract liabilities. The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by performance as it is performed. The WashTec Group determines progress towards completion using an output method based on elapsed time. Satisfaction of performance obligations is dependent on contract terms and is usually on a monthly basis. This provides a faithful depiction of the output. The revenue is recognized and billed when the performance obligation is satisfied. Contract liabilities are reversed to profit or loss accordingly. The payment period usually granted is 30 days, although some service agreements are prepaid.\n\nRevenue from the carwash management business is not recognized until a carwash is completed. This also applies if a carwash is first sold to an independent leasing company.\n\nWashTec also sells equipment to leasing companies that lease it on to customers. This revenue is recognized at the time of the sale. In rare cases, these transactions include contracts containing repurchase agreements and WashTec must repurchase the equipment at the customer's request. Revenue from the sale of the equipment is recognized in such cases in the amount of the service performed, meaning that revenue is reduced by the amount of the right of return. Additionally, a corresponding adjustment is made to the cost of the service performed, which is accounted for in other current financial assets in the amount of the net investment in the lease.\n\nThe amount recognized as revenue corresponds to the transaction price and comprises the consideration that the WashTec Group is expected to receive in exchange for the transfer of the promised goods or services to a customer. It does not include value added tax or sales tax. Deductions such as rebates, discounts and bulk discounts are accounted for as variable consideration in determination of the transaction price if it is highly probable that the revenue will not be reversed. They are estimated on the basis of expected value. Bulk discounts are accounted for as other financial liabilities.\n\nThe transaction price is allocated to the individual performance obligations on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price. Any discount is normally allocated proportionately to all performance obligations in a contract unless there is evidence that all or part of the discount relates to one or more, but not all, performance obligations in the contract. As there are no directly observable prices at which the WashTec Group would sell a promised good or promised service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers, the stand-alone selling price is estimated at contract inception using the expected cost plus a margin approach.\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe WashTec Group makes use of the practical expedient of recognizing those costs of obtaining a contract and costs to fulfill a contract when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that would otherwise have been recognized is one year or less. This applies at WashTec to all such costs.\n\nInterest income is recognized on an accrual basis in profit or loss using the effective interest method.\n\n### Cost of sales\n\nCost of sales comprises the cost of producing or providing sold products and services. In addition to directly attributable material, labor and energy costs, this also includes production and service overheads. Overheads include depreciation of property, plant and equipment and inventory write-downs.\n\n### Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share is calculated by dividing consolidated net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.\n\nFor the calculation of diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding is adjusted to account for all potentially dilutive shares.\n\n### Segment reporting\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 8, operating segments are identified using the management approach. Under that approach, external segment reporting is based on the internal group organizational and management structure and on internal reporting to the Management Board as the entity's chief operating decision maker. Where the aggregation criteria are met, operating segments are aggregated into reportable segments.\n\nA geographical segment is a distinguishable component of an entity that is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment and is subject to risks and generates returns that differ from those of components operating in other economic environments.\n\n### 6. Significant estimates, assumptions and judgments\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, it is necessary to make certain assumptions, estimates and judgments that may affect the presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations. These primarily relate to the determination of economic useful lives, the measurement of provisions, the realizability of deferred tax assets and assumptions about future cash flows and discount rates. All judgments are continually reassessed and are based in each case on historical experience and current knowledge with regard to future events. Actual amounts may differ from the assumptions and estimates in individual cases. Changes are taken into account when better knowledge becomes available and can lead in future periods to material adjustments to the carrying amounts of affected assets or liabilities.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nIn connection with impairment testing of goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and other non-financial assets, it is necessary to estimate future cash flows from each asset or cash generating unit in order to determine value in use. An appropriate discount rate must also be selected in order to determine the present value of the cash flows. Estimating future cash flows requires long-term income forecasts to be made in light of general economic conditions and the development of the industry. For further [details, please see Note 5.](#page-121-0)\n\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets require estimates and assumptions to be made in order to determine uniform Group-wide economic useful lives and methods of depreciation and amortization.\n\n### Impairment of financial assets\n\nIn application of the simplified approach for trade receivables without a significant financing component and for trade receivables with a significant financing component, lifetime expected credit losses are determined. For this purpose, trade receivables are grouped based on days past due. The impairment rates are based on credit loss rates over the past three years and are adjusted for forward-looking macroeconomic factors affecting customer solvency.\n\n### Deferred tax assets\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized. Management estimates relate to the amount of taxable net income and the expected timing. For further details, please [see Note 16.](#page-143-0)\n\n### Pensions, other post-employment benefits and partial retirement benefits\n\nThe costs of pension and partial retirement obligations are determined using actuarial methods. Actuarial valuation involves assumptions about discount rates, future wage and salary increases, pension increases and life expectancy. Due to the long-term nature of the pension plans, such estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty. Further details are provided in [Notes 26](#page-151-0) [and 27.](#page-153-0)\n\n### Share-based payment\n\nCash-settled share-based payment is recognized at fair value at each balance sheet date. In order to estimate the fair value of shared-based payment, it is necessary to determine the most suitable valuation technique, which is dependent on the granting conditions. It is also necessary to determine suitable input parameters for the valuation technique, notably volatility of the share price and the risk-free r[ate of interest for the remaining term.](#page-165-0)  The assumptions and techniques used are shown in Note 37.\n\n### Provisions\n\nProvisions for termination benefits and guarantee provisions are recognized on the basis of expectations, estimates of the probability of occurrence, and planned measures. The size of potential payment obligations is estimated on the basis of an assessment of the situation.\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Development costs\n\nDevelopment costs are capitalized in accordance with the accounting policies described [in Note 5. T](#page-121-0)heir initial recognition is based on management's assessment that technical and financial feasibility is demonstrated. This is usually the case when a product development project has reached a specific milestone in an established project management model.\n\n### Income from repurchase agreements\n\nWashTec also sells equipment to leasing companies that lease it on to customers. In rare cases, these transactions include contracts containing repurchase agreements. Under such an agreement, WashTec undertakes to repurchase the equipment at the end of the contract term at the customer's request. The provision for contracts with repurchase agreements comprises the expected expenses from contractual obligations to repurchase the equipment sold and is measured on a rolling basis. Measurement of the provision involves estimation of the probability that the equipment will have to be repurchased at the end of the contract term. The right of return is accounted for in other current financial assets and in the amount of the net investment in the lease. This is based on an estimation of the probability that the equipment will have to be repurchased at the end of the contract term and is measured on a rolling basis.\n\n### Notes to the Consolidated Income Statement\n\n### 7. Segment reporting\n\nSegmentation within the Group using the management approach is by sales territories. Reflecting market conditions, the sales territories are defined as the regions Europe, North America and Asia/Pacific and correspond to the respective domiciles of the Group companies. The individual segments are controlled on the basis of revenue and EBIT. Segment results consist of income and expenses directly attributable to each reporting segment and to Group charges for Group-wide functions. The Consolidation column contains consolidation adjustments to eliminate transactions in profit or loss between operating segments. This mainly relates to the elimination of intercompany income from sales of goods. The sum of the reportable segments corresponds, after consolidation adjustments, to consolidated net income. Transfer prices between individual Group entities are established on an arm's length basis. They take into account market-specific and economic conditions in the individual segments. The measurement principles for segment reporting are based on the IFRS principles used in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group's segments are business units that generate their revenue primarily through the sale of machines, spare parts, service and chemical products.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\n| By segment 2023                                                                                   | Europe  | North<br>America | Asia/Pacific | Consolidation | Group   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|------------------|--------------|---------------|---------|\n| in €k                                                                                             |         |                  |              |               |         |\n| Revenue                                                                                           | 378,852 | 102,885          | 19,174       | -11,442       | 489,468 |\n| of which with third parties                                                                       | 367,617 | 102,667          | 19,174       | 0             | 489,468 |\n| of which with other segments                                                                      | 11,235  | 208              | 0            | -11,442       | 0       |\n| Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)                                                         | 36,220  | 5,709            | 645          | -687          | 41,886  |\n| EBIT margin (in %)                                                                                | 9.6     | 5.5              | 3.4          | –             | 8.6     |\n| Financial income                                                                                  |         |                  |              |               | 213     |\n| Financial expenses                                                                                |         |                  |              |               | -3,688  |\n| Earnings before taxes (EBT)                                                                       |         |                  |              |               | 38,411  |\n| Income taxes                                                                                      |         |                  |              |               | -10,439 |\n| Net income                                                                                        |         |                  |              |               | 27,972  |\n| Capital expenditure on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets   | 13,617  | 10,913           | 2,440        | 0             | 26,970  |\n| Amortization, depreciation and impairment of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and |         |                  |              |               |         |\n| right-of-use assets                                                                               | 12,584  | 1,413            | 694          | 0             | 14,692  |\n\n| By segment 2022                                                                                   | Europe  | North America | Asia/Pacific | Consolidation | Group   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------------|--------------|---------------|---------|\n| in €k                                                                                             |         |               |              |               |         |\n| Revenue                                                                                           | 371,625 | 107,662       | 17,624       | -14,672       | 482,239 |\n| of which with third parties                                                                       | 357,423 | 107,191       | 17,624       | 0             | 482,239 |\n| of which with other segments                                                                      | 14,201  | 471           | 0            | -14,672       | 0       |\n| Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)                                                         | 36,415  | 1,448         | 422          | -276          | 38,009  |\n| EBIT margin (in %)                                                                                | 9.8     | 1.3           | 2.4          | -

Germany and France make up the largest share of total revenue. After consolidation, Germany accounts for 25.1% (prior year: 26.6%) of consolidated revenue, relating to the products Equipment and Service, Chemicals and Others. France accounts for 12.9% (prior year: 13.8%) of consolidated revenue. External sales outside of Europe are primarily generated in North America and are mostly attributable to the United States. As in the prior year, transactions with one major customer in the Europe and North America segments marginally exceeded 10% of total revenue.\n\nThe allocation of Group assets to segments is based on the geographical location of the assets. Sales to external customers shown for each geographical segment are assigned to the segments based on customers' geographical location. The Group has no assets in other countries because it does not have its own sales organizations in other countries. Revenue with other countries is generated through exports to independent dealers.\n\nAnalysis of Group assets by geographical location:\n\n| 2023 in €k                                              | Germany | Europe | North<br>America | Asia/<br>Pacific | Group  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|------------------|------------------|--------|\n| Property, plant and equipment                           | 20,015  | 3,822  | 9,392            | 496              | 33,725 |\n| Capital expenditure on property, plant<br>and equipment | 2,076   | 828    | 9,467            | 488              | 12,859 |\n| Intangible assets including goodwill                    | 45,325  | 4,087  | 0                | 1,324            | 50,736 |\n| Capital expenditure on intangible assets                | 1,868   | 37     | 0                | 1,313            | 3,218  |\n| Right-of-use assets                                     | 7,042   | 8,351  | 2,259            | 761              | 18,413 |\n| Capital expenditure on right-of-use assets              | 5,328   | 3,480  | 1,446            | 638              | 10,892 |\n| 2022 in €k                                              | Germany | Europe | North<br>America | Asia/<br>Pacific | Group  |\n| Property, plant and equipment                           | 20,343  | 4,213  | 306              | 407              | 25,268 |\n| Capital expenditure on property, plant<br>and equipment | 2,085   | 2,314  | 126              | 215              | 4,741  |\n| Intangible assets including goodwill                    | 45,264  | 4,066  | 0                | 14               | 49,344 |\n| Capital expenditure on intangible assets                | 2,787   | 0      | 0                | 0                | 2,787  |\n| Right-of-use assets                                     | 5,521   | 8,975  | 1,991            | 850              | 17,337 |\n| Capital expenditure on right-of-use assets              | 2,666   | 3,399  | 895              | 221              | 7,180  |\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 8.

Research and development costs in the amount of €1,688k (prior year: €2,389k) were not capitalized as the criteria for capitalization under IAS 38 were not met.\n\nThere were no material contractual obligations such as obligations to purchase property, plant and equipment or intangible assets as of the reporting date.\n\n### Goodwill\n\nThe total goodwill with a carrying amount of €43,289k (prior year: €42,312k) is allocated as follows to the operating segments identified in accordance with IFRS 8: Europe in the amount of €42,305k (prior year: €42,305k) and Asia/Pacific in the amount of €984k (prior year: €7k). The increase in goodwill is due to the acquisition of the New [Zealand sales partner, Car Kleen New Zealand Ltd.; for details, please refer to Note 3.](#page-117-0)\n\nThe goodwill allocated to the operating segments is routinely tested for impairment by determining value in use.\n\nIn accordance with the approach described in Note 5, Accounting policies, goodwill is tested for impairment on the basis of the Group-level planning for 2024 through 2029.\n\nPlanning is primarily based on the following assumptions based on the longstanding experience of management and the medium-term strategies for the individual markets. Further information was available to management in the form of external market studies. The key assumptions are as follows:\n\n- W Revenue growth averaging approximately 4.7% p.a. in the Europe segment and between 3.6% and 6.7% in the remaining segments.\n- W Cost increases of 2–3% p.a.\n- W Wage and salary cost increases of approximately 3–4% p.a.\n\nAssumptions made for discounting purposes were a pre-tax discount rate of 9.6% (prior year: 10.5%) and a long-term growth rate in perpetuity of 1.0% (prior year: 1.0%).\n\nThe discount rate is based on a weighted cost of debt of 4.0% (prior year: 4.4%), the weighted cost of equity and the capital structure. The cost of equity is based on a riskfree rate of return averaging 2.2% (prior year: 2.5%) and a beta of 1.3 (prior year: 1.3).\n\nNo indications of impairment were identified for goodwill in the WashTec Group in the reporting year. Nor would a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate and a 20% reduction in the future cash flows result in recognition of an impairment loss.\n\n### 15. Right-of-use assets\n\nThe recognized leases primarily relate to rented buildings and leasing of service vehicles.

Deferred Taxes\n\nThere are deferred tax assets in the amount of €3,478k (prior year: €3,856k) and deferred tax liabilities in the amount of €1,741k (prior year: €1,600k) relating to temporary differences.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are not recognized for outside basis differences as the entity holding the investment is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is not probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future. The tax base of the unrecognized deferred tax liabilities is €1,476k (prior year: €1,028k).\n\nLoss carryforwards and temporary differences have been recognized as deferred tax assets to the extent it is probable that the loss carryforwards or the temporary differences will be utilized on the basis of the internal planning for 2024 through 2029.\n\nTo the extent that it is not probable that loss carryforwards will be able to be utilized against future taxable net income, no deferred tax assets are recognized for them. Deferred tax assets were therefore not recognized in the reporting year in relation to loss carryforwards in the amount of €3,710k (prior year: €10,621k) and temporary differences in the amount of €6,038k (prior year: €9,716k). This corresponds to €942k (prior year: €2,650k) in deferred tax assets not recognized for loss carryforwards and €1,520k (prior year: €2,470k) in deferred tax assets not recognized for temporary differences.\n\nThe loss carryforwards have no time restrictions with regard to their utilization.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe deferred tax assets and liabilities relate, prior to offsetting, to the following material balance sheet items:\n\n| in €k                                 |  | Deferred tax assets |               | Deferred tax liabilities |               |\n|---------------------------------------|--|---------------------|---------------|--------------------------|---------------|\n|                                       |  | Dec 31, 2023        | Dec 31, 2022  | Dec 31, 2023             | Dec 31, 2022  |\n| Tax loss carryforwards                |  | 248                 | 702           | 0                        | 0             |\n| Property, plant and equipment         |  | 329                 | 336           | –1,220                   | –1,202        |\n| Goodwill                              |  | 0                   | 0             | –967                     | –913          |\n| Intangible assets                     |  | 0                   | 0             | –1,680                   | –1,421        |\n| Right-of-use assets                   |  | 0                   | 0             | –4,443                   | –3,947        |\n| Inventories                           |  | 2,077               | 1,365         | –169                     | –92           |\n| Trade receivables                     |  | 293                 | 175           | –6                       | –55           |\n| Other assets                          |  | 4                   | 1             | –308                     | –285          |\n| Non-current interest<br>bearing loans |  | 0                   | 0             | –133                     | 0             |\n| Lease liabilities                     |  | 4,508               | 3,814         | 0                        | 0             |\n| Provisions                            |  | 1,755               | 1,829         | 0                        | –2            |\n| Other liabilities                     |  | 881                 | 1,680         | –2                       | –31           |\n| Contract liabilities                  |  | 570                 | 303           | 0                        | –1            |\n| <b>Total</b>                          |  | <b>10,665</b>       | <b>10,205</b> | <b>–8,928</b>            | <b>–7,949</b> |\n| <i>of which non-current</i>           |  | 5,050               | 5,406         | –6,219                   | –5,744        |\n| <i>of which current</i>               |  | 5,615               | 4,799         | –2,709                   | –2,205        |\n\nDeferred tax receivables and liabilities totaling €7,187k (prior year: €6,349k) were offset in accordance with the offsetting rules in IAS 12.\n\n€–72k (prior year: €–555k) in deferred taxes were recognized in equity in the reporting year.

It is divided into 13,976,970 no-parvalue bearer shares (prior year: 13,976,970 shares) and is fully paid in. Each share has a single voting right and is entitled to dividends according to the share's percentage of the registered share capital.\n\n|                             | Dec 31, 2023 | Dec 31, 2022 |\n|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Ordinary shares (thousand)  | 13,977       | 13,977       |\n| Share capital per share (€) | 2.86         | 2.86         |\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the average weighted number of issued and outstanding shares was 13,382,324 (prior year: 13,382,324 shares).\n\nThe Annual General Meeting of May 15, 2023 resolved, among other things, for the distributable profit of €29,804,169.57 shown in the Company's annual financial statements for fiscal year 2022 to be appropriated for payment of a dividend of €2.20 per eligible no-par value share, totaling €29,441,112.80, and for the remaining distributable profit of €363,056.77 to be carried forward.\n\n### Authorized capital\n\nThe Authorized Capital currently existing under subsection 5.1 of the Company's Articles of Association, which has not been used to date, would have expired on June 30, 2022. In order that the Company may continue to act rapidly and flexibly as needed in order to raise equity capital on favorable terms, the existing Authorized Capital is to be revoked and the Management Board is once again to be authorized to increase the share capital by the issue of new no-par-value bearer shares.\n\n[By resolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 16, 2022, which is available in the](https://ir.washtec.de/en/)  Investor Relations section of the Company website at www.washtec.de, the Authorized\n\nCapital under subsection 5.1 of the Articles of Association resolved as agenda item 7 of the Annual General Meeting of April 29, 2019 was revoked. At the same time, the Management Board was authorized, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to increase the registered share capital on one or more occasions on or before June 30, 2025 by a total amount of up to €8,000,000 (Authorized Capital) by issuing new no-par-value bearer shares in exchange for cash and/or non-cash contributions. The shareholders must normally be granted preemptive rights in this connection.\n\nThe Management Board is authorized, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the preemptive rights of shareholders:\n\n- W for fractional amounts;\n- W if the new shares are issued in exchange for a non-cash contribution, including in connection with the acquisition of companies, parts of companies or interests in companies;\n- W in the event of capital increases in exchange for cash contributions if at the time of the final fixing of the issue price by the Management Board the issue price of the new shares is not significantly lower, within the meaning of section 203 (1) and (2) and section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG, than the stock market price of existing publicly listed shares of the same class and with the same features, and the pro rata amount of the share capital attributable in total to the new shares on which preemptive rights are excluded does not exceed 10% at the time the authorization becomes effective or, if the pro rata amount is then lower, at the time the authorization is exercised;\n- W to the extent necessary in order to grant the holders of warrant-linked and/or convertible bonds issued by the Company or its subsidiaries a right to subscribe for new shares in the scope to which they would be entitled if they exercised their option or conversion right or fulfilled their conversion or option obligations.\n\nThe pro rata amount of the share capital attributable to shares issued against cash or non-cash contributions under the above stipulations with shareholders' preemptive rights \n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\nexcluded may not exceed a total of 10% of the Company's share capital at the time of the resolution by the Annual General Meeting. To be deducted from this amount – subject to any further authorization to exclude shareholders' preemptive rights that may be resolved by a subsequent Annual General Meeting – are those shares which are issued during the term of the Authorized Capital under another authorization with shareholders' preemptive rights excluded or to which warrant-linked or convertible bonds with conversion or warrant rights or with conversion or warrant obligations relate that are issued during the term of the Authorized Capital with shareholders' preemptive rights excluded.\n\nThe Management Board is authorized, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to stipulate further details concerning the capital increase and its implementation, including the features of the share rights and the terms and conditions of issue.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is authorized to revise the text of the Articles of Association after full or partial implementation of the capital increase from Authorized Capital.\n\n### 23. Capital reserves\n\nCapital reserves primarily consist of the contribution of California Kleindienst Holding GmbH to the capital of WashTec AG as of January 1, 2000 in the amount of €26,828k, and €18,019k, less €1,774k in costs relating to capital increases, from the premium paid in connection with the capital increase in August 2005. Capital reserves were reduced in 2009 when treasury shares were retired in the amount of €9,464k.\n\n### 24. Treasury shares\n\nAs in the prior year, WashTec AG held treasury shares in the amount of €13,177k as of December 31, 2023. This corresponds to 594,646 shares or 4.25%. The treasury shares were acquired in fiscal years 2012, 2013 and 2015.\n\n### Purchase and use of treasury shares\n\nUnless expressly permitted by law, the Company cannot acquire or make use of treasury shares except with authorization from the Annual General Meeting. As the authorization\n\nto purchase and use treasury shares in accordance with section 71 (1) no. 8 AktG granted by resolution of the Annual General Meeting of April 29, 2019 would have expired on June 30, 2022, it was resolved at the Annual General Meeting of May 16, 2022 to revoke the previous authorization and to grant the Company renewed authorization to purchase and make use of treasury shares. The resolution of the Annual General [Meeting is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company website at](https://ir.washtec.de/en/)  www.washtec.de.\n\n### Authorization to acquire treasury shares\n\nThe Company is authorized pursuant to section 71 (1) 8 AktG, on or before June 30, 2025 and for purposes other than to trade in the Company's own shares, to acquire the Company's own shares in the amount of up to 10% of the share capital at the time of the resolution or – if lower – at the time the authorization is exercised.\n\nThe Management Board may opt to acquire such shares on the stock exchange, by means of a public purchase offer to all shareholders or by means of a public invitation directed at all shareholders to tender shares for sale.\n\nIf the shares are acquired on the stock exchange, the consideration per share paid by the Company (excluding incidental acquisition costs) may not be more than 10% higher or lower than the average stock exchange price of the Company's shares in the XETRA closing auction (or a comparable successor system) on Frankfurt Stock Exchange over the last five trading days prior to the acquisition of the shares.\n\nIf the shares are acquired by means of a public purchase offer to all shareholders or by means of a public invitation directed at all shareholders to tender shares for sale, the purchase price offered or the limits of the purchase price range per share (excluding incidental acquisition costs) may not be more than 10% higher or lower than the average stock exchange price of the Company's shares in the XETRA closing auction (or a comparable successor system) on Frankfurt Stock Exchange over the last five trading days prior to the date of the public announcement of the offer or of the public invitation to tender shares for sale.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\nIf the public offer is oversubscribed, or if not all of a plurality of equivalent offers are accepted in the case of an invitation to tender shares for sale, then acceptance must be based on quotas. Provision may be made for preferential acquisition or preferential acceptance of small quantities of up to 100 shares in the Company offered for acquisition per shareholder. Additional conditions may be stipulated in the public offer or in the invitation to tender shares.\n\n### Use of treasury shares; exclusion of shareholders' preemptive rights\n\nOther than by way of sale on the stock exchange or by way of an offer to all shareholders, the Management Board is authorized, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to make use of treasury shares acquired on the basis of the authorization granted at the Annual General Meeting on May 16, 2022 or on the basis of a previously granted authorization as follows:\n\n### They may\n\n- W be offered and transferred to third parties as consideration in connection with the direct or indirect acquisition of companies, parts of companies or interests in companies or in connection with business combinations;\n- W be used to service options issued in a stock option program to members of the management of companies affiliated with the Company and to employees of the Company or of companies affiliated with the Company; or\n- W be used in other ways provided that the Company's treasury shares are utilized against cash payment and at a price that is not significantly lower than the stock exchange price of the Company's shares at the time of disposal. This authorization is additionally restricted to shares with a pro rata amount of the share capital that may not exceed a total of 10% of the share capital at the time the authorization becomes effective or, if lower, at the time the authorization is exercised.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is authorized to use the treasury shares acquired on the basis of this authorization to service options issued in a stock option program to members of the Management Board of the Company.\n\nThe aforementioned authorizations for use other than by way of sale on the stock exchange or by way of an offer to all shareholders may be exercised in whole or in part and on one or more occasions. The use made may be for one or more of the aforementioned purposes. Shareholders' preemptive rights to treasury shares are excluded to the extent that, in accordance with the above authorizations, the shares are used other than by way of sale on the stock exchange or by way of an offer to all shareholders.\n\nTo the extent that shares are used, with shareholders' preemptive rights excluded, to service options issued in a stock option program to members of the Management Board of the Company, to members of the management of companies affiliated with the Company and to employees of the Company or of companies affiliated with the Company, use may only be made of the authorization up to a total maximum amount of 5% of the share capital at the time of the resolution by the Annual General Meeting. To be deducted from this 5% limit is the pro rata share of the share capital attributable to shares issued or sold in exchange for cash or non-cash contributions during the term of the authorization or under another authorization, with shareholders' preemptive rights excluded, to members of the Management Board of the Company, to members of the management of companies affiliated with the Company and to employees of the Company or of companies affiliated with the Company.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Cancellation of treasury shares\n\nThe Management Board is authorized, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to cancel shares acquired on the basis of the above authorization or a previously granted authorization, in whole or in part, without the cancellation or its execution requiring a further resolution of the Annual General Meeting. Cancellation results in a reduction in capital. In departure from this, the Management Board may stipulate that instead of a reduction in capital, the pro rata share of the share capital attributable to each remaining share is increased. In this event, the Management Board is authorized to revise the number of shares in the Company's Articles of Association.\n\n### Utilization in partial amounts\n\nAll of the aforementioned authorizations may be exercised by the Company in whole or in part, on one or more occasions, and for one or more purposes. The authorizations – with the exception of the authorization to cancel treasury shares – may also be exercised by subsidiaries of the Company or by third parties for the account of the Company or for the account of subsidiaries of the Company. The authorizations for the use of treasury shares, for the exclusion of subscription rights and for the cancellation of treasury shares also include the use of shares in the Company acquired on the basis of section 71d sentence 5 AktG.\n\n### 25.

Provisions for pensions\n\nThe provisions relate mainly to WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH and WashTec Holding GmbH, Augsburg, Germany, and have been recognized in order to reflect obligations, arising from future and current benefit entitlements, to current and former employees and their surviving dependents. The pension plan provides for retirement benefits (from the age of 63), early retirement benefits and invalidity benefits. Employees must have served the Company for at least 10 years in order to be entitled to the benefits, with years of service taken into account only after an employee has reached the age of 30. The monthly retirement benefit is derived from a fixed amount multiplied by the number of pension-qualifying years of service. In addition, individual contractual terms and conditions apply.\n\nThe amount of the provision was determined using actuarial methods at a discount rate of 3.45% (prior year: 3.1%). The annual salary and cost-of-living increases were measured at 2.0% (prior year: 2.0%). The return from reimbursement claims due to the existing pension liability insurance policies amounts to 3.45% (prior year: 3.1%). The Prof. Dr. Klaus Heubeck 2018 G mortality tables were used as the biometrical basis of calculation. Staff turnover ratios were estimated according to age and sex and taken from standard tables.\n\nThe number of pension beneficiaries as of December 31, 2023 was 219 employees (prior year: 223 employees), and the total number of all persons to whom there is a pension commitment is 290 employees (prior year: 312 employees). The new valuations include the effects of experience adjustments in the amount of €47k (prior year: €–303k).\n\nAll actuarial gains and losses have been recognized in other comprehensive income. Actuarial gains and losses before deferred taxes in the fiscal year under review were €318k (prior year: €1,373k).

The calculation was based on an interest rate of 3.7% (prior year: 2.7%) and annual salary increases of 2.25% (prior year: 2.25%).\n\nThe provision for warranty obligations is recognized based on experience. The assumptions used in calculating the provision for warranty obligations were based on current sales levels and on the currently available information about repairs and returns for sold products during the warranty period. It is expected that the costs will be incurred during the warranty period after the balance sheet date.\n\nThe provision for contracts with rights of return comprises the expected expenses from contractual obligations to take back equipment previously sold to leasing companies and is measured on a rolling basis. In general, these obligations are secured by bank guarantees.\n\nThe provision for termination benefits in the amount of €1,778k (prior year: €914k) relates to measures for workforce reductions.\n\nThe other provisions totaling €481k (prior year: €501k) mainly relate to provisions for potential claims in the amount of €384k (prior year: €401k).\n\n### 28. Interest-bearing loans\n\nThe WashTec Group's financing is based on bilateral agreements with various banks. The borrower is WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH and has credit lines totaling €99,690k (prior year: €91,500k) at its disposal, consisting of demand facilities totaling €60,000k (prior year: €60,000k) and facilities with remaining terms as of December 31, 2023 of nine to 48 months totaling €39,690k (prior year: €31,500k). The facilities with a remaining term of nine months are credit lines that are normally provided for a term of 24 months and are extended on a regular basis. Talks for the upcoming extension are on track. All banks involved have already confirmed their willingness to continue the working relationship. The credit lines may be drawn on both as credit and as guarantee facilities. The increase in the credit lines is mainly due to the acquisition of the site occupied by the US subsidiary. This was purchased effective January 2, 2023 following the termination of the previous lease agreement. The purchase price was USD 10.3 million. This\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-154-0\"></span>was financed by long-term, five-year US dollar bank loans in the same amount. In addition, the guarantee facility was drawn in the amount of €4,075k (prior year: €5,251k). The undrawn amount of the credit line available for future operating activities and to meet obligations was €56,496k as of the reporting date (prior year: €46,137k).\n\nInterest-bearing loans at the WashTec Group are made up as follows:\n\n| in €k                              | Dec 31, 2023 | Dec 31, 2022 |\n|------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Non-current interest-bearing loans | 5,204        | 0            |\n| Current interest-bearing loans     | 33,916       | 41,362       |\n| Total                              | 39,120       | 41,362       |\n\nThe current interest-bearing loans are made up of overdraft borrowings in the amount of €32,287k (prior year: €41,362k) and interest-bearing loans in the amount of €1,629k (prior year: €0k).\n\nThe facilities provided by the banks are not tied to any financial covenants. The interest rate on the credit lines is variable and linked to changes in EURIBOR, €STR and SOFR plus a contractually agreed margin. The credit lines carry interest according to the applicable conditions of the relevant banks at the time they are utilized. The interest rates ranged between 2.7% and 5.3% in the reporting year (prior year: between 0.2% and 2.6%).\n\n### 29.

The lease payments are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which the condition that triggers them occurs. As in the prior year, there are no future cash outflows that are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023.\n\nA number of property leases contain extension and termination options. No lease payments related to these as the optional periods are in the future. Potential future cash outflows in the amount of €3,097k (prior year: €3,100k) were not included in the lease liabilities as the leases are not reasonably certain to be extended.\n\nTotal cash outflows for leases were €8,740k in fiscal year 2023 (prior year: €9,095k). Future cash outflows arising from leases not yet commenced to which the WashTec Group committed in fiscal year 2023 amount to €256k (prior year: €50k). As in the prior year, there were no gains from sale-and-leaseback transactions.\n\nThe other rental expenses include €346k (prior year: €310k) in expenses for leases of low-value assets that are not short-term leases. Low-value assets mainly comprise IT equipment. As in the prior year, no expenses were recognized for variable lease payments not taken into account in the measurement of lease liabilities.\n\nFor the right-of-use assets recognized for leased assets and the related depreciation, ple[ase see](#page-138-0) [Note 15.

Financial risk management objectives and methods\n\nThe risks for the Group arising from derivative financial instruments comprise credit and liquidity risk along with market price risk in the form of interest and currency risk. Company policy is to avoid or limit such risk as far as possible. Substantially all hedging is coordinated and undertaken centrally. For example, the Group regularly identifies all items that are subject to interest rate and currency risk, assesses the probability of occurrence of negative developments and makes any decisions required to avoid or reduce variation in the corresponding interest rate and/or currency positions. No trading in derivatives is undertaken as a fundamental rule in accordance with internal Group policy.\n\nAll risk types to which the Group is exposed, and the strategies and procedures for managing the risks, are described below.\n\n### Credit risk\n\nThe Group conducts business exclusively with creditworthy third parties. To minimize credit risk, order limits are imposed where customers do not have first-class credit standing. For new regional customers, the Company requests evidence of credit standing or financing. Impairments recognized on receivables are expected to be sufficient to [cover actual risk. Please see Note 19 fo](#page-145-0)r further information.\n\nFor some trade receivables, the WashTec Group in some cases requires collateral in the form of guarantees or letters of credit to which the Group can have recourse under the contract terms in the event of payment default by the counterparty.\n\nThere is presumed to be a concentration of credit risk if a single customer or oil company makes up more than 10% of revenue. Revenue with one major customer marginally exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue in fiscal years 2023 and 2022. The development of receivables is monitored on a monthly basis as part of receivables management. If there are indications of an increase in credit risk, insolvency insurance may be taken out with reputable credit insurers. There is therefore no enhanced credit risk in this regard.\n\nWith respect to credit risk arising from the Group's remaining financial assets – such as cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets – the maximum credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty is the carrying amount of the instruments. No credit losses are expected on such instruments.\n\n### Liquidity risk\n\nA key business objective is to ensure that Group companies are solvent at all times. The implemented cash management systems enable the Group to identify potential shortfalls in good time and take appropriate action. The current and future liquidity situation is controlled in a timely manner on an annual basis based on a monthly rolling consolidated liquidity plan. Undrawn credit lines ensure the supply of liquidity. The credit lines have been granted under bilateral agreements between WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH and various banks subject to joint and several liability on the part of WashTec AG. Further information is provided in Note 32.\n\nThe table below shows all contractually agreed undiscounted payments of principal and interest on financial liabilities recognized as of December 31, 2023 for future fiscal years.\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe table includes all instruments held as of the balance sheet date for which payments were already agreed. Foreign currency amounts are translated at closing rates. Variable interest payments on the financial instruments, primarily on loans, are calculated at expected interest rates. Financial liabilities that are repayable at any time are always included in the earliest repayment category.\n\n| in €k                       | Carrying<br>amount | Cash flows |           |          |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------|------------|-----------|----------|\n|                             | Dec 31, 2023       | 2024       | 2025–2028 | 2029 ff. |\n| Interest-bearing loans      | 39,120             | 35,649     | 5,787     | 0        |\n| Lease liabilities           | 19,439             | 8,226      | 11,609    | 344      |\n| Trade payables              | 23,951             | 23,951     | 0         | 0        |\n| Other financial liabilities | 19,172             | 19,117     | 55        | 0        |\n\n| in €k                       | Carrying<br>amount | Cash flows |           |          |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------|------------|-----------|----------|\n|                             | Dec 31, 2022       | 2023       | 2024–2027 | 2028 ff. |\n| Interest-bearing loans      | 41,362             | 6,483      | 47,748    | 0        |\n| Lease liabilities           | 18,102             | 8,197      | 9,604     | 751      |\n| Trade payables              | 22,711             | 22,711     | 0         | 0        |\n| Other financial liabilities | 20,765             | 20,597     | 168       | 0        |\n\n### Market price risk\n\nThe main sources of market price risk facing the Group relate to exchange rate movements between the euro and other currencies and to interest rate movements on the international money and capital markets.\n\n### Currency risk\n\nMovements in the USD/EUR, CAD/USD and EUR/NOK (and in the prior year also CNY/ EUR) exchange rates could have a material effect on consolidated net income because a portion of the operating business is conducted in the North America segment and a portion in the Asia/Pacific segment. American subsidiary Mark VII Equipment Inc., Arvada, USA, has a long-term CAD loan receivable against its Canadian subsidiary, which is designated as a net investment in a foreign operation in the amount of CAD 7,800k (prior year: CAD 7,800k). The translation effect of the loan receivable, which is attributable to the net investment in a foreign operation, is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe following sensitivity analysis shows how EBT and equity would change had the currencies identified as price risk variables moved differently as of the balance sheet date.

The documentation includes the identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the hedged risk and how the entity assesses whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including an analysis of the possible reasons for any hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined). In accordance with Group policy, there is no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes.\n\nTo hedge these interest rate exposures, derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps were held for hedging purposes during the reporting year. Credit risk relating to the counterparties to the interest rate derivatives could result in hedge ineffectiveness. As of December 31, 2023, no ineffectiveness was identified and the hedging relationships are classified as effective.\n\nHedging instruments as of December 31, 2023 comprised two interest rate swaps, which serve to hedge the loan for the acquisition of the site occupied by the American subsidiary.\n\n| Start        | End           | Nominal<br>amount in<br>USDk | Reference<br>rate | Interest rate<br>(%) | Hedge<br>relationship | Hedge ratio<br>(%) |\n|--------------|---------------|------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| Jan. 3, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2027 | 5,100                        | SOFR              | 4.15                 | 1:1                   | 100                |\n| Jan. 3, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2027 | 1,975                        | SOFR              | 4.11                 | 1:1                   | 50                 |\n\nThe cash flow hedge reserve changed as follows in the fiscal year:\n\n|                                                                                      |  | 2023 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|------|\n| in €k                                                                                |  |      |\n| As of January 1                                                                      |  | 0    |\n| Change in fair value of hedging instruments recognized in other comprehensive income |  | 27   |\n| Gain or loss reclassified to other comprehensive income                              |  | -36  |\n| Deferred taxes                                                                       |  | 3    |\n| As of December 31                                                                    |  | -6   |\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Impact of changes in interest rates\n\nThe following table shows the sensitivity of consolidated earnings before taxes to a reasonably possible change in the interest rate on the variable-rate loans.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in response to changes in economic conditions. The Group monitors its capital using appropriate financial ratios. Net financial liabilities comprise interest-bearing loans and lease liabilities less cash and cash equivalents. At the end of 2023, net financial liabilities amounted to €41,886k (prior year: €45,249k). The facilities provided by the banks are not tied to any financial covenants.\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 33.

If there is no active market, fair value is established using valuation techniques.\n\nIn the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy, financial instruments are classified into three levels on the basis of the input factors used. Level 1 input factors have the highest priority and unobservable inputs the lowest.

Related party disclosures\n\n### Management Board remuneration (HGB)\n\nThe Management Board remuneration system is geared to promoting the corporate strategy and the long-term development of the Company and its affiliates. This is achieved among other things by means of a simple and clear incentive structure in Management Board remuneration. The remuneration system and the uniform remuneration structure for all Management Board functions are designed to prevent inappropriate incentives, both from outside and from within the Company. In particular, they aim to prevent Management Board decision-making that is calculated to maximize remuneration in the short term but is not conducive to the long-term success of the business.\n\nAt its meeting on March 24, 2021, the Supervisory Board, after due deliberation, adopted the system for the remuneration of the members of the Management Board of WashTec AG in accordance with the requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act resulting from the German Act Implementing the Second Shareholder Rights Directive (ARUG II) and taking into account the German Corporate Governance Code dated December 16, 2019 (the \"2020 Code\"). The amended version of the German Corporate Governance Code dated April 28, 2022 (the \"2022 Code\") has no effect in this regard. With regard to the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, reference is made to the Declaration of Conformity published in the combined management [report, section 8.1.](#page-96-0)\n\nThis remuneration system was approved by the 2021 Annual General Meeting pursuant to section 120a (1) AktG and applies to all Management Board contracts entered into or renewed after the Annual General Meeting on May 18, 2021. Those contracts are the Management Board contracts of CEO Dr. Ralf Koeppe, who was reappointed in fiscal year 2022, CFO Andreas Pabst, who was newly appointed in fiscal year 2022, and CSO Sebastian Kutz, who was newly appointed in fiscal year 2023. In accordance with the 2022 Code and section 26j of the Introductory Act to the Stock Corporation Act (EGAktG), all Management Board contracts current at the time of the 2021 Annual General\n\nMeeting continued to be subject to the previous remuneration system (see also the Declaration of Conformity of December 15, 2022 submitted by the Management Board and Supervisory Board in accordance with section 161 AktG). The long-term variable remuneration in the form of the Long Term Incentive Program (LTIP) 2021-2023 for the Management Board was adopted effective January 1, 2021 and applies to all members of the Management Board. With regard to the Management Board contracts current at the time of the 2021 Annual General Meeting, these have continued or will continue to apply under the conditions specified in the respective contract.\n\nThe total remuneration of members of the Management Board is made up of non-performance-based and performance-based remuneration components and is linked overall to sustained growth of the Company. The non-performance-based remuneration components consist of fixed remuneration and incidental benefits, notably comprising the provision of company cars and insurance coverage. The performance-based remuneration components include both a short-term and a long-term component.\n\nThe short-term variable remuneration is based in equal parts on Company targets and individual performance targets. The Company targets relate to the WashTec Group's financial key performance indicators. These are revenue, EBIT, free cash flow and return on capital employed (ROCE). For each fiscal year, the Supervisory Board sets the Company targets relevant to remuneration. The individual performance targets comprise operational or strategic targets, including non-financial targets, primarily from the areas of product innovation, sustainability, process optimization, digitalization and customer benefit.\n\nThe long-term variable remuneration is structured as share-based payment with a onetime cash award (LTIP) and has a term from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2023. The LTIP ensures long-term performance and sustainability under the corporate strategy with the two performance targets return on capital employed (ROCE) and total shareholder return (TSR).

The terms and conditions of the transactions correspond to those of arms-length transactions.\n\nThe total expense recognized for Management Board remuneration in accordance with IFRS was €1,135k (prior year: €1,885k). €985k (prior year: €936k) consisted of fixed remuneration and €457k (prior year: €228k) to single-year variable remuneration. An amount of €307k was recognized as income in relation to long-term share-based payment for fiscal years 2021 to 2023 (prior year: expense of €584k). A total of €1,143k (prior year: €1,421k) was recognized in other liabilities and €100k (prior year: €129k) directly in equity for the future disbursement of long-term share-based payment for the members of the Management Board active as of December 31, 2023. In addition, the total expenses include €0k (prior year: €138k) relating to early termination of a Management Board contract.\n\nThe total expense recognized for remuneration of the Supervisory Board in accordance with IFRS was €678k (prior year: €652k). The expense recognized for fixed remuneration was €379k (prior year: €376k) and that recognized for single-year variable remuneration was €15k (prior year: €0k). Other remuneration, predominantly attendance fees, amounted to a total of €273k (prior year: €245k). An amount of €11k (prior year: €32k) was recognized as expense for long-term share-based payment for fiscal years 2022 to 2024 adopted by the 2021 Annual General Meeting. In addition, €35k (prior year: €26k) was recognized in other liabilities and €7k (prior year: €5k) directly in equity for future disbursements.\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Share-based payment (IFRS 2)\n\nThere are contracts in place with the members of the Management Board that provide for share-based payment in the form of a Long Term Incentive Program (LTIP). A sharebased payment arrangement in the form of an LTIP for the Supervisory Board was established by resolution of the 2021 Annual General Meetings and is made use of by Supervisory Board members Mr. Bellgardt, Dr. Liebler, Dr. Selent and Mr. Wiedemann. This is intended to give members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board additional incentives to secure the business success of the Company in the medium and long term and to seek to deliver sustained growth in shareholder value.\n\nIn order to enable the Supervisory Board to participate in WashTec AG's long-term development, the Annual General Meeting of May 18, 2021 adopted a share-based payment arrangement for the Supervisory Board with an incentive period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024. In order to participate in the new share-based payment arrangement, a Supervisory Board member is required to already have held a personal investment in shares in the Company or to have made such an investment by July 31, 2022 (Chairman: 4,000 shares maximum; all others: 2,000 shares maximum). A Supervisory Board member can also participate in the LTIP with shares already purchased by the member prior to the Company's Annual General Meeting in fiscal year 2021. In that case, invested shares can also be shares with which the Supervisory Board member participated in LTIP 2018 and 2015. The amount paid out depends on percentage target attainment of certain performance targets over the term and on personal investment in Company shares. The stipulated performance targets were an EPS target, a ROCE target and a free cash flow target. The reference base for the targets comprises the key performance indicators for fiscal year 2021. Depending on whether one, several or all of the targets are fulfilled, a different multiplier applies for the cash award. This is calculated by multiplying a multiplier with the number of invested shares multiplied by the reference share price. Entitlement to the bonus payment is conditional on the Supervisory Board member still being on the Supervisory Board and still holding shares in the Company. A Supervisory Board member who is elected to the Supervisory Board after\n\nthe beginning of the incentive period may participate in the LTIP. In order to do so, the member must make a personal investment in shares in the Company, with the invested shares purchased at the latest three months after the entry into effect of the member's election to the Supervisory Board. Payment is made on the day following the Company's Annual General Meeting in fiscal year 2025. Entitlement to payment is subject to the resolutive condition that one-sixth of the cash award received under the LTIP is reinvested in shares in the Company by the eligible Supervisory Board member within three months subsequent to the Company's Annual General Meeting in fiscal year 2025 and the Supervisory Board member holds those shares for at least three years after acquiring them. The requirement to hold the shares ends if the eligible Supervisory Board member leaves the Supervisory Board during the three-year holding period.\n\nThe current share-based payment arrangement for the Management Board has an incentive period from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2023 and consists of two components: a non-personal-investment component and an optional personal investment component.\n\nUnder the non-personal-investment component, a Management Board member can obtain a maximum cash award, at 100% target achievement, of 100% of their respective short-term variable annual target remuneration for each year of the LTIP.\n\nAn additional personal investment component provides a Management Board member with the opportunity to increase – up to a maximum of double (cash award multiplier = 2) – their cash award under the non-personal-investment component by personal investment in WashTec AG shares. Doubling the cash award requires a personal investment in the amount of 100% of the 2021 short-term variable target annual remuneration in euros by a specified cut-off date. If the personal investment is lower, the personal investment component is proportionately smaller (cash award multiplier < 2). Personal investment for the purposes of the LTIP means (euro) amounts invested in shares in the Company held personally by the Management Board member on the June 30, 2023 cut-off date. This includes any shares that the Management Board member acquired under pre\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\nvious LTIP programs and still holds. If a Management Board member is appointed after the start of the incentive period, the rule for the personal investment in shares of the Company required to double the entitlement under the non-personal-investment component is that the Management Board member must make a personal investment amounting to 100% of the variable target income in euros for the year in which the Management Board member takes office. A personal investment for the purposes of this program means (euro) amounts, amounting to up to 100% of the variable target income for the year in which the Management Board member takes office, invested in shares in the Company held personally by the Management Board member on June 30, 2023 (the cut-off date). The long-term share-based payment is paid at the end of the incentive period. The amount paid depends on the achievement of agreed performance targets for return on capital employed (ROCE) and total shareholder return (TSR). The two performance targets must each reach the minimum threshold of 81% set by the Supervisory Board in order to count. The ROCE target has a weighting of 70% and the TSR target has a weighting of 30% in determination of the cash award. If the Management Board member makes use of the personal investment component, payment is subject to the resolutive condition that one-sixth of the gross cash award under the LTIP with personal investment is reinvested in shares in the Company by the Management Board member within three months of the cash award falling due and that the Management Board member remains invested with that quantity of shares for at least three years after acquiring them. There are exemptions to the reinvestment requirement and the holding period in the event of the Management Board member leaving office.\n\nThese obligations were measured at fair value as required for share-based payment in accordance with IFRS 2. The long-term share-based compensation for the Management Board expires as of December 31, 2023. It is paid out after the Supervisory Board meeting adopting the financial statements in March 2024. The grant date for the Supervisory Board share-based payment arrangement with the incentive period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024 is the date of the Annual General Meeting in fiscal year 2021.\n\nBoth programs constitute equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the amount of the required reinvestment of one sixth of the cash award, with the remaining portion comprising cash-settled share-based payment transactions. The equity-settled share-based payment component is recognized directly in equity. The portion comprising a cash-settled share-based payment transaction is recognized in other liabilities. The obligations from share-based payment are recognized in non-current other liabilities at fair value taking into account the remaining duration of the program.\n\nThe obligations recognized in other liabilities for the LTIP are as follows:\n\n| in €k            | Dec 31, 2023 | Dec 31, 2022 |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| LTIP obligations | 1,178        | 1,447        |\n| Total            | 1,178        | 1,447        |\n\nThe obligations recognized directly in equity for the LTIP are as follows:\n\n| in €k                                                    | Dec 31, 2023 | Dec 31, 2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Portion of LTIP obligation recognized directly in equity | 107          | 134          |\n| Total                                                    | 107          | 134          |\n\nThe expenses recognized for the LTIP are as follows:\n\n| in €k         | 2023  | 2022  |\n|---------------|-------|-------|\n| LTIP expenses | 1,285 | 1,582 |\n| Total         | 1,285 | 1,582 |\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 38.

In addition, we have audited the group management report of WashTec AG for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the statement on corporate governance pursuant to § [Article] 289f HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and § 315d HGB.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- W the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and\n- W the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the group management report does not cover the content of the statement on corporate governance referred to above.\n\nPursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n### *Basis for the Audit Opinions*\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\n### *Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements*\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\n{174}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn our view, the matter of most significance in our audit was as follows:\n\n### 1 Recoverability of goodwill\n\nOur presentation of this key audit matter has been structured as follows:\n\n1 Matter and issue\n\n2 Audit approach and findings\n\n3 Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter we present the key audit matter:\n\n### 1 Recoverability of goodwill\n\n1 In the Company's consolidated financial statements Goodwill amounting in total to EUR 43,289 thousand (16,0 % of total assets) is reported. Goodwill is tested for impairment by the Company once a year or when there are indications of impairment to determine any possible need for write-downs. Impairment testing is carried out at the level of the groups of cash-generating units to which the relevant goodwill has been allocated. The carrying amount of the relevant cash-generating units, including goodwill, is compared with the corresponding recoverable amount in the context of the impairment test. The calculation of the recoverable amount generally employs the value in use. The present value of the future cash flows from the respective group of cash-generating units normally serves as the basis of valuation. Present values are calculated using discounted cash flow models. For this purpose, the adopted medium-term business plan of the Group forms the starting point for future projections based on assumptions about longterm rates of growth. Expectations relating to future market developments and assumptions about the development of macroeconomic factors on the business activities of the Group are also taken into account. The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital for the relevant group of cash-generating units. The im-pairment test determined that no write-downs were necessary.\n\n The outcome of this valuation exercise is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the executive directors with respect to the future cash inflows from the respective group of cash-generating units, the discount rate used, the rate of growth and other assumptions, and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background and due to the complex nature of the valuation, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n2 As part of our audit, we assessed the methodology employed for the purposes of performing the impairment test, among other things. After matching the future cash inflows used for the calcu-lation against the adopted medium-term business plan of the Group, we assessed the appropri-ateness of the calculation, in particular by coordinating it with general and sector-specific market expectations. We discussed and examined supplementary adjustments to the medium-term business plan for the purposes of the impairment test with the members of the Company's staff responsible. We also assessed whether the basis for including the costs of Group functions was accurate. In the knowledge that even relatively small changes in the discount rate applied can have a material impact on the value of the entity calculated in this way, we focused our testing in particular on the parameters used to determine the discount rate applied, and evaluated the measurement model. In order to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the projections, we assessed the sensitivity analyses performed by the Company and carried out our own sensitivity analyses with respect to those groups of cash-generating units whose carrying amount was only slightly greater than the recoverable amount. Taking into account the information available, we determined that the carrying amounts of the cash-generating units, including the goodwill, were adequately covered by the discounted future cash flows.\n\n Overall, the measurement inputs and assumptions used by the executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also within the ranges considered by us to be reasonable.\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/175/Picture/1 description: The image shows two document icons.

In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n{176}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n*Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report*\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the\n\naggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- W Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- W Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- W Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- W Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n\n{177}------------------------------------------------\n\n- W Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.\n- W Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- W Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- W Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n### *Other legal and regulatory requirements*\n\n*Report on the Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB*\n\n### *Assurance Opinion*\n\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report (hereinafter the \"ESEF documents\") contained in the electronic file WashTec\\_AG\\_KA\\_KLB\\_ESEF\\_2023-12-31.zip and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format (\"ESEF format\"). In accordance with German legal requirements, this assurance work extends only to the conversion of the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the group management report into the ESEF format and therefore relates neither to the information contained within these renderings nor to any other information contained in the electronic file identified above.\n\n{178}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn our opinion, the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report contained in the electronic file identified above and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format. Beyond this assurance opinion and our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the accompanying group management report for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023 contained in the \"Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and on the Group Management Report\" above, we do not express any assurance opinion on the information contained within these renderings or on the other information contained in the electronic file identified above.\n\n### *Basis for the Assurance Opinion*\n\nWe conducted our assurance work on the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report contained in the electronic file identified above in accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB and the IDW Assurance Standard: Assurance Work on the Electronic Rendering, of Financial Statements and Management Reports, Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB (IDW AsS 410 (06.2022)) and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised). Our responsibility in accordance therewith is further described in the \"Group Auditor's Responsibilities for the Assurance Work on the ESEF Documents\" section. Our audit firm applies the IDW Standard on Quality Management: Requirements for Quality Management in the Audit Firm (IDW QMS 1 (09.2022)).\n\n*Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the ESEF Documents*\n\nThe executive directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the ESEF documents including the electronic rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report in accordance with § 328 Abs. 1 Satz 4 Nr. [number] 1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 328 Abs. 1 Satz 4 Nr. 2 HGB.\n\nIn addition, the executive directors of the Company are responsible for such internal control as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of ESEF documents that are free from material non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting process.\n\n### *Group Auditor's Responsibilities for the Assurance Work on the ESEF Documents*\n\nOur objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB, whether due to fraud or error. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the assurance work. We also:\n\n- W Identify and assess the risks of material non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance opinion.\n- W Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance work on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.\n- W Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e., whether the electronic file containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 in the version in force at the date of the consolidated financial statements on the technical specification for this electronic file.\n- W Evaluate whether the ESEF documents provide an XHTML rendering with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and to the audited group management report.\n\n{179}------------------------------------------------\n\nW Evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with the requirements of Articles 4 and 6 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the date of the consolidated financial statements, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML rendering.\n\n### *Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation*\n\nWe were elected as group auditor by the annual general meeting on 15 May 2023. We were engaged by the supervisory board on 9 December 2023. We have been the group auditor of the WashTec AG, Augsburg, without interruption since the financial year 2008.\n\nWe declare that the audit opinions expressed in this auditor's report are consistent with the additional report to the audit committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report).\n\n### *Reference to an other matter – use of the auditor's report*\n\nOur auditor's report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited group management report as well as the assured ESEF documents. The consolidated financial statements and the group management report converted to the ESEF format – including the versions to be filed in the company register – are merely electronic renderings of the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited group management report and do not take their place. In particular, the \"Report on the Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB\" and our assurance opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the assured ESEF documents made available in electronic form.\n\n### *German public auditor responsible for the engagement*\n\nThe German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement is Jürgen Schumann.\n\nMunich, March 22 2024\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nJürgen Schumann ppa.

This was mainly due to the chemicals business, where new customers were acquired, while revenue performance was stable in Equipment and Service.\n\n### Significant increase in EBIT\n\nMainly as a result of the implemented price increases and active cost management, the EBIT of €41.9m was significantly higher than the prior year (€38.0m). The EBIT margin improved to 8.6% (prior year: 7.9%).\n\n### Significant rise in free cash flow\n\nFree cash flow increased significantly to €46.1m (prior year: €16.2m) despite the €9.5m acquisition of the site occupied by the American subsidiary.\n\n{2}------------------------------------------------\n\n### The EBIT margin increased to 11.3% in the fourth quarter\n\n| Q4                              |       | Q4 2023    | Q42022     | Change   |      |\n|---------------------------------|-------|------------|------------|----------|------|\n|                                 |       |            |            | absolute | in % |\n| Revenue                         | €m    | 132.8      | 143.7      | -10.9    | -7.6 |\n| EBIT                            | €m    | 15.0       | 15.4       | -0.4     | -2.6 |\n| EBIT margin                     | %     | 11.3       | 10.7       | 0.6      | 5.6  |\n| EBT                             | €m    | 14.2       | 15.2       | -1.0     | -6.6 |\n| Net income                      | €m    | 11.1       | 11.6       | -0.5     | -4.3 |\n| Number of shares in circulation | units | 13,382,324 | 13,382,324 | –        | –    |\n| Earnings per share              | €     | 0.83       | 0.87       | -0.04    | -4.3 |\n\n### Revenue down in fourth quarter\n\nRevenue of €132.8m was 7.6% down on the record prior-year quarter (€143.7m).\n\n### EBIT at high prior-year level with higher EBIT margin\n\nDespite the lower revenue, the EBIT of €15.0m was on the same high level as in the prior year (€15.4m). The EBIT margin increased to 11.3% (prior year: 10.7%). The implemented cost increases and active cost management contributed to this positive outcome.\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Contents\n\nImage /page/3/Picture/5 description: A close-up shot depicts a series of green, textured strips hanging vertically from a metallic structure above.

Persistently high inflation and the resulting key interest rate hikes, coupled with a generally high level of economic uncertainty, significantly slowed consumption and investment. Tensions with China, the ongoing war in Ukraine and the Middle East conflict also had a noticeable impact on economic development. The German economy has cooled significantly since the end of last year. Contrary to expectations last summer, a recovery failed to materialize in the second half of the year. This ongoing crisis mode has led to increased general economic uncertainty and also made our customers cautious about investing.\n\nWashTec responded to these successive crises in the fiscal year, among other things by adjusting its strategy. In the summer, together with the Supervisory Board, we defined and confirmed the following priorities for the years ahead:\n\n- Total customer care: We continue to focus on maximum customer benefit in everything we do. Based on our portfolio of superior equipment and biodegradable wash chemicals and on our advanced digital platform, we offer carwash operators and consumers the most profitable and most sustainable carwash. With the coordinated, integrated system of carwash equipment, water treatment and chemicals, we enable our customers to achieve the best possible wash results. We see the integration of our entire product and service portfolio – equipment, service and chemicals, embedded in digital solutions – as a source of major growth potential.\n- In regional terms, we will primarily focus on our core regions of Europe and North America in order to better exploit the market potential available there.\n\nFollowing the changes on the Supervisory Board and the Management Board in the new fiscal year, the implementation of this strategic direction will be accelerated in 2024.\n\nIn connection with the regional focus on our defined core markets, we sold the majority of our Chinese subsidiary to the existing management at the end of 2023. The Chinese market will continue to be developed as a distributor market.\n\nOur focus in the ongoing expansion of our digital capabilities is on systematically implementing additional customer benefits. To this end, WashTec entered into a cooperation on in-car payment with Ryd Wash in January 2024. In February 2024, we announced a strategic partnership with Superoperator. This partnership will embed the most advanced digital subscription solution for consumers into our digital service portfolio.\n\nThese realignments will lead to a strengthening of our profitable business growth. The Service and Chemicals business lines will have above-average growth and will benefit from digitalization.\n\nThe WashTec Group achieved a new revenue record of €489.5m in fiscal year 2023, an increase of€7.3m or 1.5% on the prior year (€482.2m). At constant exchange rates, the growth in revenue was 3.4%.\n\nThe revenue growth compared to the prior year was mainly due to a larger contribution from the aftersales business with service and chemicals. Revenue with our chemical products especially developed very positively due to the acquisition of new customers, increasing by 15.6% year on year.\n\nDue to an improvement in gross profit, EBIT rose by 10.3% to €41.9m (prior year: €38.0m). The EBIT margin was 8.6% (prior year: 7.9%). We have therefore delivered, and met our guidance for 2023.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\nOrders received were lower in the reporting year than in the prior year due to the drop in demand in the market as a whole. The lower level of orders received meant that the order backlog at the end of December 2023 was down on the prior year, but it is still high overall compared to the long-term average and secures capacity utilization for the first few months of the new fiscal year.\n\nIn Europe, the equipment business was mainly affected by the general economic uncertainty and by changes in strategic orientation at major customers – such as Total Energies selling all of its service stations in Germany and the Netherlands to Couche-Tard. Renewal of the product portfolio involves start-up and ramp-up costs. Measures such as training for our service employees and design-to-cost issues were addressed in the fourth quarter and are having an impact in the new fiscal year. The good service business and, above all, the very good chemicals business helped to compensate for these issues. In total, EBIT in Europe remained at the prior year's level of €36.2m.\n\nRevenue in North America was maintained at the same level in US dollars as in the prior year. The WashTec Group's business in this region was also adversely affected by the generally subdued demand. Earnings in North America increased significantly by €4.3m to €5.7m. This is mainly due to the efficiency improvement projects launched and successfully implemented in fiscal year 2023, particularly in the areas of supply chain and service.\n\nDespite the uncertain overall economic situation described above, we achieved our targets in 2023 and met our guidance in all respects. With the more sharply focused strategy and accelerated execution, we have laid the basis for further profitable growth.\n\nWe will be helped here not only by the collaborations with digital service partners described above, but also by the high level of research and development expenditure maintained in fiscal year 2023. The focus of this R&D was on developing additional features and functions for the new gantry carwash platform. The new competition-beating digital gantry carwash offers outstanding washing and drying performance at maximum process speed. At the same time,\n\nwe are continuously reducing the ecological footprint. We have made further improvements here through a better understanding of the biological and chemical interrelationships in water treatment, further reducing the amount of fresh water needed and thus helping to address the water shortages caused by climate change in many regions. Another focus was the successful introduction of a modular system for the new JetWash generation, which ensures fast assembly and easy commissioning at customers' sites. As of December 31, 2023, around 70 people were employed in research and development. This represents 4.1% of the workforce and illustrates the importance of innovation to our future success.\n\nFocusing on the entire integrated system of equipment, water treatment and biodegradable chemicals places an increased emphasis on sustainability. Consumers want to wash their cars in the most environmentally friendly way possible, and our own customers – the operators of carwash equipment – are also increasingly concerned about sustainable and cost-effective use of resources. We address this need. With our automated carwashes, water treatment and Green Car Care chemicals, we provide customers with the products they require for this purpose. It is our corporate responsibility to continuously improve and further develop the sustainability aspects of our business model.\n\nSustainability is also an integral part of our business processes. This is very important to us. We therefore continued our extensive reporting in fiscal year 2023, compiling our second voluntary Sustainability Report, the WashTec Sustainability Policy and the WashTec Group Environmental Policy. These documents can be viewed at any time on the Company website a[t https://ir.washtec.de/en/sustainability/. They provide information on our activities and goals](https://ir.washtec.de/en/sustainability/)  in the areas of economic, environmental and social sustainability.\n\nNone of this would have been possible without our employees and their tireless commitment to WashTec. In challenging times like these, it is all the more important that we at WashTec pull together and demonstrate on a daily basis that drive and solidarity are core elements of our corporate culture. On behalf of my colleagues on the Management Board and myself, I would like to thank all our employees for their dedication and hard work in 2023.\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\nFiscal 2023 was not an easy year. Nevertheless, we have steered our company well through these challenging times and worked intensively on our future direction. By adjusting our strategy, we have laid the groundwork for our company to return to a double-digit EBIT margin in the coming years, and our consistent focus on maximizing customer benefit will lead to increasing earnings contributions. We are sure that we have taken the action needed.\n\nThank you very much for your trust and loyalty.\n\nAndreas Pabst CFO/Member of the Management Board\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/9 description: The image shows a close-up of blue, cloth-like strips hanging down, possibly part of a car wash.

The Supervisory Board was directly involved in all decisions of fundamental significance to the Company. It regularly obtained updates on the condition of the Group throughout fiscal year 2023.\n\ndynamism and conviction.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nstances.\n\nThe Supervisory Board also supervised the managerial activities of the Management Board of WashTec AG. This work was based on timely written and verbal reporting by the Management Board to the Supervisory Board. Among other things, the Management Board reported each month in writing to the Supervisory Board about the development of the business. As needed, the Supervisory Board also requested additional reports from the\n\nManagement Board and inspected other relevant Company documentation. Any departure of the actual business development from plans and targets was explained to the Supervisory Board in detail and examined by the Supervisory Board based on the documents presented. The Management Board notably coordinated with the Supervisory Board with regard to the Company's strategic orientation. The Supervisory Board extensively discussed transactions of importance to the Company on the basis of the reports issued by the Management Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board voted on all reports and draft resolutions submitted by the Management Board wherever required by law, the Company's Articles of Association or rules of procedure, after thorough examination and discussion. Beyond the extensive work conducted during the Supervisory Board meetings, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board maintained constant contact with the Management Board and consulted between Supervisory Board meetings in numerous one-on-one discussions with the Management Board on the Company's strategy, planning, business development, risk situation, risk management and compliance. The remaining Supervisory Board members also exchanged information with the Management Board outside of meetings. All members of the Supervisory Board reported in detail to the remaining members on their one-on-one consultations with the Management Board. In fiscal year 2023, notably in light of the ongoing global macroeconomic crises, the plenary Supervisory Board held a total of thirteen meetings (five in-person meetings and eight hybrid meetings, i.e. in-person with virtual attendance option).\n\nThe Supervisory Board and its committees held at least one meeting in each quarter. In addition, various resolutions were adopted outside of meetings by circulation. In plenary meetings, the committee chairpersons regularly informed the Supervisory Board about the work of the committees. A separate report on the work of the committees is provided below. All members of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board additionally convened for a two-day strategy workshop. The Supervisory Board also regularly met without the Management Board.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\nAlongside Management Board and Supervisory Board matters, topics of regular Supervisory Board consultations included market trends, the competitive situation, product development, the development of revenue, earnings and human resources, finances, capital allocation, the main Group companies, the risk management system and the strategic orientation and development of the WashTec Group. The Management Board reported regularly and comprehensively to the Supervisory Board about corporate planning, the course of business, strategic development and the current situation of the Group. The Supervisory Board consequently had a detailed understanding of all major business events and developments at the WashTec Group at all times.\n\nFurthermore, the Supervisory Board examined transactions and actions of the Management Board requiring approval and decided upon the granting of such approval. The current business situation and the Company's financial performance, financial position and cash flows were discussed on a regular basis in comparison to budgeted figures.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Supervisory Board also addressed succession planning for the Management Board. On February 28, 2024, the Supervisory Board appointed Mr. Michael Drolshagen as the Company's new Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) with effect from May 1, 2024. He succeeds Dr. Ralf Koeppe, whose membership of the Management Board ended by mutual agreement on February 29, 2024.\n\nOther individual topics addressed in meetings were as follows:\n\n- Discussion, audit and adoption of the annual and consolidated financial statements, the combined management report and the non-financial statement of WashTec AG for fiscal year 2022 (first quarter)\n- Use of net profit (first quarter)\n- Resolution on the agenda for the Annual General Meeting (first quarter)\n- Strategy workshop (second quarter)\n- Consultation on the quarterly statements (second and fourth quarters)\n- Consultation on the half-year report (third quarter)\n- Selection and proposal procedure for auditor from 2024\n- Supervisory Board matters (ongoing)\n- Management Board matters (ongoing)\n- Changes on the board\n- Management Board and Supervisory Board remuneration\n- Review and approval of the non-financial statement and the diversity policy\n- Declaration of Conformity and regular compliance update\n- Sales and marketing strategies and projects; global service\n- Digital transformation\n- Sustainability/ESG\n- WashTec Obeya Initiative\n- Status, strategy and processes in North America and China\n- Product development, processes and projects, in particular with regard to SmartCare\n- Annual planning for 2024 and medium-term planning\n\nKey topics at the March 25, 2024 meeting for adoption of the financial statements comprised discussion of the annual financial statements of WashTec AG, of the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2023 together with adoption and approval of the annual and consolidated financial statements, and of the combined management report. It also addressed the Remuneration Report for fiscal year 2023.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Composition of the Supervisory Board\n\nIn accordance with the Articles of Association of WashTec AG, the Supervisory Board consists of six members elected by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Chairman of the Company's Supervisory Board, Dr. Günter Blaschke, notified the Company's Management Board on November 8, 2023 that he would be stepping down from the Supervisory Board effective December 31, 2023. The decision was made for personal reasons and by mutual agreement with the Supervisory Board and the Management Board.\n\nOn December 19, 2023, the Supervisory Board unanimously elected Ulrich Bellgardt – member of the Supervisory Board since 2014 and Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board – as the new Chairman of the Supervisory Board of WashTec AG effective January 1, 2024. Peter Wiedemann, member of the Supervisory Board since 2022, was elected as the new Deputy Chairman of the Company's Supervisory Board effective January 1, 2024.\n\nFollowing Dr. Blaschke's departure from the Supervisory Board, a resolution on the election of a new member of the Supervisory Board will be adopted at the 2024 Annual General Meeting.\n\n### Report on the work of the committees\n\nIn the reporting year, there were six committees (Audit Committee, Personnel Committee, Nomination Committee, Innovation and Production Committee, Sales Strategy Committee and Corporate Strategy and Sustainability Committee) whose primary purpose was to prepare Supervisory Board meetings and resolutions for the plenary Supervisory Board. The committees can also be assigned decision-making powers within the scope of mandatory [statutory provisions. The composition of the committees is shown on](#page-100-0) page 101. A brief overview of the work of the committees in the reporting year is provided in the following.\n\nThe Audit Committee convened six times in the fiscal year under review. Four meetings of the committee were held in person, while one was held as a hybrid meeting and one as a virtual meeting by video conference. Two meetings were held in the presence of the auditor. The Committee primarily consulted on the annual financial statements of WashTec AG and the consolidated financial statements along with the combined management report, the non-financial statement, supervision of the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of the internal control system, risk management system, the work of Internal Audit and capital allocation. Other topics of the meetings were the upcoming change of auditor for fiscal year 2024 together with the selection and proposal procedure required by law for this purpose. Based on the proposal of the Audit Committee, the entire Supervisory Board will propose KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft to the Annual General Meeting as the auditor for 2024.\n\nWithout exception, the Audit Committee discussed the Group's quarterly reports and halfyear financial report in detail prior to publication. It also defined the focal points of the audit for the reporting year, issued the audit engagement to the auditor, addressed new accounting and reporting requirements (EU taxonomy) and consulted on compliance matters.\n\nThe Personnel Committee met ten times during the reporting year. Four meetings of the committee were held in person and six meetings were held as virtual meetings by video conference. Its meetings focused on changes on the Management Board, Management Board remuneration and long-term succession planning.\n\nThe Nomination Committee met twice during the reporting year held as a virtual meeting. One meeting was held in connection with the expiration of the Supervisory Board mandates for Dr. Blaschke and Mr. Bellgardt at the end of the 2023 Annual General Meeting. The Nomination Committee decided to recommend that the Supervisory Board should nominate Dr. Blaschke and Mr. Bellgardt for re-election at the 2023 Annual General Meeting. The committee also met in connection with the resignation of Dr. Blaschke.\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Innovation and Production Committee convened three times in the fiscal year under review, in one case for a two-day meeting. All meetings of the committee were held in person. The focus was primarily on organization, processes, strategic product development projects, digitalization and product sustainability.\n\nThe Sales strategy committee met twice during the reporting year, both times in person. The main focus was on sales and marketing activities, developments in a number of core markets and the outlook and targets for sales and marketing activities, primarily in the North America region.\n\nThe Corporate Strategy and Sustainability Committee met twice during the reporting year, with one meeting held in person and one in hybrid form. In addition to the continuous improvement of sustainability reporting, key topics included the preparation of the annual strategy workshop and the further development of WashTec's sustainability strategy.\n\nGood collaborative working relationships were assured at all times.\n\n### Individualized disclosure of meeting attendance\n\nMembers' attendance at the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees was 99% in fiscal year 2023. The attendance of the members of the Supervisory Board at the meetings of the Supervisory Board and of the committees in fiscal year 2023 is disclosed on an individual basis in the following:\n\n| Meetings attended/total number of meetings | Supervisory Board |      | Audit Committee |      | Personnel Committee |      | Nomination Committee |      | Innovation and Production Committee |      | Sales Strategy Committee |      | Corporate Strategy and Sustainability Committee |      |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|------|-----------------|------|---------------------|------|----------------------|------|-------------------------------------|------|--------------------------|------|-------------------------------------------------|------|\n|                                            | Number            | in % | Number          | in % | Number              | in % | Number               | in % | Number                              | in % | Number                   | in % | Number                                          | in % |\n| Dr. Günter Blaschke (Chairman)¹            | 13/13             | 100% | 6/6             | 100% | 10/10               | 100% | 1/1                  | 100% | 3/3                                 | 100% | 2/2                      | 100% | 2/2                                             | 100% |\n| Ulrich Bellgardt (Deputy Chairman)¹        | 13/13             | 100% | 6/6             | 100% | 10/10               | 100% | 1/1                  | 100% | 3/3                                 | 100% | 2/2                      | 100% | 2/2                                             | 100% |\n| Dr. Hans Liebler                           | 13/13             | 100% | 6/6             | 100% |                     |      | 2/2                  | 100% |                                     |      |                          |      |                                                 |      |\n| Heinrich von Portatius                     | 13/13             | 100% | 6/6             | 100% |                     |      |                      |      |                                     |      | 2/2                      | 100% |                                                 |      |\n| Dr. Alexander Selent                       | 13/13             | 100% | 6/6             | 100% | 9/10                | 90%  |                      |      |                                     |      |                          |      | 2/2                                             | 100% |\n| Peter Wiedemann                            | 13/13             | 100% |                 |      |                     |      | 2/2                  | 100% | 3/3                                 | 100% |                          |      |                                                 |      |\n|                                            |                   | 100% |                 | 100% |                     | 97%  |                      | 100% |                                     | 100% |                          | 100% |                                                 | 100% |\n\n*¹ Dr. Blaschke was a member and the Chairman of the Nomination Committee until November 13, 2023; Mr. Bellgardt has been a member and the Chairman of the Nomination Committee since November 14, 2023.*\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Conflicts of interest\n\nIn accordance with Recommendation E.1 of the German Corporate Governance Code 2022, each member of the Supervisory Board must disclose any conflicts of interest to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board without delay. No such conflicts of interest were disclosed in the reporting period.\n\n### Corporate governance\n\nThe Management Board and the Supervisory Board regard corporate governance as an ongoing process and regularly address compliance with the stipulations of the German Corporate Governance Code. They have conducted a joint review of corporate governance. On December 19, 2023, the Management Board and Supervisory Board submitted an up[dated Declaration of Conformity, which is reprinted beginning on page 97. The Audit Com](#page-96-0)mittee also consulted in-depth on the compliance organization and corporate audits. Compliance updates are a regular topic of Audit Committee meetings. The new members also had the opportunity to have discussions with senior management.\n\nThe Company subscribed to a specialist periodical on apprenticeship training and professional development on behalf of the Supervisory Board in the 2023 reporting year. Supervisory Board members also took part in various internal and external professional development events. As a fundamental part of the onboarding process for the newly elected members of the Supervisory Board, the Company provides onboarding information and personal discussions are held with members of the Management Board.\n\n### Remuneration system for the Management Board\n\nIn its meeting of March 24, 2021, the entire Supervisory Board updated and adopted the Management Board remuneration system. The remuneration system for the Management Board was approved by the 2021 Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Management Board remuneration system is geared to the responsibilities and performance of the Management Board members and to the situation of the Company. The overall remuneration of members of the Management Board is made up of monetary and non-mon-\n\netary as well as fixed and variable components and is linked overall to sustained growth of the Company.\n\nAll remuneration components are structured in such a way that they are appropriate, both individually and in the aggregate, and do not encourage the taking of unreasonable risks. The remuneration of Management Board and Supervisory Board members is described in greater detail in the Remuneration Report, which is available on the Company's website.\n\n### Audit of the 2023 annual and consolidated financial statements\n\nIn accordance with the resolution of the Annual General Meeting on May 15, 2023, the Audit Committee engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH, Munich, to audit the annual financial statements of WashTec AG and the consolidated financial statements and combined management report of WashTec AG and the Group.\n\nThe auditor audited the annual financial statements for fiscal year 2023 prepared in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB), the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) applicable in the EU and the combined management report of WashTec AG and the Group, and issued an unqualified audit opinion in each case. In the process, the auditor addressed in depth the focal points of the audit specified by the Audit Committee for the reporting period in the audit engagement. No material weaknesses were reported in the internal control and risk management systems.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers also audited the annual financial statements of the main Group companies of WashTec AG.\n\nThe Audit Committee verified and monitored the independence and qualification of the auditor and addressed audit quality both before and during the course of the audit.\n\nIn addition, the auditor verified and confirmed that the Management Board has established an appropriate monitoring system in accordance with Section 91 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) that is capable of identifying, at an early stage, any developments that might affect the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Supervisory Board examined in detail the annual financial statements, the consolidated financial statements, the combined management report, the non-financial statement of WashTec AG and the Group and the Management Board's proposal on the appropriation of distributable profit. The auditor's audit reports were made available to all members of the Supervisory Board in good time and were discussed in detail both by the Audit Committee at its meeting on February 29, 2024 and at the Supervisory Board meeting for adoption of the financial statements on March 25, 2024. Both meetings were attended by the auditor. All questions posed by members of the Supervisory Board were answered in detail. During preparation and performance of the audit, the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee regularly exchanged information with the auditor without the involvement of the Management Board. The Chairman of the Audit Committee regularly discussed the progress of the audit with the auditor and reported on this to the Audit Committee.\n\nNo objections were raised during the Supervisory Board's review. At its meeting for adoption of the financial statements, the Supervisory Board approved the annual financial statements of WashTec AG and the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Management Board. The annual financial statements of WashTec AG are thus formally adopted. The Management Board's proposal on the appropriation of distributable profit was approved by the Supervisory Board following in-depth review.\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board, I would like to thank the members of the Management Board and all of our employees for their active commitment and constructive teamwork during the past fiscal year. The Supervisory Board would also like to thank Dr. Günter Blaschke, our long-standing Chairman of the Supervisory Board, who stepped down on December 31, for his unwavering commitment and dedicated service. In his almost 10 years as Chairman of the Supervisory Board, he has defined an era.\n\nThe Supervisory Board would also like to thank Dr Koeppe for his great commitment, with which he has positioned WashTec well in economically challenging times, and wishes him all the best for the future, both professionally and personally.\n\nAugsburg, March 2024\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board\n\nUlrich Bellgardt Chairman of the Supervisory Board\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-16-0\"></span>Sustainable success with our integrated system.\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/5 description: The image shows a car wash machine with large rotating brushes and water.

In addition to financial aspects, supplementary disclosures must also be provided on certain non-financial aspects to the extent that they are material within the meaning of Section 289c (3) HGB. The non-financial aspects on which information must be provided comprise environmental, employee-related and social matters, respect for human rights, and combating corruption and bribery. It is stated in the report whether each aspect is material to the Company and the general public. The reporting obligations under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation can be found under \"Disclosures on Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\"\n\nPreparation of the \"Separate Non-Financial Report\" was based on the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards, 2016 version). Policies are described in accordance with the requirements of GRI 103: \"Management Approach\".\n\nA detailed report on risk management and a description of prevailing risks that could have a material impact on the further development of the WashTec Group can be found in the Combined Management Report in Section 4 \"Outlook, opportunities and risk report\" [starting on page 82. No material risks from th](#page-81-0)e Company's business activities, business relationships, products and services have been identified that are highly likely to have, or will have, severe adverse impacts on the foregoing aspects. The impacts of climate-related matters on the business model and the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the WashTec Group are explained in the Combined Management Report under [section 1, \"General information about the Group\" starting on page 56 a](#page-55-0)nd i[n Note 2 o](#page-116-0)f the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe WashTec Group began implementing the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) in fiscal year 2023. This includes developing a project plan for implementation and reporting in accordance with the CSRD from fiscal year 2024 and analyzing the requirements of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). Work has also begun on the materiality analysis. In addition, a voluntary sustainability report was once again prepared for fiscal year 2022, providing information about activities and goals in terms of economic, environmental and social sustainability. This is based on the Global Reporting [Initiative \\(GRI\\) standards, 2021 version, and is available on the Company's website at](https://ir.washtec.de/en/sustainability/)  *https://ir.washtec.de/en/sustainability*.\n\nThe content of the Separate Non-financial Report is reviewed by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board is supported in this by Internal Audit.\n\n### Description of the business model and diversity policy\n\nDescriptions of the business model, external factors influencing the business, strategy, and research and development activities can be found [in the Combined Management Report in](#page-55-0)  section 1 \"General information about the Group,\" starting on page 56.\n\nThe diversity policy is described i[n the Combined Management Report in section 8.1](#page-96-0)  \"Declaration of Conformity\" starting on page 97.\n\n### Human rights and anti-corruption\n\nIn a thorough revision of the WashTec Code of Conduct (previously the WashTec Code of Ethics) in 2023, WashTec further developed the clear guidelines for law-abiding conduct and compliance with high ethical standards that the Company has had in place since 2005 and adapted them to new requirements such as the German Supply Chain Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz). The WashTec Code of Conduct includes key guidance on how employees are expected to interact both with each other and with customers, suppliers,\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nconsultants and authorities. All WashTec Group managers and employees in sensitive areas such as Sales, Procurement, Human Resources and Finance receive regular training, which concludes with a test and certification.\n\nAmong other things, the WashTec Code of Conduct also sets out rules for combating corruption and bribery. WashTec expects employees and business partners worldwide to comply with all legal requirements. The WashTec Code of Conduct for Suppliers, which likewise underwent thorough revision in the reporting year, requires business partners to comply with high ethical standards, including clear requirements regarding respect for human rights and the environment.\n\nThe project to implement the Supply Chain Act at WashTec included not only a thorough revision and update of the WashTec Code of Conduct and WashTec Supplier Code of Conduct, but also a review and adjustment of internal structures and processes in order to fully comply with the requirements for responsible supply chain management, even though WashTec does not reach the thresholds for application of the Supply Chain Act as of January 1, 2024.\n\nAs a machinery and mechanical engineering company, the WashTec Group is subject to numerous international rules and regulations, all of which are directed towards transparent and responsible supply chains. Most suppliers are located in Europe and America. WashTec thus largely operates with its production and supply chain in countries that maintain high standards in terms of respect for human rights.\n\nWith their legally binding signature on the WashTec Supplier Code of Conduct, WashTec obtains the commitment of all material business partners to comply with the principles and rules it contains. Any deviation from the rules on responsibility and integrity in corporate governance is identified in audits – such as supplier audits – that are an integral part our business activities.\n\nIn further support of the compliance system, a whistleblower system introduced in 2016 allows employees and others to raise concerns – anonymously if they prefer – and to report circumstances that may indicate a violation of the law or Company policies. Any such indications are investigated and appropriate action taken if grounds for suspicion or violations are found. As part of the implementation of the Supply Chain Act, the existing whistleblower system was supplemented with options for reporting human rights and environmental violations. In addition, processes were reviewed and adjusted as needed for implementation of the EU Whistleblower Directive (Directive EU 2019/1937) and the national implementing legislation in all countries where WashTec has subsidiaries.\n\nThe processes in place are considered to be appropriate and viable for the identification and elimination of questionable ethical and human rights matters.\n\n### Environmental matters\n\nThe Separate Combined Non-Financial Report 2022 assessed environmental matters as material. This assessment remains valid for the present report. In fiscal year 2023, water consumption was assessed as a new material aspect alongside the reduction of carbon emissions.\n\nIn addition, planning continued as to when and under what conditions the WashTec Group can become climate-neutral in the countries where it has production sites (including service and sales). The largest source of energy consumption and carbon emissions at WashTec is the vehicle park. Technological developments with regard to how vehicles are powered and the related infrastructure are therefore crucial to the achievement of climate neutrality. A further factor is the implementation of projects of our own. These include projects to further reduce energy consumption, convert heating systems, modernize the equipment and technologies used and expand photovoltaic electricity generation. Conditions in each country and region also influence the achievement of climate neutrality. This includes charging infrastructure and a country's general philosophy with regard to climate-friendly transportation. Another, primarily regional factor is utilities' energy mix and CO2 equivalent in the supply of heat and power.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Carbon emissions\n\nThe goal of environmental compatibility in business activities is based on awareness of social responsibility and the aim of making WashTec even more sustainable. In addition, the Company is subject to legal requirements with respect to environmentally relevant activities and takes appropriate measures to ensure compliance.\n\nLong before the energy crisis forced companies to actively address the issues of energy economy and sustainability, WashTec established a cross-site and cross-functional environment and energy team. This team continued in 2023 to help identify matters of relevance to the environment and energy and to implement related improvement measures. This contributed to improvements in sustainability and reductions in energy demand, resource consumption and waste. The necessary human, financial and capital resources were quantified and allocated in budget planning. On a higher level, country organization and cluster management teams are informed at regular meetings about the various environment-related projects and their status and outcomes. The full Management Board is regularly briefed on environment-related measures and approves budget-relevant measures.\n\nLessons were also learned from last year's energy crisis and suitable action was taken. Among other things, the energy task force established in response to the crisis was retained and now remains in place alongside the existing energy and environment team. The energy task force develops, evaluates, coordinates and monitors the implementation of various energy-saving measures, primarily during the heating periods.\n\n### Objective/policy\n\nWashTec targets a sustained 30% reduction in carbon emissions in the countries with production sites by 2025 relative to the 2019 baseline. The emission figures for 2023 amounted to 5,779t CO2e\\* (prior year: 7,008t CO2e\\*). This figure is calculated from energy use in production, administration and the service units and includes all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG) in Germany, the Czech Republic, USA and China. In the period from 2019 to 2023, the WashTec Group reduced carbon emissions by 2,746t CO2e\\* or 32%\\*. The prior-year figure, for the period from 2019 to 2022, was a reduction in carbon emissions by 1,519t CO2e\\* or 18%\\*.\n\nThe sale of the Chinese subsidiary in 2023 has virtually no impact on the above target for reducing carbon emissions. In recent years, the Chinese company's carbon emissions constantly accounted for around 1% of the total carbon emissions of the production sites included in the target.\n\n### Measures\n\nAs part of the Environment and Energy Roadmap 2025, an array of measures are being implemented to reduce the WashTec Group's carbon footprint. The focus is on the electrification of the entire fleet. The current car policy, which includes a system of incentives via mobility budgets, a car allowance and all-electric vehicles, provides the basis for needs-based personal mobility. With regard to motor vehicles, additional hybrid and all-electric vehicles were procured in 2023. In addition, the car policy was revised so that only all-electric vehicles can be ordered alongside diesel vehicles. The proportion of electric vehicles increased significantly in 2023 compared to the prior year. A further increase in the share of electric vehicles in the fleet is expected by 2024. Charging infrastructure for electric vehicles and\n\n*<sup>\\*</sup>Full billing data is not yet available for 2023 as some providers do not bill WashTec until later in the year. The figures are therefore partly based on the prior year, extrapolation or self meter readings. The carbon emissions for 2022 have been restated for the same reason as the necessary billing data was not available at the time.*\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\nelectric industrial trucks has been installed at all production sites in Germany. Specific challenges related to fleet electrification include the market availability of efficient and economically viable electric vehicles, the expansion of the charging network and the differing tax treatment of electric vehicles in the countries where subsidiaries operate. Full conversion to electric forklifts in Augsburg was planned for 2023. This cannot be completed until 2024 due to delivery delays by manufacturers.\n\nAs planned, WashTec conducted an initial analysis of opportunities to reduce carbon emissions in the US in 2023 as part of a project under the Environment and Energy Roadmap 2025. Particularly important factors include local conditions such as vehicle size requirements, long distances compared to European countries and available infrastructure. The biggest challenges here are the lack of nationwide charging infrastructure for electric vehicles and the lacking widespread availability of diesel fuel, which is far more efficient than gasoline. In addition, how the companies are supplied with energy depends on the local conditions. This means that carbon-neutral energy is not universally available due to a lack of infrastructure. There is expected to be further potential for reducing the Group's carbon emissions in the US, as the US subsidiary is one of the Company's largest single carbon emitters. Depending on fleet replacement cycles and delivery lead times for more efficient vehicles, improvements may not be fully realized until subsequent years.\n\nCars, vans and forklifts are only part of the Company's mobility. Accordingly, WashTec continues to work on implementing the mobility policy for the Augsburg plant. This aims to optimize mobility throughout the plant and includes national and international travel as well as on-site transportation. Its recommendations and measures are designed to realize the available potential for improvement in the carbon footprint. All aspects of intermodal mobility – the use of different modes of transport for a single trip – must be considered here in accordance with legal requirements. In addition, the dialog on mobility solutions is being continued with city center businesses and the City of Augsburg.\n\nImplementation of the zero-emission strategy that follows from the operational mobility management policy has already begun and will make the vehicle fleet in Germany 100% carbon-neutral by 2030. Across Europe, the WashTec Group vehicle fleet is to consist of over 80% alternative propulsion vehicles by 2030. Trials are underway within the scope of what is technically feasible.\n\nThe production plants in Germany have been supplied exclusively with certified green electricity since the beginning of 2021. Moreover, the extension of district heating to additional buildings at the Augsburg site continued in 2023. The heating in the production facilities was replaced with radiant heating panels. These are significantly more energy-efficient and make for less carbon-intensive heating. Their installation at other locations and in other buildings is currently being examined. This contributes significantly to reducing the WashTec Group's carbon footprint.\n\nData transparency and validity are crucial to ensuring continuous reductions in energy consumption. For this purpose, WashTec implemented energy data software in 2021. The software was supplemented to include additional meters in 2023. This makes it possible to analyze, for example, the specific electricity consumption of each building at the Augsburg site or the main energy consumers. The resulting transparency enables even more detailed consumption analysis in order to identify further potential energy savings and take action to realize them. This led to a 23% reduction in energy requirements (power and heat) compared to 2022 at the production plants in Germany and the Czech Republic. WashTec plans to install more meters on an ongoing basis. The possibility is currently being examined of metering other significant energy forms (heat, compressed air, etc.).\n\nEmployees are continually educated and motivated with regard to the importance of environmentally conscious conduct. Suggestions for energy savings and environmentally conscious conduct have been received through the employee suggestion scheme.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Processes/due diligence\n\nThe global carbon footprint analysis for the WashTec Group covers all global production sites, meaning those in Germany, the Czech Republic, the United States and China, including their sales and service activities. Calculation of the data is done on the basis of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG) and, among other things, with the aid of databases such as \"GEMIS\" and \"DEFRA\". The categories covered are, in Scope 1 (\"Direct GHG emissions and removals\") and in Scope 2 (\"Indirect GHG emissions from imported energy\"). Specifically, these comprise emissions from in-house heat generation, the corporate vehicle fleet, air conditioning, purchased district heat and purchased electricity.\n\nThe company is working on optimizing the processes for data collection, data validation and completeness for the determination of Scope 3 emissions for Germany according to the GHG. This process is at an advanced stage but has not yet been concluded. For this reason, information on Scope 3 emissions is not published.\n\n### Outcomes\n\nMulti-year comparison of carbon emissions in the countries with production sites (Germany, Czech Republic, USA and China):\n\nImage /page/33/Figure/6 description: The image contains two bar charts comparing CO2 emissions. The first chart, titled \"CO₂e Tons total - Scope 1 & 2\", shows the total CO2 emissions in tons for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from 2019 to 2023. In 2019, Scope 1 emissions were 6,117 tons and Scope 2 emissions were 2,408 tons. In 2020, Scope 1 emissions were 5,778 tons and Scope 2 emissions were 1,907 tons. In 2021, Scope 1 emissions were 5,742 tons and Scope 2 emissions were 1,478 tons. In 2022, Scope 1 emissions were 5,795 tons and Scope 2 emissions were 1,213 tons. In 2023, Scope 1 emissions were 4,996 tons and Scope 2 emissions were 783 tons. The second chart, titled \"CO₂e Tons/€m revenue - Scope 1 & 2\", shows the CO2 emissions per million euros of revenue for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from 2019 to 2023. In 2019, Scope 1 emissions were 14.0 tons/€m and Scope 2 emissions were 5.5 tons/€m. In 2020, Scope 1 emissions were 15.3 tons/€m and Scope 2 emissions were 5.0 tons/€m. In 2021, Scope 1 emissions were 13.4 tons/€m and Scope 2 emissions were 3.4 tons/€m. In 2022, Scope 1 emissions were 12.0 tons/€m and Scope 2 emissions were 2.5 tons/€m. In 2023, Scope 1 emissions were 10.2 tons/€m and Scope 2 emissions were 1.6 tons/€m.\n\nThe main factors contributing to the year-on-year reduction in carbon emissions in fiscal year 2023 were the ongoing conversion of the heating systems in Augsburg to district heating, maintaining the new lower indoor temperature level, vehicle fleet optimization (such as the use of alternative powertrains) and temperature optimization in the painting process. These measures were already partially implemented by the end of 2022 in connection with the acute energy crisis and reached the targeted savings potential in 2023. Replacing additional LPG forklifts with electric forklifts, active use of waste heat and investment in\n\n*\\*Full billing data is not yet available for 2023 as some providers do not bill WashTec until later in the year. The figures are therefore partly based on the prior year, extrapolation or self meter readings. The carbon emissions for 2022 have been restated for the same reason as the necessary billing data was not available at the time.*\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\nenergy-efficient production machinery and infrastructure such as LED lighting, lighting sensors and compressors contributed to a further reduction in carbon emissions. The latter measures apply to all sites in Germany and the Czech Republic. As they were implemented over the course of the year, their full contribution to carbon reduction will not be realized until 2024.\n\n### Water consumption\n\nThe most important resource for the operation of WashTec vehicle wash equipment is water – primarily the water used in carwashes operated by customers. Automated wash equipment, especially when operated in combination with water treatment, contributes significantly to reducing water consumption associated with washing vehicles. By recycling process water, our water treatment systems can significantly reduce the consumption of fresh water.\n\nDepending on the carwash configuration, the dimensioning of the water treatment system, the selected wash programs, the number of washes and the types of vehicles, significant volumes of fresh water can be saved. A WashTec gantry carwash with a water treatment system uses only about one-fifth as much water as manual washing.\n\n### Objective/policy\n\nWashTec aims to promote the resource-efficient operation of vehicle wash equipment by minimizing the water consumption of systems in use with customers. The goal is for customers to be convinced by the sustainability approach of WashTec water treatment systems by 2025.\n\n### Measures\n\nOne key measure to convince customers of the sustainability approach of WashTec water treatment systems is to promote such systems more prominently in sales activities.\n\nFollowing activities in 2022 to define sales targets and communication measures, produce information material and conduct mailing campaigns, WashTec launched an international certification program for sustainable carwash sites in June 2023.\n\nThe certification program aims to provide consumers with additional transparency for carwash purchase decisions and to help operators to successfully publicize their commitment to sustainable vehicle washing.\n\nCertification as a sustainable carwash site requires the satisfaction of three criteria: the use of sustainable washing chemicals from the AUWA Green Car Care product range, efficient operation through the use of modern WashTec carwash equipment and the deployment of a water treatment system.\n\nThis prominent positioning of water treatment systems as one of three key factors for certification as a sustainably operated carwash site creates additional incentives for our customers to invest in water treatment equipment.\n\nThe digital integration of WashTec water treatment systems into the mywashtec platform introduced in 2023 and the resulting benefits for operators in terms of transparency, monitoring and convenience with regard to water provide extensive additional scope for convincing new and existing customers of the sustainability approach in our water treatment systems.\n\n### Processes/due diligence\n\nThe Group monitors the proportion of the installed base of WashTec automatic vehicle wash equipment in the field that is equipped with a water treatment system. An increase in this proportion reflects the extent to which our customers are convinced by the sustainability approach of our water treatment systems.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe proportion of the installed base of WashTec automatic vehicle wash equipment in the field that is equipped with a water treatment system increased slightly in 2023 compared to the prior year.\n\n### Employee-related matters\n\nThe Separate Combined Non-Financial Report 2022 assessed employee-related matters as material. This assessment remains valid for the present report. Close teamwork with our employees and related matters are key factors in our corporate success. In particular, workplace safety and health are a high priority that WashTec is committed to ensuring for employees. This also reflects the Company's responsibility towards employees.\n\n### Objective/policy\n\nAttractive human resources policies are a basis of the WashTec Group's business success and key to holding our market position. Our social contribution includes providing and creating a secure supply of jobs and apprenticeships. This is done in compliance with the respective national legal requirements. In Germany, these include:\n\n- W Collective bargaining agreements at each site and minimum wage requirements\n- W Equal treatment laws and anti-discrimination regulations (in Germany, the General Act on Equal Treatment)\n- W Rules on the assignment of management positions, on employee rights and on leadership positions in the private and public sectors\n- W Workplace regulations\n- W Requirements of employers' liability insurance institutions.\n\nThe main objective in occupational safety and health is to protect the health of employees. This is ensured by maintaining the highest possible safety standards throughout the business. Reducing accidents, accident severity and injuries is the goal of all managers and employees. Despite all preventive measures, there is still a residual risk that unfortunately cannot be completely eliminated. WashTec is nevertheless committed to a vision zero philosophy based on the conviction that every accident is avoidable.\n\n### Measures\n\nRegular review of potential or existing hazards leads to a reduction in incidents, near misses and accidents. On the basis of the identified potential hazards, measures are derived, planned and implemented. A further aim alongside occupational safety is to identify and implement aids that reduce physical effort as part of health management. These analyses are supported by training courses and workplace-specific instruction provided on a mandatory schedule in our training tool.\n\n### Processes/due diligence\n\nAll activities for maintaining high standards of occupational safety are managed using the WashTec Message app. This integrates the entire reporting chain and has the standard features for reporting accidents and near misses. On the basis of the reported incidents, scope for improvement and risks are identified in order to take targeted action to enhance occupational safety. In addition, all accidents are analyzed in terms of the type of accident and injury. This makes it possible to identify accident blackspots and counteract them with training, instruction, or additional personal protective equipment. The WashTec Message app can also be used to carry out workplace inspections and report vehicle accidents. A digital solution is used to prepare risk assessments. The entire process for ensuring high occupational safety standards is part of our Integrated Management System.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Outcomes\n\nOne of the most important metrics in management reviews is the accident rate. This is determined for the entire Group. Continuous improvement of HSE processes and management systems over the years has ensured that the number of occupational accidents is consistently below the industry average reported by the employers' liability insurance association. There were no occupational accidents in fiscal year 2023 with fatal or serious injuries, meaning with lasting injury or resulting in a pension entitlement.\n\nThe number of occupational accidents per million hours worked, at 4.2 in the 2023 reporting year as in the prior year, was well below the industry average for 2022 (20.4) reported by the employers' liability insurance association.\n\n### Social matters\n\nAll activities surrounding responsible management of the working relationship with employees fit together in a closely interlocking package of measures. Factors shaping the human resources strategy include the globalization of the business activities, rapid adaptation of work processes, workforce age structure and needs relating to digitalization and new ways of working. In collaboration with management at our individual operating sites, this results in a detailed picture of the measures needed.\n\nSuccessful corporate development is rooted in detailed awareness of the needs and potential of our workforce at all locations. The Human Resources (HR) function, which is under the direction of the CEO, coordinates cross-cutting measures. These are implemented by local HR managers. The principles guiding the development of our HR strategy are based on the Corporate Philosophy, the Corporate Guidelines and national legal requirements at our operating locations.\n\nIn 2021, a diversity policy was formulated for WashTec in close collaboration with the diversity team. This sets out rules for respectful interaction. Activities to promote respectful interaction among the workforce are headed by the diversity team, which is made up of two\n\ndiversity officers and three additional members from the Management Board, the Works Council and HR. In addition, diversity ambassadors disseminate the subject of diversity together with related guidance across all corporate units and levels.\n\nThe development of our employee and social program is based in particular on:\n\n- W Participative working methods, such as cross-departmental teams\n- W A consistent and long-term employment policy\n- W Constructive communication between employer and employees\n- W Intensified training and professional development\n- W Equal treatment, equal opportunities and diversity.\n\nIn addition to our employee development activities, the Company has also selected a number of social projects for support, primarily involving local non-profit organizations.\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Disclosures on Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation\n\n### General disclosures/principles\n\nWith its Sustainable Finance Action Plan, the European Commission pursues the goal of channeling capital flows into environmentally sustainable activities. One measure towards this goal is the introduction of a uniform classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities (under the EU Taxonomy Regulation). Under delegated acts and pronouncements by the European Commission supplementing Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088), companies that are subject to an obligation to publish non-financial information pursuant to the CSR Directive (EU Directive 2014/95/EU) are required to comply with continuously increasing reporting obligations.\n\nThey are required to disclose, with reference to six specified objectives (Article 9 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation), how and to what extent their business activities are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable. In particular, non-financial reporting must include the following performance indicators:\n\n- W The proportion of turnover (i.e., revenue) derived from products or services associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable under the Taxonomy Regulation.\n- W The proportion of capital expenditure (CapEx) and the proportion of operating expenditure (OpEx) related to assets or processes associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable under the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nThe six environmental objectives in the EU Taxonomy Regulation are:\n\n- I. Climate change mitigation\n- II. Climate change adaptation\n- III. Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- IV. Transition to a circular economy\n- V. Pollution prevention and control\n- VI. Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nEconomic activities are Taxonomy-eligible if they fall under the economic activities listed in Annex I and II and the associated amendments of the Climate Delegated Act or Annex I to IV of the Environmental Delegated Act (referred to in the following as the \"Delegated Acts issued in this connection\").\n\nUnder Article 3 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, economic activities are Taxonomy-aligned if they:\n\n- W Make a substantial contribution to one or more of the six objectives in accordance with Articles 10 to 16 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation,\n- W Do no significant harm (\"DNSH\") with regard to any of the five additional objectives in accordance with Article 17 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation,\n- W Are carried out in compliance with the minimum safeguards (for occupational safety and health and human rights) laid down in Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and\n- W Comply with technical screening criteria established by the European Commission.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Reporting in fiscal year 2023\n\nFor fiscal year 2023, with regard to the two climate objectives, it is necessary to report on the proportion of turnover, CapEx and OpEx associated both with economic activities that are Taxonomy-eligible and those that are not Taxonomy-eligible and with economic activities that are Taxonomy-aligned and those that are not Taxonomy-aligned. With regard to the four remaining environmental objectives, it is necessary to report for fiscal year 2023 on the proportion of turnover, CapEx and OpEx associated with economic activities that are Taxonomy-eligible and those that are not Taxonomy-eligible. Qualitative explanations must additionally be provided for all six objectives.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation contains language and terms that remain subject to interpretation and could lead to changes in reporting if clarified by the EU at a later date. There is a risk that this would change the assessment of the reported figures. Our interpretation is presented below.\n\n### Economic activities\n\nOn the basis of its business model, the WashTec Group has assessed all economic activities listed for the six objectives listed in the Delegated Acts issued in this connection.\n\nThe WashTec Group's economic activities are based on the aggregation of product groups. These comprise:\n\n- W The development, manufacture and sale of vehicle wash equipment, including peripherals, and water recovery systems together with related services (hereafter \"Equipment and Service\")\n- W The development, manufacture and sale of carwash chemicals (hereafter \"Chemicals\")\n\nA detailed assessment of the WashTec Group's business activities has shown that they fall partly within the scope of the Delegated Acts issued in this connection.\n\nThe climate objectives – \"climate change mitigation\" and \"climate change adaptation\" – primarily relate to those economic activities and sectors which have the greatest potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The business model of the WashTec Group does not fall under these sectors.\n\nThe Equipment and Service business activity is partially Taxonomy-eligible with regard to the environmental objective \"Transition to a circular economy.\" The water recovery systems product corresponds to economic activity 2.2 \"Production of alternative water resources for purposes other than human consumption\" listed in Annex II of the Environmental Delegated Act.\n\nThe water recovery systems manufactured by WashTec enable the collection and treatment of grey water\\* and, by thus producing an alternative water resource, reduce the fresh water consumption of the equipment in operation on customer sites.\n\nThe three remaining environmental objectives – \"Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources,\" \"Pollution prevention and control\" and \"Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\" – primarily relate to those economic activities and sectors which have the greatest potential for significant improvements in environmental protection in relation to these three objectives. The WashTec Group's business model does not fall under these sectors.\n\nThe WashTec Group does not engage in any economic activity related to energy generation from fossil gas or nuclear energy. Accordingly, templates 2 to 5 under the Regulation are not presented. Template 1 is provided on p. 50.\n\n*\\*Grey water includes waste water from bathtubs, showers, bathroom sinks, clothes washing machines and laundry sinks.*\n\nW Other\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Accounting policy\n\nThe WashTec Group has determined the key performance indicators under the EU Taxonomy Regulation, comprising turnover, CapEx and OpEx, in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in force as of the reporting date together with the interpretations of the IFRS IC (IFRIC) as adopted by the European Union. The disclosures on the performance indicators relate to the companies fully consolidated in the WashTec Group's financial statements.\n\nWith regard to the climate targets, the WashTec Group's business activities are not Taxonomy-eligible and not Taxonomy-aligned. For this reason, no disclosures are provided in the following for categories (a) and (b) of points 1.1.2.2 and 1.1.3.2 of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act. The measures set out in the following relate to the purchase of intermediate products and services from potentially Taxonomy-aligned economic activities that lead to greenhouse gas reductions (category (c) of points 1.1.2.2 and 1.1.3.2 of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act). The measures were identified on the basis of the WashTec Group's Environment and Energy Roadmap 2025 (see also under \"Environmental matters\") and the climate change mitigation objective.\n\nThe WashTec Group reports in this regard on the Taxonomy eligibility of purchased intermediate products and services. It was not possible to assess their Taxonomy alignment because verification of compliance with the technical screening criteria resides with the suppliers and service providers and not with WashTec. This applies in particular to the \"DNSH\" criteria and compliance with the minimum safeguards.\n\nWith regard to the environmental objective \"Transition to a circular economy,\" the Equipment and Service business activity is partially Taxonomy-eligible. The water recovery systems product corresponds to economic activity 2.2 \"Production of alternative water resources for purposes other than human consumption\" listed in Annex II of the Environmental Delegated Act.\n\nDouble counting in the allocation of turnover, CapEx and OpEx in the numerator to economic activities is avoided by allocating the various measures to the individual activities and objectives. In addition, no separate CapEx or OpEx has been identified for the climate change adaptation objective that contributes to this objective in particular.\n\n### Performance indicators\n\nFor fiscal year 2023, the three key performance indicators turnover, CapEx and OpEx must be disclosed in relation to Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-non-eligible economic activities (all objectives) and in relation to Taxonomy-aligned and Taxonomy-non-aligned economic activities (climate objectives) (Article 5 (2) of the Environmental Delegated Act).\n\nThe turnover key performance indicator is calculated as the proportion of revenue derived from products or services associated with economic activities that qualify as Taxonomyeligible or Taxonomy-aligned under the Taxonomy Regulation (numerator), divided by the consolidated revenue in fiscal year 2023 (denominator) (point 1.1.1 of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act).\n\nThe water recovery systems product is assigned to the \"Equipment and Service\" business activity. This business activity corresponds to economic activity 2.2 \"Production of alternative water resources for purposes other than human consumption\" under the environmental objective \"transition to a circular economy\" and is thus Taxonomy-eligible (Annex II of the Environmental Delegated Act). Turnover from water recovery systems has been determined on the basis of revenue from the individual product groups. Turnover generated with water recovery systems amounted to €8,209k in fiscal year 2023.\n\nThe numerator for Taxonomy-eligible revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation is €8,209k.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe denominator is net turnover within the meaning of Article 2 (5), of Directive 2013/34 and is €489,468k (see \"Revenue\" in the Consolidated Income Statement).\n\nThe CapEx key performance indicator is calculated as the proportion relating to assets or processes that are associated with economic activities that qualify as Taxonomy-eligible or Taxonomy-aligned under the Taxonomy Regulation (numerator), divided by the total additions to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use assets in fiscal year 2023 (denominator) (point 1.1.2 of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act).\n\nThe WashTec Group has invested in two laser welding systems to improve the energy efficiency of the metalworking processes at its plants in Augsburg and the Czech Republic. The new systems reduce electricity consumption. They also reduce compressed air consumption, which further reduces electricity consumption. This measure aims for a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The final payment amounted to €111k and was recognized in the technical equipment and machinery asset category. This qualifies as a measure in accordance with category (c) of point 1.1.2.2 of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act. The economic activity to which the measure is allocated under the \"climate change mitigation\" objective in accordance with Annex I of the Climate Delegated Act is 3.6 \"Manufacture of other low carbon technologies\".\n\nIn the area of industrial trucks, LPG forklifts have begun to be replaced with electric forklifts. This measure aims for a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The associated CapEx amounted to €144k and was recognized in the \"right-of-use assets: other plant, fixtures and fittings\" asset category. This qualifies as a measure in accordance with category (c) of point 1.1.2.2 of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act. The economic activity to which the measure is allocated under the \"climate change mitigation\" objective in accordance with Annex I of the Climate Delegated Act is 3.6 \"Manufacture of other low carbon technologies\".\n\nThe new car policy in particular contributes to the further electrification of the Company vehicle fleet and thus to the reduction of carbon emissions. The CapEx associated with the leasing of category M1 and N1 electric vehicles amounted to €244k and was recognized in the \"right-of-use assets: other plant, fixtures and fittings\" asset category. This qualifies as a measure in accordance with category (c) of point 1.1.2.2 of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act. The economic activity to which the measure is allocated under the \"climate change mitigation\" objective in accordance with Annex I of the Climate Delegated Act is 6.5 \"Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles\".\n\nIn connection with the electrification of the fleet, charging infrastructure for electric vehicles and electric industrial trucks has been installed at all production sites in Germany. The CapEx associated with the installation of charging stations for electric vehicles amounted to €34k and was recognized in the \"Land, land rights and buildings\" asset category. This qualifies as a measure in accordance with category (c) of point 1.1.2.2 of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act. The economic activity to which the measure is allocated under the \"climate change mitigation\" objective in accordance with Annex I of the Climate Delegated Act is 7.4 \"Installation, maintenance and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings (and parking spaces attached to buildings)\".\n\nThe numerator of the total Taxonomy-eligible CapEx for the economic activity 3.6 \"Manufacture of other low carbon technologies\" is €255k.\n\nThe numerator of the total Taxonomy-eligible CapEx in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation is €533k. Of this amount, €145k relates to additions to property, plant and equipment and €388k to right-of-use assets.\n\nThe denominator comprising CapEx consists of additions to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use assets in fiscal year 2023 and is €26,969k (see Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, [Note 14, un](#page-140-0)der additions to cost, an[d Note 15,](#page-142-0)  Right-of-use assets).\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Information\n\nThe OpEx key performance indicator is calculated as the proportion relating to assets or processes that are associated with economic activities that qualify as Taxonomy-eligible or Taxonomy-aligned under the Taxonomy Regulation (numerator), divided by OpEx for fiscal year 2023 in accordance with point 1.1.3 of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act (denominator). This covers direct non-capitalized costs that relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment that are necessary to ensure their continued and effective functioning.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, in order to reduce energy consumption and thus improve the environmental performance of its operations, the WashTec Group continued the project launched in fiscal year 2021 for the gradual conversion of the German sites to energy-efficient LED lighting. The attributable OpEx amounted to €4k and was recognized in the consolidated income statement under \"cost of sales\". It was determined on the basis of the costs recorded in the relevant account. This qualifies as a measure in accordance with category (c) of point 1.1.3.2 of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act. The economic activity to which the measure is allocated under the climate change mitigation objective in accordance with Annex I of the Climate Delegated Act is 7.3 \"Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment, category (d) installation and replacement of energy efficient light sources\".\n\nThe numerator of the total Taxonomy-eligible OpEx in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation is €4k.\n\nThe denominator comprising OpEx as defined above is €16,837k.\n\nThe templates presented in the following correspond to the requirements in Annex V of the Environmental Delegated Act.\n\nImage /page/41/Picture/7 description: The image shows a close-up of a car wash machine with large, rotating brushes. The brushes are made of alternating orange and black bristles. The brushes are in motion, creating a blurred effect.

In their respective KPIs, where the use of proceeds from the financing is not known, financial undertakings shall compute the financing of economic activities contributing to multiple environmental objectives under the most relevant environmental objective that is reported in bold in this template by non-financial undertakings. An environmental objective may only be reported in bold once in one row to avoid double counting of economic activities in the KPIs of financial undertakings. This shall not apply to the computation of Taxonomy-alignment of economic activities for financial products defined in point (12) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088. Non-financial undertakings shall also report the extent of eligibility and alignment per environmental objective, that includes alignment with each of environmental objectives for activities contributing substantially to several objectives, by using the template below:\n\n(d) EL Taxonomy-eligible activity for the relevant objective N/EL Taxonomy-non-eligible activity for the relevant objective\n\nPrior-year information in relation to the Climate Delegated Act; for the Environmental Delegated Act, prior-year information is to be provided for the first time for reporting on fiscal year 2024.\n\n|     | Taxonomy-aligned per objective | Taxonomy-eligible per objective |\n|-----|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| CCM | 0%                             | n/a                             |\n| CCA | 0%                             | n/a                             |\n| WTR | 0%                             | n/a                             |\n| CE  | n/a                            | 2%                              |\n| PPC | 0%                             | n/a                             |\n| BIO | 0%                             | n/a                             |\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\nProportion of CapEx from products or services associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities – disclosure covering year 2023 / 1 (continued on next page)\n\n| Financial year 2023                                                        |         |       |                                |                                 | Substantial contribution criteria |                     |                     |                     |                     |                                 | DNSH criteria (\"Does not Significantly Harm\") |       |           |                     |                   |                       |                                                                                            |                                  |                                      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Economic Activities                                                        | Code(a) | CapEx | Proportion<br>of CapEx<br>2023 | Climate<br>Change<br>Mitigation | Climate<br>Change<br>Adaptation   | Water               | Pollution           | Circular<br>Economy | Bio-<br>diversity   | Climate<br>Change<br>Mitigation | Climate<br>Change<br>Adaptation               | Water | Pollution | Circular<br>Economy | Bio-<br>diversity | Minimum<br>Safeguards | Proportion<br>of<br>Taxonomy-<br>aligned<br>(A.1) or<br>eligible<br>(A.2)<br>CapEx<br>2022 | Category<br>enabling<br>activity | Category<br>transitional<br>activity |\n| (1)                                                                        | (2)     | (3)   | (4)                            | (5)                             | (6)                               | (7)                 | (8)                 | (9)                 | (10)                | (11)                            | (12)                                          | (13)  | (14)      | (15)                | (16)              | (17)                  | (18)                                                                                       | (19)                             | (20)                                 |\n|                                                                            |         | €k    | %                              | Y;N;<br>N/EL(b) (c)             | Y;N;<br>N/EL(b) (c)               | Y;N;<br>N/EL(b) (c) | Y;N;<br>N/EL(b) (c) | Y;N;<br>N/EL(b) (c) | Y;N;<br>N/EL(b) (c) | Y/N                             | Y/N                                           | Y/N   | Y/N       | Y/N                 | Y/N               | Y/N                   | %                                                                                          | E                                | T                                    |\n| A.

Global economic growth in 2023 was thus around 3%. The nevertheless moderate overall growth of the global economy in 2023 was mainly due to the still high (though declining) inflation rates and to restrictive central bank monetary policies. Germany's economy contracted by 0.3% in 2023 according to the\n\nImage /page/50/Figure/4 description: This image shows a line graph comparing the stock performance of WashTec and SDAX in Euro over a period of time from January to February. The y-axis represents the stock value, ranging from 30.00 to 45.00. The x-axis represents the months from January to February. The blue line represents the stock performance of WashTec, while the orange line represents the stock performance of SDAX in Euro.\n\nPrice performance of WashTec shares 2023/2024 compared to the SDAX (indexed)\n\nGerman Federal Statistical Office and the German government forecasts that it will grow by just 0.2% year on year in 2024. Business sentiment has deteriorated above all in the mechanical engineering, automotive and electrical industries. While supply chain problems gradually eased as the year progressed – which made it possible to work off existing order backlogs – the business environment deteriorated with a decline in new orders.\n\nDespite a large number of negative factors, such as the terrible wars on or near Europe's doorstep, weak economic growth in many European countries and also in China as a key sales market, together with high inflation rates, most stock markets recovered much the previous year's losses over the course of 2023. Falling inflation rates in particular fueled hopes of interest rate cuts in the near future and thus boosted the performance of shares in the technology sector especially. The DAX recovered most of all towards the year-end and gained 20% in value over the year as a whole. The more defensively oriented STOXX Europe 50 showed a somewhat smaller gain of 16%. Both the mid-cap MDAX and the small-cap SDAX had a successful year with increases of 8% and around 17% respectively.\n\n### WashTec AG share performance in 2023\n\nThe WashTec share price began 2023 at €34.55 and marked its high for the year at €41.75 on April 6. On October 27, 2023, the share price reached its low of €29.75. The end-of-year share price was €32.00. This was 7.4% down on the prior year-end closing price. The share thus underperformed the SDAX (+15.5%). These figures relate to closing prices on the Xetra trading platform.\n\nAs of February 29, 2024, WashTec shares were trading at €36.40 per share.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Attractive dividend policy\n\nPursuant to a resolution adopted by the Annual General Meeting on May 15, 2023, the Company paid its shareholders a dividend of €2.20 per share for fiscal year 2022. Dividend distributions thus totaled €29.4m in 2023. Based on the year-end share price, the dividend yield was 6.88%. This places WashTec among the strongest performers on the German stock market in terms of dividend yield.\n\nWashTec aims to maintain an attractive dividend policy under which shareholders duly participate in the Company's success.\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board are proposing a dividend of €2.20 per share for fiscal year 2023.\n\n### Changes in shareholder structure\n\nThe majority of WashTec AG shares are held by institutional investors. WashTec AG received the following voting rights notifications under the Securities Trading Act (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz) in fiscal year 2023.

[The information set out below the](#page-78-0)refore mainly relates to the Group. WashTec AG is discussed separately in section 2.6. The direct subsidiaries of WashTec AG are AUWA-Chemie GmbH, WashTec Holding GmbH and WashTec Carwash Management GmbH. WashTec AG has control and profit (loss) pooling agreements with AUWA-Chemie GmbH and WashTec Carwash Management GmbH and a profit transfer agreement with WashTec Holding GmbH.\n\n### WashTec Holding GmbH\n\nWith the exception of AUWA-Chemie GmbH and WashTec Carwash Management GmbH, the WashTec Group's ownership interests in operating companies are held by WashTec Holding GmbH, based in Augsburg, Germany. WashTec Holding GmbH has control and profit (loss) pooling agreements with WashTec Financial Services GmbH and WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH.\n\n### WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH\n\nThe bulk of the operating business is conducted by WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH, Augsburg, Germany. This is where the main products of the WashTec Group are developed, manufactured, sold and serviced. WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH also supplies and supports the subsidiaries and independent foreign distributors.\n\n### AUWA-Chemie GmbH\n\nAUWA-Chemie GmbH produces chemical products for carwash equipment. Distribution is via WashTec subsidiaries and independent distributors in Germany and Europe.\n\n### Foreign subsidiaries\n\nThe WashTec Group is represented, and WashTec products are sold and serviced, by the Company's own subsidiaries in the Netherlands, France, Denmark, Norway, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Austria, Poland, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In the reporting year, WashTec also still had a subsidiary in China. The Chinese market will be developed in the future as a distributor market. In addition, the previously independent distributor in New Zealand was taken over in 2023 in order to commence direct sales and service activities there. An overview of the production locations is provided under the heading \"Production, sourcing and logistics.\"\n\n### WashTec Financial Services GmbH and WashTec Carwash Management GmbH\n\nWashTec Financial Services GmbH and WashTec Carwash Management GmbH provide services relating to the sale and operation of carwashes, such as brokering individual financing arrangements and services in connection with the operation of carwash equipment.\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/58/Picture/3 description: This image is a world map showing the distribution of WashTec, distributors, and production sites. The map shows that WashTec has distribution in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The map also shows the locations of distributors and production sites. There are production sites in Denver, Augsburg, Grebenau, Recklinghausen, and Nyrany. The legend indicates that the distribution by WashTec is represented by a dark blue color, distributors are represented by a light blue color, and production sites are represented by black dots.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\nements Further Information\n\n60\n\nThe WashTec Group's global footprint is a clear competitive advantage. WashTec has around 1,700 employees worldwide and subsidiaries in all major markets.\n\nIn addition, WashTec has a broad network of independent distributors and is thus on the map in over 80 countries throughout the world.\n\n### Production, sourcing and logistics\n\nWashTec has a global procurement and production network with production facilities in Germany, the Czech Republic and the USA. Most of the equipment for worldwide distribution is assembled at the main plant in Augsburg, Germany. Gantry carwashes are produced for the North American market in Denver (USA). Much of the sheet metal production takes place in the Nyrany (Czech Republic), where components are also preassembled and the basic gantry carwash system is assembled. The Company has two other sites in Germany producing control units for the entire Group (Recklinghausen) and wash chemicals (Grebenau).\n\n### Segments\n\nThe WashTec Group's global business is divided into three geographical regions. European business activities and exports to other countries are combined in the Europe region. The North America region comprises the activities in the USA and Canada. The Asia/Pacific region mainly includes the business activities of the subsidiaries in Australia and China.\n\n### Management and control\n\nAs an Aktiengesellschaft (a German stock corporation), WashTec AG has a two-tier management and supervisory structure comprising the Management Board and the Supervisory Board. The Management Board is responsible for managing the Company, sets the strategic direction and pursues the goal of sustained growth in shareholder value. The Supervisory Board, which consists of six members in accordance with the Articles of Association, advises and supervises the Management Board.\n\nAs the Group parent company, WashTec AG determines corporate strategy and overall control, resource allocation and communication with key stakeholder groups in the business environment, primarily comprising the capital market and shareholders. The Company's internal management and control is based on a value-oriented management system. This encompasses an integrated planning and control strategy, target ratios for management of the Company as well as measures for ensuring sustained and profitable growth, efficiency improvements and efficient capital management. The Company's Management Board and Supervisory Board define corporate strategy and related targets, which are implemented at all business units across all of levels of responsibility in the Group.\n\nMonitoring is performed by way of regular meetings involving all reporting units. These include fortnightly Management Board meetings at which the divisional heads report, monthly meetings with the main divisional heads, regular international management meetings with heads of the operating companies, strategic and annual planning including capital expenditure, production and capacity planning, regular reporting and forecasting, ongoing market analysis, and regular analyses of revenue, sales, order backlog and market share. All capital expenditure projects are continuously reviewed and monitored in the same connection.\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\n### External factors influencing the business\n\n### Mobility transition\n\nThe major economic and social trend toward individualization is a key driver of continued growth in demand for mobility. The resulting traffic volumes are still largely based on individual travel. In line with the need to decarbonize and the global mobility trends, this is resulting in changes in vehicle fleets. While autonomous driving and shared mobility mean a reduction in the vehicle fleet, they also lead to increasing passenger mileage with shorter vehicle life cycles.\n\nIn addition to the size of the fleet, the type and intensity of vehicle use will also determine carwash demand in the future. Vehicles need to be cleaned no matter how they are powered and regardless of the ownership model. \"Shared mobility\" vehicles tend to be washed more frequently.\n\n### Decarbonization and sustainability\n\nCompanies' sustainability performance is crucially important to all stakeholders, creating a growing need for information and transparency. As well as the environmental compatibility of products, this also includes companies' carbon footprint.\n\nThe use of recirculating water recovery systems in automated vehicle washing significantly reduces the consumption of mains water compared to hand washing or to a carwash without a water recovery system. In wash chemicals, the Green Car Care product range uses biogenic detergents without any fossil resources. These are agents that reduce the surface tension of the water for improved wetting performance.\n\nWith a binding commitment to reduce its own carbon footprint, WashTec is contributing to the global efforts to limit global warming (for further information, please see under \"1.2 Corporate objective and strategy\").\n\n### Economy\n\nA key factor influencing the uptake of automated vehicle washing is a country's average per capita income. As this increases, it creates sustainable market potential worldwide, especially in regions that are transitioning from manual to automated washing. Progress here is being slowed down, however, by various factors such as inflation and the resulting high interest rates, and global crises such as the war in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\n### Customer expectations\n\nCustomer expectations continue to focus on optimal wash results while conserving resources. Customers also expect the equipment to be easy to use. Automated carwashes are far more environment-friendly than manual washing because they use less water and chemicals. This is especially true of carwashes with water treatment systems. Modern digital systems allow operators to conveniently access and remotely monitor and control plant parameters anytime, anywhere. For the end user, speed, convenience, quality and the wash experience remain key factors.\n\nAccordingly, the Company continues to operate on the basis that clean cars will remain a key quality criterion and hence a driver of the business model. The WashTec Group nevertheless expects changes in the operating environment, in particular with regard to the future importance and conceptual design of existing operator sites. At the same time, these developments also harbor opportunities, most of all from the provision of digital, environment-friendly solutions for carwash.\n\nThe Company closely monitors the development of external factors affecting the business in order to respond to changes in a timely manner and make the appropriate strategic choices.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1.2 Corporate objective and strategy\n\nThe focus of our activities is on offering the maximum possible benefit to people who wash cars professionally. This requires not only specialization to meet customer needs, but also product and service leadership to ensure the best possible technology and quality for our products. The environmental and economic sustainability of our products is a further strategic and operational focus.\n\nOur strategy is based on four main pillars:\n\n- W Total customer care\n- W Optimum integrated system for carwash\n- W Primary focus on the core regions of Europe and North America\n- W Sustainability\n\n### Total customer care\n\nWith total customer care, the WashTec Group places the focus on maximum customer benefit and, based on the superior equipment and wash chemicals portfolio and advanced digital platform, offers car wash operators and consumers the most profitable carwash. Integrating the entire product and service portfolio – equipment, service and chemicals, embedded in digital solutions – is a source of major growth potential.\n\n### Optimum integrated system for carwash\n\nWith the integrated system of equipment, water treatment and biodegradable chemicals, carwash operators and consumers are ensured the most sustainable carwash. The coordinated components of the washing process also enable our customers to achieve the best possible wash.\n\n### Focus on core regions\n\nIn regional terms, the focus is on Europe and North America in order to better exploit the market potential available there.\n\n### Environmental sustainability\n\nEnvironmental sustainability is a high priority for WashTec and relates both to our operations and to the environmental impact of our products. This strategy includes reducing the carbon emissions of our own production facilities, together with their sales and service operations, as well as reducing the amount of water used at customer carwashes.\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1.3 Control system\n\n### Financial and non-financial key performance indicators\n\nThe key financial and non-financial performance indicators used by the Company for planning and control are as follows:\n\nKey financial performance indicators\n\n- W Revenue\n- W EBIT\n- W Free cash flow\n- W ROCE\n\nThe free cash flow performance indicator is defined as cash inflow from operating activities less cash outflow from investing activities.\n\nReturn on capital employed (ROCE) is defined as the ratio of EBIT to capital employed. We define capital employed as non-current assets (non-current assets including goodwill and right-of-use assets) plus net operating working capital (NOWC), calculated as the average of the reporting date figures for the last five quarters. NOWC is defined as the sum of inventories and trade receivables less trade payables and prepayments on orders.\n\n### Key non-financial performance indicator\n\nThe following non-financial performance indicator is used at Group level:\n\nW Accident rate: Work accidents/million hours worked\n\nThe Separate Non-financial Report contains a detailed description of the accident rate as WashTec's k[ey non-financial performance indicator \\(see \"Separate Non-financial Report\"](#page-29-0)  beginning on page 30).\n\n### Separate non-financial report in accordance with Sections 289b (3) and 315b (3) HGB\n\n[The Separate Non-financial Report in accordance with Sections 289b \\(3\\) and 315b \\(3\\) HGB](https://ir.washtec.de/en/financial_reports/)  is published on the Company's website at https://ir.washtec.de/en/financial\\_reports/ as a separate section of the [Annual Report 2023, beginning on page 30.](#page-29-0)\n\n### Opportunities and risk management\n\nResponsible management of business risk is one of the basic principles of good corporate governance. The Management Board has at its disposal comprehensive Group-wide and Company-specific reporting and management systems that permit it to identify, assess and manage such risk. These systems are continuously developed and adapted to changes in the operating environment. The Management Board regularly informs the Supervisory Board about existing risks, any measures taken and their development.\n\nDetails of risk management are found in the risk report, which is part of the management report. The management report contains the report required under Sections 289 and 315a of the German Commercial Code (HGB) on the internal monitoring and risk management system.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1.4 Research and development\n\nA major thrust of research and development during the year related to the development of additional SmartCare features and functions. The focus was on improvements in washing and drying quality and in process speed and on further reducing the environmental footprint. Further progress was made here through a better understanding of the biological and chemical interrelationships in water treatment, further reducing the amount of fresh water needed and thus helping to address the drought periods caused by climate change in many regions. Another focus was the successful introduction of a modular system for the new JetWash generation, which ensures fast assembly and easy commissioning at customers' sites.\n\nIn total, some 70 employees work in research and development at the WashTec headquarters in Augsburg on solutions that maximize modularity and reusability. International patents secure the future solution space for WashTec.\n\nTotal operating research and development expenditure in the WashTec Group amounted to approximately €14.2m in 2023 (prior year: €14.2m). The Group's capitalized development costs came to €1.6m in fiscal year 2023 (prior year: €2.0m) and mainly related to the development of software for the digitalization and service platform.\n\nImage /page/63/Picture/7 description: A white car is being washed by large, green brushes in a car wash.

Inflation peaked in 2023 as a result of monetary policy tightening and began to fall as the year progressed, but is still above the target levels aimed at by central banks. Uncertainties and tensions in relation to China, the war in Ukraine and the Middle East conflict also had a notable impact on economic development.\n\nIn its forecast for 2024, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) believes that the high interest rate levels maintained by central banks to curb inflation and the scaling back of fiscal support in the face of mounting debt will weigh on economic activity and that underlying\n\nproductivity growth will remain low. The IMF nevertheless expects positive impetus, particularly from the USA and several large emerging and developing countries, as these are developing more resiliently than initially expected and the Chinese economy is receiving fiscal support. Accordingly, the IMF expects global economic growth in 2024 to be at the same level as in 2023.\n\n### Industry development (mechanical engineering and chemicals)\n\nThe German economy has cooled significantly since the end of last year. Inflation eased over the course of the year and wage increases picked up compared to the prior year. Contrary to expectations in the summer, however, a recovery failed to materialize in the second half of the year. According to the German Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA), the persistently weak global economy and low domestic investment in particular led to a year-on-year decline in incoming orders in the German machinery and mechanical engineering sector throughout the year. Private consumption also failed to recover.\n\nAccording to forecasts by the ifo Institute, the German economy will slowly recover from last year's recession in 2024. The German government's forecast is significantly more cautious with growth of 0.2%. At present, the main factors holding back economic growth are weak foreign demand in industry, the higher borrowing costs for investment as a result of monetary policy tightening, and sluggish private consumption. These issues should become gradually less important with exports expected to increase as foreign markets rebound and private consumption anticipated to rise on the back of higher wages and a stable labor market.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Market for carwash equipment\n\n### Customer groups\n\nWashTec's customers are predominately operators of filling stations that offer on-site carwashes, with which they generate a substantial part of their earnings. These customers include multinational petroleum companies, retailers (convenience stores), individual filling station operators and operator chains. Additional key customer groups include carwash operators, automobile repair shops, supermarket chains, road freight companies and public transport operators.\n\n### Competition\n\nWashTec is the global market leader with an installed base of over 50,000 units. In Europe – a developed market with intense competition – WashTec's own research shows the Company to lead the market by a wide margin in terms of market coverage and market share. The North American market, with a large proportion of conveyor tunnel carwashes, is more fragmented on the customer and supplier side than Europe. European and American competitors contend for a developed market in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n### Sales markets\n\nGermany and the rest of Europe remain the largest sales markets. Based on the Group strategy, North America in particular is targeted to account for a higher percentage of the Group's total revenue in the medium to long term. In addition, the aftersales business with service and chemicals should contribute to the overall growth of the WashTec Group through new products and stronger focus on this area of business.\n\n### 2.2 Group business performance\n\n[The following section examines the WashTec Group's business performance. WashTec AG](#page-78-0)  is discussed separately in section 2.6.\n\nThe general economic environment has not changed significantly in fiscal year 2023 compared to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts presented in the Annual Report 2022. High inflation and higher interest rates in particular dampened consumption and investment.\n\nThe German economy has been contracting since the end of last year. In the German machinery and mechanical engineering sector, the downward trend in order intake that set in at the beginning of the fiscal year continued throughout the year. Supply bottlenecks continued to ease and the ongoing high level of orders on hand supported the development of the economy. However, investment was held back significantly by higher financing costs. This also affects the WashTec Group.\n\n|                                                        |    | 2022  | Guidance 2023          | 2023  | Change year<br>on year   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----|-------|------------------------|-------|--------------------------|\n| Revenue                                                | €m | 482.2 | ±3%                    | 489.5 | 1.5%                     |\n| EBIT                                                   | €m | 38.0  | ≥10%                   | 41.9  | 10.3%                    |\n| Free cash flow                                         | €m | 16.2  | ≥10%                   | 46.1  | 184.6%                   |\n| ROCE                                                   | %  | 20.2  | ≥1 percentage<br>point | 21.5  | 1.3 percentage<br>points |\n| Accident rate<br>(work accidents/million hours worked) |    | 4.2   | <4.2                   | 4.2   | 0.0                      |\n\nThe WashTec Group achieved a new revenue record of €489.5m in fiscal year 2023, an increase of €7.3m or 1.5% on the prior year (€482.2m). The target communicated in the Annual Report 2022 of revenue in the range of ±3% of the prior year was thus met. Adjusted for exchange rate effects, the growth in revenue was 3.4%.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe year-on-year revenue growth was mainly due to the very positive performance in the chemicals business, where new customers were acquired. At €418.5m, Equipment and Service revenue was level with the prior year (€420.0m). Revenue was reduced mainly due to the weaker sales figures for equipment as a result of the difficult market conditions. The price increases implemented in response to the rising price of materials – primarily last year – were unable to fully compensate for the overall market trend. Revenue was also impacted by negative currency effects, particularly in relation to the Norwegian krone and the US dollar.\n\nAs forecast, revenue in the Europe region was on a par with the prior year. Revenue growth on an exchange rate adjusted basis was not achieved in North America due to the general decline in market demand. In US dollars, revenue amounted to USD 111.1m (prior year: USD 112.0m). In the Asia/Pacific region, the forecast of revenue growth at constant exchange rates was met.\n\nLargely due to an improvement in gross profit, EBIT rose by 10.3% to €41.9m (prior year: €38.0m). The EBIT margin was 8.6% (prior year: 7.9%). In its guidance, the Company forecast a significant increase in EBIT by ≥10%, which was thus achieved.\n\nThe forecast made at the beginning of the year of a significant EBIT increase of ≥10% in the Europe region was not met. EBIT in North America increased significantly and met the forecast improvement in EBIT compared to the prior year. The same applies to the Asia/Pacific region.\n\nIn the final quarter of the year, revenue fell by 7.6%to€132.8m (prior year:€143.7m). Revenue in Europe and North America in particular was down on the record prior-year quarter, mainly due to lower output volumes. EBIT in the fourth quarter, at €15.0m, was on the same high level as in the prior year (€15.4m). Active cost management made it possible in this period to generate a double-digit EBIT margin of 11.3% (prior year: 10.7%).\n\nFree cash flow increased due to significantly reduced net operating working capital to €46.1m (prior year: €16.2m). Performance was positively impacted in particular by the measures initiated at the beginning of the year to reduce the amount of capital tied up in inventories. This means that the forecast of a significant increase in free cash flow by ≥10% was clearly exceeded.\n\nROCE stood at 21.5% (prior year: 20.2%). The target of a significant improvement in ROCE by ≥1 percentage point was thus achieved, mainly due to the significantly higher EBIT. The denominator, capital employed, increased by €6.3m or 3.3% year on year. This increase is mainly due to the rise in non-current assets on the acquisition of the site occupied by the American subsidiary.\n\nThe accident rate, at 4.2 as in the prior year, was significantly below the industry average reported for recent years by the employers' liability insurance associations (Berufsgenossenschaften). The target set for 2023 of an accident rate less than 4.2 was not met. WashTec continues to target further reductions in the number of occupational accidents.\n\nOverall, the difficult economic environment and the resulting reluctance of customers to invest had a significant negative impact on the WashTec Group's business development in the reporting year. By way of active cost management throughout the year, the company successfully responded to changing market conditions and significantly improved earnings despite the challenges.\n\n### Order backlog\n\nOrders received in the reporting year were down year on year due to the drop in demand in the market as a whole. Due to the lower level of orders received, the order backlog at the end of December 2023 was significantly down on the prior year, but is still high overall compared to the long-term average.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 2.3 Group financial position and cash flows\n\n### 2.3.1 Results of operations\n\n### Income statement\n\nThe following table shows the income statement of the WashTec Group:\n\n| In €m                             | 2023   | 2022   | Change   |        |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|--------|\n|                                   |        |        | absolute | in %   |\n| Revenue                           | 489.5  | 482.2  | 7.3      | 1.5    |\n| Cost of sales                     | -352.9 | -352.8 | -0.1     | -0.0   |\n| Gross profit                      | 136.5  | 129.4  | 7.1      | 5.5    |\n| Gross profit margin in %          | 27.9   | 26.8   | 1.1      | –      |\n| Research and development expenses | -14.2  | -14.2  | 0.0      | 0.0    |\n| Selling expenses                  | -62.5  | -62.1  | -0.4     | -0.6   |\n| Administrative expenses           | -18.6  | -17.1  | -1.5     | -8.8   |\n| Other income and expenses         | 0.5    | 2.0    | -1.5     | -75.0  |\n| EBIT                              | 41.9   | 38.0   | 3.9      | 10.3   |\n| EBIT margin in %                  | 8.6    | 7.9    | 0.7      | –      |\n| Financial result                  | -3.5   | -0.7   | -2.8     | -400.0 |\n| EBT                               | 38.4   | 37.3   | 1.1      | 2.9    |\n| Income taxes                      | -10.4  | -10.9  | 0.5      | 4.6    |\n| Net income                        | 28.0   | 26.4   | 1.6      | 6.1    |\n| Earnings per share (€)            | 2.09   | 1.97   | 0.12     | 6.1    |\n\n### Group revenue\n\nThe WashTec Group generated revenue of €489.5m in the year ending December 31, 2023, an increase of €7.3m or 1.5% on the prior-year figure (€482.2m). This is a new annual record.\n\nImage /page/67/Figure/8 description: This bar chart titled \"Revenue in €m, multi-year comparison\" shows the revenue in millions of euros from 2019 to 2023. In 2019, the revenue was 436.5 million euros. In 2020, the revenue was 378.7 million euros. In 2021, the revenue was 430.5 million euros. In 2022, the revenue was 482.2 million euros. In 2023, the revenue was 489.5 million euros.\n\nAdjusted for exchange rate effects, full-year revenue was €498.8m, an increase of 3.4% on the prior year (€482.2m). The negative exchange rate effects relate to movements in the Norwegian krone, the US dollar and the Australian dollar. Detailed discussion of the devel[opment of the individual regions is provided under \"Reporting by region\" in section 2.3.2.](#page-70-0)\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Revenue by product    |       |       |          |      |\n|-----------------------|-------|-------|----------|------|\n| In €m                 | 2023  | 2022  | Change   |      |\n|                       |       |       | absolute | in % |\n| Equipment and Service | 418.5 | 420.0 | –1.5     | –0.4 |\n| Chemicals             | 65.8  | 56.9  | 8.9      | 15.6 |\n| Others                | 5.2   | 5.3   | –0.1     | –1.9 |\n| Total                 | 489.5 | 482.2 | 7.3      | 1.5  |\n\nEquipment and Service revenue fell slightly by €1.5m compared to the prior year, mainly due to the general decline in demand in the market as a whole. Both key account business and the direct sales business were down on the prior year. Chemicals revenue grew very strongly. New customer wins made it possible to achieve significant revenue growth of 15.6% despite a mainly weather-related fall in carwash volumes.\n\nOther revenue, mainly from the arrangement of financing and the operations business, accounts for around 1.1% of the WashTec Group's total revenue and was stable relative to the prior year.\n\n### Further information on the income statement\n\n### Gross profit\n\nAt€136.5m, gross profit was 5.5%higher than the prior-year figure of€129.4m. Gross profit thus increased at a higher rate than revenue. The gross profit margin improved from 26.8%in the prior year to 27.9%. This improvement was mainly due to the price increases implemented in response to material price rises, primarily last year, and to a favorable product mix. Price rises for purchased parts and wage cost increases were partly offset by reduced prices of raw materials.\n\n### Research and development expenses\n\nAt €14.2m, research and development expenses were on a par with the prior year (€14.2m). New product development costs of€1.6m were capitalized in the reporting year (prior year: €2.0m) and will be amortized in subsequent periods. Amortization of research and development expenditure capitalized in prior years totaled €0.2m (prior year: €0.3m). The capitalization ratio was 11.3% (prior year: 14.1%). The focus was on developing additional features and functions for SmartCare. This included improvements to washing and drying quality and to process speed, and further reducing the ecological footprint, particularly with regard to the quantity of fresh water required. As of December 31, 2023, around 70 employees (prior year: around 70 employees) worked in research and development. This represents 4.1% (prior year: 3.8%) of the workforce.\n\n### Selling expenses\n\nSelling expenses, at €62.5m, were on the same level as in the prior year (€62.1m). Freight costs in this function area increased by €1.1m, due partly to higher costs for freight forwarders and partly to the higher proportion of business accounted for by chemicals. In contrast, advertising and trade fair costs went down by €0.7m. The prior-year figure here was significantly increased, primarily due to the resumption of trade fairs skipped during the pandemic.\n\n### Administrative expenses\n\nAdministrative expenses in the reporting year, at €18.6m, were€1.5m higher than in the prior year (€17.1m). The increase was mainly due to expenditure for cost optimization on the new product generation. Other than this, the item mainly includes personnel expenses and other costs of recruitment, professional development, communication and auditing.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Other income and expenses\n\nOther income and expenses were significantly lower than the prior year at €0.5m (prior year: €2.0m). The reduction in this item is mainly due to lower proceeds from the sale of non-current assets (€−0.5m) and the effects, recognized in this item, of the deconsolidation of the subsidiary in China (€−0.5m).\n\n### EBIT\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) were up 10.3% to €41.9m (prior year: €38.0m).\n\n#### EBIT in €m, multi-year comparison\n\nImage /page/69/Figure/9 description: The image is a bar graph showing data from 2019 to 2023. In 2019, the value is 36.3. In 2020, the value is 20.1. In 2021, the value is 45.7. In 2022, the value is 38.0. In 2023, the value is 41.9.\n\nA presentation of EBIT by regions is provided under \"Reporting by region\" in section 2.3.2.\n\n### EBIT margin\n\nThe EBIT margin decreased due to the improved gross profit margin to 8.6% (prior year: 7.9%).\n\n### Financial result\n\nThe financial result was €−3.5m (prior year: €−0.7m). The significant change is mainly due to higher expense on interest-bearing loans as a result of higher interest rates. In addition, average total debt was higher than in the prior year, partly due to borrowing to acquire the site of the US subsidiary.\n\n| Analysis of financial result                        |             |             |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| In €m                                               | 2023        | 2022        |\n| Other interest income                               | 0.2         | 0.5         |\n| <b>Financial income</b>                             | <b>0.2</b>  | <b>0.5</b>  |\n| Interest-bearing loans                              | 2.8         | 0.7         |\n| Interest expense from discounting lease liabilities | 0.4         | 0.2         |\n| Other interest expense                              | 0.5         | 0.4         |\n| <b>Financial expense</b>                            | <b>3.7</b>  | <b>1.3</b>  |\n| <b>Financial result</b>                             | <b>-3.5</b> | <b>-0.7</b> |\n\n### EBT\n\nEarnings before tax (EBT) increased to €38.4m (prior year: €37.3m).\n\n### Income taxes\n\nThe income taxes of €10.4m (prior year: €10.9m) consist of current taxes and deferred taxes mainly relating to temporary differences. The tax rate (relative to EBT) was 27.2%, slightly lower than in the prior year (29.3%). The lower tax rate compared to the prior year is primarily due to the utilization of loss carryforwards in the US and higher earnings contributions from foreign subsidiaries, which tend to have lower tax rates.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-70-0\"></span>Net income\n\nNet income improved by €1.6m to €28.0m (prior year: €26.4m). On the basis of the average number of shares (13,382,324), earnings per share (basic = diluted) increased by 6.1% to €2.09 (prior year: €1.97).\n\n### Net income in €m, multi-year comparison\n\nImage /page/70/Figure/4 description: This bar chart shows the values for the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.

The Management Board and Supervisory Board intend to recommend to the Annual General Meeting, which is scheduled for May 14, 2024, to appropriate the distributable profit of €30,073,713.43 shown in the Company's annual financial statements for fiscal year 2023 as follows: Distribution of €2.20 per eligible share, totaling €29,441,112.80, with the remaining distributable profit of €632,600.63 to be carried forward.\n\n### 2.3.2 Reporting by region\n\nImage /page/70/Figure/8 description: The image shows two donut charts comparing revenue by region in millions of euros for 2023 and 2022. For 2023, the total revenue is €489.5m, with Europe contributing €378.9m (+2.0%), North America contributing €102.9m (-4.5%), and Asia/Pacific contributing €19.2m (+9.1%). For 2022, the total revenue is €482.2m, with Europe contributing €371.6m, North America contributing €107.7m, and Asia/Pacific contributing €17.6m.\n\n\\* cross-segment consolidation eects are disregarded.\n\nEBIT by regions in €m\\*\n\nImage /page/70/Figure/10 description: The image shows two donut charts, one for 2023 and one for 2022.

The 2022 donut chart shows that Europe accounts for €36.4m, North America accounts for €1.4m, and Asia/Pacific accounts for €0.4m, with a total of €38.0m.\n\n\\* cross-segment consolidation eects are disregarded.\n\n### 71\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Europe\n\n| Europe region key figures |         |       |       | 2023  | 2022 | Change |\n|---------------------------|---------|-------|-------|-------|------|--------|\n| Revenue                   | €m      | 378.9 | 371.6 | 2.0%  |      |        |\n| EBIT                      | €m      | 36.2  | 36.4  | -0.5% |      |        |\n| EBIT margin               | %       | 9.6   | 9.8   | -0.2  |      |        |\n| Employees (as of Dec. 31) | persons | 1,398 | 1,486 | -88   |      |        |\n\n### Market environment\n\nAlongside North America, the wash equipment market in Europe is one of the most developed vehicle wash markets in the world. It has the highest number of installed carwashes and well-developed provider services and distribution structures.\n\nWashTec's customers in Europe are predominately operators of filling stations that offer on-site carwashes, with which they generate a substantial part of their earnings. These customers include multinational petroleum companies, retailers (convenience stores), individual filling station operators and operator chains. Additional key customer groups include carwash operators, supermarket chains, car dealerships and repair shops, road freight companies and public transport operators.\n\nCompetition in Europe is intense and limited to only a small number of manufacturers. A key factor is a market-wide service network and installed base. New competitors face correspondingly high barriers to entry. According to its own research, WashTec is the clear market leader in terms of market coverage and market share, and has by far the most well-established sales and service network and by far the largest installed base of gantry carwashes in Europe's core markets.\n\nBusiness performance in the reporting year was negatively impacted by the ongoing difficult economic situation, particularly in Germany, which is the region's most important market.\n\n### Revenue\n\nIn Europe, revenue increased by 2.0% to €378.9m (prior year: €371.6m). At constant exchange rates, the revenue increase was 2.9%, mainly due to the development of the Norwegian krone. Equipment and Service revenue remained level with the prior year. While equipment revenue was down, there was an increase in service revenue. Of particular note, the Chemicals division achieved strong double-digit growth in the region thanks to the acquisition of new key accounts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEBIT in the Europe region, at €36.2m, was on the same level as the prior year (€36.4m). The EBIT margin was 9.6% (prior year: 9.8%). In this region in particular, lower revenues from equipment sales and the resulting inability to cover fixed costs led to challenges in terms of earnings performance.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n### North America\n\n| North America region key figures |         |       |       |        |\n|----------------------------------|---------|-------|-------|--------|\n|                                  |         | 2023  | 2022  | Change |\n| Revenue                          | €m      | 102.9 | 107.7 | -4.5%  |\n| EBIT                             | €m      | 5.7   | 1.4   | 307.1% |\n| EBIT margin                      | %       | 5.5   | 1.3   | 4.2    |\n| Employees (as of Dec. 31)        | persons | 243   | 282   | -39    |\n\n### Market environment\n\nNew registrations of cars and light trucks have increased significantly in North America in recent years. Slight population growth and growth in the number of vehicles continue to be expected for the years ahead.\n\nThe key customer groups in North America – alongside a number of major customers – are independent small or medium-size carwash chains and retailers (convenience stores). The share of conveyor tunnel carwashes relative to gantry carwashes and growth in this product segment are above the global average.\n\n### Revenue\n\nRevenue in North America decreased from €107.7m in the prior year to €102.9m. In US dollars, revenue was USD 111.1m and thus at the same level as in the prior year (prior year: USD 112.0m). The WashTec Group's business in this region was also adversely affected by the generally subdued demand in the market as a whole.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEarnings in North America increased significantly by €4.3m to €5.7m (prior year: €1.4m). This is mainly due to the efficiency improvement projects launched last year and successfully implemented in fiscal year 2023, particularly in the areas of supply chain and service efficiency.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Asia/Pacific\n\n| Asia/Pacific region key figures |         |      |      |        |\n|---------------------------------|---------|------|------|--------|\n|                                 |         | 2023 | 2022 | Change |\n| Revenue                         | €m      | 19.2 | 17.6 | 9.1%   |\n| EBIT                            | €m      | 0.6  | 0.4  | 50.0%  |\n| EBIT margin                     | %       | 3.1  | 2.3  | 0.8    |\n| Employees (as of Dec. 31)       | persons | 46   | 56   | –10    |\n\n### Market environment\n\nTo further expand the WashTec Group's market position in the Asia/Pacific region and commence direct sales and service activities in New Zealand, WashTec New Zealand Limited was established in fiscal year 2023 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH. The previously independent distributor was taken over as of December 1, 2023.\n\nWashTec has a good market position in Australia and New Zealand. There, the major American and European manufacturers are in direct competition.\n\nAs described in the Annual Report 2022, the Company reviewed its market approach in China over the course of the year. As a result, the WashTec Group decided on a strategic realignment in the Asia/Pacific region and sold 90% of the shares in its Chinese subsidiary. The Chinese market will be developed in the future as a distributor market. This will enable WashTec to continue providing strong local customer support while maintaining the same high level of service for all WashTec carwash equipment installed in the Chinese market.\n\n### Revenue\n\nAt €19.2m, revenue in the Asia/Pacific region was higher than in the prior year (€17.6m). €6.4m is accounted for by China (prior year: €4.4m) and €0.3m by New Zealand (prior year: €0m). Adjusted for exchange rates, revenue in the region was €20.7m. The growth in the region in fiscal year 2023 is primarily due to increased volume with local oil companies in China. Business performance there in the prior year was notably impacted by measures in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue in Australia was on a par with the prior year.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs in previous years, the positive EBIT of€0.6m (prior year: €0.4m) was mainly due to the earnings contribution from Australia.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 2.3.3 Net assets\n\n### Asset and capital structure\n\n| Condensed consolidated balance sheet: assets   |                 |                 |          |       |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|-------|\n| In €m                                          | Dec 31,<br>2023 | Dec 31,<br>2022 | change   |       |\n|                                                |                 |                 | absolute | in %  |\n| Non-current assets (incl. right-of-use assets) | 102.9           | 91.9            | 11.0     | 12.0  |\n| Receivables and other assets                   | 93.5            | 102.8           | -9.3     | -9.0  |\n| Inventories                                    | 54.8            | 71.6            | -16.8    | -23.5 |\n| Deferred tax assets                            | 3.5             | 3.9             | -0.4     | -10.3 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                      | 16.7            | 14.2            | 2.5      | 17.6  |\n| Total assets                                   | 271.3           | 284.5           | -13.2    | -4.6  |\n\n|                                              |         |         | change   |       |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|----------|-------|\n| In €m                                        | Dec 31, | Dec 31, |          |       |\n|                                              | 2023    | 2022    | absolute | in %  |\n| Equity                                       | 85.8    | 88.1    | -2.3     | -2.6  |\n| Interest-bearing loans                       | 39.1    | 41.4    | -2.3     | -5.6  |\n| Liabilities and provisions                   | 115.6   | 117.0   | -1.4     | -1.2  |\n| of which provisions (including income taxes) | 27.1    | 28.3    | -1.2     | -4.2  |\n| of which trade payables                      | 24.0    | 22.7    | 1.3      | 5.7   |\n| Contract liabilities                         | 29.1    | 36.4    | -7.3     | -20.1 |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                     | 1.7     | 1.6     | 0.1      | 6.3   |\n| Total equity and liabilities                 | 271.3   | 284.5   | -13.2    | -4.6  |\n\n### Condensed consolidated balance sheet: equity and liabilities\n\nThe WashTec Group's balance sheet total went down from €284.5m to €271.3m.\n\n### Assets\n\nThe goodwill included in the WashTec Group's non-current assets amounted to €43.3m (prior year: €42.3m). The increase compared to the prior year is due to the acquisition of the New Zealand distributor. Property, plant and equipment primarily consists of the items land and buildings in the amount of €21.7m (prior year: €12.5m) and technical equipment and machinery in the amount of €8.9m (prior year: €8.4m). The increase in the land and buildings item is mainly due to the acquisition of the site occupied by the US subsidiary for €9.5m in January 2023. Also included are right-of-use assets in the amount of €18.4m (prior year: €17.3m). This increase is mainly due to the extension of a contract with a logistics service provider.\n\nReceivables and other assets went down from €102.8m in the prior year to €93.5m. This is mainly due to the reduction in trade receivables compared to the prior year following the record revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nAt €54.8m, inventories were significantly lower at the end of the year than in the prior year (€71.6m). The decrease is mainly due to planned inventory optimization, as the considerable uncertainties on procurement markets in recent years have now cleared.\n\nDeferred tax assets totaling €3.5m (prior year: €3.9m) mainly relate to temporary differences between the tax base and IFRS carrying amounts.\n\nCash and cash equivalents went up from €14.2m in the prior year to €16.7m.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\nEquity went down from €88.1m to €85.8m. Details regarding income and expenses recognized directly in equity in accordance with IFRS are shown in the Statement of Changes in Consolidated Equity (p.115). The equity ratio increased to 31.6% (prior year: 31.0%) [because of the lower balance sheet total compared to the prior year, primarily due to the](#page-114-0)  reduction in working capital.\n\nInterest-bearing loans fell slightly compared to December 31, 2022 from €41.4m to €39.1m. This includes a long-term loan in the amount of €5.2m taken out in the fiscal year to finance the acquisition of the site occupied by the American subsidiary. The €7.5m yearon-year decrease in short-term interest-bearing loans resulted from the significant improvement in cash flow.\n\nLease liabilities amounted to €19.4m as of the reporting date (prior year: €18.1m).\n\nNet financial debt (cash and cash equivalents less financial liabilities) stood at €41.9m as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: €45.2m). The decrease by €3.3m is mainly due to the increase in cash and cash equivalents and the reduction in interest-bearing loans.\n\nProvisions (including income tax provisions) in the amount of €27.1m (prior year: €28.3m) primarily consist of provisions for personnel, partial retirement obligations and warranties.\n\nTrade payables rose slightly from €22.7m to €24.0m.\n\nContract liabilities decreased to €29.1m (prior year: €36.4m). This item includes prepayments on orders from customers, although these have fallen significantly compared to the prior year, and deferred income for full maintenance, extended guarantees and prepaid service agreements.\n\nAt€1.7m, deferred tax liabilities were at the same level as the prior year (€1.6m). They relate to temporary differences between the tax base and IFRS carrying amounts.\n\n### Unrecognized internally generated intangible assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments\n\nThe main unrecognized internally generated intangible assets benefiting WashTec's business are the immense experience and expertise of the workforce. Know-how about the wash process and the ability to deploy that expertise in research and development constitute a key competitive advantage. Another key success factor for the WashTec Group is the sales and service network built up over many years.\n\nThere are no off-balance sheet financial instruments.\n\n### 2.3.4 Financial position\n\n### Capital structure\n\nAs part of centralized financial management, the companies of the WashTec Group are financed through WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH. The Company's liabilities are denominated in euros and US dollars. The base interest rate on the loans is variable and linked to EURIBOR, €STR and SOFR. As of December 31, 2023, the Group had one credit line for a total amount of €99.7m (prior year: €92.8m). The increase was in connection with borrowing to finance the acquisition of the site occupied by the US subsidiary.\n\nThe undrawn amount of the credit line available for future operating activities and to meet obligations was €56.5m as of the reporting date (prior year: €46.1m).\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Capital expenditure, depreciation and amortization, and impairments\n\nAs planned, capital expenditure, at €14.7m, was higher in the reporting year than in the prior year (€7.5m), mainly due to the acquisition of the site occupied by the American subsidiary in the amount of €9.5m (prior year: €0.1m). The focus of capital expenditure, accounting for €4.8m (prior year: €7.2m) was on Europe. Capital expenditure in Asia/ Pacific amounted to €0.5m (prior year: €0.2m).\n\nIn addition, there was an addition of €1.4m from the acquisition of the New Zealand distributor.\n\nDepreciation and amortization of non-current assets is applied in accordance with statutory requirements and WashTec's accounting policies. Assets are generally depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic useful life.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment. The impairment test is based on the Group-level internal planning for 2024 to 2029.\n\nRecognized intangible assets were tested for impairment. The impairment testing did not lead to the recognition of any impairment losses.\n\n### Cash flow statement\n\n| In €m                                      | 2023  | 2022  | Change   |        |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------|-------|----------|--------|\n|                                            |       |       | absolute | in %   |\n| EBT                                        | 38.4  | 37.3  | 1.1      | 2.9    |\n| Net cash inflow from operating activities  | 61.8  | 22.7  | 39.1     | 172.2  |\n| Net cash outflow from investing activities | -15.7 | -6.5  | -9.2     | -141.5 |\n| Free cash flow                             | 46.1  | 16.2  | 29.9     | 184.6  |\n| Net cash outflow from financing activities | -34.4 | -48.5 | 14.1     | 29.1   |\n| Net change in cash funds                   | 11.8  | -32.2 | 44.0     | 136.6  |\n| Net foreign exchange difference            | -0.2  | 0.6   | -0.8     | -133.3 |\n| Cash funds as of Jan. 1                    | -27.1 | 4.5   | -31.6    | -702.2 |\n| Cash funds as of Dec. 31                   | -15.6 | -27.1 | 11.5     | 42.4   |\n\nThe net cash inflow from operating activities increased significantly by €39.1m to €61.8m (prior year: €22.7m). This was mainly due to the reduction in net operating working capital by €21.6m to €83.5m (prior year: increase by €18.3m to €105.1m). The improvement is mainly due to the lower level of trade receivables following the record revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. Inventories were also reduced by €16.8m compared to the prior year. This was due to a significant decrease in uncertainty in the procurement markets.\n\nThe net cash outflow from investing activities was €−15.7m in fiscal year 2023 (prior year: €−6.5m). The increase in the cash outflow is mainly due to the acquisition of the site occupied by the US subsidiary. This was purchased effective January 2, 2023 following the termination of the previous lease agreement. The purchase price was USD10.3m. This was financed by long-term, five-year US dollar bank loans in the same amount. The cash inflows and outflows in connection with the sale of the Chinese subsidiary and the acquisition of the New Zealand subsidiary amounted to €−1.2m.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\nFree cash flow (cash inflow from operating activities – cash outflow from investing activities) increased significantly to €46.1m (prior year: €16.2m).\n\n#### Free cash flow in €m, multi-year comparison\n\nImage /page/77/Figure/3 description: The image is a bar graph with the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 on the x-axis. The y-axis is not labeled. The bar for 2019 has a value of 15.0. The bar for 2020 has a value of 45.6. The bar for 2021 has a value of 42.3. The bar for 2022 has a value of 16.2. The bar for 2023 has a value of 46.1.\n\nThe net cash outflow from financing activities was €−34.4m (prior year: €−48.5m). The cash outflow was €43.8m (prior year: €48.6m) and mainly consisted of the dividend payout of €29.4m (prior year: €38.8m) and the repayment of lease liabilities. That was offset by a €9.5m cash inflow from taking out interest-bearing loans (prior year: €0.1m).\n\nCash funds increased overall, mainly due to the higher free cash flow as a result of significantly improved working capital management, to €−15.6m as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: €−27.1m). The Company was able to meet its payment obligations at all times.\n\n### 2.4 Non-financial performance indicator\n\n| Accident rate                       |      |                  |      |                    |\n|-------------------------------------|------|------------------|------|--------------------|\n|                                     | 2022 | Guidance<br>2023 | 2023 | Change<br>absolute |\n| Work accidents/million hours worked | 4.2  | <4.2             | 4.2  | 0.0                |\n\nWashTec uses the number of work accidents per million hours worked as a key non-financial performance indicator. As in the prior year, the figure of 4.2 for 2023 was below the industry average reported for recent years by the employers' liability insurance associations (Berufsgenossenschaften). This meant that the target set for 2023 of an accident rate less than 4.2 was not met. WashTec targets further reductions in the number of occupational accidents.\n\n### 2.5 Employees\n\n#### Average number of employees by year, multi-year comparison\n\nImage /page/77/Figure/11 description: This image is a bar chart that shows the values for the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. The value for 2019 is 1,880. The value for 2020 is 1,798. The value for 2021 is 1,767. The value for 2022 is 1,806. The value for 2023 is 1,768.\n\nThe number of employees fell by 137 to 1,687 as of December 31, 2023 (prior year: 1,824). When comparing with the prior year, it should be noted that the December 31, 2022 figure included 50 employees of the subsidiary in China. Seven employees were added as of\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-78-0\"></span>December 31, 2023 on the initial consolidation of the New Zealand subsidiary. The average number of employees at WashTec during the year was 1,768 (prior year: 1,806).\n\nThe WashTec Group ensures that its employees receive appropriate remuneration. In Germany in particular, with the exception of AUWA-Chemie GmbH, the WashTec Group is subject to collective agreements with trade union IG Metall. Collective agreements with trade union IG Bergbau, Chemie, Energie serve as benchmarks at AUWA-Chemie GmbH.\n\n### 2.6 WashTec AG\n\nWashTec AG has its registered place of business in Augsburg and is the ultimate parent company of the WashTec Group. As such, it is responsible for the strategic management and control of all its subsidiaries. Since the Company does not have any operations of its own, its results of operations, financial position and cash flows are determined by the business performance of its subsidiaries.\n\nThe business performance of WashTec AG to a large extent corresponds to that of the WashTec Group, which is described in detail under \"Business performance\". The forecast for WashTec AG of a significant increase in net income for the period by ≥10% in fiscal year 2023 was not achieved. This is mainly due to the effects of the disposal of the Chinese subsidiary.\n\n| Income statement of WashTec AG (condensed) |      |      |          |       |\n|--------------------------------------------|------|------|----------|-------|\n| In €m                                      | 2023 | 2022 | Change   |       |\n|                                            |      |      | absolute | in %  |\n| Revenue                                    | 3.5  | 2.7  | 0.8      | 29.6  |\n| Personnel expenses                         | 2.0  | 2.1  | –0.1     | –4.8  |\n| Other operating expenses                   | 3.8  | 2.8  | 1.0      | 35.7  |\n| Investment result                          | 37.2 | 40.4 | –3.2     | –7.9  |\n| Net income for the period                  | 29.7 | 28.3 | 1.4      | 4.9   |\n| Profit carried forward                     | 0.4  | 1.5  | –1.1     | –73.3 |\n| Distributable profit                       | 30.1 | 29.8 | 0.3      | 1.0   |\n\n### Earnings\n\nRevenue at WashTec AG – HGB-basis, meaning as measured in accordance with the German Commercial Code – increased to €3.5m (prior year: €2.7m) and related to management costs charged on to subsidiaries.\n\nWashTec AG's personnel expenses (HGB-basis) of €2.0m (prior year: €2.1m) include Management Board remuneration and personnel expenses for the Legal and Investor Relations functions.\n\nOther operating expenses (HGB-basis), at €3.8m, were up on the prior year (€2.8m). The increase was partly due to consulting services related to the cost optimization of the new product generation.\n\nThe investment result (HGB-basis) comprises income under control and profit (loss) pooling agreements and a profit transfer agreement in the total amount of €24.1m (prior year: €35.8m) and interest income in the total amount of €0.2m (prior year: €0.1m). In addition, WashTec Holding GmbH paid a dividend in the amount of €13.0m (prior year: €4.5m).\n\nNet income for the period (HGB-basis) increased to €29.7m (prior year: €28.3m).\n\n| Balance Sheet of WashTec AG (condensed) |              |              |          |       |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------|-------|\n| In €m                                   | Dec 31, 2023 | Dec 31, 2022 | Change   |       |\n|                                         |              |              | absolute | in %  |\n| Non-current assets                      | 128.2        | 128.2        | 0.0      | 0.0   |\n| Receivables and other assets            | 39.0         | 40.9         | -1.9     | -4.6  |\n| Equity                                  | 159.2        | 158.9        | 0.3      | 0.2   |\n| Provisions                              | 4.9          | 7.9          | -3.0     | -38.0 |\n| Liabilities                             | 3.1          | 2.3          | 0.8      | 34.8  |\n| Balance sheet total                     | 167.2        | 169.1        | -1.9     | -1.1  |\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Financial position and cash flows\n\nNon-current assets (HGB-basis) mainly consist of shares in affiliated companies in the amount of €128.1m (prior year: €128.1m). Management tests the shares in affiliated companies annually for impairment. No impairment has been identified.\n\nThe receivables and other assets (HGB-basis) in the amount of €39.0m (prior year: €40.9m) primarily resulted from general clearing transactions with affiliated companies under control and profit (loss) pooling agreements and a profit transfer agreement.\n\nEquity (HGB-basis) was €159.2m (prior year: €158.9m). This yields an equity ratio of 95.2% (prior year: 94.0%).\n\nProvisions (HGB-basis) stood at €4.9m (prior year: €7.9m) and mainly related to taxes, legal and consulting expenses, auditing costs, Management Board remuneration and Supervisory Board remuneration. The decrease is mainly due to the lower provisions for income taxes.\n\nWashTec AG is financed by means of cash pooling with WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH.\n\n### Opportunities and risk report\n\nWashTec AG's opportunities and risks as the Group's ultimate parent company are derived from the opportunities and risks of its operating subsidiaries. WashTec AG is integrated into the Group-wide risk management system. Further information is provided in the opportunities and risk report. That section also provides a description of the internal control system as required under Section 289f (1) HGB.\n\nWashTec AG's main risks relate to the recoverability of the carrying amount of investments.

The focus is on maximum possible benefit to people who wash cars professionally. To strengthen its market and technology leadership in carwash, the Company will step up investment in products and digitalization in the short term.\n\n### Markets and products\n\nThe Company intends to further increase its presence and market share in the Group's main sales regions and product and service segments worldwide. This applies to all markets in which WashTec intends to occupy a leading position in every customer, product and service segment. Special emphasis is placed on Europe and North America. WashTec generates a significant portion of revenue in Europe and aims to further extend its market position there. In addition, North America in particular is planned to account for a higher share of the Group's revenue in the medium to long term.\n\n### General economic conditions\n\n[A detailed description of the overall economic development can be found in section 2.1 of](#page-64-0)  the management report. The WashTec Group has prepared its outlook against the general backdrop of a continuing uncertain economic and geopolitical environment and expects global economic growth in 2024 to be on a similar level to 2023. Uncertainties and tensions in relation to China, the war in Ukraine and the Middle East conflict may also have a negative impact on economic development.\n\n### WashTec business development\n\nThe outlook for fiscal year 2024 is subject to uncertainties that could have a material effect on the planned development of key performance indicators.\n\nWhen specifying the planning assumptions, it was assumed in particular that interest rates would decline slightly over the course of the year. Inflation rates will remain high, weighing on consumption and investment. Against this backdrop, the WashTec Group expects low economic growth this year. The forecast does not incorporate any significant increase in tensions with China or any significant escalation of the war in Ukraine or the conflict in the Middle East, or the possibility of these conflicts spreading to other countries.\n\nBased on a largely stable price level on the sales side and a solid order backlog at the end of 2023, the Company expects business to remain stable in 2024. The cost optimization measures initiated for the new product generation will contribute to a further increase in profitability. With regard to material prices, the WashTec Group expects the costs of purchased parts and labor to remain at their current high level and anticipates a lower price level for raw materials than in the prior year.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Management Board aims to actively further the development of the Group's strategy together with the entire workforce and to continuously improve operating performance. The focus for 2024 will be on further optimizing existing processes, product optimization, and investing in the development of digital solutions and products. We see the integration of our entire product and service portfolio – equipment, service and chemicals, embedded in digital solutions – as a source of major growth potential. In regional terms, we will focus on our core regions of Europe and North America in order to better exploit the market potential available there.\n\nTo accelerate this process, the Company will incur additional capital expenditure in the low single-digit million range in 2024.\n\nIn summary, the Management Board expects in its guidance that the Group-level key performance figures will develop as follows:\n\nFor fiscal year 2024, WashTec expects Group revenue on a similar level to the prior year (2023: €489.5m), with an increase in EBIT in the mid-single-digit percentage range (2023: €41.9m).\n\nRevenue and EBIT in Europe and North America are expected to develop in line with the targeted Group performance.\n\nThe Company expects net operating working capital to further normalize in 2024, particularly with regard to trade receivables/payables and inventories. As a result, the Company expects a free cash flow of between €30m and €40m (2023: €46.1m).\n\nWashTec aims to employ the capital available to it profitably and efficiently. Return on capital employed (ROCE) is our central measure of capital efficiency. In the medium term, the WashTec Group aims for ROCE of over 25%. For the coming year, the Company expects ROCE to remain at the prior-year level (±1%).\n\nThe accident rate (work accidents/million hours worked), which is already low compared with the industry average, is expected to fall further in fiscal year 2024 (2023: 4.2).\n\nEarnings in the separate financial statements of WashTec AG depend to a substantial extent on the profit transfers from subsidiaries. The key financial performance indicator is net income for the period. The forecast described for the WashTec Group therefore also applies to the business development of WashTec AG as the ultimate Group parent company.\n\n| Revenue on a similar level to the prior year | $\\pm$ 3%                          |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Increase in EBIT                             | Mid single-digit percentage range |\n| Free cash flow                               | €30m–€40m                         |\n| ROCE                                         | $\\pm$ 1 percentage point          |\n| Accident rate                                | <4.2                              |\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 4.2 Opportunities and risk report\n\nRisks are possible future developments or events that could lead to negative variation from projections or targets for the Company. Risk is intrinsic to any business venture.\n\nOpportunities are possible future developments or events that could lead to positive variation from projections or targets for the Company. A potential favorable outcome of a risk is also referred to as an opportunity.\n\nThe WashTec Group's international business activities give rise to opportunities and risks that are inextricably linked with its business. To address these opportunities and risks in a timely and controlled manner, the Company's key business processes are subject to an internal monitoring and control system. This enables timely action to be taken as necessary.\n\n### 4.2.1 Opportunities and risk management\n\n### Risk management\n\nRisks are identified, analyzed, assessed, managed, documented and communicated, and these activities monitored, using a uniform, Group-wide, multi-level risk management system. The purpose of this system is to identify risks posed by future events on the basis of short-term and mid-term planning (with both a 12-month and a two-to-three-year planning horizon) and to initiate any action needed to adequately address them. The aim of including risk analysis beyond the next twelve months is to aid in timely identification of potential future risks even if their impact is not material for the coming fiscal year. In the opinion of the Management Board, this risk early warning system is capable of suitably identifying all material and going-concern risks. The risk management system used by the Group allows systematic risk recording, documentation, assessment and aggregation on the basis of recognized statistical methods.\n\nAll identified risks are reported by divisional heads and analyzed within the risk management system on a semi-annual basis. Risks are assessed for EBIT impact – either as an absolute maximum impact figure or as a three-point estimation of a best-case, expected and worst-case impact figure – and for probability of occurrence and the effectiveness of possible countermeasures. Risks are assessed using uniform criteria. The EBIT impacts are presented in a gross/net analysis. The gross figure is the amount before any measures taken. Risk mitigation measures may comprise, for example, existing provisions, insurance policies, or planned projects and activities for preventive risk minimization. They are specified, implemented and monitored for effectiveness by divisional managers. The risk management system is also audited annually by Internal Audit.\n\nIn the risk analysis, all net individual risks are simulated using Monte Carlo simulation. They are simulated and aggregated both at Group level and at risk category level. Any correlations are taken into account. The simulation is used to determine both the expected loss (net) and value-at-risk with a confidence level of 95%. Value-at-risk represents the WashTec Group's overall potential risk and is used to determine risk-bearing capacity. Risk-bearing capacity is assessed in relation to Group liquidity, equity and operating earnings (EBIT). This is done by comparing value-at-risk with the corresponding risk coverage potential.\n\nIn individual risk analysis, individual risks and opportunities that have a similar cause-effect relationship are aggregated in the risk analysis.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe simulated expected loss (net) per risk category is classified according to financial impact and probability of occurrence as follows:\n\n| Financial impacts on Group EBIT in €k: |                    |               |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------|\n| 1                                      | Insignificant      | <499          |\n| 2                                      | Minor              | 500–4,999     |\n| 3                                      | Material           | 5,000–9,999   |\n| 4                                      | Serious            | 10,000–19,999 |\n| 5                                      | Existential threat | >20,000       |\n\n### W The probability of occurrence is indicated as follows:\n\n| 1 | Very unlikely | 1-15%  |\n|---|---------------|--------|\n| 2 | Unlikely      | 15-40% |\n| 3 | Possible      | 40-60% |\n| 4 | Likely        | 60-85% |\n| 5 | Very likely   | 85-99% |\n\nThere were no changes in risk classification compared with the prior year.\n\nBased on the combination of these two factors, all risks, aggregated by risk categories, are classified by threat potential as negligible (N), relevant (R), major (M) or threat to survival (S). This forms the basis for the subsequent management of risks.\n\n| Risk matrix        | Probability of occurrence |        |        |        |        |\n|--------------------|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Impacts            | 1–15%                     | 15–40% | 40–60% | 60–85% | 85–99% |\n| Existential threat | R                         | M      | M      | S      | S      |\n| Serious            | R                         | R      | M      | M      | M      |\n| Material           | R                         | R      | M      | M      | M      |\n| Minor              | N                         | R      | R      | R      | M      |\n| Insignificant      | N                         | N      | R      | R      | R      |\n\n### Opportunity management\n\nThe purpose of opportunity management is to identify, assess and manage positive future potential at an early stage and to take suitable measures for the implementation of new strategies and innovations. The identification and exploitation of opportunities (opportunity management) is an ongoing task of business geared to securing the long-term success of the Company and capitalizing on short-run advantages.\n\nOpportunities are collated, assessed and, to the extent possible, materialized for all divisions in regular budget planning and update sessions as well as in management meetings.\n\n### 4.2.2 Opportunities and risks\n\nThe opportunities and risks that could have a material impact on the development of the WashTec Group as of the December 31, 2023 balance sheet date are described in the following.\n\n### Uncertainties in financial markets and in overall economic development\n\n### Risks\n\nUncertainties and unforeseeable changes in the global economy, financial markets and the political landscape could adversely affect capital spending patterns in individual customer groups. Access to markets and terms of delivery can also change at short notice.\n\nIn view of the current economic situation, including the geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties, there continues to be uncertainty with regard to material prices and availability. The situation has eased compared to the last few years, which is why these risks are rated lower in terms of probability of occurrence and financial impact for the coming fiscal year.\n\nPersistently high interest rates and high construction costs give rise to a risk of further market contraction and may lead to a further weakening of investment behavior, particularly in the direct sales segment. The difficult market environment and instability in Central and\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\nEastern Europe due to the war in Ukraine may also have a negative impact on customer investment behavior.\n\nIn addition, the current Middle East conflict could lead to various risks for the Group. Supply conditions could become more difficult as a result. This could lead to higher logistics costs or reduced availability of materials, which in turn could be reflected in rising material prices. As little revenue is generated in this region, the direct impact on the Group's business development is considered to be non-material.\n\n### Opportunities\n\nThe easing of inflation and interest rates observed at the end of the year could continue in the coming fiscal year and lead to greater customer demand.\n\nThe general economic slowdown and the associated decline in demand could result in lower procurement prices for the Group.\n\n### Climate and environmental risks\n\n### Risks\n\nClimate change, regional droughts and water scarcity, increasing road congestion, rising fuel costs, the proliferation of inner-city vehicle-free zones and greater general environmental awareness could all lead to fewer vehicles on the road in order to protect the environment or comply with regulations. Such a trend could diminish carwash use and, accordingly, reduce capital spending on vehicle wash equipment.\n\nCar washing bans due to droughts, as seen in Southern Europe during past years, could have a negative effect on the Group's service and chemicals business. The impacts of climate change may also result in such bans on car washing being enshrined in law in the near future.\n\nThe WashTec Group does not currently consider shifts in consumer preferences towards low-emission or zero-emission products to be significant with regard to the carwash business model, as more conscious consumer behavior only affects the choice of means of propulsion and is of secondary importance for how frequently cars are washed.\n\nPotential changes in the way vehicles are utilized in the future, such as the increase in car-sharing models, will not materially affect WashTec's business model in the short term. In the medium term, such changes could lead to a shift from individual washing in gantry carwashes to autonomous washing in conveyor tunnel systems.\n\nNew mobility concepts could lead in the future to increased use of the existing vehicle fleet. In addition to the size of the fleet, the nature and intensity of vehicle use would then determine carwash demand. Vehicles need to be cleaned no matter how they are powered and regardless of the ownership model.\n\n### Opportunities\n\nThe scarcity and rising cost of fresh water as a resource could lead to an increase in automated vehicle washing. This is far more environment-friendly if the carwash has a water treatment system. According to the system, wash program and vehicle type, water recovery systems that recirculate wash water can reduce mains water consumption by up to 90%.\n\nAdditional countries adopting stricter legislation could drive a rise in demand for carwash systems with water recovery equipment. Similarly, rules and regulations such as the prohibition of hand car washing could have a positive effect on demand for carwash equipment.\n\nWashTec contributes significantly to environmental sustainability as a pioneer in the development of eco-friendly carwash chemicals.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Customers, competition and market\n\n### Risks\n\nA freeze on capital spending by individual major customers or the listing of other suppliers due to major customers launching new bid requests for framework supply agreements could lead to a decrease in revenue and/or to losses of market share for WashTec in virtually all regions. These risks could affect revenue performance in the North America region in particular in the years ahead.\n\nGiven the intensive competition in the industry, there are potential risks associated with price-based competition that could lead to increased price pressure in certain markets or market segments. WashTec has implemented a comprehensive and systematic market tracking system. Revenue risks that could arise from a potential decline in demand are monitored on an ongoing basis. Appropriate measures are taken as necessary to adapt products, optimize the product range and adjust capacity.\n\nReduced supply and higher prices for fossil fuels are driving demand for electric vehicles. This could lead to reduced use of filling stations as they exist today. At present, however, it is not possible to predict which recharging model will prevail for electric vehicles. However, our major customers believe that due to the existing vehicle fleet, this option will not have a significant impact on the number and use of filling stations over the next five to ten years.\n\nA further risk can arise if major customers sell some or all of their (filling station) networks. If stations or networks are then acquired by more than one purchaser, then this could lead to higher selling effort and render existing long-term contacts with decision makers obsolete. Similarly, the termination of partnerships with distributors or service providers could lead to increased costs for sales, service or installation.\n\n### Opportunities\n\nThe trend towards high-quality automated car washing will continue, including in regions outside of the developed markets. The Company's solid structure also allows it to invest in new products and markets. Local presence with the Company's own production plant in the North America region could lead to a positive outcome above the internally budgeted figures in the mid-term. The increasingly global procurement activities could enable further efficiency potential to be realized in the future procurement and production of individual components.\n\nCloser collaboration with our independent distributors in countries where WashTec does not have subsidiaries of its own could increase sales volumes in growth regions.\n\n### Capital expenditure\n\nCapital expenditure decisions are based among other things on assumptions and estimates about future developments. The assessment of risks and opportunities plays a significant role when reviewing potential capital expenditure.\n\n### Risks\n\nThere is a risk of the assumptions or estimates made about future market developments not materializing as expected, leading to a misallocation of investment spending or development projects not resulting in the expected contributions to earnings. Such misallocation could have a negative impact on the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the WashTec Group due to interest expense for tied-up capital and/or due to impairments. A significant increase in the duration of investment projects can also have a negative impact on the Company's earnings as a result of tied-up resources and/or cost overruns. To adequately address such risk, the Company has a detailed policy for approving capital expenditure and related spending.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Opportunities\n\nCapital expenditure offers numerous opportunities. Depending on the type of capital expenditure, these include opportunities to strengthen WashTec's market and competitive position and/or to improve earnings. Investment in digitalization in particular could open up new opportunities in terms of products and solutions for our customers and thus generate a competitive advantage. Smart technology optimizes carwash operation, for example, and allows operators to precisely meet customer needs. Remote services can also be used to increase machine availability and enhance carwash profitability.\n\n### Innovations and patents\n\n### Risks\n\nProduct innovations carry the risk of not being taken up by the market as expected. This could result in innovations not performing and generating revenue as expected and in them falling short of market expectations. To avoid this, WashTec keeps a close watch on new market launches and tests product effectiveness at an early stage.\n\nFor any company, launching new products on the market involves additional effort and risks. As well as the additional product placement effort and the aforementioned customer acceptance risk, there is further risk potential in managing the phase-out of existing products and in quality-related problems that only become apparent after market launch.\n\nIncreasing requirements for compliance with technical and country-specific standards result in higher financial and technical expense, but this is currently not considered material to the Group's business.\n\nInnovations by competitors, developments in the automotive industry and the emergence of new substitute technologies in related industries can have a significant and long-term impact on demand for WashTec products. However, the associated risks are primarily seen in the medium to long term and are therefore of secondary importance to risk assessment for the coming fiscal year.\n\n### Opportunities\n\nThe WashTec Group's research and development activities are aimed at adding to the existing product range, developing new wash systems and quickly and efficiently meeting individual customer requirements. WashTec innovations have received numerous past awards at industry trade fairs and have been successfully launched on the market.\n\nInnovative products could outperform customer expectations, generate new demand and win new customer groups or lead to a shift in market share among existing customer segments.\n\nWashTec has a large number of patents and licenses that are highly important to the Group's business and can therefore confer a competitive advantage.\n\n### IT security, quality and processes\n\n### Risks\n\nCyber risks are all risks to which computer and information networks and all IT-assisted business and production processes are exposed. The use of IT inevitably entails risks, which cannot ultimately be ruled out, for the stability of business processes and for the availability, confidentiality and integrity of information and data. Cyberattacks and ransomware attacks continue to grow in number and professionalism around the world. The risk in the context of cybercrime is classified as relevant overall.\n\nIT security, quality and process risks can arise in connection with new product launches and with improvements in internal processes and the introduction of new IT systems. The Company's operating processes critically depend on continuous availability of all technical systems. Were this to be at risk, it would have an overall negative impact on WashTec.\n\nWashTec has taken appropriate measures (training, implementing improved safety systems, etc.) to reduce these risks as far as possible. In the opinion of the Company, the stability of the IT systems in recent years indicates that they are robust. Significant effort and continuous investment will nevertheless be made in the coming year to further reduce these risks.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nQuality problems in the development or production of carwash equipment can result in subsequent costs for the Group. Any defects or problems are continuously recorded, monitored and corrected by quality assurance.\n\n### Opportunities\n\nContinuous improvement of business processes and the use of new technologies can have a positive impact on customer satisfaction. In addition, it may lead to process efficiency gains that have not been taken into account in normal planning.\n\n### Suppliers\n\n### Risks\n\nThe purchase of raw materials, components or services involves risks related to delivery delays, insufficient product availability, quality defects and price fluctuations.\n\nGiven the current economic situation, including the geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties, there continues to be uncertainty regarding material prices and availability.\n\nIn addition, rising diesel prices and road tolls, a shortage of skilled logistics workers, unsafe transportation conditions and trade route disruption of the kind being caused by the Middle East conflict can lead to rising transportation and logistics costs.\n\n### Opportunities\n\nCompetition among suppliers and their innovation potential makes it possible to achieve both technical and price improvements for the procurement of products or services.\n\nThe increasingly global procurement activities could enable further efficiency potential to be realized in the future procurement and production of individual components.\n\n### Capacity risks\n\nDemand fluctuations and varying production capacity utilization over the course of the year require corresponding capacity adjustments. The fact that sales volumes are higher in the final months of the year creates particular challenges in production planning.\n\nAbsences of production personnel due to illness can result in a sudden loss of production capacity for several days.\n\nOn the basis of internal sales volume planning, capacity risks at the production sites are identified as far as possible and mitigated by the deployment of temporary workers and flexible annual working time arrangements or, in the event of extreme fluctuations, by short time working. A significant shift in the course of the fiscal year could result in sales risks due to potential difficulties in adjusting capacity with temporary workers.\n\nDemand growth is met by continuous improvement of production processes and by timely capital expenditure on capacity expansion.\n\n### Takeover risks or changes in ownership structure\n\nIf its stock market valuation fails to sufficiently reflect the Company's long-term intrinsic value or the WashTec Group's performance sparks the interests of new investors, then this could lead to significant changes in ownership structure or a takeover.\n\nSuch events may lead to changes in the WashTec Group's established strategy, the composition of its executive bodies and its previously communicated expectations. Some of the WashTec Group's contractual agreements (such as loans agreements) include a change of control clause.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Financial and legal risks\n\nThe base interest rate on the existing financing arrangements is variable. Further interest rate rises could negatively impact the WashTec Group's earnings. However, given the increases in recent years, the Company does not anticipate any further significant interest rate hikes. Increased utilization of the credit lines, combined with the current high level of interest rates, poses the risk of higher financing costs.\n\nWashTec is also exposed to risks arising from different product-specific and country-specific rules, regulations and laws that affect its business activities and processes. There is a possibility that new litigation may arise and that existing litigation with contracting parties may be resolved. The Group manages these risks by involving the legal department in critical legal transactions at an early stage, by engaging external experts as necessary and by recognizing appropriate provisions.\n\n### Exchange rate changes\n\n### Risks\n\nDue to transactions with subsidiaries, exchange rate changes could affect operating performance. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations may affect the Group's income statement through the measurement of open foreign currency positions. To mitigate such effects when necessary, WashTec hedges against major risk with derivatives. The operational risk arising from individual transactions in foreign currencies is immaterial to the Group due to the small volume of such transactions.\n\n### Opportunities\n\nA weakening of the euro could lead to positive currency effects on revenue in the North America or Asia/Pacific regions.\n\n### Liquidity risk\n\nEnsuring that the subsidiaries are solvent at all times is essential for WashTec. The implemented cash management systems enable potential shortfalls to be identified in good time and appropriate action to be taken. Undrawn credit lines ensure the supply of liquidity.\n\nA liquidity risk could arise in that there might not be adequate cash to discharge financial obligations as they fall due, for example due to payments not factored into cash planning.\n\nExisting credit lines can be extended in the event that the development of the business results in additional financing requirements.\n\nThe company considers itself well positioned with regard to liquidity risks. With the currently available credit lines, the Company has sufficient liquid resources and borrowing lines to be able to be flexible and also to invest in future growth.\n\n### Credit and default risks\n\nThe WashTec Group exclusively conducts business with creditworthy third parties. To minimize credit risk, order limits are imposed in cases where customers do not have first-class credit standing. For new regional customers, the Company requests evidence of credit standing or financing. The recognized allowances for trade receivables are considered sufficient to cover the actual default risk. There is no material credit risk concentration within the Group. For selected customers, insolvency coverage is taken out with reputable credit insurers when receivables exceed a certain level.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Tax risks\n\nThe WashTec Group mostly recognizes deferred taxes in relation to temporary differences. Changes in tax legislation that affect the tax rate could result in expense from the remeasurement of recognized deferred tax assets and thus adversely affect consolidated equity and/or earnings per share.\n\nFurther risks could arise due to ongoing pending tax audits at Group companies. Due to the international nature of the WashTec Group's business activities, tax risks cannot be ruled out until tax audits have been concluded.\n\n### Employee risks\n\nWashTec is highly dependent on qualified employees and specialists, especially in development, customer care and carwash equipment programming and operation. The unexpected loss of employees, changes in the age structure of the workforce or difficulties finding qualified employees could have an adverse effect on WashTec's development. This is notably exacerbated by the current shortage of skilled labor.\n\n### 4.2.3 Overview of corporate risks\n\nThe following table shows the risks aggregated by risk category:\n\n|                                        | Probability of<br>occurrence | Change |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------|\n| Overall economic development           | relevant                     | →      |\n| Climate and environmental risks        | relevant                     | →      |\n| Customers, competition and market      | relevant                     | →      |\n| Capital expenditure risks              | relevant                     | →      |\n| Innovations and patents                | relevant                     | →      |\n| IT security, quality and process risks | relevant                     | →      |\n| Supplier risks                         | relevant                     | →      |\n| Capacity risks                         | relevant                     | →      |\n| Takeover risks                         | negligible                   | →      |\n| Financial and legal risks              | relevant                     | →      |\n| Currency risks                         | negligible                   | →      |\n| Liquidity risks                        | negligible                   | →      |\n| Credit and default risks               | negligible                   | →      |\n| Tax risks                              | relevant                     | →      |\n| Employee risks                         | relevant                     | →      |\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 4.2.4 Overall risk assessment\n\nThe established risk management system is appropriate in the assessment of the Management Board and is subject to continuous improvement. The solid business model also limits business risks and opens up additional opportunities. Aggregation of the most significant individual risks across all corporate divisions and functions provides an indication of the Group's overall risk assessment, even though it is considered unlikely that the individual risks will materialize simultaneously. The cumulative expected loss (net) across all individual risks is €22.7m as of the end of 2023 (prior year: €25.9m) and is thus slightly down on the prior year, mainly due to the lower material price risks.\n\nBased on the individual risks set out above, the overall assessment is as follows:\n\nThe total number of risks that have a material impact on the WashTec Group is at the same level as in the prior year. Risks related to material prices and availability decreased in the reporting year, but continue to apply in view of the current economic situation, including the geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties. In the long term in particular, ongoing conflicts in the Middle East could complicate transportation conditions and thus lead to rising material and logistics costs. The Group does not currently expect this to have any material impact on business development in the coming year. Risks associated with overall economic development are classified as lower than in the prior year. However, a continuation of the high interest rates and high construction costs could lead to a further contraction of the overall market, resulting in lower revenue, particularly in the direct customer business. The\n\ndifficult market environment and instability in Central and Eastern Europe due to the Ukraine war may also have a negative impact on customer investment behavior. Given the intensive competition in the industry, the risks in relation to customers, competition and market remain unchanged. As in the prior year, the number of ransomware attacks and cyberattacks continues to increase, as a result of which IT security risks continue to be relevant for WashTec. However, this risk is considered to be lower than in the prior year due to improvements in the IT security system and other measures.\n\nBased on the findings of the risk management process, the Management Board is not currently aware of any risks that could cast doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nIn accordance with Section 317 (4) HGB, the risk early warning system set up in accordance with Section 91 (2) AktG is audited by the auditor as part of the audit of the annual financial statements. The audit showed that the Management Board has taken the measures required in accordance with Section 91 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), in particular for the establishment of a monitoring system in suitable form. In all material respects, the monitoring system is capable of ensuring, with reasonable assurance, timely identification of any risks that may raise doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Risk reporting is also provided to the Supervisory Board.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-92-0\"></span>5\n\nWashTec's risk management system (RMS) is described in the Risk Report under 4.2. Opportunities and risk report.\n\nThe internal control system (ICS) comprises all systematically defined controls and monitoring activities. It monitors principles and procedures using preventive and detective controls.\n\nAn effective and efficient internal control system is critical to the successful management of risk in business processes. The ICS covers all WashTec companies. The scope of activities to be performed by each entity varies, depending among other things on the entity's materiality to the consolidated financial statements and the specific risks associated with it. Overall responsibility for the ICS lies with the Management Board. In the manner of a compliance management system, the purpose of WashTec's ICS is to ensure effectiveness and efficiency in business activities, orderly and reliable accounting, and compliance with the legal provisions and requirements relevant to the WashTec. Accordingly, WashTec's internal control system covers all key business processes and goes beyond controls in the accounting process.\n\nIn the accounting process, various monitoring measures and controls help to ensure, for example, that the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with requirements. WashTec uses a uniform Group consolidation system to ensure consistency. This also minimizes the risk of misstatements in accounting and external reporting. Adequate functional segregation and application of the dual control principle reduce the risk of fraudulent conduct. The coordinated processes, systems and controls provide sufficient assurance that the accounting process complies with IFRS, the\n\nGerman Commercial Code (HGB) and other accounting-related requirements and laws. Group-wide accounting policies ensure the uniformity of accounting throughout the WashTec Group. New accounting requirements and changes in existing accounting requirements are examined for their impact on the WashTec Group and applied on a timely basis.\n\nWashTec regularly performs system backups in the case of relevant IT systems in order to prevent data loss and system downtime as far as possible. The security policy also includes in-built system controls, manual spot checks by experienced staff, role-based permissions and physical access restrictions.\n\nWashTec continuously develops the requirements for the internal control system and adapts the control landscape to changing processes. Internal Audit is involved in the entire process and regularly reviews the effectiveness of the internal control system as part of the riskbased annual audit plan.\n\n### *Note: The following paragraph was not subject to an audit by the auditor.*\n\n*WashTec's Management Board evaluates the output of the RMS and the ICS at Management Board meetings and conducts an annual assessment of their appropriateness and effectiveness. The Management Board has no indication that the RMS and ICS (including the CMS), taken as a whole, were not adequate or effective in any material respect as of December 31, 2023. However, as part of a continuous improvement process, the Management Board recognizes the need for ongoing optimization to ensure effectiveness and efficiency. Irrespective of this, there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any RMS or ICS. No system considered to be adequate and effective is guaranteed to identify all risks or rule out process or control violations in all circumstances. The Audit Committee is systematically integrated into WashTec's RMS and ICS (including the CMS). In particular, the Audit Committee monitors accounting and the accounting process as well as the appropriateness and effectiveness of the ICS and the RMS.*\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-93-0\"></span>Risk reporting in relation to the use of financial instruments 6\n\nThe main risks for the WashTec Group arising from derivative financial instruments comprise credit, liquidity and market price risks. Company policy is to avoid or limit such risk as far as possible. The management of interest rate, currency, liquidity, credit and default risk has already been described in the risk report. When necessary, the Company also considers the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge market price risks. Interest rate and currency risks are the main market price risks. At the inception of a hedging relationship, both the hedging relationship and the Group's risk management objectives and strategies with regard to the hedge are formally designated and documented. This is described in detail in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with Group policy, there is no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes.\n\nImage /page/93/Picture/5 description: In a close-up shot, a car is being washed in a car wash.

There are no different classes of shares. The Management Board is not aware of any restrictions regarding voting rights or the transfer of shares. There are no shares carrying special rights granting their holders a power of control.\n\n### Restrictions regarding voting rights and the transfer of shares\n\nIn accordance with Section 71b of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Company has no rights in respect of treasury shares it acquires. In all other respects, each share has one vote.

Under Section 7.1 of the Articles of Association, the Management Board consists of one or more members. The number of members of the Management Board is determined by the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn accordance with the Company's Articles of Association read in conjunction with the current Management Board rules of procedure, the Management Board currently comprises three members. The Articles of Association do not lay down any special requirements with respect to the appointment and removal of one or all of the members of the Management Board. The Supervisory Board is responsible for appointments and removals. Members may be reappointed to the Management Board or have their term of office extended.\n\nAmendments to the Articles of Association are made pursuant to Section 179 and 133 AktG and to Sections 9.14 and 9.15 of the Articles of Association. The Company has not made use of the option to lay down further requirements for amendments to the Articles of Association.\n\nSection 9.14 of the Articles of Association reduces the statutory minimum requirements to the extent permitted by law. The Supervisory Board is authorized to make solely formal amendments to the Articles of Association.\n\n### Powers of the Management Board to issue or buy back shares\n\n### Authorized Capital (Section 5.1 of the Articles of Association of WashTec AG)\n\nBy resolution of the Annual General Meeting on May 16, 2022, the Management Board is authorized, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to increase the registered share capital on one or more occasions on or before June 30, 2025 by a total amount of up to €8,000,000 (Authorized Capital) by issuing new no-par-value bearer shares in exchange for cash and/or non-cash contributions. The shareholders must be granted preemptive rights in\n\nthis connection unless otherwise stipulated. The new shares may also be underwritten by one or more banks designated by the Management Board with the obligation to offer them to the shareholders for subscription (indirect subscription right). However, the Management Board is authorized (subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board) to exclude shareholders' preemptive rights in certain cases as set out in Section 5.1 of the Articles of Association of WashTec AG. The Management Board has not made use of these authorizations to date. The authorized capital is intended to enable the Company to act rapidly and flexibly as needed in order to raise equity capital on favorable terms.\n\n### Share buy-back\n\nUnless expressly permitted by law, the Company cannot acquire or make use of treasury shares except with authorization from the Annual General Meeting. By resolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 16, 2022, the Company is authorized to acquire, on or before June 30, 2025 and for purposes other than to trade in the Company's own shares, the Company's own shares in the amount of up to 10% of the share capital of €40,000,000 at the time of the resolution or – if lower – at the time the authorization is exercised. The Management Board may opt to acquire such shares on the stock exchange, by means of a public purchase offer to all shareholders or by means of a public invitation directed at all shareholders to tender shares for sale. The precise terms and conditions for the purchase and use of treasury shares are set out in item 8 of the agenda in the 2022 Invitation to the Annual General Meeting of WashTec AG. Following completion of the share buyback offer in September 2015, and including shares previously held, WashTec AG now holds a total of 594,646 of treasury shares, representing approximately 4.25% of its registered share capital.\n\n### Significant agreements subject to a change of control of the company following a takeover bid\n\nIndividual contractual agreements entered into by the WashTec Group (such as loan agreements) provide for the option of extraordinary termination in the event of a takeover (change of control). In that event there may also be a change of management.\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Corporate Governance Statement\n\n### In accordance with Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board of WashTec AG operate in accordance with the principles of good and responsible corporate governance. In this Corporate Governance Statement in accordance with Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, or HGB), the Management Board reports on corporate governance at WashTec AG and in the WashTec Group. The Corporate Governance Statement also includes the declaration on the German Corporate Governance Code (the \"Code\") in accordance with Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, or AktG).\n\n### 8.1 Declaration of Conformity\n\n<span id=\"page-96-0\"></span>8\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board of WashTec AG identify with the objectives of the Code, which encourage responsible, transparent corporate management and supervision directed at sustained growth in shareholder value.\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board regularly direct their attention to satisfying the Code's requirements, which comprise principles, recommendations and suggestions. The recommendations of the Code are largely complied with.\n\nThe Declaration of Conformity in accordance with Section 161 AktG as submitted jointly by the Management Board and Supervisory Board on December 19, 2023 is reprinted below. [All submitted declarations are published in the Investor Relations section of the Company's](https://ir.washtec.de/en/)  website at www.washtec.de.\n\n### *\"WashTec AG, Augsburg*\n\n### *Declaration of Conformity of December 19, 2023 under Section 161 AktG*\n\n*The Management Board and Supervisory Board submitted the last Declaration of Conformity on December 15, 2022.*\n\n*The Management Board and Supervisory Board hereby declare that since submission of the last Declaration of Conformity on December 15, 2022, WashTec AG has complied with the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (the \"Code\") issued by the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code as amended on April 28, 2022, and will continue to comply with those recommendations in the future, with the following exceptions:*\n\n*In the first sentence of Recommendation G.10, the Code recommends predominantly share-based variable remuneration for the Management Board. The long-term variable remuneration under the Long Term Incentive Program (LTIP) contains significant share price-based components. These include the total shareholder return target weighted at 30% under the LTIP, which is used to assess the share price performance over the duration of the three-year incentive period. In light of this, the Management Board and Supervisory Board, as a purely precautionary measure, declare an exception from the first sentence of Code Recommendation G.10. It should be noted in this connection that the LTIP provides for the possibility, subject to fulfillment of specified conditions, of increasing the remuneration under the LTIP by up to a maximum of twofold by means of a corresponding personal investment in WashTec AG shares. This option provides a clear incentive for members of the Management Board to take a stake in the risks and rewards of the share price performance.*\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\n*Furthermore, the second sentence of Code Recommendation G.10 recommends that granted long-term variable remuneration amounts should be accessible to Management Board members only after a period of four years. The incentive period under the LTIP is three years and is based on the regular term of Management Board contracts, which is likewise three years. In view of this three-year cycle, the Management Board and the Supervisory Board consider a three-year period under the LTIP to be appropriate. Accordingly, the Supervisory Board and Management Board declare an exception from the second sentence of Code Recommendation G.10. The Code is complied with to the extent that one-sixth of the final cash award from the personal investment LTIP component is subject to an obligation to purchase shares with a three-year holding period.*\n\n*The remuneration system for the remuneration of members of the Management Board of WashTec AG adopted by the Supervisory Board in its meeting of March 24, 2021 and approved by the Annual General Meeting of WashTec AG of May 18, 2021 applies to all Management Board contracts entered into or renewed after the Annual General Meeting on May 18, 2021. The applicable LTIP 2021– 2023 for the Management Board, which includes a negative bonus/clawback arrangement, was adopted effective January 1, 2021 and applies to all members of the Management Board. This is intended to be retained in the subsequent LTIP 2024-2026. With regard to the Management Board contracts current at the time of the 2021 Annual General Meeting, these have continued or will continue to apply under the conditions there specified. Recommendations G.11 sentence 2 (retention and reclaiming of variable remuneration) and G.13 sentence 2 of the Code (severance payment taken into account against compensation payments in the event of a post-contractual non-compete clause) are not implemented in these Management Board contracts. This is due to the fact that the Management Board* \n\n*contracts current at the time of the 2021 Annual General Meeting were entered into on the basis of the previous remuneration system adopted by resolution of the Supervisory Board on December 19, 2019.*\n\n*The second sentence of Code Recommendation G.18 specifies that any performance-related remuneration for the Supervisory Board should be geared to the long-term development of the Company. The Supervisory Board of WashTec AG is granted annual performance-based remuneration under the Articles of Association and long-term performance-based remuneration in accordance with the resolution of the 2021 Annual General Meeting (\"Supervisory Board LTIP\"). The current Supervisory Board LTIP applies for the period January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The Management Board and the Supervisory Board are proceeding on the assumption that the recommendation will be complied with and, as a precautionary measure, declare that the maximum achievable cash award under the Supervisory Board LTIP, broken down pro rata for each year, will generally exceed the maximum achievable annual performance-based remuneration.*\n\n*Augsburg, December 19, 2023*\n\n*Management Board and Supervisory Board\"*\n\n*Further information about corporate governance can be found on the Internet at www.washtec.de.

As the Company's executive body, it is required to act in the Company's best interests, in furtherance of which it seeks to deliver sustained growth in shareholder value. It is responsible for establishing the principles of the Company's corporate policies in consultation with the Supervisory Board. The Management Board is also responsible for the strategic direction of the Company, the planning and setting of the Company's budget, the allocation of resources and the oversight of the business units. In addition, the Management Board is responsible for ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and with internal corporate guidelines or directives, and it works to ensure compliance by all Group companies. It reports to the Supervisory Board regularly, promptly and comprehensively on all issues of relevance to the Company and the Group relating to strategy and strategy implementation, planning, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows, compliance, risks and risk management.\n\nThe work of the Management Board is governed by rules of procedure for the Management Board, which are issued by the Supervisory Board. In particular, the rules of procedure define the portfolios of the members of the Management Board, specify the matters reserved for decision by the full Management Board, determine the matters requiring the approval of the Supervisory Board and establish the majority voting requirements for Management Board resolutions.\n\nThe members of the Management Board in the reporting period were Dr. Ralf Koeppe, Mr. Sebastian Kutz, Mr. Andreas Pabst and Mr. Stephan Weber.\n\nThe Management Board membership of Dr. Koeppe was terminated by mutual agreement on February 29, 2024. He will be succeeded by Mr. Michael Drolshagen, who the Supervisory Board has appointed as new the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) with effect from May 1, 2024.\n\n| Name                           | Period                            | Portfolio                                                                                                                                                         |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dr. Ralf Koeppe<br>(CEO & CTO) | January 1 to<br>December 31, 2023 | Corporate Culture, Communication and Philosophy, HR,<br>R&D, Supply Chain, Production, Quality, Sustainability,<br>AUWA-Chemie GmbH                               |\n| Sebastian Kutz (CSO)           | March 1 to<br>December 31, 2023   | Global Sales and Service, Key Account Management,<br>Marketing, Business Units/Product Management, Service<br>Support, WashTec Carwash Management GmbH            |\n| Andreas Pabst (CFO)            | January 1 to<br>December 31, 2023 | Finance/Controlling, IT, Procurement, Investor Relations,<br>Legal and Compliance, Risk Management, Internal Audit,<br>Insurance, WashTec Financial Services GmbH |\n| Stephan Weber (CSO)            | January 1 to<br>February 28, 2023 | Global Sales and Service, KAM/CWM, Marketing and<br>Product Units/Product Management                                                                              |\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Succession planning and diversity policy\n\nTogether with the Management Board, the Supervisory Board ensures that long-term succession planning is in place for the Management Board. The CEO and the Chairman of the Supervisory Board hold regular discussions on this topic as part of such planning. This issue is also regularly addressed by the Supervisory Board in its meetings. Long-term succession planning is based in particular on discussions between the Supervisory Board and the members of the Management Board and on contacts with senior executives of the Company. Terms of office and renewal options for current Management Board members are discussed along with potential successors.\n\nWashTec aims as a matter of policy for the composition of the Management Board to be based on qualification.\n\nThe Supervisory Board pays particular attention to diversity as part of the selection process for new Management Board members. In connection with filling vacancies on the Management Board, the Supervisory Board prepares a requirements profile and conducts interviews with suitable candidates. When making appointments to the Management Board, efforts are made to ensure that candidates have experience in the same or a similar industry. Based on this, the Supervisory Board decides on appointments to fill vacant Management Board positions taking into account the requirements profile and specific qualification requirements. Where necessary, the Supervisory Board and the Personnel Committee are assisted by external consultants in the preparation of requirements profiles and the selection of candidates.\n\nGiven suitable experience, people of all age groups can be members of the Management Board. In accordance with recommendation B.5 of the Code, the Supervisory Board has set a standard age limit of 65 for members of the Management Board. Information on targets [for the percentage of women on the Management Board is provided under heading 8.6 on](#page-105-0)  page 106.\n\n### 8.4 Supervisory Board\n\n### Supervisory Board procedures\n\nThe Supervisory Board of WashTec AG advises and monitors the Management Board in its management of the Company, including the management of the Group. Management Board decisions of major significance – for example, acquisitions, divestments and financing measures – are subject to Supervisory Board approval. The Supervisory Board regularly discusses business development and planning, as well as the Company's strategy and its implementation. The Supervisory Board reviews the Company's quarterly statements and half-year report and approves the annual financial statements of WashTec AG and the consolidated financial statements. As there is no resolution of the Annual General Meeting pursuant to Section 172 AktG, the annual financial statements of WashTec AG are adopted on approval by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board monitors the Company's compliance with the law, regulatory requirements and internal corporate guidelines. Its scope of responsibilities also includes appointing the members of the Management Board and defining their portfolios. In addition, the Supervisory Board adopts resolutions on, among other things, the remuneration system for the Management Board (cf. section 87a AktG), on the basis of which the specific remuneration of individual Management Board members is determined. The Supervisory Board submitted a revised remuneration system for members of the Management Board to the 2021 Annual General Meeting of WashTec AG for approval, which was granted by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe work of the Supervisory Board is governed by internal rules of procedure, in particular pertaining to the convocation and conduct of meetings, the adoption of resolutions and the [manner in which any conflicts of interest are handled. The rules of procedure are available](https://ir.washtec.de/en/corporate-governance/)  on the Company's website at: Rules of Procedure for the *Supervisory Board – WashTec AG.*\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-100-0\"></span>The Supervisory Board regularly reviews the efficiency of its work in a self-assessment. The self-assessment is based on a questionnaire that is regularly updated and revised in accordance with the requirements of the Code. The most recent self-assessment was carried out in the first quarter of 2023. The results of the assessment were also presented and discussed in depth in the first quarter of 2023. Those findings confirm a professional, constructive working relationship characterized by a high degree of trust and openness both within the Supervisory Board and in its dealings with the Management Board. A number of suggestions were also taken up and put into practice during the course of the year. No notable deficits were identified.\n\nThe Management Board and Supervisory Board work closely together in the best interests of the Company. No conflicts of interest requiring disclosure to the Supervisory Board arose on the part of members of the Management Board or Supervisory Board. The independent advice and monitoring of the Management Board by the Supervisory Board has been and continues to be ensured at all times.\n\n### Composition of the Supervisory Board and of Supervisory Board committees\n\nIn accordance with the Articles of Association of WashTec AG, the Supervisory Board consists of six members elected by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Chairman of the Company's Supervisory Board, Dr. Günter Blaschke, notified the Company's Management Board on November 8, 2023 that he would be stepping down from the Supervisory Board effective December 31, 2023. The decision was made for personal reasons and by mutual agreement with the Supervisory Board and the Management Board.\n\nOn December 19, 2023, the Supervisory Board unanimously elected Ulrich Bellgardt – member of the Supervisory Board since 2014 and Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board – as the new Chairman of the Supervisory Board of WashTec AG effective January 1, 2024. Peter Wiedemann, member of the Supervisory Board since 2022, was elected as the new Deputy Chairman of the Company's Supervisory Board effective January 1, 2024.\n\nFollowing Dr. Blaschke's departure from the Supervisory Board, a resolution on the election of a new member of the Supervisory Board will be adopted at the 2024 Annual General Meeting on May 14, 2024.\n\nIn order to perform its duties efficiently and in accordance with the requirements of the Code, the Supervisory Board has established an Audit Committee, a Personnel Committee, a Nominating Committee, a Corporate Strategy and Sustainability Committee, a Sales Strategy Committee, and an Innovation and Production Committee.\n\n*Committee composition until December 31, 2023*\n\n|                                                     | Audit<br>Committee | Personnel<br>Committee | Nomination<br>Committee           | Innovation<br>and<br>Production<br>Committee | Sales<br>Committee          | Corporate<br>Strategy and<br>Sustainability<br>Committee |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dr. Günter Blaschke<br>(until December 31,<br>2023) |                    | C                      | C (until<br>November<br>13, 2023) | M                                            | C                           | M                                                        |\n| Ulrich Bellgardt                                    |                    | M                      | C (from<br>November<br>14, 2023)  | M                                            | M                           | C                                                        |\n| Dr. Hans Liebler                                    | M                  |                        | M                                 |                                              |                             |                                                          |\n| Heinrich von Portatius                              | M                  |                        |                                   |                                              | M (from<br>May 15,<br>2023) |                                                          |\n| Dr. Alexander Selent                                | C                  | M                      |                                   |                                              |                             | M                                                        |\n| Peter Wiedemann                                     |                    |                        | M                                 | C                                            |                             |                                                          |\n\n*C: Committee chairperson M: Committee member*\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *Committee membership from January 1, 2024*\n\n|                        | Audit<br>Committee | Personnel<br>Committee | Nomination<br>Committee | Innovation<br>and<br>Production<br>Committee | Sales<br>Strategy<br>Committee | Corporate<br>Strategy and<br>Sustainability<br>Committee |\n|------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Ulrich Bellgardt       |                    | C                      | C                       | M                                            | M                              | C                                                        |\n| Dr. Hans Liebler       | M                  |                        | M                       |                                              | M                              |                                                          |\n| Heinrich von Portatius | M                  | M                      |                         | M                                            | C                              |                                                          |\n| Dr. Alexander Selent   | C                  | M                      |                         |                                              |                                | M                                                        |\n| Peter Wiedemann        |                    |                        | M                       | C                                            |                                | M                                                        |\n\n*C: Committee chairperson M: Committee member*\n\nThe primary purpose of the committees is to prepare Supervisory Board meetings and resolutions for the plenary Supervisory Board. Their responsibilities are set out in detail in section 10 onwards of the Rules of Procedure for the Supervisory Board. Within the scope of the overall responsibility of the Supervisory Board, each member performs certain duties on the committees based on the member's expertise. The committee chairpersons each report regularly to the Supervisory Board on the work of the committees.\n\nThe membership of the Supervisory Board, meeting attendance and details of the Supervisory Board's work together with that of its committees in the reporting year are presented [in the Report of the Supervisory Board beginning on page 11.](#page-10-0)\n\nIn March 2022, taking into account the legal requirements and the recommendations of the Code, the Supervisory Board of WashTec AG adopted specific objectives for its composition, including a profile of skills and expertise and a diversity policy for the Supervisory Board.\n\n### Independence\n\nThe Supervisory Board is required to include what it considers to be an appropriate number of independent members within the meaning of the Code. For this purpose, more than half of the shareholder representatives are required to be independent from the company and the Management Board. If the company has a controlling shareholder, at least one of these shareholder representatives is also required to be independent from the controlling shareholder. The Chair of the Supervisory Board, the Chair of the Audit Committee, as well as the Chair of the Personnel Committee, are required to be independent from the company and the Management Board. The Chair of the Audit Committee is also required to be independent from any controlling shareholder.\n\n### Diversity policy\n\nDiversity contributes to a broad range of experience, perspectives, knowledge and skills within the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board therefore seeks to ensure sufficient diversity in terms of personality, gender, internationality, educational or professional background, expertise, experience and age distribution, taking particular account of the following criteria for its composition:\n\n- W The Supervisory Board as a whole is required to have a balanced age structure, including both younger professionals and older members with greater professional and life experience.\n- W In elections to the Supervisory Board, the aim is to ensure that, in addition to suitability in terms of personal and professional skills and expertise, the Supervisory Board includes both male and female members. The composition of the Supervisory Board must be based on the applicable legal requirements and on the target quotas established on the basis of the Act on Equal Participation of Women and Men in Leadership Positions (Führungspositionengesetz).\n- W The Supervisory Board is composed of individuals who, in addition to their personal and professional skills and expertise, preferably also have different educational and occupational backgrounds – such as engineering, business, law or the humanities.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe guiding principle for the composition of the Supervisory Board is to ensure professional monitoring and advice of the Management Board of WashTec AG. Its members as a whole are required to possess the knowledge, skills and professional expertise necessary to properly perform the duties of the Supervisory Board of WashTec AG as an internationally operating listed company in the mechanical engineering sector.\n\nCandidates proposed for election to the Supervisory Board are required to have the personality, knowledge and experience to properly perform the duties of a member of the Supervisory Board of WashTec AG as an internationally operating listed company in the mechanical engineering sector. Each member of the Supervisory Board is required to possess the integrity and independence of judgment to fulfill his or her responsibilities of oversight and control. For the purpose of advising and monitoring the Management Board, each member of the Supervisory Board is also required to have appropriate experience from management functions or to have otherwise acquired the necessary skills.\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board are each responsible for ensuring that they have sufficient time at their disposal to properly perform their duties. It is necessary to take into account in this connection that at least four ordinary Supervisory Board meetings are held each year, each of which requires adequate preparation, that sufficient time must be available for the review of the annual and consolidated financial statements, and that membership of one or more Supervisory Board committees requires additional time.\n\nSupervisory Board members are required to comply with the limit on the number of supervisory board offices held as recommended by the Code.\n\nThe normal age limit for membership of the Supervisory Board, as laid down in the rules of procedure for the Supervisory Board, is 75 years.\n\nThe Supervisory Board as a whole is required to possess all skills and expertise considered material in view of WashTec's activities. This includes, in particular, knowledge and experience in the following areas of expertise:\n\n| Area of expertise                                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Leadership experience/management                                         | Leadership/management experience through holding an executive<br>position or as a member of a supervisory board or similar body in<br>a (listed) company                                                                                                                 |\n| Technology and innovations (including<br>engineering and digitalization) | Knowledge and experience in the areas of technology and<br>innovations (including engineering and digitalization)                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Production, sales and marketing                                          | Knowledge and experience in the areas production, sales and<br>marketing                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Finance                                                                  | Knowledge and experience in the application of accounting<br>principles and the application of internal control procedures and<br>auditing                                                                                                                               |\n| Risk management and compliance                                           | Knowledge and experience in risk management and in the area of<br>general corporate compliance                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Human resources                                                          | Knowledge and experience in personnel leadership, personnel<br>management and personnel development                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Sustainability (ESG)                                                     | Knowledge and experienced of ESG factors and their significance<br>and of sustainability issues of importance to the WashTec Group,<br>and knowledge of corporate governance in listed companies<br>(German Corporate Governance Code, Market Abuse Regulation,<br>etc.) |\n| Internationality                                                         | Knowledge and experience (including non-native language skills)<br>in international business activities                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Capital market and investor relations                                    | Knowledge and experience (including non-native language skills)<br>in international business activities                                                                                                                                                                  |\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition, in view of the requirements in Section 100 (5) AktG, at least one member of the Supervisory Board must have expertise in the field of accounting and at least one other member of the Supervisory Board must have expertise in the field of auditing. According to the Code, the expertise in the field of accounting consists of special knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control and risk management systems, and the expertise in the field of auditing consists of special knowledge and experience in the auditing of financial statements. Accounting and auditing also include sustainability reporting and its audit and assurance. The chairman of the audit committee is required to have appropriate expertise in at least one of the two areas. The members as a whole must be familiar with the sector in which the company operates.\n\n### Implementation/composition of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board of WashTec AG in the reporting period was composed in accordance with its objectives and the above requirements. All members of the Supervisory Board in office in the reporting period have diverse professional and educational backgrounds, international experience and many years of management experience. The members as a whole are familiar with the sector in which the Company operates and have the knowledge, skills and experience that are material to WashTec. The expertise of the Supervisory Board and the Corporate Strategy and Sustainability Committee on sustainability issues relevant to the Company enables the Supervisory Board, in its monitoring and advisory capacity, to monitor the inclusion of environmental and social sustainability in corporate strategy and planning. Following Dr. Blaschke's departure from the Supervisory Board on December 31, 2023, the Supervisory Board will submit a nomination for the election of a new member of the Supervisory Board to the 2024 Annual General Meeting and will take the aforementioned objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board and the profile of skills and expertise for the entire Supervisory Board into account in that nomination.\n\nThe Supervisory Board and its Audit Committee each have at least one member with expertise in accounting in the person of Dr. Liebler and at least one additional member with expertise in auditing in the person of Dr. Selent. Dr. Selent, the Chairman of the Audit Committee, has expertise, special knowledge and experience in the fields of accounting and auditing, notably by virtue of his professional training as auditor and tax advisor and his many years of service as Chief Financial Officer of Fuchs Petrolub AG.\n\nDr. Liebler has special knowledge and experience in the field of accounting, in particular due to his academic qualifications and his many years as managing director of various international companies.\n\nDr. Selent and Dr. Liebler consequently qualify as financial experts within the meaning of Section 100 (5) AktG and Recommendation D.3 of the Code.\n\nIn addition, during the reporting period, the Supervisory Board had what it considers to be an appropriate number of independent members, as it considers all six members of the Supervisory Board to be independent within the meaning of the Code.\n\nBased on the requirements for members of the Supervisory Board, the following qualification matrix shows the expertise present and the status of implementation of the profile of skills and expertise and of the diversity policy as of December 31, 2023:\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                                             | Dr. Günter Blaschke                  | Ulrich

German Corporate Governance Code 2022*\n\n *Based on a self-assessment by the Supervisory Board (a check mark indicates at least good and in-depth knowledge, exceeding the minimum legal requirements for Supervisory Board members, on the basis of existing qualifications or acquired in the course of service as a Supervisory Board member, such as through many years of service on the Audit Committee or regular participation in professional development measures).*\n\nWhen selecting and nominating candidates for the Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board and the Nomination Committee take into account, in addition to the requirements of the law and the Code, the above-mentioned objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board and strive to fulfill the profile of skills and expertise for the Supervisory Board as a whole. The selection process is also required to consider the diversity aspect at an early stage. The Supervisory Board's decision on election nominations to the Annual General Meeting is always based on the interests of the Company, taking into account all circumstances of the individual case.\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-105-0\"></span>8.5 Shareholders and the Annual General Meeting\n\nWashTec AG regularly provides detailed information on the Company's business development, financial position, financial performance and cash flows and on non-financial subject matter to its shareholders in the form of reporting, in individual discussions and at investor conferences.\n\nThe shareholders exercise their rights at the Annual General Meeting. The Annual General Meeting of WashTec AG is generally held in the second quarter of the year. The Annual General Meeting adopts resolutions regarding, among other things, the appropriation of distributable profit, ratification of the acts of the Management Board and Supervisory Board, and election of the auditor. Amendments to the Articles of Association and the granting of authorization to take measures that have the effect of changing the share capital are decided exclusively by resolution of the Annual General Meeting and implemented by the Management Board. Absent shareholders may have their voting rights exercised by proxies.\n\nWashTec AG held the Annual General Meeting in person in the 2023 reporting year. All documents of relevance to its Annual General Meeting were published online in German and in English. The WashTec AG website thus provides an information platform for both national and international investors, including with regard to the Annual General Meeting.\n\n### 8.6 Targets for the percentage of women on the Boards\n\nThe Supervisory Board is required to set targets for the percentage of women on the Company's Management Board and Supervisory Board, together with dates for their achievement. In the fiscal year 2018, the Supervisory Board set targets for the percentage of women in the Management Board and Supervisory Board, to be achieved by June 30, 2023. On July 26, 2018, the Supervisory Board resolved to set a target of at least 25% as the female quota for the Management Board. This target was not met by the June 30, 2023 target date. The reasons are as follows: Following the departure of Dr. Reden from the Management Board, there were no female members of the Management Board from September 1, 2022 onward. Based on this, in the Company's interests, the Supervisory Board decides on appointments to vacant Management Board positions taking into account the requirements profile and specific qualification requirements. When doing so, the Supervisory Board considers diversity in terms of factors such as age, gender and educational or professional background. In appointing the current members of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board decided on the basis of a careful and structured selection process on the best candidates for each position.\n\nOn July 26, 2018, the Supervisory Board resolved to set a target of 0% as the female quota for the Supervisory Board for the period until June 30, 2023. This decision was intended to create the greatest possible flexibility for constituting the Board on the basis of qualification. There were no women members of the Supervisory Board as of the June 30, 2023 target date.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, the Supervisory Board set new targets for the number of women on the Management Board and Supervisory Board from July 1, 2023 for achievement by June 30, 2028. The Supervisory Board has set the target figure for the number of women on the Management Board at zero (0) and the target figure for the number of women on the Supervisory Board at one (1) person.\n\nThe Supervisory Board's reasoning for setting the target for the Management Board in this way was as follows: The setting of a target of zero for the Management Board is intended to retain the greatest possible flexibility for constituting the Management Board on the basis of qualification. The Supervisory Board decides on appointments to Management Board positions in the interests of the Company based on qualifications, experience and professional and personal suitability. The Supervisory Board pays particular attention to diversity as part of the selection process for new Management Board members. Elements of the diversity policy with regard to the composition of the Management Board include factors such as\n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\nage, educational and professional background and gender. In the interests of maximum flexibility, however, no priority is to be given to gender in future appointments to the Management Board. With the Management Board in its new composition since last year, WashTec AG has a highly motivated and dynamic management team. Accordingly, in the interest of future-oriented and sustainable management of the Company and of confidence in the current composition of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board does not wish to send out the wrong signals by setting a higher target, nor does it wish by setting such a target to commit itself in advance – or give the impression of committing itself in advance – with regard to its appointment decisions for the next five years. The Supervisory Board's decision on appointments to Management Board positions will always continue to be based on the interests of the Company, taking into account all circumstances of the individual case.\n\nIrrespective of the statutory targets for the percentage of women on the Management Board and Management Board and Supervisory Board, the WashTec Group attaches great importance to equal treatment, equal opportunities and diversity in when filling management positions and all other positions in the Company. In particular, the goal of further promoting the percentage of women in leadership positions within the WashTec Group continues to apply for the future.\n\nThe Management Board considers diversity when making appointments to executive positions. In fiscal year 2022, the Management Board of WashTec AG set itself the goal of further promoting the percentage of women in leadership positions within the WashTec Group and decided to set a voluntary female quota for one management level across the entire Group. The target is 18% (equivalent to 32 people); the date for achievement of the target is June 30, 2027. The need to set targets for the percentage of women at levels of management within WashTec AG does not arise, because WashTec AG as the Group parent has no such levels due to the very small number of employees.\n\n### 8.7 Corporate governance practices\n\n### Transparency and communication\n\nProviding comprehensive and timely information to shareholders and stakeholders is a high priority for WashTec. WashTec reports on its business situation and its results of operations through financial reporting, the annual press conference and conference calls. Once annually, WashTec voluntarily publishes a comprehensive sustainability report, which is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website, www.washtec.de. WashTec also publishes press releases and ad-hoc disclosures. All notices and disclosures, the Articles of Association of WashTec AG, all Declarations of Conformity and further documents concerning corporate governance (such as the WashTec Code of Conduct) are available for downloading from the [Investor Relations section of the Company's website, www.washtec.de.](https://ir.washtec.de/en/) \n\nUnder Article 19 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No 596/2014, members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board, as well as persons closely associated with them, are required to disclose any purchase or sale of securities in WashTec AG or of related financial instruments once the purchase and sale transactions reach a total amount of €20,000 within a calendar year. The reportable securities transactions reported to WashTec AG in the reporting period (managers' transactions) have been duly published and are available in the [Investor Relations section of the Company's website, www.washtec.de under News –](https://ir.washtec.de/en/news/)  Managers' Transactions.\n\n### Compliance\n\nWashTec has established a Group-wide compliance organization to ensure that all relevant requirements are observed. The compliance organization is subject to continuous development and improvement. The Management Board and Supervisory Board regard the compliance organization as a major element of WashTec's management and control structure. Detailed reporting on compliance is thus a regular subject of meetings of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee. A detailed compliance report is also prepared each year.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\nStatements Further Information\n\nThe strategic guidelines and the WashTec AG Code of Conduct form the basis of the Company's compliance program. The Code of Conduct was thoroughly revised in the reporting year. It contains binding rules on legally compliant conduct as well as precise directions on matters such as compliance with competition law and anti-corruption law, handling donations, avoiding conflicts of interests, complying with the prohibition on insider trading, and protecting the Company's assets, as well as requirements for the protection of human and environmental rights within the meaning of the German Supply Chain Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz). The Code of Conduct is binding for all employees of the WashTec Group worldwide and for the members of the Management Board. It is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect social and regulatory changes.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board observe the rules to the extent that they apply to them. All WashTec Group managers and employees in sensitive areas such as Sales, Procurement, Human Resources and Finance receive regular online training on the Code of Conduct, with a concluding test and certification. Regular online training, likewise with a concluding test, is also provided on the General Data Protection Regulation, especially for new employees. As part of the compliance system, a whistleblower system in place since 2016 allows employees and others to raise concerns – anonymously if they prefer – and flag circumstances that may indicate a violation of the law or Company policies. This has also been updated in connection with the changes in the law. Any such indications are investigated and action taken as appropriate if grounds for suspicion or violations are identified. [The WashTec Group Grievance and Reporting Procedure is available in the Investor Rela](https://ir.washtec.de/en/corporate-governance/)tions – Corporate Governance section of the Company website, www.washtec.de.\n\nThe insider list to be drawn up under Article 18 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 is updated in accordance with the law. The individuals recorded in the insider list are informed of the duties entailed.\n\n### Opportunities and risk management\n\nResponsible management of opportunities and risks is part of good corporate governance. The Management Board has established an internal control system and risk management system that is appropriate and effective having due regard to the scope of the Company's business activities and its risk situation. The Management Board and the Supervisory Board regularly discuss existing opportunities and risks, their development and action to be taken. The internal control system and the risk management system are subject to continuous de[velopment and adaptation to changing conditions. Details are presented in the opportunities](#page-81-0)  and risk report starting on page 82.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Augsburg, March 22, 2024\n\nSebastian Kutz CSO/Member of the Management Board\n\nAndreas Pabst CFO/Member of the Management Board\n\nImage /page/108/Picture/7 description: A close-up shot captures a car undergoing a wash, with soap and water cascading over its surface.

Statements of WashTec AG (IFRS) for Fiscal Year 2023\n\n### General\n\n### 1. General information on the Group\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the WashTec Group for the fiscal year January 1 to December 31, 2023 were prepared and submitted to the Supervisory Board for review on March 22, 2024. They were approved at the Supervisory Board meeting on March 25, 2024 and subsequently released for publication by the Management Board. The consolidated financial statements and Group Management Report may be accessed via the [Bundesanzeiger \\(Federal Gazette\\) and the Unternehmensregister \\(Company Register\\)](https://ir.washtec.de/en/financial_reports/)  and downloaded from our website at https://ir.washtec.de/en/financial\\_reports/.\n\nThe ultimate parent company of the WashTec Group is WashTec AG, which is entered in the commercial register of the Local Court of the City of Augsburg, Germany, under registration number HRB 81.\n\nThe Company's registered office is located at Argonstrasse 7, 86153 Augsburg, Germany.\n\nThe Company's shares are in free float and are listed on the Open Market in the Prime Standard segment of Frankfurt stock exchange.\n\nThe purpose of the WashTec Group comprises the development, manufacture, sale and servicing of carwash products and washing chemicals, as well as leasing and all related services and financing solutions required in order to operate carwash equipment.\n\n### 2. Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of WashTec AG have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in force as of the balance sheet date together with the interpretations of the IFRS IC (IFRIC). They comply with the accounting standards applicable in the European Union for fiscal year 2023 and are also supplemented by additional information required under section 315e of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch, or HGB) and by the Group Management Report.\n\nThe requirements under section 315e HGB are met, exempting the Company from the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with German commercial law.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis except with respect to non-current trade receivables, share-based payment and derivative financial instruments, which are measured at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros. Unless otherwise indicated, all figures are rounded to the nearest thousand (€k); this may result in rounding differences. The fiscal year is the calendar year.\n\nThe WashTec Group's business development in fiscal year 2023 was influenced by the macroeconomic environment. Persistently high interest rates resulted in higher interest expenses on drawn credit lines. The WashTec Group therefore used derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk in the reporting year. In addition, the higher level of interest rates compared to the prior year was taken into account accordingly when determining the discount rates for non-current balance sheet items and the measurement parameters used in goodwill impairment testing. Impairment testing did not reveal any need for adjustment in the reporting period.\n\nClimate-related issues affect the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the WashTec Group as follows:\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\n- <span id=\"page-117-0\"></span>W Measures by the Company to reduce carbon emissions in Germany focus on capital expenditure on electric charging infrastructure, energy efficiency improvements in heating systems and the purchase of green electricity for production sites. In addition, the Company has adopted the target of making fleet operations in Germany 100% carbon-neutral by 2030.\n- W The property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of relevance for replacement investment are fully depreciated or amortized as of fiscal year 2023. Consequently, there is currently no indication of any impact on useful lives or residual values.\n- W With regard to the recoverability of inventories, order-based production and procurement make it possible to minimize any impairment risks going beyond those arising in the normal course of business.\n- W It is not currently necessary to recognize provisions for environmental or asset retirement obligations or to recognize contingent liabilities or contingent assets due to climate-related obligations.\n- W All climate-related factors that could affect value in use have been assessed in goodwill impairment testing. The impairment testing included possible impacts on the WashTec Group's business model and sales markets, changes in the regulatory environment and changes in the intended use of assets due to climate-induced obligations. This did not reveal any need for adjustment in the reporting period.\n- W Overall, no significant impacts on the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the WashTec Group were identified on the basis of estimates, assumptions or judgments.\n\n### 3. Basis of consolidation and consolidated group\n\n### Basis of consolidation\n\n The The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of WashTec AG and its subsidiaries as of December 31 of each fiscal year. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as those of the parent company, using uniform accounting policies.\n\n Subsidiaries are fully consolidated as of the acquisition date, which is the date when the Group obtains control. WashTec AG controls an investee from the point in time when WashTec AG is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Subsidiaries cease to be consolidated when the parent company no longer has control.\n\n All intragroup balances, transactions, income, expenses as well as unrealized gains and losses resulting from intragroup transactions are eliminated in full.\n\n### Consolidated group\n\nIn addition to the parent company, the consolidated financial statements of WashTec AG also contain the following group entities as of December 31, 2023 (shareholdings in accordance with 315e in conjunction with section 313 (2) HGB). Figures for companies in Germany are based on annual financial statements prepared in accordance with German commercial law; for foreign companies they are generally based on IFRS financial statements before consolidation.\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Consolidated entities as of December 31, 2023                            | Shareholding in % | Parent | Business

Limited was established on June 23, 2023 as a subsidiary of WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH, with 100% of the voting rights, in order to commence direct sales and service activities in New Zealand. The New Zealand subsidiary was consequently consolidated for the first time in fiscal year 2023.\n\nWashTec New Zealand Limited took over the assets and liabilities of the previously independent New Zealand sales partner, Car Kleen New Zealand Ltd. as of December 1, 2023. This investment in the New Zealand market is intended to reinforce the WashTec Group's presence in the Asia/Pacific region and strengthen cooperation with local customers.\n\nThe purchase price for the acquisition was €1,624k. Of this amount, €797k was paid by the December 31, 2023 reporting date. Payment of the balance is subject to the satisfaction of certain contractual conditions and is expected to be made in the first half of 2024. Incidental acquisition costs were not material and were accounted for in other expenses in the income statement.\n\nThe acquired net assets were measured at a fair value of €649k, resulting in goodwill of €974k. The goodwill mainly relates to the expected synergies based on Car Kleen New Zealand Ltd.'s proven track record in vehicle wash technology and the team's many years of experience.\n\nThe following table shows the assets and liabilities recognized at the acquisition date:\n\n| in €k                                              | Fair value |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Non-current assets (including right-of-use assets) | 642        |\n| Receivables and other assets                       | 340        |\n| Inventories                                        | 607        |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                          | 28         |\n| Assets acquired                                    | 1,617      |\n| Liabilities and provisions                         | 647        |\n| Contract liabilities                               | 322        |\n| Liabilities assumed                                | 969        |\n| Net assets                                         | 649        |\n| Goodwill                                           | 974        |\n| Consideration                                      | 1,624      |\n\nThe fair value of the acquired trade receivables was €335k at the acquisition date. This corresponds to the gross amount of the trade receivables. No impairment was recognized at the acquisition date.\n\nConsolidated net income as of December 31, 2023 includes revenue of €310k and net income of €44k.\n\nHad the acquisition been made as of January 1, 2023, revenue of €3,969k and net income of €379k would have contributed to the consolidated net income of the WashTec Group in fiscal year 2023.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs of December 14, 2023, WashTec sold 90% of the shares in its Chinese subsidiary, WashTec Car Cleaning Equipment (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., to the existing management. The sale was registered by the competent authorities in China effective December 19, 2023. It took place as part of a strategic realignment by the WashTec Group in the Chinese market, which will now continue to be developed as a distributor market. This will ensure the best possible market position for the future while maintaining and further intensifying longstanding customer relationships. WashTec will retain a 10% stake in the company.\n\n€–504k was recognized as expense in the consolidated income statement in connection with the deconsolidation of the Chinese subsidiary. The sale of the subsidiary resulted in a disposal of assets in the amount of €2,764k, mainly comprising inventories and trade receivables. It also resulted in the disposal of €2,107k in liabilities, mainly to suppliers and employees.\n\nUp to the deconsolidation date, revenue of €6,446k and operating profit (EBIT) of €–738k were recognized in the consolidated income statement of the WashTec Group in 2023.\n\n### 4. Effects of new financial reporting standards\n\nNew or amended financial reporting standards entered into force in the reporting period.

Initial application of the standards is planned when they are recognized and endorsed by the European Union.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-121-0\"></span>\n\n| Standards | and | amendments not yet applied |\n|-----------|-----|----------------------------|\n|-----------|-----|----------------------------|\n\n| Standard/<br>inter-<br>pretation | Title                                                                            | Mandatory<br>application | EU<br>endorse-<br>ment  | Material effects on the<br>Group |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| IAS 1                            | Amendments to IAS 1 – Classification of<br>Liabilities as Current or Non-Current | January 1,<br>2024       | December<br>20, 2023    | None                             |\n| IAS 1                            | Amendments to IAS 1 – Non-current Liabilities<br>with Covenants                  | January 1,<br>2024       | December<br>20, 2023    | None                             |\n| IFRS 16                          | Amendments to IFRS 16 – Lease Liability in a<br>Sale and Leaseback               | January 1,<br>2024       | November<br>21, 2023    | None                             |\n| IAS 7                            | Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 – Supplier<br>Finance Agreements                  | January 1,<br>2024       | Yet to be<br>determined | None                             |\n| IAS 21                           | Amendments to IAS 21 – Lack of Exchangeab-<br>ility                              | January 1,<br>2025       | Yet to be<br>determined | None                             |\n\n### 5. Accounting policies\n\nThe adopted accounting policies are (unless otherwise specified below) consistent with those applied in prior years. For the accounting policies applied in the prior year, please see the prior-year Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n### Currency translation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in euros, the euro being the Group's functional and reporting currency.\n\nForeign currency annual financial statements of subsidiaries are translated by applying the functional currency approach. The functional currency of a foreign company is normally its national currency. The items in the separate financial statements of each entity are measured in the entity's functional currency.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the reporting date exchange rate. All exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss with the exception of exchange differences relating to net investments in a foreign operation and adjustment items for currency translation. These are recognized in other comprehensive income until disposal of the net investment, when they are recognized as income or expense in the period. Deferred taxes arising from such exchange differences are likewise recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nNon-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the transaction date. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured. Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of resulting assets and liabilities are accounted for as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the reporting date exchange rate.\n\nAssets and liabilities of subsidiaries that do not report in euros are translated at the reporting date exchange rate, and their income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the fiscal year. Resulting exchange differences are accounted for separately in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount recognized in other comprehensive income relating to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item when the cost is incurred, if the recognition criteria are met. In addition to directly attributable costs, the cost of self-constructed assets also includes an allocation of material and production overheads and depreciation. Repair and maintenance costs are immediately recognized in profit or loss. Depreciation is applied pro rata temporis on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is mostly depreciated using the following useful lives:\n\n| Property, plant and equipment      | Useful life    |\n|------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Buildings                          | 20 to 50 years |\n| Technical plant and machinery      | 5 to 14 years  |\n| Other plant, fixtures and fittings | 3 to 8 years   |\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising from derecognition (measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in profit or loss when the item is derecognized. At the end of each fiscal year, an asset's residual value, useful life and method of depreciation are reviewed and, if necessary, adjusted.\n\n### Business combinations and goodwill\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. For this purpose, the cost of the acquisition is determined as the fair value of the consideration transferred, meaning the sum of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are normally accounted for as expense.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost. It is measured as the excess of the cost of the business combination over the acquirer's share in the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. It is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, from the acquisition date, to the Group's cash generating units (segments) that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination.\n\n### Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets mainly comprise acquired patents, technologies, capitalized development costs, licenses and software.\n\n| Intangible assets                 | Useful life  |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------|\n| Acquired patents and technologies | 8 years      |\n| Licenses and software             | 3 to 8 years |\n| Capitalized development costs     | 6 to 8 years |\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\nIntangible assets not acquired in a business combination are measured at cost on initial recognition and subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated amortization and impairment losses.\n\nA distinction is made between intangible assets with finite useful lives and those with indefinite useful lives. In the reporting period, the Group exclusively held assets with finite useful lives.\n\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their economic useful life. The amortization period and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each fiscal year and adjusted accordingly if expectations have changed. There were no changes in fiscal year 2023.\n\nInternally generated intangible assets (research and development costs)\n\nResearch costs are recognized as expense in the period in which they are incurred. Development costs for a given project comprise all directly attributable costs (mainly personnel expenses) as well as allocated overheads. They are capitalized as an intangible asset only if the asset can be identified, a future economic benefit is expected and the cost can be measured reliably during development. In addition, development costs are only capitalized if completion of development and subsequent use or sale are technically and financially feasible and intended.\n\nAfter initial recognition of development costs as an asset, the cost model is applied, meaning that the asset is carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization begins when development is complete and the\n\nasset is available for use. The asset is amortized over the period of the expected future economic benefits. During the development phase, when the useful life is indefinite, the asset is tested annually for impairment.\n\n### Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAssets with a finite useful life are tested as of each balance sheet date for indications of impairment. If there is such an indication, the Group estimates the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is fair value less costs of disposal or value in use, whichever is higher. Value in use is determined by applying an appropriate valuation model. For this purpose, the expected future cash flows are discounted to present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects market expectations concerning the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Recoverable amount is estimated for each individual asset or, if it cannot be estimated for an asset, for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount. An impairment loss recognized in earlier reporting periods is reversed to income if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The increased carrying amount may not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized in the past. Impairment reversals are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nIntangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are tested for impairment annually and if there are events or circumstances that indicate that an asset may be impaired.\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\nGoodwill is tested for any impairment by estimating the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated. The Group's cash generating units correspond to the operating segments identified in accordance with IFRS 8. These are divided into the regions Europe, North America and Asia/Pacific.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. Impairment losses recognized for goodwill cannot be reversed in subsequent reporting periods. The Group performs annual impairment testing of goodwill after completing the budgeting process.\n\n### Financial instruments\n\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Initial recognition takes place when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.\n\nAll regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are accounted for at the trade date, which is the date when the Group commits itself to purchase or sell the asset. Regular way purchases or sales require delivery of the asset within the timeframe established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.\n\n### Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets primarily comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, derivatives with a positive market value and other financial assets.\n\nFinancial assets are classified as at amortized cost (AC), at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVthOCI) or at fair value through profit or loss (FVthP/L). They are categorized on initial recognition on the basis of the company's business model for managing financial assets and of the contractual cash flow characteristics of each financial asset, and are measured at fair value. Financial assets not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset.\n\n### Financial assets at amortized cost (AC):\n\nThis category comprises financial assets held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows where the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. After initial recognition, the financial assets are measured at amortized cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Receivables with a significant financing component are discounted at current market interest rates if the effect is material. Such receivables are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less any accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on derecognition or impairment of the financial assets are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and bank balances that have a term of less than three months from the date of acquisition and are carried at face value. For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash funds consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above plus any utilized bank overdrafts.\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVthOCI): This category comprises financial assets held within a business model whose objective is both to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets where the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nAfter initial recognition, these are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVthP/L):\n\nFinancial assets not measured at amortized cost (AC) or at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVthOCI), and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments for which hedge accounting is applied, are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVthP/L). In addition, financial assets can be voluntarily designated in certain circumstances as at fair value through profit or loss (FVthP/L). The Group does not currently make use of this option. All changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss.\n\n### Impairment of financial assets:\n\nThe Group tests financial assets, and groups of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, for impairment as of each balance sheet date.\n\nA risk allowance is normally recognized on the basis of the general approach using a three-stage model in relation to changes in the default risk on a financial asset. On initial recognition, all financial assets are normally classified in stage 1 and their 12-month expected credit loss determined. If the credit risk on a financial asset has significantly increased since the previous reporting date, the asset is transferred to stage 2. WashTec assumes a significant increase in credit risk if the financial asset is more than 30 days past due. Where there is additionally objective evidence of impairment, a financial asset is transferred to stage 3. Objective evidence of impairment includes the initiation of legal action and receivables past due by more than one year. In stage 2 and 3, the risk allowance is recognized in the amount of the lifetime expected credit losses.\n\nImpairment losses on trade receivables without a significant financing component are accounted for using the simplified approach. In addition, an entity can likewise elect to apply the simplified approach to trade receivables with a significant financing component. For this purpose, the risk allowance is recognized in the amount of the lifetime expected credit losses. The Group makes use of this election for trade receivables with a significant financing component and calculates the impairment losses on the basis of an impairment table.\n\nTrade receivables have similar credit risk characteristics. For the measurement of lifetime expected credit losses, trade receivables are grouped based on days past due. The impairment rates are based on credit loss rates over the past three years and are adjusted for forward-looking macroeconomic factors affecting customer solvency.\n\nThe risk allowance for other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents is recognized using the general approach. Expected credit losses on other financial assets and on cash and cash equivalents are immaterial and are not recognized.\n\n### Derecognition of financial assets:\n\nA financial asset (or a part of a financial asset or a part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognized when contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or the financial asset is transferred and the transfer meets the criteria for derecognition under IFRS 9. In the event of objective evidence that a receivable is impaired, an impairment loss is recognized. If a receivable is classified as uncollectible, it is derecognized.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Financial liabilities\n\nThe financial liabilities mainly comprise liabilities to credit institutions, trade payables, derivatives with a negative market value and other financial liabilities. Financial liabilities are classified as non-current if their remaining term is more than twelve months; they are classified as current if their remaining term is less than twelve months.\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as at amortized cost (FLAC) or at fair value through profit or loss (FVthP/L).\n\nFinancial liabilities are normally initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost (FLAC) using the effective interest method. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, derivatives with a negative market value and financial liabilities designated on initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVthP/L). Financial liabilities not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss are initially measured at fair value less transaction costs.\n\n### Derecognition of financial liabilities:\n\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, canceled or expires.\n\n### Derivative financial instruments and hedging\n\nThe WashTec Group used derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk in the reporting year. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized and subsequently measured at fair value and, according to their market value, are accounted for as other financial assets or other financial liabilities. Changes in fair value are accounted for according to whether a derivative financial instrument is designated in an effective hedge. Derivatives without hedge accounting are recognized through profit or loss (FVthP/L).\n\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument is accounted for in full in other non-current financial assets or other non-current financial liabilities if the remaining term of the derivative is more than twelve months. It is accounted for in full in other current financial assets or other current financial liabilities if the remaining term of the derivative is less than twelve months.\n\nAt the inception of a hedging relationship, both the hedging relationship and the Group's risk management objectives and strategies with regard to the hedge are formally designated and documented. The documentation includes the identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the hedged risk and how the entity assesses whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including an analysis of the reasons for any hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined).\n\nA hedging relationship meets all hedge effectiveness requirements if there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship and the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Cash flow hedges\n\nA cash flow hedge is the hedge of exposure to variability to cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with all, or a component of, a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction and could affect profit or loss.\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges is recognized in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in profit or loss. The amounts recognized in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the period during which the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when hedged financial income or expense is recognized or a forecast sale occurs.\n\nIf a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or if the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred amounts at that time remain in equity for as long as the hedged item continues to exist. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative amounts recognized in equity are reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n### Net investments in foreign operations\n\nA monetary item in the form of an outstanding receivable from a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely is a part of the net investment in that foreign operation. Such monetary items are non-current receivables from foreign subsidiaries of the Group. Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognized in profit or loss in the separate financial statements of the subsidiary. In the consolidated financial statements, such exchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the subsidiary.\n\n### Inventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated proceeds from a sale in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\nThe cost of raw materials, consumables and supplies is determined on a rolling average basis. The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes directly attributable costs as well as a reasonable allocation of material and production overheads on the basis of normal capacity utilization. Borrowing costs are not included in the cost of inventories.\n\n### Treasury shares\n\nThe cost of any treasury shares purchased by WashTec AG is accounted for as a single adjustment in equity. Purchases, sales and retirements of treasury shares are not recognized in profit or loss.\n\n### Provisions\n\n### Other provisions\n\nOther provisions are recognized for all legal or constructive obligations to third parties as of the balance sheet date whose timing or amount is uncertain. They are measured at the present value of the best estimate of the expenditures required to settle the obligations. If the Group expects reimbursement of some or all of a provision (such as through an insurance policy), the reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset if it is virtually certain. Non-current provisions are discounted at current pre-tax market rates if the effect is material. The effect of the time value of money is accounted for in the financial result. Provisions are normally reversed to the same item in the income statement for which they were recognized.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\nProvisions for pensions are measured using the projected unit credit method (IAS 19 revised). This takes into account the pensions known and vested as of the balance sheet date as well as expected future increases in salaries and pensions. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in their entirety in other comprehensive income net [of deferred taxes. Service cost and interest are accounted for in](#page-151-0) the operating result. For further details, please see Note 26.\n\n### Provisions for partial retirement arrangements\n\nPartial retirement arrangements are primarily based on the block model. They result in two types of obligations that are measured at present value in accordance with actuarial principles and are accounted for separately: The first type of obligation relates to the accumulated outstanding settlement amount, which is recognized pro rata over the active/working phase. The accumulated outstanding settlement amount is based on the difference between the compensation earned by an employee prior to the partial retirement arrangement (including the employer's share of social security contributions) and the compensation for the part-time employment (including the employer's share of social security contributions, but not including top-up payments). The second type of obligation relates to the employer's obligation to pay the top-up payments plus an additional amount towards statutory pension insurance. In accordance with IAS 19 (revised), this is recognized as a provision pro rata over the working phase.\n\n### Share-based payment\n\nIFRS 2 distinguishes between equity-settled share-based payments and cash-settled share-based payments. For their service, the Management Board and Supervisory Board of WashTec AG receive cash-settled share-based remuneration comprising both components.\n\nIn the case of cash-settled share-based remuneration, the resulting liability is recognized at fair value through profit or loss over the period of time in which the service is performed. Fair value is estimated using a suitable option price model. Conditions relating to the WashTec AG share price (market conditions) are included in measurement. Performance-related exercise conditions are also included. The equity-settled sharebased payment component is recognized directly in equity. Obligations from cash-settled share-based payment are recognized in other liabilities at fair value taking into account the remaining duration of the progr[am. Please see Note 37 for further details.](#page-165-0) \n\n### Leases\n\nA lease is a contract that conveys the right to control the use of an asset (the underlying asset) for a certain period of time in exchange for consideration. For all leases, the Group normally recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for the lease payments. Leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at present value from the time the underlying asset is made available to the Group.\n\nLease liabilities comprise fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate and are initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date, amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase option if it is reasonably certain to be exercised and payments of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.\n\nLease payments are discounted at the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. The lessee's incremental borrowing rate is determined over various maturities on the basis of a riskfree interest rate plus a margin and a country-specific risk premium. Each lease payment is separated into principal and interest components. The interest expense is recognized in profit or loss in each period over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease liability.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee and the estimated cost relating to dismantling obligations.\n\nMost leases are entered into for fixed terms of one to three years. Some leases of office and warehouse buildings are for longer terms. Leases may also include implicit extensions or extension and termination options. The Group makes use of such arrangements to obtain maximum operational flexibility. Either party can exercise the existing extension and termination options. The notice periods agreed for the termination options are sufficient for alternatives to be found in good time where necessary.\n\nWhen determining the lease term for buildings, Management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise any options to extend or not to exercise any option to terminate. The main factors considered are the terms, satisfaction with the working relationship with the lessor and logistical considerations in connection with the Group's forward strategy. If the Group is satisfied with the working relationship and these factors are also expected to be compatible with the corporate strategy looking ahead, it is considered reasonably certain that the leases will be extended/not terminated. Changes in the lease term due to the exercise of options to extend or options to terminate are only included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain that the option to extend will be exercised or the option to terminate will not be exercised.\n\nThis is reassessed upon the occurrence of any significant event or any significant change in circumstances that affects the previous assessment and is in the control of the lessee. Lease terms are negotiated individually and include a large variety of different conditions.\n\nIn the subsequent measurement of lease liabilities, the carrying amount is increased by the interest expense for the lease liability and reduced by the lease payments made. For potential future increases in variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, the lease liability and the right-of-use asset are remeasured when the adjustment to the lease payments takes effect.\n\nRight-of-use assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost. They are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of useful life and lease term. If a purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised, they are depreciated over the useful life of the asset underlying the lease.\n\nIn the case of leases that include an extension or termination option, the lease liability is remeasured and the right-of-use asset adjusted if a significant event or significant change in circumstances occurs that is within the Group's control and was assessed differently on initial measurement.\n\nThe Group makes use of the exemptions for short-term leases and for leases of lowvalue assets that are not short-term leases and recognizes their lease payments on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. In addition, the provisions of IFRS 16 are not applied to leases of intangible assets.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn order to provide customers, and in particular large operator groups or oil companies, with equipment as part of the carwash management business in return for compensation based on the number of washes, equipment manufactured by WashTec is sold to a leasing company and repurchased under sale and leaseback transactions or hire purchase agreements. For these transactions, a right-of-use asset and a lease liability are recognized for the equipment concerned. No revenue is recognized from the sale of the equipment. Under the contracts with the customers, revenue is realized on the basis of the number of washes and the right-of-use asset is depreciated.\n\n≡\n\n[Please refer to Notes 10,](#page-138-0) [15 a](#page-142-0)n[d 29 f](#page-154-0)or information on right-of-use assets, lease liabilities, depreciation and interest expense.\n\n### Contract liabilities\n\nPerformance obligations that are satisfied over time are recognized as contract liabilities in the balance sheet (see also Revenue Recognition). The items presented as contract liabilities in the Group are prepayments on orders and deferred income, which mostly relate to full maintenance, extended guarantees and prepaid service agreements.\n\n### Income taxes\n\nThe current income tax charge is calculated for the consolidated financial statements on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where subsidiaries operate and generate taxable net income. For recognized tax provisions, the expected tax payment is used as a best estimate. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to\n\napply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Current and deferred taxes are recognized in profit or loss unless tax relates to transactions that are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences at consolidated entities between IFRS-basis carrying amounts of assets or liabilities and their tax base and for consolidation adjustments in profit or loss.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax loss carryforwards and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are not recognized for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred taxes are also not recognized for temporary differences if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which at the time of the transaction affects neither IFRS-basis accounting profit (before income taxes) nor taxable profit and which is not a business combination. Deferred taxes are recognized for transactions in which equal deductible and taxable temporary differences arise.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries unless the entity holding the investment is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future (\"outside basis differences\").\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if, and only if, there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority.\n\n### Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue is recognized when a performance obligation has been satisfied by transfer of a promised good or promised service (i.e., an asset) to a customer. An asset is transferred when the customer obtains control of the asset.\n\nPerformance obligations from the sale of equipment, accessories, merchandise and services are satisfied at a point in time when the promised asset has been transferred and/or the customer has obtained control of the asset. This is normally the case when finished goods or merchandise are delivered, sent or collected and when equipment is installed. The payment period usually granted is 30 days.\n\nFor financing components, the Group makes use of the practical expedient of not taking into account the effects of a financing component if the period between when the goods or services are transferred and when the customer pays for them is one year or less or if the financing component is not material in both absolute and relative terms.\n\nPerformance obligations mainly arising from full maintenance agreements, extended guarantees and prepaid service agreements are satisfied over time and accounted for as contract liabilities. The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by performance as it is performed. The WashTec Group determines progress towards completion using an output method based on elapsed time. Satisfaction of performance obligations is dependent on contract terms and is usually on a monthly basis. This provides a faithful depiction of the output. The revenue is recognized and billed when the performance obligation is satisfied. Contract liabilities are reversed to profit or loss accordingly. The payment period usually granted is 30 days, although some service agreements are prepaid.\n\nRevenue from the carwash management business is not recognized until a carwash is completed. This also applies if a carwash is first sold to an independent leasing company.\n\nWashTec also sells equipment to leasing companies that lease it on to customers. This revenue is recognized at the time of the sale. In rare cases, these transactions include contracts containing repurchase agreements and WashTec must repurchase the equipment at the customer's request. Revenue from the sale of the equipment is recognized in such cases in the amount of the service performed, meaning that revenue is reduced by the amount of the right of return. Additionally, a corresponding adjustment is made to the cost of the service performed, which is accounted for in other current financial assets in the amount of the net investment in the lease.\n\nThe amount recognized as revenue corresponds to the transaction price and comprises the consideration that the WashTec Group is expected to receive in exchange for the transfer of the promised goods or services to a customer. It does not include value added tax or sales tax. Deductions such as rebates, discounts and bulk discounts are accounted for as variable consideration in determination of the transaction price if it is highly probable that the revenue will not be reversed. They are estimated on the basis of expected value. Bulk discounts are accounted for as other financial liabilities.\n\nThe transaction price is allocated to the individual performance obligations on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price. Any discount is normally allocated proportionately to all performance obligations in a contract unless there is evidence that all or part of the discount relates to one or more, but not all, performance obligations in the contract. As there are no directly observable prices at which the WashTec Group would sell a promised good or promised service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers, the stand-alone selling price is estimated at contract inception using the expected cost plus a margin approach.\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe WashTec Group makes use of the practical expedient of recognizing those costs of obtaining a contract and costs to fulfill a contract when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that would otherwise have been recognized is one year or less. This applies at WashTec to all such costs.\n\nInterest income is recognized on an accrual basis in profit or loss using the effective interest method.\n\n### Cost of sales\n\nCost of sales comprises the cost of producing or providing sold products and services. In addition to directly attributable material, labor and energy costs, this also includes production and service overheads. Overheads include depreciation of property, plant and equipment and inventory write-downs.\n\n### Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share is calculated by dividing consolidated net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.\n\nFor the calculation of diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding is adjusted to account for all potentially dilutive shares.\n\n### Segment reporting\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 8, operating segments are identified using the management approach. Under that approach, external segment reporting is based on the internal group organizational and management structure and on internal reporting to the Management Board as the entity's chief operating decision maker. Where the aggregation criteria are met, operating segments are aggregated into reportable segments.\n\nA geographical segment is a distinguishable component of an entity that is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment and is subject to risks and generates returns that differ from those of components operating in other economic environments.\n\n### 6. Significant estimates, assumptions and judgments\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, it is necessary to make certain assumptions, estimates and judgments that may affect the presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations. These primarily relate to the determination of economic useful lives, the measurement of provisions, the realizability of deferred tax assets and assumptions about future cash flows and discount rates. All judgments are continually reassessed and are based in each case on historical experience and current knowledge with regard to future events. Actual amounts may differ from the assumptions and estimates in individual cases. Changes are taken into account when better knowledge becomes available and can lead in future periods to material adjustments to the carrying amounts of affected assets or liabilities.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nIn connection with impairment testing of goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and other non-financial assets, it is necessary to estimate future cash flows from each asset or cash generating unit in order to determine value in use. An appropriate discount rate must also be selected in order to determine the present value of the cash flows. Estimating future cash flows requires long-term income forecasts to be made in light of general economic conditions and the development of the industry. For further [details, please see Note 5.](#page-121-0)\n\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets require estimates and assumptions to be made in order to determine uniform Group-wide economic useful lives and methods of depreciation and amortization.\n\n### Impairment of financial assets\n\nIn application of the simplified approach for trade receivables without a significant financing component and for trade receivables with a significant financing component, lifetime expected credit losses are determined. For this purpose, trade receivables are grouped based on days past due. The impairment rates are based on credit loss rates over the past three years and are adjusted for forward-looking macroeconomic factors affecting customer solvency.\n\n### Deferred tax assets\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized. Management estimates relate to the amount of taxable net income and the expected timing. For further details, please [see Note 16.](#page-143-0)\n\n### Pensions, other post-employment benefits and partial retirement benefits\n\nThe costs of pension and partial retirement obligations are determined using actuarial methods. Actuarial valuation involves assumptions about discount rates, future wage and salary increases, pension increases and life expectancy. Due to the long-term nature of the pension plans, such estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty. Further details are provided in [Notes 26](#page-151-0) [and 27.](#page-153-0)\n\n### Share-based payment\n\nCash-settled share-based payment is recognized at fair value at each balance sheet date. In order to estimate the fair value of shared-based payment, it is necessary to determine the most suitable valuation technique, which is dependent on the granting conditions. It is also necessary to determine suitable input parameters for the valuation technique, notably volatility of the share price and the risk-free r[ate of interest for the remaining term.](#page-165-0)  The assumptions and techniques used are shown in Note 37.\n\n### Provisions\n\nProvisions for termination benefits and guarantee provisions are recognized on the basis of expectations, estimates of the probability of occurrence, and planned measures. The size of potential payment obligations is estimated on the basis of an assessment of the situation.\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Development costs\n\nDevelopment costs are capitalized in accordance with the accounting policies described [in Note 5. T](#page-121-0)heir initial recognition is based on management's assessment that technical and financial feasibility is demonstrated. This is usually the case when a product development project has reached a specific milestone in an established project management model.\n\n### Income from repurchase agreements\n\nWashTec also sells equipment to leasing companies that lease it on to customers. In rare cases, these transactions include contracts containing repurchase agreements. Under such an agreement, WashTec undertakes to repurchase the equipment at the end of the contract term at the customer's request. The provision for contracts with repurchase agreements comprises the expected expenses from contractual obligations to repurchase the equipment sold and is measured on a rolling basis. Measurement of the provision involves estimation of the probability that the equipment will have to be repurchased at the end of the contract term. The right of return is accounted for in other current financial assets and in the amount of the net investment in the lease. This is based on an estimation of the probability that the equipment will have to be repurchased at the end of the contract term and is measured on a rolling basis.\n\n### Notes to the Consolidated Income Statement\n\n### 7. Segment reporting\n\nSegmentation within the Group using the management approach is by sales territories. Reflecting market conditions, the sales territories are defined as the regions Europe, North America and Asia/Pacific and correspond to the respective domiciles of the Group companies. The individual segments are controlled on the basis of revenue and EBIT. Segment results consist of income and expenses directly attributable to each reporting segment and to Group charges for Group-wide functions. The Consolidation column contains consolidation adjustments to eliminate transactions in profit or loss between operating segments. This mainly relates to the elimination of intercompany income from sales of goods. The sum of the reportable segments corresponds, after consolidation adjustments, to consolidated net income. Transfer prices between individual Group entities are established on an arm's length basis. They take into account market-specific and economic conditions in the individual segments. The measurement principles for segment reporting are based on the IFRS principles used in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group's segments are business units that generate their revenue primarily through the sale of machines, spare parts, service and chemical products.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\n| By segment 2023                                                                                   | Europe  | North<br>America | Asia/Pacific | Consolidation | Group   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|------------------|--------------|---------------|---------|\n| in €k                                                                                             |         |                  |              |               |         |\n| Revenue                                                                                           | 378,852 | 102,885          | 19,174       | -11,442       | 489,468 |\n| of which with third parties                                                                       | 367,617 | 102,667          | 19,174       | 0             | 489,468 |\n| of which with other segments                                                                      | 11,235  | 208              | 0            | -11,442       | 0       |\n| Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)                                                         | 36,220  | 5,709            | 645          | -687          | 41,886  |\n| EBIT margin (in %)                                                                                | 9.6     | 5.5              | 3.4          | –             | 8.6     |\n| Financial income                                                                                  |         |                  |              |               | 213     |\n| Financial expenses                                                                                |         |                  |              |               | -3,688  |\n| Earnings before taxes (EBT)                                                                       |         |                  |              |               | 38,411  |\n| Income taxes                                                                                      |         |                  |              |               | -10,439 |\n| Net income                                                                                        |         |                  |              |               | 27,972  |\n| Capital expenditure on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets   | 13,617  | 10,913           | 2,440        | 0             | 26,970  |\n| Amortization, depreciation and impairment of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and |         |                  |              |               |         |\n| right-of-use assets                                                                               | 12,584  | 1,413            | 694          | 0             | 14,692  |\n\n| By segment 2022                                                                                   | Europe  | North America | Asia/Pacific | Consolidation | Group   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------------|--------------|---------------|---------|\n| in €k                                                                                             |         |               |              |               |         |\n| Revenue                                                                                           | 371,625 | 107,662       | 17,624       | -14,672       | 482,239 |\n| of which with third parties                                                                       | 357,423 | 107,191       | 17,624       | 0             | 482,239 |\n| of which with other segments                                                                      | 14,201  | 471           | 0            | -14,672       | 0       |\n| Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)                                                         | 36,415  | 1,448         | 422          | -276          | 38,009  |\n| EBIT margin (in %)                                                                                | 9.8     | 1.3           | 2.4          | -

Germany and France make up the largest share of total revenue. After consolidation, Germany accounts for 25.1% (prior year: 26.6%) of consolidated revenue, relating to the products Equipment and Service, Chemicals and Others. France accounts for 12.9% (prior year: 13.8%) of consolidated revenue. External sales outside of Europe are primarily generated in North America and are mostly attributable to the United States. As in the prior year, transactions with one major customer in the Europe and North America segments marginally exceeded 10% of total revenue.\n\nThe allocation of Group assets to segments is based on the geographical location of the assets. Sales to external customers shown for each geographical segment are assigned to the segments based on customers' geographical location. The Group has no assets in other countries because it does not have its own sales organizations in other countries. Revenue with other countries is generated through exports to independent dealers.\n\nAnalysis of Group assets by geographical location:\n\n| 2023 in €k                                              | Germany | Europe | North<br>America | Asia/<br>Pacific | Group  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|------------------|------------------|--------|\n| Property, plant and equipment                           | 20,015  | 3,822  | 9,392            | 496              | 33,725 |\n| Capital expenditure on property, plant<br>and equipment | 2,076   | 828    | 9,467            | 488              | 12,859 |\n| Intangible assets including goodwill                    | 45,325  | 4,087  | 0                | 1,324            | 50,736 |\n| Capital expenditure on intangible assets                | 1,868   | 37     | 0                | 1,313            | 3,218  |\n| Right-of-use assets                                     | 7,042   | 8,351  | 2,259            | 761              | 18,413 |\n| Capital expenditure on right-of-use assets              | 5,328   | 3,480  | 1,446            | 638              | 10,892 |\n| 2022 in €k                                              | Germany | Europe | North<br>America | Asia/<br>Pacific | Group  |\n| Property, plant and equipment                           | 20,343  | 4,213  | 306              | 407              | 25,268 |\n| Capital expenditure on property, plant<br>and equipment | 2,085   | 2,314  | 126              | 215              | 4,741  |\n| Intangible assets including goodwill                    | 45,264  | 4,066  | 0                | 14               | 49,344 |\n| Capital expenditure on intangible assets                | 2,787   | 0      | 0                | 0                | 2,787  |\n| Right-of-use assets                                     | 5,521   | 8,975  | 1,991            | 850              | 17,337 |\n| Capital expenditure on right-of-use assets              | 2,666   | 3,399  | 895              | 221              | 7,180  |\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 8.

Research and development costs in the amount of €1,688k (prior year: €2,389k) were not capitalized as the criteria for capitalization under IAS 38 were not met.\n\nThere were no material contractual obligations such as obligations to purchase property, plant and equipment or intangible assets as of the reporting date.\n\n### Goodwill\n\nThe total goodwill with a carrying amount of €43,289k (prior year: €42,312k) is allocated as follows to the operating segments identified in accordance with IFRS 8: Europe in the amount of €42,305k (prior year: €42,305k) and Asia/Pacific in the amount of €984k (prior year: €7k). The increase in goodwill is due to the acquisition of the New [Zealand sales partner, Car Kleen New Zealand Ltd.; for details, please refer to Note 3.](#page-117-0)\n\nThe goodwill allocated to the operating segments is routinely tested for impairment by determining value in use.\n\nIn accordance with the approach described in Note 5, Accounting policies, goodwill is tested for impairment on the basis of the Group-level planning for 2024 through 2029.\n\nPlanning is primarily based on the following assumptions based on the longstanding experience of management and the medium-term strategies for the individual markets. Further information was available to management in the form of external market studies. The key assumptions are as follows:\n\n- W Revenue growth averaging approximately 4.7% p.a. in the Europe segment and between 3.6% and 6.7% in the remaining segments.\n- W Cost increases of 2–3% p.a.\n- W Wage and salary cost increases of approximately 3–4% p.a.\n\nAssumptions made for discounting purposes were a pre-tax discount rate of 9.6% (prior year: 10.5%) and a long-term growth rate in perpetuity of 1.0% (prior year: 1.0%).\n\nThe discount rate is based on a weighted cost of debt of 4.0% (prior year: 4.4%), the weighted cost of equity and the capital structure. The cost of equity is based on a riskfree rate of return averaging 2.2% (prior year: 2.5%) and a beta of 1.3 (prior year: 1.3).\n\nNo indications of impairment were identified for goodwill in the WashTec Group in the reporting year. Nor would a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate and a 20% reduction in the future cash flows result in recognition of an impairment loss.\n\n### 15. Right-of-use assets\n\nThe recognized leases primarily relate to rented buildings and leasing of service vehicles.

Deferred Taxes\n\nThere are deferred tax assets in the amount of €3,478k (prior year: €3,856k) and deferred tax liabilities in the amount of €1,741k (prior year: €1,600k) relating to temporary differences.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are not recognized for outside basis differences as the entity holding the investment is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is not probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future. The tax base of the unrecognized deferred tax liabilities is €1,476k (prior year: €1,028k).\n\nLoss carryforwards and temporary differences have been recognized as deferred tax assets to the extent it is probable that the loss carryforwards or the temporary differences will be utilized on the basis of the internal planning for 2024 through 2029.\n\nTo the extent that it is not probable that loss carryforwards will be able to be utilized against future taxable net income, no deferred tax assets are recognized for them. Deferred tax assets were therefore not recognized in the reporting year in relation to loss carryforwards in the amount of €3,710k (prior year: €10,621k) and temporary differences in the amount of €6,038k (prior year: €9,716k). This corresponds to €942k (prior year: €2,650k) in deferred tax assets not recognized for loss carryforwards and €1,520k (prior year: €2,470k) in deferred tax assets not recognized for temporary differences.\n\nThe loss carryforwards have no time restrictions with regard to their utilization.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe deferred tax assets and liabilities relate, prior to offsetting, to the following material balance sheet items:\n\n| in €k                                 |  | Deferred tax assets |               | Deferred tax liabilities |               |\n|---------------------------------------|--|---------------------|---------------|--------------------------|---------------|\n|                                       |  | Dec 31, 2023        | Dec 31, 2022  | Dec 31, 2023             | Dec 31, 2022  |\n| Tax loss carryforwards                |  | 248                 | 702           | 0                        | 0             |\n| Property, plant and equipment         |  | 329                 | 336           | –1,220                   | –1,202        |\n| Goodwill                              |  | 0                   | 0             | –967                     | –913          |\n| Intangible assets                     |  | 0                   | 0             | –1,680                   | –1,421        |\n| Right-of-use assets                   |  | 0                   | 0             | –4,443                   | –3,947        |\n| Inventories                           |  | 2,077               | 1,365         | –169                     | –92           |\n| Trade receivables                     |  | 293                 | 175           | –6                       | –55           |\n| Other assets                          |  | 4                   | 1             | –308                     | –285          |\n| Non-current interest<br>bearing loans |  | 0                   | 0             | –133                     | 0             |\n| Lease liabilities                     |  | 4,508               | 3,814         | 0                        | 0             |\n| Provisions                            |  | 1,755               | 1,829         | 0                        | –2            |\n| Other liabilities                     |  | 881                 | 1,680         | –2                       | –31           |\n| Contract liabilities                  |  | 570                 | 303           | 0                        | –1            |\n| <b>Total</b>                          |  | <b>10,665</b>       | <b>10,205</b> | <b>–8,928</b>            | <b>–7,949</b> |\n| <i>of which non-current</i>           |  | 5,050               | 5,406         | –6,219                   | –5,744        |\n| <i>of which current</i>               |  | 5,615               | 4,799         | –2,709                   | –2,205        |\n\nDeferred tax receivables and liabilities totaling €7,187k (prior year: €6,349k) were offset in accordance with the offsetting rules in IAS 12.\n\n€–72k (prior year: €–555k) in deferred taxes were recognized in equity in the reporting year.

It is divided into 13,976,970 no-parvalue bearer shares (prior year: 13,976,970 shares) and is fully paid in. Each share has a single voting right and is entitled to dividends according to the share's percentage of the registered share capital.\n\n|                             | Dec 31, 2023 | Dec 31, 2022 |\n|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Ordinary shares (thousand)  | 13,977       | 13,977       |\n| Share capital per share (€) | 2.86         | 2.86         |\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the average weighted number of issued and outstanding shares was 13,382,324 (prior year: 13,382,324 shares).\n\nThe Annual General Meeting of May 15, 2023 resolved, among other things, for the distributable profit of €29,804,169.57 shown in the Company's annual financial statements for fiscal year 2022 to be appropriated for payment of a dividend of €2.20 per eligible no-par value share, totaling €29,441,112.80, and for the remaining distributable profit of €363,056.77 to be carried forward.\n\n### Authorized capital\n\nThe Authorized Capital currently existing under subsection 5.1 of the Company's Articles of Association, which has not been used to date, would have expired on June 30, 2022. In order that the Company may continue to act rapidly and flexibly as needed in order to raise equity capital on favorable terms, the existing Authorized Capital is to be revoked and the Management Board is once again to be authorized to increase the share capital by the issue of new no-par-value bearer shares.\n\n[By resolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 16, 2022, which is available in the](https://ir.washtec.de/en/)  Investor Relations section of the Company website at www.washtec.de, the Authorized\n\nCapital under subsection 5.1 of the Articles of Association resolved as agenda item 7 of the Annual General Meeting of April 29, 2019 was revoked. At the same time, the Management Board was authorized, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to increase the registered share capital on one or more occasions on or before June 30, 2025 by a total amount of up to €8,000,000 (Authorized Capital) by issuing new no-par-value bearer shares in exchange for cash and/or non-cash contributions. The shareholders must normally be granted preemptive rights in this connection.\n\nThe Management Board is authorized, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the preemptive rights of shareholders:\n\n- W for fractional amounts;\n- W if the new shares are issued in exchange for a non-cash contribution, including in connection with the acquisition of companies, parts of companies or interests in companies;\n- W in the event of capital increases in exchange for cash contributions if at the time of the final fixing of the issue price by the Management Board the issue price of the new shares is not significantly lower, within the meaning of section 203 (1) and (2) and section 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG, than the stock market price of existing publicly listed shares of the same class and with the same features, and the pro rata amount of the share capital attributable in total to the new shares on which preemptive rights are excluded does not exceed 10% at the time the authorization becomes effective or, if the pro rata amount is then lower, at the time the authorization is exercised;\n- W to the extent necessary in order to grant the holders of warrant-linked and/or convertible bonds issued by the Company or its subsidiaries a right to subscribe for new shares in the scope to which they would be entitled if they exercised their option or conversion right or fulfilled their conversion or option obligations.\n\nThe pro rata amount of the share capital attributable to shares issued against cash or non-cash contributions under the above stipulations with shareholders' preemptive rights \n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\nexcluded may not exceed a total of 10% of the Company's share capital at the time of the resolution by the Annual General Meeting. To be deducted from this amount – subject to any further authorization to exclude shareholders' preemptive rights that may be resolved by a subsequent Annual General Meeting – are those shares which are issued during the term of the Authorized Capital under another authorization with shareholders' preemptive rights excluded or to which warrant-linked or convertible bonds with conversion or warrant rights or with conversion or warrant obligations relate that are issued during the term of the Authorized Capital with shareholders' preemptive rights excluded.\n\nThe Management Board is authorized, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to stipulate further details concerning the capital increase and its implementation, including the features of the share rights and the terms and conditions of issue.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is authorized to revise the text of the Articles of Association after full or partial implementation of the capital increase from Authorized Capital.\n\n### 23. Capital reserves\n\nCapital reserves primarily consist of the contribution of California Kleindienst Holding GmbH to the capital of WashTec AG as of January 1, 2000 in the amount of €26,828k, and €18,019k, less €1,774k in costs relating to capital increases, from the premium paid in connection with the capital increase in August 2005. Capital reserves were reduced in 2009 when treasury shares were retired in the amount of €9,464k.\n\n### 24. Treasury shares\n\nAs in the prior year, WashTec AG held treasury shares in the amount of €13,177k as of December 31, 2023. This corresponds to 594,646 shares or 4.25%. The treasury shares were acquired in fiscal years 2012, 2013 and 2015.\n\n### Purchase and use of treasury shares\n\nUnless expressly permitted by law, the Company cannot acquire or make use of treasury shares except with authorization from the Annual General Meeting. As the authorization\n\nto purchase and use treasury shares in accordance with section 71 (1) no. 8 AktG granted by resolution of the Annual General Meeting of April 29, 2019 would have expired on June 30, 2022, it was resolved at the Annual General Meeting of May 16, 2022 to revoke the previous authorization and to grant the Company renewed authorization to purchase and make use of treasury shares. The resolution of the Annual General [Meeting is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company website at](https://ir.washtec.de/en/)  www.washtec.de.\n\n### Authorization to acquire treasury shares\n\nThe Company is authorized pursuant to section 71 (1) 8 AktG, on or before June 30, 2025 and for purposes other than to trade in the Company's own shares, to acquire the Company's own shares in the amount of up to 10% of the share capital at the time of the resolution or – if lower – at the time the authorization is exercised.\n\nThe Management Board may opt to acquire such shares on the stock exchange, by means of a public purchase offer to all shareholders or by means of a public invitation directed at all shareholders to tender shares for sale.\n\nIf the shares are acquired on the stock exchange, the consideration per share paid by the Company (excluding incidental acquisition costs) may not be more than 10% higher or lower than the average stock exchange price of the Company's shares in the XETRA closing auction (or a comparable successor system) on Frankfurt Stock Exchange over the last five trading days prior to the acquisition of the shares.\n\nIf the shares are acquired by means of a public purchase offer to all shareholders or by means of a public invitation directed at all shareholders to tender shares for sale, the purchase price offered or the limits of the purchase price range per share (excluding incidental acquisition costs) may not be more than 10% higher or lower than the average stock exchange price of the Company's shares in the XETRA closing auction (or a comparable successor system) on Frankfurt Stock Exchange over the last five trading days prior to the date of the public announcement of the offer or of the public invitation to tender shares for sale.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\nIf the public offer is oversubscribed, or if not all of a plurality of equivalent offers are accepted in the case of an invitation to tender shares for sale, then acceptance must be based on quotas. Provision may be made for preferential acquisition or preferential acceptance of small quantities of up to 100 shares in the Company offered for acquisition per shareholder. Additional conditions may be stipulated in the public offer or in the invitation to tender shares.\n\n### Use of treasury shares; exclusion of shareholders' preemptive rights\n\nOther than by way of sale on the stock exchange or by way of an offer to all shareholders, the Management Board is authorized, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to make use of treasury shares acquired on the basis of the authorization granted at the Annual General Meeting on May 16, 2022 or on the basis of a previously granted authorization as follows:\n\n### They may\n\n- W be offered and transferred to third parties as consideration in connection with the direct or indirect acquisition of companies, parts of companies or interests in companies or in connection with business combinations;\n- W be used to service options issued in a stock option program to members of the management of companies affiliated with the Company and to employees of the Company or of companies affiliated with the Company; or\n- W be used in other ways provided that the Company's treasury shares are utilized against cash payment and at a price that is not significantly lower than the stock exchange price of the Company's shares at the time of disposal. This authorization is additionally restricted to shares with a pro rata amount of the share capital that may not exceed a total of 10% of the share capital at the time the authorization becomes effective or, if lower, at the time the authorization is exercised.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is authorized to use the treasury shares acquired on the basis of this authorization to service options issued in a stock option program to members of the Management Board of the Company.\n\nThe aforementioned authorizations for use other than by way of sale on the stock exchange or by way of an offer to all shareholders may be exercised in whole or in part and on one or more occasions. The use made may be for one or more of the aforementioned purposes. Shareholders' preemptive rights to treasury shares are excluded to the extent that, in accordance with the above authorizations, the shares are used other than by way of sale on the stock exchange or by way of an offer to all shareholders.\n\nTo the extent that shares are used, with shareholders' preemptive rights excluded, to service options issued in a stock option program to members of the Management Board of the Company, to members of the management of companies affiliated with the Company and to employees of the Company or of companies affiliated with the Company, use may only be made of the authorization up to a total maximum amount of 5% of the share capital at the time of the resolution by the Annual General Meeting. To be deducted from this 5% limit is the pro rata share of the share capital attributable to shares issued or sold in exchange for cash or non-cash contributions during the term of the authorization or under another authorization, with shareholders' preemptive rights excluded, to members of the Management Board of the Company, to members of the management of companies affiliated with the Company and to employees of the Company or of companies affiliated with the Company.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Cancellation of treasury shares\n\nThe Management Board is authorized, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to cancel shares acquired on the basis of the above authorization or a previously granted authorization, in whole or in part, without the cancellation or its execution requiring a further resolution of the Annual General Meeting. Cancellation results in a reduction in capital. In departure from this, the Management Board may stipulate that instead of a reduction in capital, the pro rata share of the share capital attributable to each remaining share is increased. In this event, the Management Board is authorized to revise the number of shares in the Company's Articles of Association.\n\n### Utilization in partial amounts\n\nAll of the aforementioned authorizations may be exercised by the Company in whole or in part, on one or more occasions, and for one or more purposes. The authorizations – with the exception of the authorization to cancel treasury shares – may also be exercised by subsidiaries of the Company or by third parties for the account of the Company or for the account of subsidiaries of the Company. The authorizations for the use of treasury shares, for the exclusion of subscription rights and for the cancellation of treasury shares also include the use of shares in the Company acquired on the basis of section 71d sentence 5 AktG.\n\n### 25.

Provisions for pensions\n\nThe provisions relate mainly to WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH and WashTec Holding GmbH, Augsburg, Germany, and have been recognized in order to reflect obligations, arising from future and current benefit entitlements, to current and former employees and their surviving dependents. The pension plan provides for retirement benefits (from the age of 63), early retirement benefits and invalidity benefits. Employees must have served the Company for at least 10 years in order to be entitled to the benefits, with years of service taken into account only after an employee has reached the age of 30. The monthly retirement benefit is derived from a fixed amount multiplied by the number of pension-qualifying years of service. In addition, individual contractual terms and conditions apply.\n\nThe amount of the provision was determined using actuarial methods at a discount rate of 3.45% (prior year: 3.1%). The annual salary and cost-of-living increases were measured at 2.0% (prior year: 2.0%). The return from reimbursement claims due to the existing pension liability insurance policies amounts to 3.45% (prior year: 3.1%). The Prof. Dr. Klaus Heubeck 2018 G mortality tables were used as the biometrical basis of calculation. Staff turnover ratios were estimated according to age and sex and taken from standard tables.\n\nThe number of pension beneficiaries as of December 31, 2023 was 219 employees (prior year: 223 employees), and the total number of all persons to whom there is a pension commitment is 290 employees (prior year: 312 employees). The new valuations include the effects of experience adjustments in the amount of €47k (prior year: €–303k).\n\nAll actuarial gains and losses have been recognized in other comprehensive income. Actuarial gains and losses before deferred taxes in the fiscal year under review were €318k (prior year: €1,373k).

The calculation was based on an interest rate of 3.7% (prior year: 2.7%) and annual salary increases of 2.25% (prior year: 2.25%).\n\nThe provision for warranty obligations is recognized based on experience. The assumptions used in calculating the provision for warranty obligations were based on current sales levels and on the currently available information about repairs and returns for sold products during the warranty period. It is expected that the costs will be incurred during the warranty period after the balance sheet date.\n\nThe provision for contracts with rights of return comprises the expected expenses from contractual obligations to take back equipment previously sold to leasing companies and is measured on a rolling basis. In general, these obligations are secured by bank guarantees.\n\nThe provision for termination benefits in the amount of €1,778k (prior year: €914k) relates to measures for workforce reductions.\n\nThe other provisions totaling €481k (prior year: €501k) mainly relate to provisions for potential claims in the amount of €384k (prior year: €401k).\n\n### 28. Interest-bearing loans\n\nThe WashTec Group's financing is based on bilateral agreements with various banks. The borrower is WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH and has credit lines totaling €99,690k (prior year: €91,500k) at its disposal, consisting of demand facilities totaling €60,000k (prior year: €60,000k) and facilities with remaining terms as of December 31, 2023 of nine to 48 months totaling €39,690k (prior year: €31,500k). The facilities with a remaining term of nine months are credit lines that are normally provided for a term of 24 months and are extended on a regular basis. Talks for the upcoming extension are on track. All banks involved have already confirmed their willingness to continue the working relationship. The credit lines may be drawn on both as credit and as guarantee facilities. The increase in the credit lines is mainly due to the acquisition of the site occupied by the US subsidiary. This was purchased effective January 2, 2023 following the termination of the previous lease agreement. The purchase price was USD 10.3 million. This\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-154-0\"></span>was financed by long-term, five-year US dollar bank loans in the same amount. In addition, the guarantee facility was drawn in the amount of €4,075k (prior year: €5,251k). The undrawn amount of the credit line available for future operating activities and to meet obligations was €56,496k as of the reporting date (prior year: €46,137k).\n\nInterest-bearing loans at the WashTec Group are made up as follows:\n\n| in €k                              | Dec 31, 2023 | Dec 31, 2022 |\n|------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Non-current interest-bearing loans | 5,204        | 0            |\n| Current interest-bearing loans     | 33,916       | 41,362       |\n| Total                              | 39,120       | 41,362       |\n\nThe current interest-bearing loans are made up of overdraft borrowings in the amount of €32,287k (prior year: €41,362k) and interest-bearing loans in the amount of €1,629k (prior year: €0k).\n\nThe facilities provided by the banks are not tied to any financial covenants. The interest rate on the credit lines is variable and linked to changes in EURIBOR, €STR and SOFR plus a contractually agreed margin. The credit lines carry interest according to the applicable conditions of the relevant banks at the time they are utilized. The interest rates ranged between 2.7% and 5.3% in the reporting year (prior year: between 0.2% and 2.6%).\n\n### 29.

The lease payments are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which the condition that triggers them occurs. As in the prior year, there are no future cash outflows that are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2023.\n\nA number of property leases contain extension and termination options. No lease payments related to these as the optional periods are in the future. Potential future cash outflows in the amount of €3,097k (prior year: €3,100k) were not included in the lease liabilities as the leases are not reasonably certain to be extended.\n\nTotal cash outflows for leases were €8,740k in fiscal year 2023 (prior year: €9,095k). Future cash outflows arising from leases not yet commenced to which the WashTec Group committed in fiscal year 2023 amount to €256k (prior year: €50k). As in the prior year, there were no gains from sale-and-leaseback transactions.\n\nThe other rental expenses include €346k (prior year: €310k) in expenses for leases of low-value assets that are not short-term leases. Low-value assets mainly comprise IT equipment. As in the prior year, no expenses were recognized for variable lease payments not taken into account in the measurement of lease liabilities.\n\nFor the right-of-use assets recognized for leased assets and the related depreciation, ple[ase see](#page-138-0) [Note 15.

Financial risk management objectives and methods\n\nThe risks for the Group arising from derivative financial instruments comprise credit and liquidity risk along with market price risk in the form of interest and currency risk. Company policy is to avoid or limit such risk as far as possible. Substantially all hedging is coordinated and undertaken centrally. For example, the Group regularly identifies all items that are subject to interest rate and currency risk, assesses the probability of occurrence of negative developments and makes any decisions required to avoid or reduce variation in the corresponding interest rate and/or currency positions. No trading in derivatives is undertaken as a fundamental rule in accordance with internal Group policy.\n\nAll risk types to which the Group is exposed, and the strategies and procedures for managing the risks, are described below.\n\n### Credit risk\n\nThe Group conducts business exclusively with creditworthy third parties. To minimize credit risk, order limits are imposed where customers do not have first-class credit standing. For new regional customers, the Company requests evidence of credit standing or financing. Impairments recognized on receivables are expected to be sufficient to [cover actual risk. Please see Note 19 fo](#page-145-0)r further information.\n\nFor some trade receivables, the WashTec Group in some cases requires collateral in the form of guarantees or letters of credit to which the Group can have recourse under the contract terms in the event of payment default by the counterparty.\n\nThere is presumed to be a concentration of credit risk if a single customer or oil company makes up more than 10% of revenue. Revenue with one major customer marginally exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue in fiscal years 2023 and 2022. The development of receivables is monitored on a monthly basis as part of receivables management. If there are indications of an increase in credit risk, insolvency insurance may be taken out with reputable credit insurers. There is therefore no enhanced credit risk in this regard.\n\nWith respect to credit risk arising from the Group's remaining financial assets – such as cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets – the maximum credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty is the carrying amount of the instruments. No credit losses are expected on such instruments.\n\n### Liquidity risk\n\nA key business objective is to ensure that Group companies are solvent at all times. The implemented cash management systems enable the Group to identify potential shortfalls in good time and take appropriate action. The current and future liquidity situation is controlled in a timely manner on an annual basis based on a monthly rolling consolidated liquidity plan. Undrawn credit lines ensure the supply of liquidity. The credit lines have been granted under bilateral agreements between WashTec Cleaning Technology GmbH and various banks subject to joint and several liability on the part of WashTec AG. Further information is provided in Note 32.\n\nThe table below shows all contractually agreed undiscounted payments of principal and interest on financial liabilities recognized as of December 31, 2023 for future fiscal years.\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe table includes all instruments held as of the balance sheet date for which payments were already agreed. Foreign currency amounts are translated at closing rates. Variable interest payments on the financial instruments, primarily on loans, are calculated at expected interest rates. Financial liabilities that are repayable at any time are always included in the earliest repayment category.\n\n| in €k                       | Carrying<br>amount | Cash flows |           |          |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------|------------|-----------|----------|\n|                             | Dec 31, 2023       | 2024       | 2025–2028 | 2029 ff. |\n| Interest-bearing loans      | 39,120             | 35,649     | 5,787     | 0        |\n| Lease liabilities           | 19,439             | 8,226      | 11,609    | 344      |\n| Trade payables              | 23,951             | 23,951     | 0         | 0        |\n| Other financial liabilities | 19,172             | 19,117     | 55        | 0        |\n\n| in €k                       | Carrying<br>amount | Cash flows |           |          |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------|------------|-----------|----------|\n|                             | Dec 31, 2022       | 2023       | 2024–2027 | 2028 ff. |\n| Interest-bearing loans      | 41,362             | 6,483      | 47,748    | 0        |\n| Lease liabilities           | 18,102             | 8,197      | 9,604     | 751      |\n| Trade payables              | 22,711             | 22,711     | 0         | 0        |\n| Other financial liabilities | 20,765             | 20,597     | 168       | 0        |\n\n### Market price risk\n\nThe main sources of market price risk facing the Group relate to exchange rate movements between the euro and other currencies and to interest rate movements on the international money and capital markets.\n\n### Currency risk\n\nMovements in the USD/EUR, CAD/USD and EUR/NOK (and in the prior year also CNY/ EUR) exchange rates could have a material effect on consolidated net income because a portion of the operating business is conducted in the North America segment and a portion in the Asia/Pacific segment. American subsidiary Mark VII Equipment Inc., Arvada, USA, has a long-term CAD loan receivable against its Canadian subsidiary, which is designated as a net investment in a foreign operation in the amount of CAD 7,800k (prior year: CAD 7,800k). The translation effect of the loan receivable, which is attributable to the net investment in a foreign operation, is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe following sensitivity analysis shows how EBT and equity would change had the currencies identified as price risk variables moved differently as of the balance sheet date.

The documentation includes the identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the hedged risk and how the entity assesses whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including an analysis of the possible reasons for any hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined). In accordance with Group policy, there is no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes.\n\nTo hedge these interest rate exposures, derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps were held for hedging purposes during the reporting year. Credit risk relating to the counterparties to the interest rate derivatives could result in hedge ineffectiveness. As of December 31, 2023, no ineffectiveness was identified and the hedging relationships are classified as effective.\n\nHedging instruments as of December 31, 2023 comprised two interest rate swaps, which serve to hedge the loan for the acquisition of the site occupied by the American subsidiary.\n\n| Start        | End           | Nominal<br>amount in<br>USDk | Reference<br>rate | Interest rate<br>(%) | Hedge<br>relationship | Hedge ratio<br>(%) |\n|--------------|---------------|------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n| Jan. 3, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2027 | 5,100                        | SOFR              | 4.15                 | 1:1                   | 100                |\n| Jan. 3, 2023 | Dec. 31, 2027 | 1,975                        | SOFR              | 4.11                 | 1:1                   | 50                 |\n\nThe cash flow hedge reserve changed as follows in the fiscal year:\n\n|                                                                                      |  | 2023 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|------|\n| in €k                                                                                |  |      |\n| As of January 1                                                                      |  | 0    |\n| Change in fair value of hedging instruments recognized in other comprehensive income |  | 27   |\n| Gain or loss reclassified to other comprehensive income                              |  | -36  |\n| Deferred taxes                                                                       |  | 3    |\n| As of December 31                                                                    |  | -6   |\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Impact of changes in interest rates\n\nThe following table shows the sensitivity of consolidated earnings before taxes to a reasonably possible change in the interest rate on the variable-rate loans.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in response to changes in economic conditions. The Group monitors its capital using appropriate financial ratios. Net financial liabilities comprise interest-bearing loans and lease liabilities less cash and cash equivalents. At the end of 2023, net financial liabilities amounted to €41,886k (prior year: €45,249k). The facilities provided by the banks are not tied to any financial covenants.\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 33.

liabilities at amortized cost*\n\n*\\*\\* For current financial instruments at amortized cost, the carrying amount at the reporting date is assumed to approximate fair value.* \n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. If there is no active market, fair value is established using valuation techniques.\n\nIn the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy, financial instruments are classified into three levels on the basis of the input factors used. Level 1 input factors have the highest priority and unobservable inputs the lowest. The three levels are explained in the following.\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\nLevel 1: The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as listed derivatives and equity instruments) is based on quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. The quoted market price of financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are classified in level 1.\n\nLevel 2: The fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market (such as OTC derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable market data and minimize the use of company-specific estimates. If all significant inputs for measurement of an instrument at fair value are observable, the instrument is classified in Level 2. The derivative financial liabilities in Level 2 in fiscal year 2023 comprise interest rate swaps, which are measured at the fair value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.\n\nLevel 3: If one or more of the significant inputs are not observable, the instrument is classified in Level 3.\n\nThere were no reclassifications of recurring fair value measurements between the individual levels during the fiscal year. Reclassifications into and out of levels in the fair value hierarchy are made at the end of the reporting period.\n\nDue to their short terms, the fair values of current trade receivables, trade payables and cash and cash equivalents as well as other financial assets, other financial liabilities and interest-bearing loans generally match their carrying amounts. The fair value of noncurrent trade receivables and lease liabilities is determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at current market interest rates. The fair value of long-term interestbearing loans is based on the discounted cash flows using the current market interest rate for such loans.\n\nDerivative financial instruments in the form of long-term interest rate swaps have been entered into during the year. These are used to hedge the interest rate risk on the bank loans taken out to finance the purchase price of the site of the US subsidiary. They are valued on the basis of the banks' market valuation.\n\n### Net gains and losses by category\n\nThe following table shows the net gains and losses on financial instruments based on the IFRS 9 categories:\n\n| in €k                                                                                      | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Financial assets at amortized cost (AC)                                                    | 192    | -19    |\n| Financial liabilities at amortized cost (FLAC)                                             | -4,112 | -1,210 |\n| Financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value through profit<br>or loss (FVthP/L) | 62     | 0      |\n\nThe net gains or losses in the financial assets at amortized cost (AC) category are primarily attributable to foreign currency measurement and those in the financial liabilities at amortized cost (FLAC) category are primarily attributable to interest expenses and foreign currency measurement. The assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVthP/L) category relates to interest income on derivative financial instruments.\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Other information\n\n### 34.

id=\"page-165-0\"></span>37. Related party disclosures\n\n### Management Board remuneration (HGB)\n\nThe Management Board remuneration system is geared to promoting the corporate strategy and the long-term development of the Company and its affiliates. This is achieved among other things by means of a simple and clear incentive structure in Management Board remuneration. The remuneration system and the uniform remuneration structure for all Management Board functions are designed to prevent inappropriate incentives, both from outside and from within the Company. In particular, they aim to prevent Management Board decision-making that is calculated to maximize remuneration in the short term but is not conducive to the long-term success of the business.\n\nAt its meeting on March 24, 2021, the Supervisory Board, after due deliberation, adopted the system for the remuneration of the members of the Management Board of WashTec AG in accordance with the requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act resulting from the German Act Implementing the Second Shareholder Rights Directive (ARUG II) and taking into account the German Corporate Governance Code dated December 16, 2019 (the \"2020 Code\"). The amended version of the German Corporate Governance Code dated April 28, 2022 (the \"2022 Code\") has no effect in this regard. With regard to the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code, reference is made to the Declaration of Conformity published in the combined management [report, section 8.1.](#page-96-0)\n\nThis remuneration system was approved by the 2021 Annual General Meeting pursuant to section 120a (1) AktG and applies to all Management Board contracts entered into or renewed after the Annual General Meeting on May 18, 2021. Those contracts are the Management Board contracts of CEO Dr. Ralf Koeppe, who was reappointed in fiscal year 2022, CFO Andreas Pabst, who was newly appointed in fiscal year 2022, and CSO Sebastian Kutz, who was newly appointed in fiscal year 2023. In accordance with the 2022 Code and section 26j of the Introductory Act to the Stock Corporation Act (EGAktG), all Management Board contracts current at the time of the 2021 Annual General\n\nMeeting continued to be subject to the previous remuneration system (see also the Declaration of Conformity of December 15, 2022 submitted by the Management Board and Supervisory Board in accordance with section 161 AktG). The long-term variable remuneration in the form of the Long Term Incentive Program (LTIP) 2021-2023 for the Management Board was adopted effective January 1, 2021 and applies to all members of the Management Board. With regard to the Management Board contracts current at the time of the 2021 Annual General Meeting, these have continued or will continue to apply under the conditions specified in the respective contract.\n\nThe total remuneration of members of the Management Board is made up of non-performance-based and performance-based remuneration components and is linked overall to sustained growth of the Company. The non-performance-based remuneration components consist of fixed remuneration and incidental benefits, notably comprising the provision of company cars and insurance coverage. The performance-based remuneration components include both a short-term and a long-term component.\n\nThe short-term variable remuneration is based in equal parts on Company targets and individual performance targets. The Company targets relate to the WashTec Group's financial key performance indicators. These are revenue, EBIT, free cash flow and return on capital employed (ROCE). For each fiscal year, the Supervisory Board sets the Company targets relevant to remuneration. The individual performance targets comprise operational or strategic targets, including non-financial targets, primarily from the areas of product innovation, sustainability, process optimization, digitalization and customer benefit.\n\nThe long-term variable remuneration is structured as share-based payment with a onetime cash award (LTIP) and has a term from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2023. The LTIP ensures long-term performance and sustainability under the corporate strategy with the two performance targets return on capital employed (ROCE) and total shareholder return (TSR).

The terms and conditions of the transactions correspond to those of arms-length transactions.\n\nThe total expense recognized for Management Board remuneration in accordance with IFRS was €1,135k (prior year: €1,885k). €985k (prior year: €936k) consisted of fixed remuneration and €457k (prior year: €228k) to single-year variable remuneration. An amount of €307k was recognized as income in relation to long-term share-based payment for fiscal years 2021 to 2023 (prior year: expense of €584k). A total of €1,143k (prior year: €1,421k) was recognized in other liabilities and €100k (prior year: €129k) directly in equity for the future disbursement of long-term share-based payment for the members of the Management Board active as of December 31, 2023. In addition, the total expenses include €0k (prior year: €138k) relating to early termination of a Management Board contract.\n\nThe total expense recognized for remuneration of the Supervisory Board in accordance with IFRS was €678k (prior year: €652k). The expense recognized for fixed remuneration was €379k (prior year: €376k) and that recognized for single-year variable remuneration was €15k (prior year: €0k). Other remuneration, predominantly attendance fees, amounted to a total of €273k (prior year: €245k). An amount of €11k (prior year: €32k) was recognized as expense for long-term share-based payment for fiscal years 2022 to 2024 adopted by the 2021 Annual General Meeting. In addition, €35k (prior year: €26k) was recognized in other liabilities and €7k (prior year: €5k) directly in equity for future disbursements.\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\n### Share-based payment (IFRS 2)\n\nThere are contracts in place with the members of the Management Board that provide for share-based payment in the form of a Long Term Incentive Program (LTIP). A sharebased payment arrangement in the form of an LTIP for the Supervisory Board was established by resolution of the 2021 Annual General Meetings and is made use of by Supervisory Board members Mr. Bellgardt, Dr. Liebler, Dr. Selent and Mr. Wiedemann. This is intended to give members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board additional incentives to secure the business success of the Company in the medium and long term and to seek to deliver sustained growth in shareholder value.\n\nIn order to enable the Supervisory Board to participate in WashTec AG's long-term development, the Annual General Meeting of May 18, 2021 adopted a share-based payment arrangement for the Supervisory Board with an incentive period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024. In order to participate in the new share-based payment arrangement, a Supervisory Board member is required to already have held a personal investment in shares in the Company or to have made such an investment by July 31, 2022 (Chairman: 4,000 shares maximum; all others: 2,000 shares maximum). A Supervisory Board member can also participate in the LTIP with shares already purchased by the member prior to the Company's Annual General Meeting in fiscal year 2021. In that case, invested shares can also be shares with which the Supervisory Board member participated in LTIP 2018 and 2015. The amount paid out depends on percentage target attainment of certain performance targets over the term and on personal investment in Company shares. The stipulated performance targets were an EPS target, a ROCE target and a free cash flow target. The reference base for the targets comprises the key performance indicators for fiscal year 2021. Depending on whether one, several or all of the targets are fulfilled, a different multiplier applies for the cash award. This is calculated by multiplying a multiplier with the number of invested shares multiplied by the reference share price. Entitlement to the bonus payment is conditional on the Supervisory Board member still being on the Supervisory Board and still holding shares in the Company. A Supervisory Board member who is elected to the Supervisory Board after\n\nthe beginning of the incentive period may participate in the LTIP. In order to do so, the member must make a personal investment in shares in the Company, with the invested shares purchased at the latest three months after the entry into effect of the member's election to the Supervisory Board. Payment is made on the day following the Company's Annual General Meeting in fiscal year 2025. Entitlement to payment is subject to the resolutive condition that one-sixth of the cash award received under the LTIP is reinvested in shares in the Company by the eligible Supervisory Board member within three months subsequent to the Company's Annual General Meeting in fiscal year 2025 and the Supervisory Board member holds those shares for at least three years after acquiring them. The requirement to hold the shares ends if the eligible Supervisory Board member leaves the Supervisory Board during the three-year holding period.\n\nThe current share-based payment arrangement for the Management Board has an incentive period from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2023 and consists of two components: a non-personal-investment component and an optional personal investment component.\n\nUnder the non-personal-investment component, a Management Board member can obtain a maximum cash award, at 100% target achievement, of 100% of their respective short-term variable annual target remuneration for each year of the LTIP.\n\nAn additional personal investment component provides a Management Board member with the opportunity to increase – up to a maximum of double (cash award multiplier = 2) – their cash award under the non-personal-investment component by personal investment in WashTec AG shares. Doubling the cash award requires a personal investment in the amount of 100% of the 2021 short-term variable target annual remuneration in euros by a specified cut-off date. If the personal investment is lower, the personal investment component is proportionately smaller (cash award multiplier < 2). Personal investment for the purposes of the LTIP means (euro) amounts invested in shares in the Company held personally by the Management Board member on the June 30, 2023 cut-off date. This includes any shares that the Management Board member acquired under pre\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\nvious LTIP programs and still holds. If a Management Board member is appointed after the start of the incentive period, the rule for the personal investment in shares of the Company required to double the entitlement under the non-personal-investment component is that the Management Board member must make a personal investment amounting to 100% of the variable target income in euros for the year in which the Management Board member takes office. A personal investment for the purposes of this program means (euro) amounts, amounting to up to 100% of the variable target income for the year in which the Management Board member takes office, invested in shares in the Company held personally by the Management Board member on June 30, 2023 (the cut-off date). The long-term share-based payment is paid at the end of the incentive period. The amount paid depends on the achievement of agreed performance targets for return on capital employed (ROCE) and total shareholder return (TSR). The two performance targets must each reach the minimum threshold of 81% set by the Supervisory Board in order to count. The ROCE target has a weighting of 70% and the TSR target has a weighting of 30% in determination of the cash award. If the Management Board member makes use of the personal investment component, payment is subject to the resolutive condition that one-sixth of the gross cash award under the LTIP with personal investment is reinvested in shares in the Company by the Management Board member within three months of the cash award falling due and that the Management Board member remains invested with that quantity of shares for at least three years after acquiring them. There are exemptions to the reinvestment requirement and the holding period in the event of the Management Board member leaving office.\n\nThese obligations were measured at fair value as required for share-based payment in accordance with IFRS 2. The long-term share-based compensation for the Management Board expires as of December 31, 2023. It is paid out after the Supervisory Board meeting adopting the financial statements in March 2024. The grant date for the Supervisory Board share-based payment arrangement with the incentive period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024 is the date of the Annual General Meeting in fiscal year 2021.\n\nBoth programs constitute equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the amount of the required reinvestment of one sixth of the cash award, with the remaining portion comprising cash-settled share-based payment transactions. The equity-settled share-based payment component is recognized directly in equity. The portion comprising a cash-settled share-based payment transaction is recognized in other liabilities. The obligations from share-based payment are recognized in non-current other liabilities at fair value taking into account the remaining duration of the program.\n\nThe obligations recognized in other liabilities for the LTIP are as follows:\n\n| in €k            | Dec 31, 2023 | Dec 31, 2022 |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| LTIP obligations | 1,178        | 1,447        |\n| Total            | 1,178        | 1,447        |\n\nThe obligations recognized directly in equity for the LTIP are as follows:\n\n| in €k                                                    | Dec 31, 2023 | Dec 31, 2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Portion of LTIP obligation recognized directly in equity | 107          | 134          |\n| Total                                                    | 107          | 134          |\n\nThe expenses recognized for the LTIP are as follows:\n\n| in €k         | 2023  | 2022  |\n|---------------|-------|-------|\n| LTIP expenses | 1,285 | 1,582 |\n| Total         | 1,285 | 1,582 |\n\n{170}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 38.

In addition, we have audited the group management report of WashTec AG for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the statement on corporate governance pursuant to § [Article] 289f HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and § 315d HGB.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- W the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and\n- W the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the group management report does not cover the content of the statement on corporate governance referred to above.\n\nPursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n### *Basis for the Audit Opinions*\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\n### *Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements*\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\n{174}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn our view, the matter of most significance in our audit was as follows:\n\n### 1 Recoverability of goodwill\n\nOur presentation of this key audit matter has been structured as follows:\n\n1 Matter and issue\n\n2 Audit approach and findings\n\n3 Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter we present the key audit matter:\n\n### 1 Recoverability of goodwill\n\n1 In the Company's consolidated financial statements Goodwill amounting in total to EUR 43,289 thousand (16,0 % of total assets) is reported. Goodwill is tested for impairment by the Company once a year or when there are indications of impairment to determine any possible need for write-downs. Impairment testing is carried out at the level of the groups of cash-generating units to which the relevant goodwill has been allocated. The carrying amount of the relevant cash-generating units, including goodwill, is compared with the corresponding recoverable amount in the context of the impairment test. The calculation of the recoverable amount generally employs the value in use. The present value of the future cash flows from the respective group of cash-generating units normally serves as the basis of valuation. Present values are calculated using discounted cash flow models. For this purpose, the adopted medium-term business plan of the Group forms the starting point for future projections based on assumptions about longterm rates of growth. Expectations relating to future market developments and assumptions about the development of macroeconomic factors on the business activities of the Group are also taken into account. The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital for the relevant group of cash-generating units. The im-pairment test determined that no write-downs were necessary.\n\n The outcome of this valuation exercise is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the executive directors with respect to the future cash inflows from the respective group of cash-generating units, the discount rate used, the rate of growth and other assumptions, and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background and due to the complex nature of the valuation, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n2 As part of our audit, we assessed the methodology employed for the purposes of performing the impairment test, among other things. After matching the future cash inflows used for the calcu-lation against the adopted medium-term business plan of the Group, we assessed the appropri-ateness of the calculation, in particular by coordinating it with general and sector-specific market expectations. We discussed and examined supplementary adjustments to the medium-term business plan for the purposes of the impairment test with the members of the Company's staff responsible. We also assessed whether the basis for including the costs of Group functions was accurate. In the knowledge that even relatively small changes in the discount rate applied can have a material impact on the value of the entity calculated in this way, we focused our testing in particular on the parameters used to determine the discount rate applied, and evaluated the measurement model. In order to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the projections, we assessed the sensitivity analyses performed by the Company and carried out our own sensitivity analyses with respect to those groups of cash-generating units whose carrying amount was only slightly greater than the recoverable amount. Taking into account the information available, we determined that the carrying amounts of the cash-generating units, including the goodwill, were adequately covered by the discounted future cash flows.\n\n Overall, the measurement inputs and assumptions used by the executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also within the ranges considered by us to be reasonable.\n\n{175}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/175/Picture/1 description: The image shows two document icons.

In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n{176}------------------------------------------------\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n*Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report*\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the\n\naggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- W Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- W Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- W Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- W Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n\n{177}------------------------------------------------\n\n- W Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.\n- W Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- W Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- W Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n### *Other legal and regulatory requirements*\n\n*Report on the Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB*\n\n### *Assurance Opinion*\n\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report (hereinafter the \"ESEF documents\") contained in the electronic file WashTec\\_AG\\_KA\\_KLB\\_ESEF\\_2023-12-31.zip and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format (\"ESEF format\"). In accordance with German legal requirements, this assurance work extends only to the conversion of the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the group management report into the ESEF format and therefore relates neither to the information contained within these renderings nor to any other information contained in the electronic file identified above.\n\n{178}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn our opinion, the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report contained in the electronic file identified above and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format. Beyond this assurance opinion and our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the accompanying group management report for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023 contained in the \"Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and on the Group Management Report\" above, we do not express any assurance opinion on the information contained within these renderings or on the other information contained in the electronic file identified above.\n\n### *Basis for the Assurance Opinion*\n\nWe conducted our assurance work on the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report contained in the electronic file identified above in accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB and the IDW Assurance Standard: Assurance Work on the Electronic Rendering, of Financial Statements and Management Reports, Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB (IDW AsS 410 (06.2022)) and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised). Our responsibility in accordance therewith is further described in the \"Group Auditor's Responsibilities for the Assurance Work on the ESEF Documents\" section. Our audit firm applies the IDW Standard on Quality Management: Requirements for Quality Management in the Audit Firm (IDW QMS 1 (09.2022)).\n\n*Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the ESEF Documents*\n\nThe executive directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the ESEF documents including the electronic rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report in accordance with § 328 Abs. 1 Satz 4 Nr. [number] 1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 328 Abs. 1 Satz 4 Nr. 2 HGB.\n\nIn addition, the executive directors of the Company are responsible for such internal control as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of ESEF documents that are free from material non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting process.\n\n### *Group Auditor's Responsibilities for the Assurance Work on the ESEF Documents*\n\nOur objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB, whether due to fraud or error. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the assurance work. We also:\n\n- W Identify and assess the risks of material non-compliance with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform assurance procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain assurance evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our assurance opinion.\n- W Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the assurance work on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.\n- W Evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e., whether the electronic file containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 in the version in force at the date of the consolidated financial statements on the technical specification for this electronic file.\n- W Evaluate whether the ESEF documents provide an XHTML rendering with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and to the audited group management report.\n\n{179}------------------------------------------------\n\nW Evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with the requirements of Articles 4 and 6 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the date of the consolidated financial statements, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML rendering.\n\n### *Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation*\n\nWe were elected as group auditor by the annual general meeting on 15 May 2023. We were engaged by the supervisory board on 9 December 2023. We have been the group auditor of the WashTec AG, Augsburg, without interruption since the financial year 2008.\n\nWe declare that the audit opinions expressed in this auditor's report are consistent with the additional report to the audit committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report).\n\n### *Reference to an other matter – use of the auditor's report*\n\nOur auditor's report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited group management report as well as the assured ESEF documents. The consolidated financial statements and the group management report converted to the ESEF format – including the versions to be filed in the company register – are merely electronic renderings of the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited group management report and do not take their place. In particular, the \"Report on the Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB\" and our assurance opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the assured ESEF documents made available in electronic form.\n\n### *German public auditor responsible for the engagement*\n\nThe German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement is Jürgen Schumann.\n\nMunich, March 22 2024\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nJürgen Schumann ppa.
