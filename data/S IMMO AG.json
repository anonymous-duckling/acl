The company pursues the goal of designing its properties to be resource-efficient, low-emission and user-friendly. At the same time, we not only play an important role in society as an employer but also provide real estate that meets people's basic need for space to live and work. In addition to encompassing labour standards, diversity and remuneration within our company, our aspiration demands a commitment to society and the local community. Handling the capital provided to us sustainably and with integrity is a key part of our corporate self image. As a listed company, we always have an obligation to our shareholders, but we also naturally have a responsibility to all other stakeholders at all times.\n\nLast year, we took important strategic and operational steps. Together with CPI and Immofinanz, we defined a Group-wide ESG strategy. This strategy sets out 15 goals in the areas of Environment, Social and Governance, which we will drive forward with joint forces. The reduction to these 15 strategic core goals enables us to focus clearly on material issues, and we expect targeted synergies from Group-wide cooperation. The goals include reducing greenhouse gas, water and energy intensity as well as, for example, increasing the proportion of certified buildings, a Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Groupwide standardised green lease agreements. The strategy adjustment was decided by the Management Board after consultation with the ESG Committee of the Supervisory Board; all goals with detailed definitions and respective deadlines can be found on page 6 of this non-financial report.\n\nImage /page/0/Picture/5 description: This image shows a woman with brown hair and glasses sitting at a table. She is wearing a black blazer over a white shirt. The background is a light beige color, and the table is a dark brown color. The woman is looking directly at the camera with a slight smile.\n\nRadka Doehring\n\n{1}------------------------------------------------\n\nOperationally, we also focused on harmonising processes and systems together with CPI and Immofinanz, at the same time ensuring that our actions are based on a common understanding of all ESG-relevant topics. In this area, we are also benefiting from the completed development of the data lake as a single point of truth to which all employees have access. This saves valuable time when working with and analysing data, but even more importantly, it enables patterns to be identified quickly. This means we can also simulate future scenarios and not just interpret data retrospectively. We learn from the past and create data-based future forecasts – this gives us a huge advantage in terms of the defined ESG goals.\n\nI am confident that the steps we have taken in the past year will make a significant contribution to further strengthening our intensive efforts in all ESG matters. The combined forces within the Group, through which we will dedicate ourselves to a common ESG strategy, make me confident not only that we will achieve our ambitious goals, but also that we will enjoy fruitful and inspiring cooperation at all levels of the Group. Only by pulling in the same direction will we succeed in becoming more mindful of our resources, our environment, and our society as a whole.\n\n# **Regulatory frameworks, principles and standards**\n\nS IMMO has published a non-financial report annually since the financial year 2017. It contains information about environmental, employee and social issues in connection with the topics defined as material by S IMMO as well as the subject of human rights and the prevention of corruption and bribery. In preparing this report, S IMMO implements the legal requirements of section 267a of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) in full as required by the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (NaDiVeG). In addition, information is disclosed in line with the EU Taxonomy Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2020/852). In addition, S IMMO is preparing for the requirements of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD, Directive (EU) 2022/2464) and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) and has already partially adjusted the nonfinancial key figure tables in this report in accordance with the current interpretation.\n\nS IMMO undertakes to comply with national, international and company principles. Since 2007, S IMMO has been committed to observing the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, which is available on the website of the Austrian Working Group for Corporate Governance. Details on the implementation of the Code at S IMMO can be found in the annual report starting on page 21. S IMMO is also included in CPI's participation in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC).\n\nAt an international level, the company applies various frameworks for the protection of human rights. Details of S IMMO's activities in the area of human rights issues, and especially the scope and content of these activities and their organisational and procedural implementation, can be found in the Human rights section starting on page 52 and in the Organisational Policy for Human Rights at www.simmoag.at/sustainability/governance. S IMMO's Code of Conduct for all executive bodies and employees of the company also covers human rights issues as well as compliance-related and environmental content. This Code, which is publicly accessible at www.simmoag.at/sustainability/governance, is binding for all executive bodies and employees and has been the subject of annual training since 2022.\n\nThe Management Board of S IMMO approves of the company's commitment to these principles and supports them fully. These frameworks currently apply only to S IMMO and all its fully consolidated subsidiaries. The plan is for them to be expanded to include external business relationships.\n\nTo facilitate the transparency and comparability of strategies, measures and results in the area of sustainability, S IMMO has applied international frameworks for its non-financial disclosures since the publication of the report on the financial year 2021. For this reason, S IMMO prepares and publishes a nonfinancial report in accordance with the applicable Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards once a year. The GRI content index provides an overview of the standards applied in this report and the sections containing the relevant information (starting on page 57).\n\nMoreover, disclosures are made in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) and the EPRA Sustainability Best Practice Recommendations (EPRA sBPR). The EPRA Sustainability Performance Measures can be found starting on page 31. The application of additional standards in non-financial reporting is continuously examined in terms of relevance and viability.\n\n# **Scope and boundaries of the report**\n\nThe company publishes the non-financial report each year as part of its annual report. The reporting period for this report is identical to that of the financial report and thus covers the period from 01 January 2023 to 31 December 2023. The report includes the key figures for the reporting year and, where possible, for the previous year. Significant events between the balance sheet date (31 December 2023) and the editorial deadline for this report (25 March 2024) are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements set out in section 5.7. This report was published on 25 March 2024.\n\n{2}------------------------------------------------\n\nThis non-financial report was published in accordance with the operational control approach (for the purposes of non-financial reporting). The scope of reporting includes S IMMO and all subsidiaries over whose operational decisions S IMMO can exercise a controlling influence. As in the previous year, this corresponds to all fully consolidated S IMMO companies (see annual report from page 125).\n\nThe Vienna Marriott and Budapest Marriott hotels are operated by fully consolidated subsidiaries under management agreements. S IMMO exercises a controlling influence over many operating activities in the area of hotel management and can exercise operational control with regard to environmental factors in particular. However, the management of the hotel staff is the sole responsibility of the respective hotel's management and lies outside S IMMO's control. This means that the employees of the two hotel companies are not covered by the operational control approach and are therefore not included in employeerelated key figures in terms of non-financial reporting as they are not material. The disclosure of the total number of employees at S IMMO, which also includes the hotel employees, is an exception.\n\nWhere reference is made to S IMMO elsewhere in the nonfinancial report, this should be understood to include all fully consolidated companies and properties of S IMMO and its employees in Austria, Germany and Croatia, but not the employees of the two hotels in Vienna and Budapest. If a key figure does not refer to all locations, this is explicitly stated. In the first quarter of the reporting year, S IMMO's office locations in Romania and Hungary were closed and the employees were largely taken on by local subsidiaries of CPI, which in turn were tasked with the local management of the respective properties. These employees are included in the key figures on a pro rata basis for 2023.\n\nReal estate-related key figures refer to S IMMO's entire property portfolio. This includes all lettable buildings and the owneroperated hotels. In addition, leasehold properties, development projects and land banks as well as any acquisitions and sales during the year are also included on a monthly basis for indicators such as energy consumption. This means that all fully consolidated properties are covered in full. The three buildings held by associates and joint ventures and accounted for using the equity method, which are therefore not fully consolidated, are only taken into account when calculating greenhouse gas emissions under the category Investments.\n\n# **Audits**\n\nThe Management Board submitted the non-financial report to the Supervisory Board for review. The Supervisory Board received, reviewed and discussed the non-financial report and found no reasons for objection. As part of the audit of the financial statements, the disclosure of all legally required information was reviewed by the appointed auditor, Ernst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H. The non-financial report has not been subjected to any further separate external audit.\n\nThe Internal Control System (ICS) and the risk management of the company are explained in detail in the risk management report in the annual report starting on page 104. The selection of the auditor is carried out by the Audit Committee and is described in the Supervisory Board report (annual report from page 18).\n\nS IMMO has not set any internal rotation interval for auditing above and beyond the statutory requirements. The last change in the auditor of the consolidated and individual financial statements of S IMMO AG was made for the financial year 2023. For the financial years 2018 to 2022, KPMG Austria GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft was appointed as the auditor of the consolidated and individual financial statements of S IMMO AG. The audit-specific and nonaudit-specific fees that the auditor receives from the company are listed in the annex to the annual report starting on page 166.\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **ESG strategy and sustainability management**\n\n# **Guiding principles**\n\nExperience shows that a company-wide approach to the topics of ESG and sustainability requires above all an intensive analysis of the company's identity and values and its corporate culture at the very outset. That is why S IMMO decided to revise and hone its guiding principles at the start of 2022 in a participative process with its employees. The company is characterised by lean structures and open cooperation across departments. It actively designs living environments by means of its properties and acts prudently and responsibly in this process. The S IMMO guiding principles consist of four related elements: purpose, vision, mission and values. Together, they describe S IMMO's identity and how it acts.\n\n### S IMMO guiding principles\n\n| Purpose | Investing in lasting values: people and real estate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Vision  | We design valuable living environments for today and tomorrow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Mission | We use our experience, passion and local know-how to turn individual properties into a future-proof and<br>high-performing portfolio based on forward-looking decisions                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Values  | Quality: Tenant satisfaction and consistently increasing business value thanks to highest standards<br>Tradition: Stability and reliability rooted in a successful past<br>Responsibility: Foresighted action for the benefit of our stakeholders and the environment<br>Collaboration: Achieving success as a team and together with our stakeholders |\n\n# **Materiality analysis**\n\nThis non-financial report is based on a materiality analysis conducted in 2021 in which potential areas of sustainable management were examined and assessed with internal and external experts in connection with the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (NaDiVeG) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. The impacts on people and the environment and the significance to key stakeholders such as shareholders, tenants, employees, other interest groups and business partners were addressed here. The materiality analysis was performed with assistance from the consulting firm Deloitte.\n\nTwo workshops were conducted with the responsible Management Board member and representatives of various specialist departments (Corporate Communications and Investor Relations, Project Development, Portfolio Management, HR, Compliance, Works Council) in which stakeholder groups were identified, and the stakeholders were assigned a weighting based on the criteria \"influence on S IMMO\" and \"interest in S IMMO\". As a result, the following stakeholder groups were identified as relevant:\n\n- Supervisory Board\n- Management Board\n- Local managing directors\n- Employees\n- Works Council\n- Tenants and brokers\n- Core shareholders\n- Institutional investors\n- Small investors\n- Banks and analysts\n\nGiven the low level of construction activity, stakeholder groups such as general contractors and suppliers were rated as non-material.\n\nTopics for the stakeholder survey were then determined in a multi-stage process. In the first step, the external consulting firm drew up a shortlist of possible topics for the survey on the basis of sector benchmarking, an analysis of reporting standards, current trends and an analysis of current and forthcoming legal conditions relating to non-financial reporting. These topics were verified at a workshop with Deloitte, and any existing gaps were scrutinised.\n\nThe identified topics were assessed on two levels: their influence on decisions of the stakeholders and their potential economic, environmental and social impacts. Stakeholder repre\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\nsentatives were then questioned via an online survey (period: July to September 2021) and in individual interviews. The aim of these surveys was to assess the impacts of economic, environmental and social aspects on S IMMO and to gauge the influence of these aspects on stakeholder decisions. Subsequently, the importance of the economic, environmental and social impacts of the topics was specified in the context of a workshop and a meeting with the Management Board member responsible for ESG.\n\nThe material topics for S IMMO are therefore the 14 aspects that have the greatest impacts on society and the environment, are the most important to stakeholders and are rated as the most significant for S IMMO's business activities.\n\n#### Material topic\n\n| Environment | Climate change adaptation<br>Energy consumption and use of resources<br>Renewable energy sources<br>Sustainable operation of buildings<br>Maintenance, repair, modernisation and renovation<br>Sustainable mobility |\n|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Social      | Diversity and equal opportunities<br>Employee satisfaction and employer attractiveness<br>Training<br>Tenant satisfaction                                                                                           |\n| Governance  | Sustainable value enhancement<br>Combating corruption<br>Digitalisation<br>Data protection                                                                                                                          |\n\nIn this non-financial report, S IMMO details its activities and the measures adopted in relation to the topics identified as material topics. These are dealt with in detail in the following chapters: Environment, Social and Governance.\n\nAgainst the background of closer cooperation in the area of ESG between S IMMO, CPI and Immofinanz, the materiality analysis is to be revised jointly in 2024.\n\n# **ESG strategy**\n\nIn the second half of 2022, S IMMO presented a comprehensive ESG strategy for the first time. As a result of the majority shareholdings of CPI and Immofinanz in S IMMO and the resulting consolidation, the ESG strategy was adapted and aligned across all three companies in the reporting year. This new Group-wide ESG strategy, consisting of 15 goals in the areas of Environment, Social and Governance, was developed jointly and replaces S IMMO's previous ESG strategy.\n\nIn particular, S IMMO has succeeded in incorporating its previous core goals into the Group-wide ESG strategy. At the same time, the strategic alignment means that some of S IMMO's previous goals will no longer be pursued in favour of a significantly more focused and streamlined approach. The company aims to achieve an even greater impact from the tighter focus and synergies of a common Group-wide strategy through joint measures, especially in highly relevant and challenging areas such as the reduction of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. It should be noted that the validation of the reduction target for greenhouse gas intensity by the Science Based Targets Initiative takes into account CPI as an entire group in which S IMMO is fully included. However, there is no validation explicitly for S IMMO alone.\n\nThe Management Board approved the current ESG strategy in August 2023 and is responsible for compliance with the strategic guidelines. The relevant specialist departments, based on the specific topics, are responsible for tracking individual targets and implementing measures, and the ESG & Sustainability department takes on the responsibility for coordinating implementation.\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Group ESG strategy and goals\n\n- **E** Environment\nImage /page/5/Picture/2 description: The image shows a line drawing of a green energy concept.

The area of digitalisation/ESG is established as a Management Board responsibility and assigned to a board member. Furthermore, the ESG & Sustainability department is a central point where sustainability issues across all departments and subsidiaries are consolidated and coordinated. This department reports directly to the Management Board, and they meet at least once a week. The ESG Committee of the Supervisory Board acts as a control and steering body. This committee monitors the company's activities and its social, economic and environmental responsibility and is informed by the Management Board and the department in detail about current focal points and areas of activity during its meetings.\n\nIn business operations, the ESG & Sustainability department works intensively with other departments on implementing S IMMO's strategic ESG goals and is responsible at the same time for collecting and analysing data on relevant key performance indicators. The awareness and understanding of ESG and sustainability is thus promoted in dialogue with the specialist departments throughout the Group and among all the employees. Moreover, the department is also responsible for the selection and implementation of international regulations, principles and standards in non-financial reporting and acts as an interface for cooperation with CPI and Immofinanz on all ESGrelated topics.\n\nExisting and potential risks that arise in the context of S IMMO's business activities and could have an impact on various sustainability matters have been incorporated into the Group's general risk management. This risk management is the responsibility of the correspondingly named function within S IMMO. Another independent function, which is currently also fulfilled operationally by a member of the Management Board, is Compliance Management, which is responsible for the areas of capital market and criminal compliance, including the associated organisational guidelines, employee training and grievance mechanisms as well as overarching responsibility for the Code of Conduct.\n\nIn order to improve the transparency and comparability of how companies deal with different sustainability issues, ESG rating agencies have been established around the world that can offer institutional investors in particular guidance when it comes to assessing companies and investment decisions.\n\nGroup-wide, the decision has been made to use the Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating and MSCI ESG Rating. Since S IMMO is currently no longer among the companies rated by MSCI, the company is focusing solely on the Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating. S IMMO was able to further improve this rating from 15.0 to 12.2 as a result of implemented measures and expanded reporting. As a result, it continues to be classified as \"low risk\" and is among the top 20% in an industry comparison and among the top 5% of all rated companies.\n\nAt the EPRA sBPR Awards 2023, S IMMO was honoured with bronze for its non-financial reporting for the second year in a row. Furthermore, S IMMO benefits from closer cooperation with CPI, as it is now an explicit part of CPI's consolidated CDP reporting, in which the Group achieved a B score in 2023.\n\n# **ESG risk management**\n\nSince September 2022, a comprehensive ESG risk management process has been established and the ESG risks have been fully integrated in all of the company's risk management processes. In terms of processes and contents, environmental, social and governance risks are handled in the same way as all other risks. Consideration of the double materiality plays an important role here, as both risks that have an impact on the company from outside and risks that may have an impact on the environment and other stakeholders from within the company as a result of its business activities are assessed.\n\nDetails of the material ESG risks and the measures for identifying, assessing, preventing and mitigating them are described in the separate risk management report starting on page 104 of the Group management report in the annual report.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Environment**\n\nConsideration of environmental aspects has been an integral part of S IMMO's strategic and operational activities for many years. In order to formalise a more responsible interaction with the environment, concrete environmental goals were defined that pursue, among other things, the reduction of energy and water consumption as well as the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. These environmental goals, which are anchored in the ESG strategy, also reflect the results of the materiality analysis conducted in 2021. With the involvement of various stakeholder groups, the following environmental topics were identified as material:\n\n- Climate change adaptation\n- Energy consumption and use of resources\n- Renewable energy sources\n- Sustainable operation of buildings\n- Maintenance, repair, modernisation and renovation\n- Sustainable mobility\n\nIn the reporting year, S IMMO aligned its ESG strategy together with CPI and Immofinanz, resulting in adjustments to individual goals. The year 2019 was also defined as the common baseline year for environmental targets. You can find out more on page 6. The Management Board of S IMMO is responsible for compliance with the goals set out in the ESG strategy. From an operational perspective, there is a portfolio-wide division of labour between S IMMO, CPI and Immofinanz. For example, the implementation of environmental measures to ensure resourceefficient building operations in Austria, Germany and Croatia is the direct responsibility of S IMMO and, in particular, the asset and property management teams there. S IMMO's properties in Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary are primarily managed by local CPI experts. The properties acquired in the Wienerberg district of Vienna in the reporting year are managed jointly by S IMMO and Immofinanz.\n\nThis close cooperation benefits not only from the joint ESG strategy, but also from the further standardisation of processes and systems between the three companies in the reporting year. In 2023, the Environmental Impact Reporting Directive was adopted by all three companies and also approved by the Management Board of S IMMO. This directive regulates the mandatory annual measurement of all relevant environmental indicators, including the necessary data collection and validation processes. It also includes annual reporting and the consideration of relevant regulatory requirements. CPI's centralised and digital environmental data management system is used for this purpose. A Group-wide solution was also found to implement the requirements for joint, modern climate risk management, which builds directly and seamlessly on S IMMO's previous work and the software program it had selected.\n\nThanks to the close cooperation, S IMMO was able to further expand the reported environmental indicators. For the first time, all relevant Scope 3 categories of greenhouse gas emissions can be reported, thus providing a complete overview of the company's carbon footprint, including a comparison with the base year 2019 now standardised Group-wide. This footprint is to be successively reduced through ongoing and property-level energy monitoring, operational optimisation measures and other measures such as increasing the proportion of renewable energy sources and modernising buildings in line with the environmental goals. The cross-company cooperation within the Group and the joint strategy should continue to make a decisive contribution to this.\n\n# **Boundaries on environmental key figures**\n\nThe key performance figures reported in this section relate to the group of fully consolidated companies of S IMMO (annual report from page 125) and follow the operational control approach. Shares accounted for using the equity method are only taken into account when calculating greenhouse gas emissions under the category Investments.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, S IMMO's property portfolio, which includes lettable buildings, owner-operated hotels, development projects and land banks, consisted of 244 properties (2022: 364) with a gross leasable area of around 1.5 million m² (2022: 1.4 million m²). Based on book value, properties in Austria accounted for 22.0% (2022: 14.5%) of the portfolio, while properties in Germany accounted for 15.7% (2022: 38.3%). Properties in CEE made up 62.3% of the portfolio (2022: 47.2%). Looking at the portfolio broken down by main type of use not including plots of land and based on book values, offices accounted for 67.2% (2022: 56.5%), retail properties for 19.4% (2022: 12.2%), residential properties for 6.1% (2022: 25.2%) and hotels for 7.3% (2022: 6.1%) as of 31 December 2023.\n\nThe property-related consumption and emissions data in this section refers to the entire real estate portfolio of S IMMO. Acquisitions and sales during the year are included on a monthly \n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\nbasis for key indicators such as energy consumption. The three buildings held by associates and joint ventures and accounted for using the equity method, which are therefore not fully consolidated, are only taken into account when calculating greenhouse gas emissions under the category Investments. The reference value of property-related environmental indicators is the reference gross leasable area. This includes – besides the gross leasable area of the properties that were part of the portfolio for the entire year – the gross leasable area of buildings that were acquired or sold during the year, normalised on a monthly basis, so that the area corresponds proportionately to the number of months relevant for reporting.\n\nAs part of the closer cooperation with CPI, the resulting standardisation of calculation methods and ongoing quality control, there may be changes to the previous year's figures.\n\nAt the end of this section of the non-financial report, you will find tables with details on the EU Taxonomy key performance indicators, the environmental key figures and the EPRA Sustainability Performance Measures.\n\n# **Implementation of the EU Taxonomy**\n\nWith the EU Taxonomy Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2020/852), the European Union has created a standardised set of rules for classifying environmentally sustainable economic activities. Economic activities should substantially support one or more defined environmental objectives and not negatively impact any of the others (Do No Significant Harm principle, DNSH).\n\nSince the reporting year 2021, S IMMO has been required to disclose the economic activities classified as taxonomy-eligible in accordance with the regulation in the form of the share in turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx) these activities account for. Taxonomy-eligible means in this case that an economic activity has been defined in the delegated acts of the EU Taxonomy and thus comes under the regulation's sphere of influence. Starting with the reporting year 2022, S IMMO discloses taxonomy-aligned economic activities, i.e. sustainable activities in accordance with the environmental objectives and technical assessment criteria of the taxonomy.\n\nAll disclosures are made on the basis of the current interpretation of the legal situation and the EU Taxonomy FAQ. Because the legal situation remains dynamic, S IMMO adopts a conservative approach in its declaration of taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic activities.\n\n# Determination of taxonomy alignment\n\nS IMMO has identified the economic activities \"acquisition and ownership of buildings\" (CCM 7.7) and \"hotels, holiday, camping grounds and similar accommodation\" (BIO 2.1) in general as well as \"installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment\" (CCM 7.3) only for CapEx as relevant and taxonomy-eligible, which avoids possible double counting. BIO 2.1 and CCM 7.3 are reported for the first time for 2023 and were not applicable in the previous year.\n\nWith its taxonomy-eligible economic activities CCM 7.3 and 7.7, S IMMO pursues the environmental goal of \"climate change mitigation\", thus double counting is avoided in this respect as well. In order to determine taxonomy alignment for the economic activity \"acquisition and ownership of buildings\" and the significant contribution to the environmental goal \"climate change mitigation\", several factors were taken into account to ensure alignment with the requirements of the EU Taxonomy and its criteria.\n\nS IMMO fundamentally ensures the minimum safeguards required by the EU Taxonomy. The topics of human rights, anticorruption, taxes and fair competition are covered by organisational policies, processes and grievance mechanisms, and employees are trained annually. Furthermore, there were no known violations of the policies or laws in the reporting year. For more details, please refer to the Governance section from page 50 onwards. Information on the gender pay gap is provided on page 48, while details on the gender diversity of the management bodies can be found on page 22 in the annual report. S IMMO is not involved in the manufacture or sale of controversial weapons.\n\nWith regard to the technical screening criteria relevant to the economic activity \"acquisition and ownership of buildings\" under the environmental goal \"climate change mitigation\", the buildings of S IMMO were checked individually for the date of the application for a construction permit and the existence of a valid Class A energy performance certificate, if possible based on the primary energy efficiency. If a class A energy performance certificate is available and the building is a non-residential building, the nominal capacity of the HVAC systems (heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration) was recorded and, if the threshold value of 290 kW was exceeded, the efficient operation within the meaning of the EU Taxonomy was verified. Czech buildings were analysed on the basis of a corresponding study to determine whether they belong to the top 15% of the national building stock in terms of energy efficiency in operation. If so, this replaced the requirement for a class A energy performance certificate, with the remaining criteria also having to be met.\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition, a climate risk assessment of all buildings in the S IMMO portfolio was carried out at the beginning of 2023 on the basis of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP). The RCPs, which were developed by scientists, describe scenarios for different increases in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and their amplifying effect on climate change. The climate risk assessment was carried out in accordance with the Representative Concentration Pathways RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 in order to avoid significant negative impacts. More information on this can be found in the risk management report starting on page 104 in the annual report. For properties that were only purchased in the course of 2023, the climate risk assessments of CPI and Immofinanz were used where necessary.\n\nIn total for the year 2023, S IMMO has identified 17 buildings (2022: 5) that currently meet the general and specific criteria according to the economic activity \"acquisition and ownership of buildings\". They consist of eight commercial properties in Bratislava, Brno, Bucharest, Hradec Králové, Mladá Boleslav, Prague and Vienna as well as a residential building in Leipzig that has since been sold. These buildings all have a Class A energy performance certificate or are in the top 15% of the national building stock in terms of energy efficiency in operation and the application for a construction permit was submitted before 31 December 2020. If HVAC systems with a nominal capacity of more than 290 kW are installed, they are operated efficiently, although in some cases the identification of efficiency losses and opportunities for energy efficiency improvements is regularly carried out by the local technicians and not automatically by the building services. The Czech properties are covered by CPI's ISO 50001-certified energy management system.\n\nThe Bucharest location is fundamentally affected by the chronic physical risks of heat stress and water stress. According to the company's assessment, the building's operation in its current use is not significantly impaired even if the water availability is reduced but not permanently heavily restricted. First response fire protection, for example by sprinkler systems, is ensured even if the water supply is interrupted. The direct impact of the climate risk of heat stress on the buildings is significantly greater, but the cooling capacity of the HVAC systems installed in the five Bucharest properties is considered sufficient for a foreseeable rise in temperature in the coming years, as evidenced by the building documentation. A building in Brno shows an increased, relevant flood risk. This is countered with a bundle of measures consisting of an emergency plan, the provision of sandbags on site and the contracting of an external service provider for flood protection. In total, 17 properties thus form the scope of the key performance indicators for taxonomy alignment under economic activity CCM 7.7.\n\nAdditionally, the investment in the chiller of another building in Vienna in 2023 fulfils the requirements for the economic activity \"installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment\" and is therefore explicitly reported only in the CapEx indicators under CCM 7.3. The economic activity \"hotels, holiday, camping grounds and similar accommodation\" is currently not taxonomy-aligned, which is why BIO 2.1 is only reported as taxonomy-eligible.\n\n# Determination of the EU Taxonomy indicators\n\nStarting out from the total revenues recognised in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, the taxonomy-eligible turnover consists of the rental income and revenues from operating costs that S IMMO generates in the course of renting out its properties as well as revenue from its hotel operations.\n\nThe basis for the capital expenditure (CapEx) in accordance with IFRS that is considered is provided by all additions to properties, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (before deprecation, amortisation, revaluations and impairments), including additions resulting from acquisitions. In terms of taxonomy eligibility, this relates to the purchase of buildings and capitalisations directly associated with existing buildings at S IMMO, including both operated hotels.\n\nThe relevant categories for determining the taxonomy-eligible operating expenses (OpEx) consist of direct, non-capitalised costs of research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leasing, maintenance and repairs as well as all other direct expenses in connection with the daily maintenance of property, plant and equipment. For S IMMO, only maintenance costs related to its property portfolio in accordance with IFRS are of material importance. S IMMO does not conduct any research and development. Short-term leasing is carried out only to an extremely limited extent and is thus not taken into consideration. The maintenance expenditure associated with existing buildings is therefore classified as taxonomy-eligible.\n\nTurnover, CapEx and OpEx are always considered taxonomyaligned if the taxonomy-eligible proportions of turnover, CapEx and OpEx are attributable to the 17 buildings classified as taxonomy-aligned. None of the taxonomy-aligned amounts are for own use. The taxonomy-aligned shares of turnover, CapEx and OpEx all increased year-on-year in 2023. The tables with the EU Taxonomy key performance indicators can be found from page 19 onwards. For further information on the underlying financial figures, please refer to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report (from page 116) and the related notes (from page 123).\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Use of resources**\n\nS IMMO is convinced that its business activities are compatible with environmentally conscious behaviour. That is why the company attaches great importance to handling the resources and raw materials it uses sparingly and carefully. This includes energy sources and water especially in the operation of the buildings on the one hand, but also raw materials and local land use and biodiversity on the other. Moreover, waste management and the offer of sustainable mobility solutions are topics that S IMMO actively addresses in the course of its activities.\n\n# Energy management\n\nBy their nature, the construction and operation of buildings are very energy-intensive – and this is also true of the S IMMO portfolio. The high global energy consumption contributes significantly to global warming and thus to climate change. In particular, the use of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas has a negative impact on the climate, as they release large amounts of greenhouse gases when burned. The associated rise in the average global temperature has scientifically proven negative impacts on humans and the environment. These include, for example, the rise in sea levels, the increase in extreme weather events such as heat waves and droughts, but also flooding due to precipitation events, as well as the loss of biodiversity and negative impacts on human health.\n\nThe company strives, both for its existing properties and for project developments, to find solutions to keep energy consumption, and thus also the operating costs for its tenants, as low as possible. In this regard, the Group-wide ESG strategy defined the goal of reducing the energy intensity of the buildings by 10% by 2030 compared to 2019. S IMMO's local teams and service providers, which also include CPI and Immofinanz, are instructed to take into account a catalogue of measures for the quick identification and implementation of optimisation and savings measures in their daily work with the individual buildings. Furthermore, in its cooperation with CPI, S IMMO benefits from the fact that most of the Czech buildings in the S IMMO portfolio are covered by CPI's ISO 50001-certified energy management system. This is to be extended to the Slovak properties in 2024, and the addition of further countries is currently under review.\n\nActual energy consumption – consisting of heating demand and electricity consumption – in the buildings managed by S IMMO is almost exclusively dependent on tenant behaviour and is therefore largely outside the company's direct control. However, S IMMO can influence the energy efficiency of buildings to a certain extent through structural measures in the course of maintenance and modernisation, including for example by upgrading building services, replacing the heating system or optimising the insulation, and therefore takes these into account in development projects and the energy and structural refurbishment of existing properties.\n\nWhen looking at energy management, it generally has to be noted that S IMMO is not able in every case to make the decision on the use of energy sources. In principle, it is responsible as the landlord for purchasing energy sources to meet the respective heating demand of the entire building, where it subsequently charges the costs on to the tenants. However, there are several exceptions, especially in Germany in the case of gas heating, where the tenants themselves obtain their heating supplies and consequently do not have to provide S IMMO with consumption information. S IMMO therefore endeavours to contribute to lower energy consumption by its tenants at least indirectly by increasing the energy efficiency of the buildings.\n\nIt is also the case in almost every Austrian and German property that S IMMO purchases electricity only for the common areas in the buildings. The areas exclusively for tenants are supplied through the tenants' own contracts. Here, too, there is no obligation on their part to provide information to S IMMO as the landlord. In CEE, S IMMO is – apart from a few exceptional cases – the sole contracting partner of the local utility companies and thus responsible for the entire energy procurement.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the allocation of costs to the tenants as part of service charge reconciliations, when entering into supply contracts S IMMO always pays attention to relevant cost and competition factors, in addition to the energy mix, in order to maintain conformity with the market.\n\nNatural gas and district heating, and in isolated cases also liquefied petroleum gas and heat pumps, are used in the properties of S IMMO to cover the heating demand. At the end of 2023, one building was still heated with heating oil by the tenant. All other properties of this kind were successfully converted to other heat sources or sold.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe electricity demand on the landlord's side for the property portfolio in Austria and for Germany has been largely covered since 2020 by purchased electricity from 100% renewable sources (solar energy, hydropower and wind energy as well as biofuels). Together with Immofinanz and the CPI subsidiary GSG Berlin, contracts were concluded in the reporting year for the procurement of electricity from 2024 for the properties on the Wienerberg and S IMMO's entire German portfolio. Not only will electricity be sourced exclusively from 100% renewable sources, but in both cases S IMMO is also utilising power purchase agreements (PPA) for the first time to cover significant portions of the agreed purchase volumes. In the course of 2021, the buildings in Croatia, Romania and Slovakia were switched to the purchase of electricity purely from sustainable sources, followed by Hungarian properties in 2022.\n\nIn 2023, 91.2% of the electricity purchased by S IMMO (2022: 95.6%) came from 100% renewable sources. The original goal of switching to 100% renewable sources across the entire portfolio by the end of 2022 was standardised as part of the Groupwide strategy adjustment to the end of 2024. The Group is also working on implementing the procurement of this type of electricity in the Czech Republic, but this has not yet been achieved. With regard to S IMMO's acquisitions in the Czech Republic, this circumstance must be taken into account in terms of key figures. For contractual reasons, it is also not currently possible to switch to electricity from 100% renewable sources for one property in Austria. In addition to external electricity procurement, existing properties are also gradually being equipped with photovoltaic systems, in order to offer the possibility for buildings to have their own, independent electricity supply. For this purpose, three photovoltaic systems in Bratislava with a total output of 299 kWp (kilowatt peak) were commissioned in 2023.\n\nIn the reporting year, S IMMO launched a pilot project for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for the automated optimisation of energy consumption. In this project, the individual elements of the building services in a commercial property in Vienna are linked together via software and controlled independently using an algorithm based on weather data and other parameters. S IMMO hopes to be able to apply the experience gained from this project to other buildings. In 2022, digital consumption meters, known as smart meters, were installed in the vast majority of German properties and connected to the IT infrastructure, where the aim is to record energy data in near real time and to be able to take corrective action when necessary and consequently optimise consumption. Both the ongoing conversion to renewable energy sources and the digitalisation of the properties contribute to more resource conservation in the operation of the buildings and consequently in improving the carbon footprint of S IMMO (for more details on this, please see from page 16).\n\nThe buildings' energy data required for the calculation of key figures is recorded by the respective internal and external property managers, managed centrally and, when necessary, harmonised for analysis by using conversion factors from the local utility companies. Consumption is considered to be within the organisation if it is based on procurement by S IMMO and cannot be allocated exclusively to tenant areas. Consumption that can be attributed exclusively to tenant spaces is considered to be outside the organisation, even if it is procured by S IMMO. Together with the disclosures on energy consumption when obtained directly by tenants, the energy data now represents the entire consumption outside the organisation in accordance with categories 3 and 13 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (see page 18). The energy consumption of the buildings is thus covered in its entirety.\n\nAs tenants who purchase their own energy are not required to disclose their consumption, the disclosures relating to this consumption are based almost exclusively on projections on the basis of actual consumption in comparable buildings in the company's portfolio as well as standard industry benchmarks at building level. Adapted to the type and size of the property, these benchmarks originate primarily from publications of the Bundesinstitut für Bau-, Stadt- und Raumforschung (BBSR – Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development), the German Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development (now the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport) and the German Energy Agency (dena).\n\nIn some cases, exact figures were not yet available for consumption on the part of S IMMO for this reporting year. These have also been extrapolated accordingly or comparable figures from the previous year were used. As the office areas that S IMMO uses itself are all located in properties in the company's portfolio, there was no need for an additional disclosure of this consumption, as it is already included. Significant consumption of fuels from renewable sources or the commercial sale of energy do not take place. Any consumption of cooling energy and steam is contained in the data on electricity and district heating and is not recorded separately.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\nMoreover, the energy data within the organisation also includes consumption by the Group's own vehicle fleet based on fuel consumption. Energy consumption outside the organisation, which is not related to properties owned by S IMMO, is not considered to be directly relevant from an energy management standpoint and is therefore not calculated. Instead, greenhouse gas emissions are recorded as the aim is to reduce the carbon footprint in this area. For more information on this, please see page 17. For an overview of the energy consumption related solely to S IMMO's property portfolio, the EPRA Sustainability Performance Measures are provided starting on page 31.\n\nCompared to the calendar year 2022, a noticeable reduction in energy intensity per net revenue was recorded across all countries in the reporting year. The intensity in relation to gross leasable area has remained constant at portfolio level.\n\n# Water management\n\nS IMMO is aware that a sufficient water supply, safe drinking water and the protection of ecosystems through appropriate sanitation facilities and equipment are material topics for the company. The company therefore ensures that employees and tenants are supplied with clean water throughout its entire property portfolio, both in property development and in property management. Water is supplied to and discharged from the properties through connections to the municipal water networks, and these processes are thus subject to the local regulations as well as requirements within the European Union.\n\nAttention is paid here to proportionate and economical use of water as a resource, especially since a large proportion of S IMMO's properties in Germany and Romania are located in an area with increased or high water stress according to the Group's own science-based climate risk assessment based on the Representative Concentration Pathways and are therefore exposed to the risk of potential water scarcity. Water stress occurs when water consumption exceeds the amount of water available in a region. Specifically, this affects properties in the cities of Berlin, Bremen, Erfurt, Halle (Saale), Kiel, Leipzig, Potsdam, Rostock and Weimar, as well as Bucharest and, in the previous year, the property in Puchheim, which has since been sold.\n\nThe operation of the properties does not involve any major water usage or water storage on an industrial scale and thus also does not trigger any impacts caused by process water. Nevertheless, in the future S IMMO will endeavour to monitor the use of water even more closely and to consult with its stakeholders. In this regard, the Group-wide ESG strategy has set a target to reduce water intensity by 10% by 2030 compared to 2019. The planned installation of digital main water meters and watersaving fittings should play a central role in this.\n\nIn almost all its properties, ensuring the overall water supply from the local utility companies is the responsibility of S IMMO. Only in a few properties is water obtained partly or directly by tenants on the basis of their own contracts, where there is no obligation for them to provide information to S IMMO. The data for the water consumption of the properties is recorded in parallel with the energy data at building level, transmitted by the property managers, consolidated on a central basis and evaluated at portfolio level. Recognising and responding to irregularities that can be attributed to increased consumption, for example as a result of a leak, forms part of the responsibilities of the local property management and service providers of the properties. This also includes the identification of water saving opportunities and the implementation of corresponding measures, for which S IMMO has created and communicated instructions to its service providers.\n\nIn order to ensure consistent comparability, the water consumption of the few properties in which the water is procured by the tenants is also included in the key figures. As accurate data is not continuously available in these cases because there is no obligation on the part of the tenants to provide this information, it has been extrapolated using the actual consumption of comparable properties in the portfolio after being adjusted to the size of the property in question. An extrapolation of this kind was also carried out in the few cases where no accurate figures were yet available for the consumption on the part of S IMMO.\n\nWater intensity fell in 2023 compared to the previous year, both in terms of net revenue and gross leasable area. This also applies in particular to the German and Romanian locations at material water risk.\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Raw materials and waste management\n\nResources are committed and waste of various kinds is produced over a long period during the construction and operating phases of properties. S IMMO is aware of its central role and responsibility here and takes steps to reduce the negative impacts to the minimum possible level. With the transition to the circular economy, S IMMO sees general potential for optimisation and an industry-wide need for action in this area. The company has therefore set itself the goal of checking the recyclability and circularity of the building materials it uses for future project developments and full refurbishments. In addition to reducing noise and dust pollution for residents, effective construction site waste management, the safe handling of dangerous substances and short transportation distances are also key priorities. Where necessary, professional disposal of waste or treatment of contaminated sites is agreed by means of framework construction contracts. Efforts are made to exclude contaminated sites by performing thorough location analyses during acquisitions.\n\nAs part of the Group-wide ESG strategy, a waste recycling rate of 55% by the end of 2025 and an increase in this rate to 60% by 2030 were defined as goals in addition to the elimination of waste sent to landfill wherever possible. In this report, S IMMO is reporting the relevant portfolio-wide waste streams from property operations for the first time. In doing so, it is drawing on the support of CPI, which has many years of experience in this area. As no complete real data is available for properties in Austria and Germany in particular, extrapolations based on comparable property portfolios and local waste data within the CPI portfolio were used in the event of data gaps. In future, waste volumes and streams are to be recorded and subsequently monitored on a portfolio-wide and software-based basis for each property, similar to energy consumption data.\n\nThe total amount of waste generated in 2023 fell slightly compared to the previous year, with the proportion of non-recycled waste increasing primarily due to the acquisition of Hungarian properties, which is attributable to the very low local recycling rate.\n\nIn its own office premises, S IMMO attaches great importance to waste separation and avoidance and, in addition to the use of environmentally friendly paper, also utilises intelligent follow-me printer technology with minimal toner consumption.\n\n# Biodiversity and land use\n\nIn view of climate change and biodiversity loss, S IMMO is engaged in the issues of biodiversity and land use. The greening of open spaces, building facades and roof areas serves in the urban area to create a more pleasant microclimate and reduces heat and noise inside and also in the immediate vicinity of the building. Because the properties enjoy a central location and because of the very high-density development of the plots of land, S IMMO's properties have few areas that are suitable for greening. It is planned to expand greening projects, taking economic viability into consideration, with the enhanced attractiveness for the users of the buildings also playing an important role. Extensive green areas around and on the buildings have been considered from the outset in the development projects currently planned in Bratislava and Budapest.\n\nIn times of increasing soil sealing in the course of ever more high-density developments, property construction projects on sites that are already sealed, known as brownfield developments, are gaining importance. These contrast with greenfield developments, where construction on areas that were previously totally undeveloped produces additional sealing of the soil. The result of soil sealing is that rainwater can no longer drain away, which in turn increases the risk of flooding. Moreover, these areas boost the rise in temperatures in the summer, as sealed ground surfaces heat up more than planted areas.\n\nAll S IMMO's current building developments are located in urban areas in capital cities in CEE, and the majority of them are on previously developed sites, which means the company is not contributing to significant additional soil sealing. The only exception to these brownfield developments is a project on an inner-city meadow site in Bratislava. In order to reduce the negative impacts, the property is being planned with a partially greened façade and extensive roof greening. S IMMO does not have any completely greenfield developments, meaning additional land use outside of urban zones, in its portfolio. In addition, possible soil desealing measures for existing properties are to be continuously examined and implemented where possible.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs part of the land bank in the areas surrounding Berlin, S IMMO manages approximately 240 ha of land area, including forests and meadows. Some of these areas are located in nature and water conservation areas in the state of Brandenburg. All the areas are managed in accordance with the applicable regulations and in harmony with nature. No properties are being developed or operated in these areas. Having plots in a land bank is a long-term investment that could provide areas for later development if they are zoned in a different way and a legally valid land use plan is produced in this connection. S IMMO is not planning any developments of its own in these areas.\n\n# Mobility\n\nIn addition to the development and operation of buildings, the theme of sustainable mobility also plays an essential role for S IMMO in many respects, as the greenhouse gas emissions caused by travel also have direct impacts on the environment and climate change. Here the company can exercise direct control over the Group's own vehicle fleet as well as national and international business trips on the one hand, while, on the other, a positive influence can be exerted on the commuting and travel behaviour of employees, tenants and other users of the properties, meaning that negative environmental impacts can be minimised.\n\nS IMMO's vehicle fleet consists of company cars and pool vehicles. As of 31 December 2023, it included a total of 16 vehicles (2022: 17) at locations in Germany and Austria, which are managed and maintained by local management. The size and cost of the vehicles are adapted to their respective purpose, and procurement has been subject to a separate organisational policy with a focus on electromobility since 2022. The distribution of the German property portfolio across several cities separated in some cases by a large distance requires a degree of flexibility that, in the company's opinion, can best be guaranteed by having a corporate fleet of its own. Several office bicycles have additionally been bought for short business journeys. The fleet is managed using management software and mobile applications.\n\nIn addition to journeys using the company's own vehicles, various kinds of business trips are necessary at all locations. The local on-site management of the properties requires a large number of short journeys, which can mainly be completed using public transport, although private cars may be needed in some cases. The Vienna location plays a special role here, as the portfolio and development projects in the CEE countries are covered from here and the aeroplane thus represents a frequently used means of transport. The company's travel policy explicitly encourages employees not to travel when it is not absolutely necessary and to hold online meetings instead or to travel by train where possible. For flights, only seats in economy class are booked in principle, although an exception is made for intercontinental flights. A greater need for international travel by plane also arises at the hotel operating companies in Vienna and Budapest as a result of their involvement in roadshows.\n\nKilometres travelled are recorded on a local basis by the individual S IMMO locations. An accurate record of the kilometres travelled is not always possible, especially when employees use a private car, taxi or public transport. Therefore, the data also contains estimates based on the average travel patterns of the employees in question, which comprise routes and frequency. The kilometres travelled are directly included in S IMMO's greenhouse gas emissions accounting.\n\nIn 2023, travelling was reduced by around 20% compared to the previous year. In the coming years, S IMMO will also try – as far as the current projects allow – to increase the use of more fuelefficient and public means of transport and to keep travel activity to a necessary minimum by using new forms of communication technology.\n\nFor 2023, S IMMO once again conducted a voluntary survey on the commuting behaviour of its employees at all locations and will continue this practice every two years in the future. The survey includes questions on the average commuting distance and the means of transport primarily used for this. The results are extrapolated on a country-specific basis to the entire workforce, with the hotel operating companies being excluded in accordance with the reporting approach. This data is also included in the greenhouse gas balance.\n\nFrom a Group-wide perspective, a number of different means of transport are used as a result of the different local circumstances and routes to the workplace. The company endeavours to actively encourage its employees to use environmentally friendly options for their commute. The central location of the workplaces featuring well-developed local public transport networks, cycle paths and footpaths is an important factor here. The reimbursement of the costs of discount cards and annual season \n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\ntickets for public transport and the creation of carpools are other measures that have already been implemented. In addition, the take-up of the offer to employees to work from home reduces the overall commuting distance.\n\nThe fact that the connection to the local public transport network is within walking distance is also an attractive benefit for the employees and the users of properties and helps to minimise the impact on the environment during operations. S IMMO therefore attaches special importance to the existing infrastructure for developments and acquisitions. Bike racks, showers and electric vehicle charging stations reinforce the incentive for more sustainable mobility among employees and visitors and are taken into consideration from the outset in new developments and when properties are modernised.\n\n# **Greenhouse gas emissions**\n\nS IMMO's efforts to reduce its own energy consumption and that of its tenants and where possible to cover the energy demand using renewable energy sources not only serve to increase energy efficiency, but also pursue the goal of reducing the carbon footprint related to the business activities. As climate change progresses, it poses new challenges for the economy and society and demands that companies live up to their responsibility in this respect. Not only the impacts of climate change on the company and its actions play a role here, but also the influence the company can exert on climate change. In this regard, S IMMO, together with CPI and Immofinanz, has defined in its Group-wide ESG strategy that the intensity of its property-related greenhouse gas emissions is to be reduced by 32.4% by 2030 compared to 2019. This total value for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 results from a goal validated for CPI as a whole by the Science Based Target initiative in July 2022, which is aligned with the well below 2°C scenario of the Paris Agreement. S IMMO is fully covered by this goal, but there is no validation explicitly only for S IMMO. An annual verification of the calculated carbon footprint is also carried out for CPI at Group level by an external company. Since the reporting year, S IMMO has also been subject to the Group-wide LCA policy together with CPI and Immofinanz. This policy stipulates that the global warming potential (GWP) must be calculated for project developments and full refurbishments of more than 5,000 m² and that a life cycle assessment (LCA) must be prepared for buildings with an area of more than 10,000 m².\n\nAs part of this goal adjustment, the base year was harmonised and changed for S IMMO from 2021 to 2019. In the reporting year, great attention was therefore paid to obtaining consistently comparable, meaningful and quality-assured data for the new base year, even if this was a long time ago.\n\nIn the context of double materiality, i.e. the mutual influences of climate and business activities on each other, S IMMO utilises, on the one hand, science-based and software-aided climate risk management with reference to the requirements of the EU Taxonomy and the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) see risk management report starting on page 109 in the annual report) and, on the other hand, once again expanded the calculation of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with its activities. This now includes all Scope 3 categories considered material. Following the recommendations of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) and in accordance with the operational control approach, the basic scope of the reporting for this carbon accounting is formed by the group of fully consolidated companies of S IMMO (see annual report from page 125).\n\nWith regard to the energy consumption of the property portfolio, this means that only the energy and refrigerants purchased by S IMMO and not directly attributable to tenants are included in the calculation of direct and indirect emissions in accordance with Scope 1 and Scope 2 of the GHG Protocol. Energy and refrigerant consumption that is directly and exclusively procured or used by the tenants is considered as Scope 3 emissions, as there is no operational control in accordance with the reporting approach. All emission values are calculated in CO2 equivalents and on the basis of the collected energy and water consumption data, waste data and refrigerant leakages as well as the kilometres travelled for business or commuting purposes and relevant expenditures. Other greenhouse gases are not shown on an itemised basis in light of the existing data. As biomass is not burned to any significant extent, no biogenic greenhouse gas emissions are recorded. As a result of the cooperation with CPI and Immofinanz, there has been a significant change in the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions in this report compared to previous years. In order to ensure Group-wide comparability, the emission factors previously used by S IMMO have been replaced by those of CPI, and all reported years have been calculated using these new emission factors. These are provided by the University Centre for Energy Efficient Buildings\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n(UCEEB) of the Czech Technical University in Prague and the company CI3, s.r.o. on the basis of renowned sources.\n\n# Direct and indirect energy-related emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2)\n\nS IMMO's direct greenhouse gas emissions under Scope 1 of the GHG Protocol arise on the one hand through the operation of the property portfolio and, on the other, as a result of the use of the Group's own vehicle fleet. The crucial factor here is that greenhouse gas emissions are released directly when fuel is consumed or when there is a refrigerant leakage. In the operation of buildings, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas and heating oil are used as fossil fuel sources alongside various refrigerants. The company's own vehicles with internal combustion engines use petrol and diesel fuels.\n\nIn the case of S IMMO, supplying the properties with electricity and district heating is the driver of the indirect energy-related emissions where energy is purchased externally and emissions arise in the course of this driver. In addition, the company's own electric and hybrid vehicles are also supplied with electricity. The GHG Protocol divides these Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions into location-based and market-based emissions. The emission factors of the respective overall local or national energy network are used as the basis here for calculating the location-based emissions of the energy consumption. The market-based emissions, in contrast, take into consideration contractual agreements between companies and utility companies and thus also specific emission factors that are guaranteed to the users by the utility companies. As S IMMO attaches great importance to renewable sources as the origin when purchasing electricity and regards this as a significant contribution to strengthening a sustainable energy network, the emissions from the consumption of electricity and district heating are calculated using both the location-based and the market-based method. The difference, in S IMMO's opinion, corresponds to an active saving of greenhouse gas emissions as a result of its deliberate choice of renewable energy sources.\n\nWhere possible based on information from local utility companies, electricity from 100% renewable sources is regarded as carbon-neutral for the calculation of the market-based emissions and, in addition, an emission factor of the utility company is applied to district heating obtained. On account of the lack of binding commitments on the part of the utilities, the locationbased country-specific emission factors are used for all other market-based calculations.\n\n# Other indirect emissions (Scope 3)\n\nFor the calculation of the other indirect greenhouse gas emissions, the Scope 3 emissions, the upstream and downstream supply chains of a company are evaluated for their relevance for the company's own emissions inventory. As part of the standardisation of the ESG strategy, S IMMO has classified the following ten out of a total of 15 categories pursuant to the GHG Protocol as material:\n\n- Category 1 Purchased goods and services\n- Category 2 Capital goods\n- Category 3 Fuel and energy-related activities\n- Category 4 Upstream transportation and distribution\n- Category 5 Waste generated in operations\n- Category 6 Business traveling\n- Category 7 Employee commuting\n- Category 11 Use of sold products\n- Category 13 Downstream leased assets\n- Category 15 Investments\n\nCompared to previous years, this selection is significantly broader and, at the company's discretion, now covers all categories that are material to S IMMO, whereby S IMMO also benefits from CPI's necessary expertise.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe figures for categories 1, 2 and 4 are based on the company's expenditure associated with the category names, whereby CPI data was used and extrapolated with adjustments for S IMMO due to inconsistent data availability. The energy data included in categories 3, 11 and 13 comprises the properties of all fully consolidated companies, whereby these categories also reflect energy and refrigerant consumption exclusively by tenants. Category 5 includes the waste generated by the properties owned by S IMMO. The travel and commuting activities of employees are recorded in categories 6 and 7. Category 15 covers the consumption of the three buildings accounted for using the equity method.\n\nIn the case of energy-related emissions, the calculations of the Scope 3 emissions distinguish between the location-based and the market-based approach in order to be able to show the positive effects on building operations when tenants choose renewable energy sources, and thus to further incentivise the societywide transition to green energy. The property-related Scope 3 emissions were consequently calculated using the emission factors specified under Scope 1 and Scope 2.\n\nGreenhouse gas intensity was significantly reduced in 2023 compared to both the previous year and the base year 2019. This applies to both location- and market-based greenhouse gas emissions in relation to net revenue and gross leasable area.\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **EU Taxonomy key performance indicators**\n\n**Environment**\n\nProportion of turnover from products or services associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities – disclosure covering year 2023\n\n**Proportion of taxonomy-aligned (A.1.) or eligible (A.2.) turnover, year 2022 (18)**\n\n| Economic activities (1)                                                                                               | Code<br>(2) | Turnover<br>(3)<br>EUR m | Proportion<br>of<br>turnover,<br>year 2023<br>(4)<br>% | Climate<br>change<br>mitigation<br>(5)<br>Y; N; N/EL | Climate<br>change<br>adaptation<br>(6)<br>Y; N; N/EL | Water<br>(7)<br>Y; N; N/EL | Pollution<br>(8)<br>Y; N; N/EL | Circular<br>economy<br>(9)<br>Y; N; N/EL | Bio-<br>diversity<br>(10)<br>Y; N; N/EL |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| A.

The scope and boundaries of the data can be found in the section Environment in the non-financial report. All disclosures relate exclusively to the property portfolio of S IMMO and cover 100% of the buildings within the reporting boundaries. The like-for-like comparisons (LfL) include all buildings that were part of the S IMMO portfolio in the last two reporting years. The gross leasable area was used as the metric for the calculation of the intensity ratios. As the calculation approach of the EPRA Sustainability Performance Measures within the CPI Group differs slightly from that of the other environmental key figures in this report, there may be deviations in individual key figures.\n\n| Impact area                 | EPRA Code                       | Unit             | Indicator                       | Austria          |

employer but also a provider of real estate that meets people's basic need for space to live and work. This mission gives rise to a particularly close relationship with and responsibility to our community at large. This responsibility is also reflected in the material topics our stakeholders defined during the materiality analysis conducted in 2021.\n\nThe following material topics are explained in this section:\n\n- Diversity and equal opportunities\n- Employee satisfaction and employer attractiveness\n- Training\n- Tenant satisfaction\n\nThe first three topics deal with employees, who are the lifeblood of S IMMO. After all, highly qualified and satisfied employees are an essential factor for the success of any company. Respect, trust and mutual esteem are the key pillars of social interaction at S IMMO. Qualified employees are S IMMO's most important asset. The company attaches particular importance to providing the team with a motivating working environment as well as the personal scope for development and the ability to strike a healthy balance between work and family life. This promotes team spirit and fosters a feeling of solidarity. S IMMO supports an open corporate culture in which cooperation as well as the satisfaction and health of all employees are promoted at all levels.\n\nAttaining these goals requires effective personnel management spearheaded locally by the subsidiaries at the various locations. This approach enables local managing directors to react to the needs and challenges of their local teams and provide them with support in specific issues.\n\nAs already outlined in chapter \"ESG strategy and sustainability management\", S IMMO's ESG goals were consolidated with those of Immofinanz and CPI and harmonised into a Groupwide ESG strategy in 2023. This process also led to a consolidation of the goals and measures in the social area.\n\n# Scope of reporting on social key figures\n\nS IMMO has not changed the scope of its reporting regarding employee data but there were major changes in the key figures as at 31 December 2023 compared with the previous year. This is due to the fact that at the beginning of 2023, S IMMO managed to pool the strengths in Hungary and Romania in the respective CPI subsidiaries, which now provide services for S IMMO properties in Budapest and Bucharest. As part of this process, the employees of S IMMO Hungary and S IMMO Romania were almost completely taken on by the respective CPI subsidiaries during the first quarter. As a result, there were no longer any employees at these S IMMO subsidiaries at the end of the quarter. Employees who moved within the Group during the year are included in this non-financial report on a pro rata basis. In order to avoid double counting at consolidated Group level, they are only included in all remuneration-related data in the company in which they were last employed.\n\nWhen reference is made in the following to S IMMO, all employees in Austria, Germany and Croatia are included. In contrast to the previous year, Management Board members are not included in the employee figures, resulting in changes to the previous year's figures. The employees of the two owner-operated hotels – Vienna Marriott and Budapest Marriott – are not included in the social key figures (for details, please refer section \"Scope and boundaries of the report\" of this non-financial report). If a key figure does not include all of the previously mentioned locations, this is explicitly stated in each case.\n\nAt the end of this section of the non-financial report, you will find tables with details of the social key figures.\n\n# **Employees**\n\nIn 2023, S IMMO had employees in Austria, Germany and Croatia and, until the first quarter of 2023, in Hungary and Romania. The local teams also manage business activities in Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria. Responsibility for human resources activities and compliance with all country-specific and labour-law requirements lies with the relevant subsidiaries. Moreover, team size and structure and the focus of business activities vary, sometimes substantially, from subsidiary to subsidiary, which is why uniform standards and processes relating to HR issues have not been consistently implemented across the S IMMO Group to date. S IMMO values direct channels of communication and the most immediate possible exchange of information between employees and their supervisors.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\nS IMMO's employees are the manifestation of the company's comprehensive expertise and make a significant contribution to the company's success. The Group employed an annual average of 100 people (2022: 136) on a headcount basis, excluding members of the Management Board, dormant employees and trainees. Including hotel employees, but excluding members of the Management Board, dormant employees and trainees, the annual average number of employees totalled 611 (2022: 583).\n\n# Diversity, equal opportunities and inclusion\n\nDiversity, equal opportunities and integration are key competitive advantages and fundamental tenets at S IMMO. As an internationally operating group, S IMMO employs people from many different countries. The Group considers a wealth of languages and cultures to be an extremely valuable resource. People from different backgrounds and with different perspectives encourage creativity and innovation and play a role in reducing harassment, discrimination and prejudices and promoting social cohesion.\n\nA lack of diversity can have negative impacts on the company and its business relationships. For example, a shortage of employees from a variety of cultural backgrounds or with a variety of language skills can make the cooperation with business partners in other countries more difficult. Furthermore, companies that lack diversity can be more susceptible to discrimination and employees from different groups may not feel valued or, in the worst case, not comfortable or safe.\n\nS IMMO is committed in its Code of Conduct to providing a discrimination-free work environment characterised by mutual trust in which everyone is valued and treated with dignity and respect. All people are equal and therefore enjoy the same rights and the same protection. Any discrimination on the basis of ethnic origin or nationality, language, social origin, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, political or other belief, mental or physical ability or other status is prohibited at S IMMO. It is not least against this backdrop that S IMMO is committed to respecting, protecting and promoting international human rights. For details, please see page 52 onwards.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, employees learned about the content of the applicable Code of Conduct as part of an annual training session and were made aware, among other things, that incidents of discrimination can be reported to defined contact points within the company or anonymously via the established digital whistleblower system.\n\nNo cases of discrimination on the basis of ethnic origin or nationality, language, social origin, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, political or other belief, mental or physical ability or other status in accordance with the definitions of the international frameworks forming the basis of the Code of Conduct were reported in 2023 (2022: 0).\n\nIn Austria and Germany, employees have the option to indicate other genders in addition to \"male\" and \"female\" in the human resources management system. In the reporting year, no employees have made use of this option to date, which is why only the categories \"male\" and \"female\" are indicated in the presentation of the employee data. There is currently no legal basis in Croatia for specifying gender options that are not categorised as either female or male.\n\n#### **Share of women**\n\nS IMMO AG has set itself the goal of continuously increasing the proportion of women in management positions and is expressly committed to the advancement of women. As of 31 December 2023, the proportion of female employees in the entire workforce was 50.0% (2022: 53.8%). The proportion of women across all managers was 34.8%, meaning that the Group-wide goal of 33.0% women in management positions was achieved. Broken down by employee category, 50.0% of employees in top management and 31.6% of employees in middle management and entry-level management were female.\n\nS IMMO has harmonised the definition of its employee categories with CPI and Immofinanz, which contributes to a more detailed presentation of the gender distribution. These are as follows:\n\n- Top Management: Non-Board C-Level, Country Managers\n- Middle Management: Department Heads\n- Entry-Level Management: Team Leads, Staff Unit Leads\n- Non-Management Employees: All other\n\nApproaching existing female employees for vacant positions in a targeted manner and supporting the transition to management roles through individual training will be continued. In the reporting year, three vacant management positions at the Vienna location were filled by existing female employees who previously had no management responsibility. S IMMO has set itself the internal goal of a 50% share of women in management positions and the entire workforce.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Reconciling work and family life**\n\nS IMMO is committed to the idea that a positive work-life balance is a key factor in ensuring greater motivation and dedication as well as improved performance by employees. In addition, a good work-life balance contributes substantially to equal opportunities within the company. S IMMO strives to offer all employees flexible working hours, the chance to work from home and the option of personalised working and part-time work models, including in conjunction with study or training. Since April 2023, employees with all-in contracts at the Vienna location have been able to reduce overtime worked as part of a flexitime account. This means that more labour-intensive phases can be compensated with time off and employees gain flexibility – an important step towards a healthy work-life balance. Moreover, paternal leave and sabbaticals are also supported, as are various schemes to simplify re-entry into the workplace after parental leave. These opportunities are positively viewed and very well received by S IMMO employees.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, 20.0% of staff members were employed on a part-time basis (2022: 18.5%), of whom 65.0% were women (2022: 75.0%. Correction of the 2022 figure). At the end of 2023, 100 employees were entitled to parental leave, of whom 50 were women and 50 were men (2022: 127, of which 67 women and 60 men). A total of 3 employees were on parental leave as of the reporting date of 31 December 2023, all of them women (2022: five women). In the 2023 reporting year, parental leave ended for 6 employees (five women and one man), of whom three returned to work after completing their parental leave (2022: one man). The other employees were transferred to Immofinanz as a result of the optimisation of the organisational structure mentioned above. The return to work rate is therefore 100%, or 50% if the analysis is limited to S IMMO AG (two women and one man).\n\nIt is particularly important for S IMMO that employees' families are also involved in various events. Children are happy when they get to know their parents' workplace, spouses and family members gain an understanding of the business model and contact between families strengthens team spirit and promotes identification with the company. A variety of events are organised in order to continuously encourage a feeling of togetherness. In Austria, these include an annual summer festival, to which families are also sometimes invited, a Christmas party, team excursions and joint participation in events such as the Business Run in Vienna.\n\n# Labour standards and occupational safety\n\nHealthy employees are the foundation of a successful company. This is why preserving and promoting the health of its employees is so important for S IMMO. S IMMO pledges to provide a safe and healthy working environment for all its employees and to practise accident prevention for the protection of employees, tenants and visitors.\n\n#### **Employee rights**\n\nThe company employs its staff exclusively in countries in the European Union and pledges to pay all of its employees a fair and living wage or salary and to fully respect the results of collective bargaining. Standard policies include fair work conditions and benefits based on the applicable legal entitlements (such as part-time work, job protection for expectant mothers, regular paid holiday, sick leave and paid parental leave).\n\nAt the Vienna location, there is a Works Council in place that represents the interests of employees within the company to the Management Board and is an important point of contact for employees on labour law issues. It has three members (two women and one man). The Works Council is authorised, for example, to enter into works agreements and is involved in dismissals and redundancies. In 2023, employees from the financing department were fully transferred to Immofinanz as part of an optimisation of the organisational structure agreed with Immofinanz. In addition to the HR and legal departments, the Works Council was also involved in the process in order to address potential negative effects on employees at an early stage and ensure a smooth transition.\n\nThe Management Board maintains an open relationship with the Works Council in Vienna based on a foundation of trust and conducts constructive and collaborative dialogue with this body to ensure a fair balance of interests. As a matter of course, S IMMO's corporate culture includes professional interaction with employee representatives without any preferential or disadvantageous treatment whatsoever. Moreover, two members (one woman and one man) were delegated to the Supervisory Board and one member each was delegated to the ESG and Audit Committees, thus providing additional representation of employee interests in these bodies.\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Health and safety**\n\nWith regard to employee health and occupational safety, S IMMO focuses primarily on prevention, offering employees various preventive programmes as part of the company's health services. At the Vienna location, for instance, employees can take advantage of an annual health check-up, melanoma screening and seasonal vaccinations. For this purpose, S IMMO is always looking into current and new options that can be implemented in the company health promotion plan.\n\nS IMMO ensures that local occupational safety laws are implemented in order to guarantee employee safety. These include first aid and fire prevention measures in particular. The Vienna location has a safety officer and several first-aiders on staff.\n\nThe locations in which S IMMO subsidiaries operate are wheelchair-friendly and ease of access is taken into account for all new buildings. As of 31 December 2023, a total of six people (2022: five) with long-term physical, mental or psychological impairments or impairment of their sensory functions were employed. This corresponds to 6.0% of the workforce (2022: 3.8%).\n\nThe company assesses the risk of accidents and injuries to be comparatively low for employees at S IMMO as their primary activity involves office work. Preserving and promoting the health of staff and avoiding workplace accidents and workrelated illnesses are clear goals the company pursues. However, the company considers sick days to be only minimally suitable as a performance key figure for assessing the health and well-being of employees. Employees are encouraged to recover fully from illnesses and injuries before returning to work. In addition, the company is dedicated to enabling employees to balance work and their personal lives, not least to offset stress and encourage mental health. In this context, all employees were offered an online seminar on burnout prevention in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nIn the reporting year, S IMMO collected accumulated sick leave data relating to its employees for all locations. On average, employees at all locations took 9.6 (counted from the first day) days of sick leave (2022: 9.8). An additional 5 employees were on long-term sick leave in 2023 (2022: 3). The definition of longterm sick leave is country-specific. Sick leave counted from the date on which the government, rather than the company, begins to pay continued wages is considered long-term sick leave by the company. Long-term sick leave has been taken into account up to now when calculating the average number of sick leave days in order not to distort the informative value of this figure.\n\nS IMMO recorded no work-related injuries in 2023 (2022: 0). There was one work-related illness in 2023 (2022: 0), no workplace accidents (2022: 2. Correction of the figure from 2022) and no deaths (2022: 0).\n\nIn addition to the safety of its own employees, S IMMO is also dedicated to ensuring safety at the company's construction sites. S IMMO's service providers and partner companies ensure that everyone involved in construction is protected in line with local statutory provisions. S IMMO therefore abides by high quality standards when selecting partner companies and opts for companies which attach great importance to factors such as safety in the workplace and employee protection. For example, in Germany S IMMO works in conjunction with partners who are ISO-certified in the area of energy, environmental and quality management. None of S IMMO's employees work primarily on construction sites. When selecting service providers, S IMMO will also exercise the utmost care and focus on the highest safety standards in the future.\n\nBoth management and the S IMMO team are very happy with the measures adopted in relation to occupational health and safety and will therefore continue to implement the existing measures in line with the ESG strategy.\n\n# Remuneration, training and employee loyalty\n\nMany of S IMMO's employees have completed high-quality training programmes and have many years of professional experience, which is also reflected in the statistics on age groups and years of service. The company therefore has a wealth of expertise to draw on. Attracting and retaining highly qualified and motivated employees is a major factor in the company's success. The company is negatively affected when employees of this kind leave. In addition to the loss of knowledge, a departure can also adversely affect business activities, for instance if projects are delayed as a result. Moreover, filling positions and training new employees takes up resources.\n\nWith this in mind, S IMMO actively takes measures to retain employees. A basic requirement is that all employees receive appropriate remuneration. In addition, it goes without saying that all legal regulations and requirements are meticulously fulfilled in all countries in which S IMMO has employees. Human resources management is handled locally by the individual subsidiaries so that individual employees' needs may be met optimally and to ensure that local law is followed.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Remuneration**\n\nS IMMO emphasises fair, sector-standard and competitive remuneration for its employees in order to secure the know-how within the company in the long term, but also to be perceived as an attractive employer by potential applicants. Salaries are based on strict gender equality and all employees are offered a fair basic salary.\n\nRemuneration depends on the position and professional experience and comprises a basic salary and often variable remuneration components depending on the position. Special payments such as performance bonuses, project bonuses or, in the last two years, cost-of-living bonuses are also paid on an ad hoc basis. The parameters for the variable remuneration components are determined in the course of annual performance reviews; the achievement of targets is a prerequisite for the annual bonus. To ensure comparability across years, only the basic salaries and variable remuneration components are included in the tables at the end of the chapter; special payments are not taken into account, nor are any special payments on resignation (e.g. remaining leave).\n\nBelow, the remuneration of employees in Austria and Germany is discussed. There is no disclosure of information for Croatia, as it would be possible to draw conclusions about individuals due to the small number of employees. Employees of S IMMO AG who transferred within the Group to CPI or Immofinanz in the course of the financial year 2023 are included in the respective reporting of these companies.\n\nFor the 2023 reporting year, the gender pay gap was analysed Group-wide for the first time. The gender pay gap reflects the ratio of the average total remuneration of female employees to male employees. The gender pay gap amounts to 1.42. In middle management it is 1.17 and among employees without a management function it is 1.24. Due to the small number of employees, no information is provided on employees in top management and in management at entry level.\n\nAccording to the analysis, existing differences in income between men and women are partly influenced by structural factors. At the Vienna location, for example, younger women in entry-level positions are more frequently contrasted with older men who have been with the company for longer. S IMMO will analyse the gender pay gap annually in future and is working to reduce the pay gap gradually.\n\nIn order to support employees in view of the increased inflation in the reporting year, the basic salaries of employees were adjusted to inflation.\n\n#### **Training and further education**\n\nS IMMO has identified the continuous professional development of its employees as a material topic and supports this with training and further education. Failure to provide training measures or adequate support for them can have negative impacts on employee satisfaction and consequently on productivity and staff turnover and even result in employees not possessing the required skills and knowledge to meet new challenges they may face in their departments. As part of the ESG strategy, the company has set the goal of ensuring that all employees complete at least eight hours of further training each year. In 2023, employees participated in an average of 10.1 hours of training and further education.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the primary focus is on expanding the employees' industry-specific expertise, for example through seminars from the fields of property management or ESG. The company also supports staff who wish to take advantage of coaching and language courses. The agreed training courses are provided by third-party institutions and service providers. In this context, the in-house training was expanded in 2023 with the goal of enabling knowledge existing within the company to be utilised more extensively and enhancing employees' digital skills. The digital learning platform that was introduced in the previous year was expanded to include mandatory training in the areas of compliance and IT in particular.\n\n3 apprentices underwent training at the property management company Maior Domus in Germany on average during the year under review (2022: 3). The apprentices are able to attend a private vocational college to provide them with a demanding training programme and the best possible preparation for their professional career. They spend time in all departments of the property management company as part of their three-year training programme and take on responsibility for overseeing their own properties from their second year, where they are supported by mentors. Apprentice training is an integral part of Maior Domus's human resources policy and a valuable investment in the future.\n\n#### **Employee loyalty**\n\nThe satisfaction and well-being of the team is one of S IMMO's key assets, and the greatest care will also be taken to maintain this in future. Making the best possible use of the personal strengths and potential of all employees not only is in the company's own interest, but also increases the motivation and identification of all employees with the company on a sustainable basis. S IMMO intends to remain an employer of choice and to continue to meet employee needs. S IMMO maintains a company-wide open-door policy and constantly strives to bring all kinds of conflicts to a quick and non-bureaucratic conclusion that is satisfactory to all sides.\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\nBesides ongoing communication between employees and managers, the annual employee reviews in particular provide an opportunity to address the concerns and needs of employees. In addition to goal setting, the aims of the review are, amongst others, to provide the opportunity for reciprocal feedback, to improve the quality of the cooperation between employees and their managers, to prepare employees in an efficient and targeted manner for their current and future roles and to improve the corporate culture and climate of communication. An employee review was conducted with 71.0% of employees in the reporting year (2022: 86.9%). Broken down by gender, 72.0% of female employees and 70.0% of male employees conducted such a review (2022: 81.4% of women and 93.3% of men). By employee category, 50.0% of employees in top management (2022: 50%), 52.6% of employees in middle management and entrylevel management (2022: 100%) and 76.6% of employees without a management function (2022: 87.1%) received an evaluation of their performance. The number of reviews has declined as a result of increased employee turnover, which is discussed in more detail below.\n\nIn the 2023 reporting year, 51 employees left S IMMO or its subsidiaries (2022: 19). At the beginning of 2023, 16 employees in Hungary and Romania left S IMMO. The employees of S IMMO Hungary and S IMMO Romania were almost entirely taken on by the respective local CPI subsidiaries. In addition, an optimisation of the organisational structure was agreed with Immofinanz at the Vienna location, as part of which the employees of the financing department were transferred in full to Immofinanz. Although these people are no longer employed by S IMMO, they are still part of the CPI Group. Excluding transfers within the Group, the fluctuation rate totalled 31.0%. The average period of service across all locations is 8.0 years (2022: 7.1 years).\n\n# **Tenants**\n\nAs a property holding company, tenants play a central role for S IMMO. Properties are designed for people and intended to meet their need for living and work space. S IMMO treats its tenants as equal partners and always strives for respectful dialogue and to meet tenants' needs. A positive relationship between S IMMO and its tenants is essential for the success of the business and the company's reputation.\n\n# Tenant communication\n\nS IMMO has always done its utmost to maintain a good, open and honest relationship with its tenants. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in particular, many questions remained unanswered, and the ongoing exchange of information with tenants was key to working together to quickly find suitable solutions for individual tenants. S IMMO is also meeting the current challenges resulting from rising inflation and interest rates by maintaining an ongoing and constructive dialogue with all tenants. S IMMO always strives to pursue a cooperative approach that complies with national laws – this is the only way to achieve an outcome acceptable to both parties. In this connection, the company benefits from being represented in the majority of its markets by on-site teams or otherwise by competent service providers that have often been in business for many years and that are not only fully familiar with local conditions but that can also build partnerships based on mutual trust with all stakeholders in the course of their day-to-day work.\n\nIn the context of its ESG strategy and the set goals, S IMMO is working on the introduction of Group-wide standardised green lease agreements for new commercial leases and renewals. These are lease agreements that are intended to encourage owners and tenants to jointly manage and use the properties in a way that preserves resources as much as possible. This includes, for example, provisions on the economical use of energy, water and waste as well as the exchange of data in this regard. Currently, the conclusion of this type of lease agreement is a voluntary option for S IMMO tenants. The first properties in Budapest and Vienna already saw the introduction of such green lease agreements by the end of 2023, and the level of coverage across the entire portfolio is to be gradually increased over the coming years.\n\n# Tenant satisfaction\n\nIt is particularly important for S IMMO to ensure that satisfied tenants occupy the company's properties for the long term. The company aims to achieve this goal by maintaining respectful and continual communications with tenants as equals, but especially by offering tenants a complete range of management services. A poor relationship with the tenants has the potential to exert a negative impact on the terms of tenancy agreements, vacancy rates and rental income and thus directly on S IMMO's business activities. On top of that, there is a risk to the company's reputation that could additionally complicate future lettings.\n\nDue to their in-depth knowledge of the properties and management of contacts with potential and current tenants, the local asset and portfolio management teams on-site play a key role in maintaining a positive relationship with the tenants. Further\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\nmore, S IMMO has its own property management company, Maior Domus, which manages properties and takes care of tenant matters in its real estate portfolio in Germany. Also at the other locations, tenants and properties are managed by dedicated teams, which are supported in most cases by external experts and service providers.\n\nThis approach allows S IMMO to quickly and flexibly act and react in all situations. For the company, regular dialogue and direct contact with its tenants are the foundation for long-term partnerships based on mutual trust and a key success factor. Tenant satisfaction can be assessed in the day-to-day work and by using criteria such as the rental term, the renewal of existing tenancy agreements and the success in reletting properties. The tenant satisfaction surveys planned for 2023 have been postponed for the time being in favour of other goals and measures and will be re-evaluated in 2024 with regard to implementation.\n\n# Building certifications\n\nOne of the biggest levers S IMMO as a real estate company has for making a significant contribution to a sustainable economy and society lies in designing the construction, operation and modernisation of the properties in a way that conserves as many resources, produces as few emissions and is as userfriendly as possible. This is why the Group started the step-bystep certification of its properties using internationally recognised certification frameworks for buildings with environmental and social characteristics – known as green buildings – in 2012. All S IMMO's development projects are now planned and implemented in accordance with these standards. Furthermore, acquisitions of properties are also evaluated with a view to certification or their ability to be certified. As part of the Groupwide ESG strategy, S IMMO has set itself the goal of further increasing the proportion of buildings certified according to Access4you, BREEAM, DGNB, EDGE, Green Key, Green Star, HQE, LEED and WELL, having significantly exceeded the previous year's target of 40% for commercial properties.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, S IMMO's property portfolio that was certified under BREEAM, LEED and WELL comprised a total of 34 properties (2022: 23) with a gross leasable area of 726,414 m² (2022: 496,375 m²) in Brno, Budapest, Bucharest, Hradec Králové, Prague, Vienna and Zagreb. This corresponds to 49.2% (2022: 34.8%) of the gross leasable area of the entire portfolio and a year-on-year increase of 46.3%. This also means that, as of the reporting date, 53.8% of the gross leasable area of commercial properties in the portfolio was certified in accordance with green building (2022: 45.4%). This further increase was achieved due to the fact that many of the buildings acquired in the year under review have green building certifications and non-certified properties were sold at the same time. The company also plans to continue to increase the proportion of certified properties through acquisitions, developments and modernisations.\n\nThe proceeds from the two green bonds issued by S IMMO in 2021 and 2022, which total EUR 95.5m following a partial repayment as a result of a change of control event in June 2022, went in their entirety into the (re)financing of acquisitions of properties certified as green buildings and were allocated in full as of the reporting date of 31 December 2022. In July 2023, S IMMO issued a third green bond in the amount of EUR 75m.\n\n# **Stakeholders and society**\n\nS IMMO takes care to cultivate relationships with its stakeholders and enable them to personally share their views and experiences. The Annual General Meeting was held as an in-person event in May 2023. In addition, many individual discussions were held with investors in 2023 – some in virtual form – while the Management Board and the Investor Relations team also took part in several roadshows. S IMMO was also invited as speaker to several ESG events and was thus able to actively contribute to the discourse on greater sustainability in the real estate industry.\n\n# Stakeholder communication\n\nContinual dialogue with various stakeholder groups is important to S IMMO. Regular communication allows the company to identify the needs and concerns as well as feedback and complaints of the stakeholders – whether they are shareholders, tenants, employees or other stakeholders – and to respond to these as quickly as possible. This has a positive effect on key performance indicators, such as the share price, the turnover rate or the occupancy rate, and can play a part in identifying potentially negative impacts for or caused by S IMMO.\n\nS IMMO is also responsible for negative effects on individual stakeholders in its day-to-day business. While the company endeavours to keep these potential effects to a minimum, it also ensures that the exchange with its dialogue groups always includes the opportunity to submit complaints and critical concerns. The large number of stakeholders, the diversity of their potential concerns and the fact that there is usually already direct contact with a department led S IMMO to decide to rely on the channels and contacts already established for receiving complaints.\n\nStakeholder concerns can be raised in person, by telephone or in writing with S IMMO employees, who will process these concerns themselves or forward them to the relevant internal department, depending on the specific issue and severity. It is also possible to contact the company as a whole, in particular via the public telephone number and the email address office@simmoag.at. Processing takes place in compliance with \n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nany applicable legal deadlines and can be carried out in the national language commonly spoken at the respective company location as well as in English. Critical concerns that have a potentially negative impact on the organisation or stakeholders are reported to the Management Board and, if necessary, also communicated to the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, the Compliance Management function and the digital and anonymous whistleblower system on S IMMO's website are available to all stakeholders in the event of compliance or other serious allegations.\n\nThe teams in the company's markets are familiar with local conditions and in some cases have long-standing relationships with the relevant stakeholders. Respectful interaction and communication with all stakeholder groups as equals is the foundation for successful cooperation. In this context, it is important for S IMMO to be aware of the needs of all stakeholders, to take their opinions seriously and – if necessary – to respond promptly and comprehensively to complaints.\n\nThe company communicates with individual stakeholder groups through the relevant departments or the local teams. A materiality analysis conducted in 2021 identified the following stakeholder groups whose influence on and interest in the company is particularly large. The details of the process for identifying the relevant stakeholders are explained in depth from page 4 onwards.\n\n- Supervisory Board\n- Management Board\n- Local managing directors\n- Employees\n- Works Council\n- Tenants and brokers\n- Core shareholders\n- Institutional investors\n- Small investors\n- Banks and analysts\n\nA constructive partnership between the Management Board and the Supervisory Board that is based on transparency is key to maintaining a rigorous corporate strategy. The Management Board provides the Supervisory Board at its meetings with detailed information on all the relevant business areas. In addition, the Supervisory Board is notified, also at short notice and if possible immediately, of all developments that are critical for the management of the company.\n\nThe employees are informed about recent developments using established channels of communication. In specific instances, the Management Board addressed the team in real time in order to provide information and context for the current situation. Moreover, employees are always free to meet one-on-one with the Management Board members. As the representative of the employees' interests at the Vienna location, the Works Council has the opportunity to present employee concerns to the Management Board as well as to the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn order to ensure optimal tenant satisfaction, S IMMO maintains an ongoing dialogue with its tenants and agents, while its local teams serve as their expert point of contact on site. These teams seek solutions that are individually tailored to meet our tenants' needs. Thanks to the close contact and regular dialogue, the expectations on the company as well as tenant satisfaction are met and continually improved on. For more information on this, please see the section on tenant satisfaction.\n\nThe company has a responsibility to core shareholders, institutional investors and small investors alike. S IMMO maintains a direct dialogue with the capital markets during its Annual General Meeting, roadshows, investor conferences and personal meetings. Regular communication with service providers, lending banks, analyst firms, brokers, etc. also forms part of our day-to-day business activities. S IMMO places great value on transparency and communication on an equal footing in all of its business relationships.\n\n# Partnerships and memberships\n\nS IMMO uses partnerships and memberships to meet its social responsibility in terms of sustainability at the sector and economic level and to promote dialogue between companies and organisations. As a long-standing member of the Austrian Business Council for Sustainable Development (respACT), the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) and the Austrian Sustainable Building Council (ÖGNI), the company is committed to the transfer of knowledge to increase sustainability. These partnerships will also be continued in 2024. In addition, the Management Board and the ESG & Sustainability department spoke at several ESG events about S IMMO's experience in dealing with sustainability challenges and contributed to the exchange of information within the industry and beyond.\n\n# Commitment to society and the local community\n\nS IMMO is pursuing its commitment to taking responsibility beyond its core business by supporting charitable projects in the countries in which it operates. In doing so, S IMMO focuses on long-term partnerships in order to contribute to development and change as sustainably as possible. In 2023, the longstanding partnership with Caritas Socialis was continued, in particular through support for the hospice. In addition, the company once again supported various Caritas projects in Austria, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria that aim to give young people prospects for the future and people in need a home under the guiding principle of \"giving shelter\".\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition, the \"Our House\" community centre in Hungary supports socially disadvantaged children and young people from the Roma minority, who are often affected by poverty and unemployment. A family children's home in Stremț (Romania), four houses of hope for children and young people in Alba Iulia (Romania) and a centre in the Bulgarian village of Pokrovan, which has long been affected by high levels of emigration, leaving many residents living in loneliness and poverty, are also supported.\n\nAs part of the traditional Christmas campaign in 2023, S IMMO supported neunerimmo, a non-profit subsidiary of the Viennese social organisation neunerhaus, which enables homeless people and those at risk of poverty to lead a self-determined and dignified life by providing affordable housing and advice.\n\nIn 2023, S IMMO was once again active in the art sector by providing facilities at Mariahilfer Strasse 103 for the 17th time for the Vienna Art Supermarket (Kunstsupermarkt), which once again proved very popular. From October 2023 to March 2024, numerous originals and unique pieces by both young, unknown and internationally renowned artists were once again exhibited and sold at modest prices. The Vienna Art Supermarket offers a low-threshold alternative to the traditional art trade for all those interested. In addition, the long-standing partnership with the Dom Museum Wien was also continued.\n\nFurthermore, S IMMO once again supported the International Summer Academy hosted by the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna (mdw Universität für Musik und darstellende Kunst Wien) by providing the Vienna Classical Music Awards and the OeAD's Green.Building.Solutions. Summer University, which focused on the topic of more sustainable construction, with a scholarship.\n\n# **Social key figures**\n\n#### Total number of employees by gender1\n\n|

Croatia.\n\n<sup>3</sup>The rate of fluctuation is calculated using the Confederation of German Employers' Associations (Bundesvereinigung der Deutschen Arbeitgeberverbände) formula and does not\n\ndistinguish between voluntary and involuntary departures (departures/average headcount in the period). Employees who transferred to Immofinanz or CPI in 2023 are not included in the calculation of the rate of fluctuation.\n\n#### Collective bargaining coverage and social dialogue\n\n|

non-employees.\n\n2 In computing the rate of work-related injuries, the undertaking shall divide the respective number of cases by the number of total hours worked by people in its own workforce and multiplied by 1,000,000. Thereby, these rates represent the number of respective cases per one million hours worked. A rate based on 1,000,000 hours worked indicates the number of work-related injuries per 500 full-time people in the workforce over a one-year timeframe. For comparability purposes a rate based on 1,000,000 hours worked shall be used also for undertakings with less than 500 people in the

Handling the capital provided sustainably and with integrity is a key part of the company's corporate self image. This responsibility is fulfilled both by the in-house team and in the context of cooperation with our business partners. In addition to the section below, the corporate governance report (see annual report from page 21) and the Code of Conduct, the Organisational Policy for Human Rights, the Organisational Policy for Issuer Compliance and the Organisational Policy for the Prevention of Bribery, Acceptance of Benefits and Corruption are available on the Group's website (www.simmoag.at/ sustainability/governance) for further information.\n\nThis section deals with the topics of digitalisation and sustainable value enhancement, which were identified as material in the course of the materiality analysis conducted in 2021.\n\n# **Responsible governance**\n\nS IMMO has now been pursuing a prudent and proven business policy for 35 years. Sustainable value enhancement in the interest of shareholders is a key aspect of the corporate strategy. The company's business activities are not geared towards short-term profits but pursue balanced and consistent development that takes into consideration both financial success and social and ecological impacts. Details of the business model can be found in the Group fundamentals section starting on page 92 in the annual report.\n\nThe company plays its part in local value creation through its business activities by promoting economic and infrastructure development and creating and securing jobs by providing properties that are in line with demand. From the revenues that are generated, taxes are paid in turn to the states in which the company actively operates.\n\nThe focus of companies on making profits, however, can also have negative impacts on people and the environment. The most significant of these include negative impacts on employees and pressures on the environment and climate. As explained in the other sections of this non-financial report, the company has set itself the goal of continually identifying and minimising any negative impacts it creates.\n\nAlong with a corporate culture geared towards fairness and equality, S IMMO maintains clear guidelines as well as companywide standards and pursues a transparent information and training policy in order to make all relevant parties aware of governance-related issues. Since 2007, S IMMO AG has been committed to observing the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance (for details, please see the corporate governance report), which contains principles on transparency and good corporate governance. The Management Board has brought the company's corporate governance into line with the principles of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance and, in conjunction with the Supervisory Board, declares that the company observes and complies with the C Rules of the Code (deviations from the C Rules are also explained in the corporate governance report). Furthermore, S IMMO is also covered by CPI's participation in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC).\n\n# Shareholders\n\nThe rights and obligations of shareholders arise from the Austrian Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the Articles of Association of S IMMO (www.simmoag.at/corporategovernance). The main rights include the right to profit-sharing and the right to participate in, vote and receive information at the Annual General Meeting. Shareholders with shareholdings above clearly defined thresholds also have rights such as the right to add items to the agenda. All rights of shareholders are published annually on the website in the notice of convening of the Annual General Meeting.\n\nDetails of the shareholder structure and the company's Investor Relations activities can be found in the \"S IMMO in the capital market\" section and at www.simmoag.at/share.\n\n# Management Board\n\nIn line with the Austrian Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Management Board of S IMMO runs the company under its own responsibility, taking the interests of all stakeholders into account. The Management Board is in charge of the operational management team, which is responsible in turn for the various divisions and functions. This cooperation is based on a constant, open exchange of information and short decision-making channels. The Supervisory Board is responsible for appointing the Management Board. In doing so, it pays particular attention to market expertise, experience, relevant skills and an appropriate track record. The key consideration regarding the composition \n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\nof the Management Board is that a wide range of skills must be covered while ensuring cordial and targeted cooperation.\n\nS IMMO is committed to performance-oriented remuneration in line with market conditions for its Management Board members with the aim of enabling the company to attract qualified managers and retain their services. In spring 2020, the S IMMO Supervisory Board set out the principles for the remuneration of members of the Management Board (remuneration policy) in accordance with section 78a AktG. This remuneration policy was submitted to and adopted by the 31st Annual General Meeting of S IMMO in October 2020 (www.simmoag.at/agm) with a majority of 75.58% of the vote.\n\nThe remuneration policy ensures that the total pay of the members of the Management Board is commensurate with the situation of the company and customary remuneration, that longterm incentives for sustainable corporate development are set and that the company's business strategy and long-term development are furthered. The aim is to create sustainable, valuecreating and growth-oriented corporate development by reconciling the interests of the company, shareholders and members of the Management Board. Based on this remuneration policy, a remuneration report is submitted to the Annual General Meeting each year and is published on the company's website (www.simmoag.at/agm) no later than three weeks before the respective Annual General Meeting. The remuneration report must be approved by the Annual General Meeting; the results of the vote are published on the company's website after the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe remuneration report presents the main features of the remuneration policy for the Management Board and Supervisory Board of S IMMO AG in the past financial year. In addition, the remuneration paid to current and former members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board during the reporting year is disclosed individually. Also disclosed is the average salary of all employees as well as the percentage increase yearon-year and in comparison to the Management Board salaries.\n\nIn line with its ESG strategy, S IMMO has set itself the goal of increasing the share of variable Management Board remuneration tied to ESG criteria. In 2022, the share was increased from 10% to the current 20%, and by 2025 it should be at least 25%.\n\n# Supervisory Board\n\nThe structure, composition and allocation of responsibilities of the Supervisory Board and the diversity concept of the company are set out in detail in the Supervisory Board report (see annual report from page 18) and the corporate governance report (see annual report from page 21). Since 2021, the Supervisory Board has had its own ESG Committee, which deals predominantly with the strategy and objectives in relation to sustainability criteria. In keeping with this, a member of the Management Board was also explicitly assigned to ESG matters in the same year.\n\nCollectively, the Supervisory Board has the relevant experience and expertise in the international property sector, finance sector, capital markets and law that are required in order to perform all its supervisory duties effectively. Accordingly, when looking for new members of the Supervisory Board, it prioritises the expertise required to strengthen the Supervisory Board, taking the avoidance of conflicts of interest and the number of existing Supervisory Board appointments into account in the selection process.\n\nMembers are elected to the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting. Under the Articles of Association of S IMMO, no shareholder has the right to nominate a member of the Supervisory Board for appointment. The CVs and declarations pursuant to section 87 (2) AktG are published on the issuer's website in good time before the Annual General Meeting. In accordance with the statutory provisions, the Works Council is also entitled to delegate Supervisory Board members from among its own members.\n\nThe term of office of all Supervisory Board members is published on the company's website (www.simmoag.at/boards), and the number of members who have declared themselves independent is disclosed in the corporate governance report starting on page 22 of the annual report.. Business relationships with related parties, including with members of the Supervisory Board, require the approval of the Supervisory Board and are disclosed on page 177 of the annual report.. Transactions undertaken by the Management Board, members of the Supervisory Board or related parties involving securities of S IMMO are reported as directors' dealings and published on S IMMO's website (www.simmoag.at/corporategovernance).\n\nS IMMO regularly conducts internal evaluations of the Supervisory Board's work – in particular the composition and activities of the Supervisory Board and its committees as well as cooperation with the Management Board. The last self-evaluation was carried out in 2022. As the current Supervisory Board was only constituted at the end of January 2024, an evaluation by the Supervisory Board is planned for the financial year 2025.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Compliance**\n\nThe observance of internationally applicable rules, the fair treatment of stakeholders and transparent communication with all target groups are basic cornerstones of S IMMO's corporate culture. As a listed company, S IMMO is subject to the provisions of Austrian and European capital market legislation. It has also established a Code of Conduct as well as binding guidelines which lay down principles of conduct for business activity on a Group-wide basis.\n\nThe members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board must make their decisions without being influenced by their own interests or those of controlling shareholders, on an informed basis and in compliance with all relevant legislation. Any conflicts of interest must be disclosed immediately, and executive functions – including those of senior management – at other companies must be approved by the Management Board and/ or Supervisory Board. The statutory prohibition on competition also applies. Critical issues such as complaints or processes with potentially negative consequences for the organisation or stakeholders must be reported to the Management Board and may also need to be communicated to the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn 2023, there were no cases of compliance violations, allegations of corruption or cases leading to disciplinary measures, legal proceedings or the termination of an employment relationship. Similarly, no critical issues were reported. In addition, no supplier contracts had to be terminated on account of breaches of the compliance guidelines. S IMMO was not required to pay any fines in connection with cases of corruption or breaches of competition law in the reporting year.\n\n# Code of Conduct and whistleblowing\n\nS IMMO has a Group-wide Code of Conduct that obliges all executive bodies and employees to act in accordance with the company's ethical standards. With reference to the corresponding organisational policies, this Code of Conduct provides the overriding regulations on the prevention of corruption, ensuring issuer compliance and safeguarding human rights, as well as taking environmental concerns into account. In this Code of Conduct, S IMMO has additionally undertaken not to make political contributions or donations to political parties or to engage in political lobbying.\n\nIf employees become aware of any demonstrable or potential violations of the Code of Conduct, they must immediately report them to Compliance Management at S IMMO or submit a corresponding anonymous notification via the digital whistleblower system that is publicly accessible on the company's website. Reported incidents are treated in confidence, and whistleblowers are guaranteed anonymity.\n\nIn line with the goals of S IMMO's ESG strategy, mandatory training on all relevant compliance issues was provided in the form of online courses in the financial year 2023. Among other things, employees were familiarised with the content and areas of application of the Group-wide Code of Conduct, associated policies and the available mechanisms for reporting violations and for whistleblowing. An explicit acknowledgement of the Code of Conduct was also required. These training courses were introduced in 2022 and will be continued annually in the future in order to promote the permanent anchoring of the key principles in the awareness and actions of all employees.\n\n# Human rights\n\nS IMMO is aware that it comes into direct and indirect contact with questions relating to human rights as a result of its business activity. An organisational policy introduced in 2022 established common procedural processes in the area of human rights management and integrated relevant human rights issues into S IMMO's active risk management.\n\nS IMMO is committed to respecting, protecting and promoting international human rights in the course of all of its activities and does not tolerate any form of discrimination. This involves preventing and dealing with human rights violations that may arise as a result of the company's activities on the one hand and, on the other, investing efforts in preventing or mitigating any negative impacts on human rights that may arise in the course of direct business relationships. S IMMO has undertaken to maintain a work environment that is characterised by mutual trust, in which diversity and inclusion are valued and in which everyone is treated with dignity and respect. S IMMO complies with laws and regulations on the protection of human rights, fair working conditions and other provisions of labour law and refers here explicitly to\n\n- the International Bill of Human Rights, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,\n- the Fundamental Principles and Core Labour Standards of the International Labour Organisation (ILO),\n- the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and\n- the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises\n\nas frameworks for defining its publicly available organisational policy on human rights, which governs its Group-wide approach \n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\nto human rights issues. This relates to how human rights are embedded in the organisation and operations and also includes the existing complaint mechanisms and the procedures for monitoring effectiveness and publishing disclosures.\n\nThe employees and the members of the executive bodies of S IMMO are required by the company's Code of Conduct to observe the precepts of this organisational policy and the rights and principles it contains in their day-to-day activities. Furthermore, S IMMO expects its non-Group service providers and suppliers, irrespective of their size, to observe the contents of this policy. A commitment from these external business partners is currently not yet required, but the preparation of a declaration to this effect is planned.\n\nThe implementation of human rights does not fall under the company's active sphere of influence in all cases, as most of the requirements have to be established and maintained at the state level. S IMMO has therefore identified human rights issues that it classes as particularly relevant and actively addresses in relation to its business activities and supply chains. A selection of these issues is listed below in line with the scope of application at S IMMO and briefly defined from the company's perspective. A general overview can be found in the relevant organisational policy at www.simmoag.at/sustainability/governance.\n\nS IMMO is committed to equal treatment and prohibits any discrimination on the basis of ethnic origin or nationality, language, social origin, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, political or other belief, mental or physical ability or other status. Sexual harassment, hatred and war propaganda of any kind are also prohibited. S IMMO protects the rights of ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities and recognises the freedom of thought, conscience and religion of every individual.\n\nS IMMO also recognises the right to just and favourable conditions of work and social security and undertakes to pay its employees a fair and living wage or salary and to fully respect both the right to and the results of collective bargaining. The company is committed to freedom of association and ensures that the interests of its employees are represented by the Works Council, which they freely elect. S IMMO's corporate culture includes professional interaction with employee representatives without any preferential or disadvantageous treatment whatsoever. The company maintains an open relationship with the Works Council based on a foundation of trust and conducts constructive and collaborative dialogue with this body in order to pursue a fair balance of interests. As of 31 December 2023, only the location in Vienna had a Works Council.\n\nThe company prohibits all forms of exploitation and explicitly forbids slavery, torture, forced and compulsory labour as well as child labour. Violations of occupational health and safety provisions or of employee rights are not permitted. Everyone has a right to physical and mental health, while mothers enjoy special protection for a reasonable period before and after giving birth. Everyone has the right to file a complaint in the event of a violation of human rights, and employees are required to report complaints and suspected incidents involving actual and potential human rights violations through the complaint mechanisms established for this purpose.\n\nThe Management Board of S IMMO has adopted and supports this organisational policy. The operational implementation and continual guarantee of human rights due diligence is the responsibility of S IMMO's Compliance Management, a Groupwide function that is currently performed by one of the members of the Management Board. This includes both the ongoing identification and assessment of actual and potential human rights violations in accordance with the precautionary principle and the initiation and follow-up of preventive, mitigation and remedial measures within the company's sphere of influence, if necessary in consultation with the rest of the Management Board and in so far as this lies within the company's control. In order to identify and address specific issues in the best possible way, Compliance Management coordinates closely with the Group departments or local management of the S IMMO branches when necessary.\n\nThe central point of contact for all complaints and suspicious activity reports regarding actual and potential human rights violations is S IMMO's Compliance Management. In addition, the local management in the branches can also be contacted as the first authority. An anonymous report can also be submitted via the Group's digital whistleblower system. All three channels are always open to employees and non-employees alike. All reported incidents are received by Compliance Management and are treated confidentially and with the assurance that anonymity is guaranteed. Once an incident is confirmed, possible countermeasures are identified. At least one additional member of the Management Board will be involved in this process.\n\nShould several human rights violations occur at the same time, the violations that involve serious and time-critical impacts will be prioritised. These complaint mechanisms pursue the goal of meeting the requirements of legitimacy, accessibility, predictability, equitability, transparency and compatibility with human rights at all times. The type of measures that are taken is decided entirely on a case-by-case basis and is determined individu\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\nally in accordance with applicable law and, where possible, in dialogue with the parties concerned.\n\nS IMMO's Compliance Management continuously documents actual and potential human rights violations that are identified, complaints that are received and measures that are implemented. This also includes measures for actively promoting human rights regardless of any complaints and suspicious activity reports as well as the further development of this organisational policy in general terms. This information, in particular the number of complaints that are received and confirmed and the measures that are implemented, is published annually in anonymised form. Cases are also processed internally in accordance with the confidentiality principle as learning examples in order to prevent similar cases from recurring as far as possible.\n\nIn the reporting year, no complaints or suspicious activity reports were received and no human rights violations were identified at S IMMO's branches.\n\nSince 2022, employees have received annual training on the contents and implementation of the organisational policy on human rights as well as on the digital whistleblower system, which plays a key role in the anonymous reporting of human rights violations.\n\n# Prevention of bribery and corruption\n\nS IMMO AG has a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to bribery, the acceptance of benefits and corruption. Corruption is typically defined as exploiting a position to benefit oneself, often at the expense of others. It is characterised by the abuse of a public role or comparable business function. Corruption entails financial losses but also dramatically undermines trust among customers and suppliers and jeopardises the company's competitive edge, and hence the jobs it provides. A binding guideline adopted by the Management Board governs the structural and procedural measures for preventing bribery, acceptance of benefits and corruption, and is also geared towards raising employees' awareness of the consequences of corruption and the opportunities to combat it. In addition, financial support for lobbying and political parties is strictly prohibited under the guideline and is not practised in any form whatsoever by S IMMO. Operational implementation of the measures is the responsibility of the Compliance Management function, which is currently performed by a Management Board member. Official S IMMO contact persons are available to all employees at their request and when a violation is suspected. Compliance violations can also be reported by contacting the local management team. As part of the Group-wide risk assessment, the company has reviewed the risks in the area of bribery, the acceptance of benefits and corruption and generally considers them to be low.\n\nAs in the year prior, an online course on the prevention of bribery, acceptance of benefits and corruption was held in the fourth quarter of 2023. Participants were informed about the applicable anti-corruption guidelines and how employees can recognise and prevent cases of corruption. A total of 76 employees took part in the training course, which corresponds to a participation rate of 87.4%. In total, 1 employee in top management (participation rate 50.0%), 11 employees in middle management (participation rate 78.6%), 5 employees in entry-level management (participation rate 100.0%) and 59 employees without a management function (participation rate 89.4%) completed the training course. Broken down by country, the number of participants was divided between 31 employees in Austria (participation rate 91.2%) and 45 employees in Germany (participation rate 86.5%). There were no participants in Croatia (participation rate 0%). In addition, two members of the Management Board (participation rate 100%) and three members of the Supervisory Board (participation rate 50%) took part in this training.\n\nIn addition, the Group-wide Organisational Policy for Issuer Compliance is binding for all employees, regulates the handling of insider information and the management of capital market compliance, and explains the legal consequences of abusing insider information. Employees also received training on this topic as part of an online course and a hybrid event. No cases of corruption or breaches of issuer compliance were reported in the reporting year.\n\n# Taxes and fair competition\n\nThe management approach to tax compliance at S IMMO is based on a commercially-oriented tax strategy with the overriding goal of complying with applicable tax regulations in all of our countries in a transparent manner. This strategy is monitored by the Management Board, and significant tax-relevant business transactions must be approved by the Management Board. In order to achieve this goal, S IMMO's internal tax department is integrated into business-related processes. The tax department is staffed with experienced tax experts at the headquarters and involving external tax experts if required. Reporting is made directly to the Management Board and the tax department is involved in the approval process for relevant business decisions in a standardised manner.\n\nThe tax compliance process includes a dual control mechanism, as external advisers are involved in the preparation process of tax returns. In addition, tax risk reporting is collected throughout the Group and each company is critically analysed \n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\nin terms of its tax risk level including ongoing reporting of all tax audits and litigation. The success of this low-risk approach has been evident in all previous tax audits, where no material findings have been identified.\n\nIn addition to local tax requirements, S IMMO also carefully observes international reporting requirements, for example the requirements of the DAC 6 EU Directive are monitored periodically. As CPI Property Group S.A. acquired a majority shareholding in both IMMOFINANZ AG and S IMMO AG in 2022, the relevant revenue threshold of EUR 750m for country-by-country reporting (CbCR) requirements was exceeded for the first time. Accordingly, from 2022 on S IMMO and its group companies are subject to CbCR requirements and fully comply with them. In addition, transfer price documentation is prepared annually in accordance with OECD principles.\n\nAll income in the S IMMO Group – in particular rental income, capital gains and internal financial income – is generated and taxed exclusively in Austria and in the operating country companies.\n\nS IMMO is subject to the CPI's Group Competition Law Compliance Policy and all S IMMO employees were familiarised with the content and principles of fair competition as part of an online training course in 2023. At the same time, there were no violations of competition law in the past year.\n\n# Digitalisation, data protection and IT security\n\nS IMMO deals intensively with the opportunities and risks of digitalisation in light of the company's activities and workflows. The issue of digitalisation is anchored in the structure of the Management Board's IT responsibilities. The aim is to continue to develop the company from a process-led to a data-led organisation in the medium term. External consulting firms and IT service providers are also involved in this process in addition to the Management Board and internal experts. At the beginning of this development, the focus was primarily on IT governance and IT security matters as well as collaboration processes. In the 2023 reporting year, more extensive projects were implemented in the areas of data and document management as well as automated reporting routines, the latter primarily against the backdrop of faster and standardised data exchange with CPI and Immofinanz. For this purpose, a data lake was set up and linked with existing software solutions and proprietary dashboards in order to create a harmonised data landscape across all systems within S IMMO Group and to generate information for reporting and strategic decision-making.\n\nDigitalisation enables work processes and workflows to be optimised and automated and employees' skills to be enhanced. These measures aim to raise productivity and efficiency and strengthen synergies in the collaboration with CPI and Immofinanz. The digitalisation initiative additionally aims to play a part in ensuring competitiveness and to increase flexibility of companies and employees in a changing business and working world. The company is aware that increased flexibility might also have a negative impact on work-life balance.\n\nS IMMO also sees potential in the digitalisation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions resulting from business trips and other travel. Virtual meetings have a role to play in saving costs and emissions by reducing the need for travel. These meetings do not require additional IT equipment to be purchased to any significant extent, meaning that S IMMO will not make materially negative contributions to electronic waste or increased energy consumption in this regard. If new company mobile phones, laptops and other devices have to be purchased, the emphasis will be placed on high-quality products with a long useful life. Old devices that are still serviceable will be given to an external company, which will refurbish and sell them to private users at affordable prices. The product lifecycle of the IT equipment can be extended in this way.\n\nRespecting personal privacy and protecting data are key issues for S IMMO and its stakeholders. Special importance is attached here to protecting the personal data of employees, tenants and business partners. The theft or loss of personal data can have a negative impact on the company and have a lasting effect on the foundation of trust between the company and its stakeholder groups. Business operations can grind to a halt if companies lose business data or are permanently or even only temporarily prevented from accessing it by third parties. This can also tarnish the company's reputation.\n\nThe issue of data protection is anchored in the structure of the Management Board's legal responsibilities. In operational terms, a designated person working with the Legal, IT and Corporate Communications and Investor Relations departments has operational responsibility for creating and implementing internal data protection policies and updating the processing register that documents flows of personal data. This person is an important internal point of contact for employees and other stakeholders in matters involving data protection law. In addition, decisions of the Austrian Data Protection Authority (DSB) along with recent developments are monitored and, if necessary, external legal experts are consulted. The Works Council of S IMMO AG is also included in meetings when necessary in order to ensure that the interests and rights of the employees are represented. In the context of the \n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\nextensive digitalisation efforts, there is also a company agreement that regulates the restriction of access to employees' personal data. As in the previous year, employees were trained in the company's IT and data protection policy as well as cybersecurity and data security topics as part of mandatory online courses in 2023. There were no complaints regarding violations of the GDPR by S IMMO in the financial year 2023.\n\nSecure IT infrastructure and protection against cybercrime are critically important for guaranteeing that both personal and business data and processes remain protected. The IT department at S IMMO is responsible for providing state-of-the-art IT infrastructure and reports directly to the Management Board. IT is additionally supported by renowned IT service providers. S IMMO implements a large number of measures and solutions to prevent breaches of the confidentiality, availability or integrity of business data as a result of unauthorised disclosures, encryption or losses. For example, S IMMO has a central user and log management system and runs an intelligent cyberdefence program and other programs to automatically identify data security risks around the clock. Moreover, hard drives, data storage media and mobile devices are encrypted and servers are hosted in a fail-safe data centre of an external service provider. The latest hardware is always used, while operating systems and software are regularly updated. The company's IT and data protection policy is constantly being developed and also covers the topic of data security.\n\nIn 2022, a penetration test was carried out by an external service provider, which is to be repeated in 2024 after some changes were made to the IT infrastructure in the reporting year. Attacks on the system were simulated in the course of this test in order to identify vulnerabilities and gaps in security and to assess the system security. Concrete measures to enhance the resilience of the IT systems were derived from the test results and subsequently implemented. Furthermore, additional security updates were carried out on the IT systems. No cyberattacks on S IMMO's IT infrastructure were recorded in 2023. There were also no leaks, thefts or loss of personal data.\n\n# Supply chain management\n\nThe suppliers commissioned by S IMMO are highly diversified and range from construction firms, property management companies and consultants to insurance providers and banks. The company is committed to the prudent, responsible selection of business partners, and takes particular care to reduce risks arising from child labour, forced labour and other social neglect or inequality. It works with well-known, recognised partners following a corresponding selection process. Business relationships are based on clear contractual conditions and regulations, with compliance with the high legal standards and provisions within the European Union being required as an absolute minimum. Along with the responsible selection of suppliers, the constant exchange of information with all service providers also plays a key role in the prevention of supply chain risks.\n\nCompared with buying, selling and letting properties, the issue of the supply chain in the context of construction activity is much more complex. The structures in the construction sector and the involvement of numerous companies and suppliers make it more difficult to monitor compliance with social and environmental standards. In particular, negative impacts can potentially arise in connection with transportation, space requirements and the disposal of problematic materials as well as violations of employment and social law.\n\nAlthough construction activity currently plays a secondary role in S IMMO's business activities, the company makes efforts to actively reduce any risks. To this end, S IMMO also relies on highly regarded and long-standing business partners in development and construction projects. As part of the joint ESG strategy, together with CPI and Immofinanz the company intends to draw up a Code of Conduct for Suppliers that will define social and environmental standards and be an integral part of new contracts. S IMMO regards this as another opportunity to contribute to a more environmentally sound and socially responsible property sector.\n\nThere was one significant change in the supply chains during the reporting period. In Romania, Slovakia and Hungary, local CPI subsidiaries have taken over asset management and, in some cases, property management services for S IMMO's properties there, replacing S IMMO subsidiaries and external service providers. CPI is also entrusted with such tasks for the properties acquired in the Czech Republic during the reporting year, while the properties acquired on Wienerberg in Vienna are managed by Immofinanz. In all cases, the local expertise and familiarity of the people managing the properties should enable synergies to be leveraged and the organisation to be streamlined as part of closer cooperation within the Group.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **GRI content index**\n\nS IMMO AG has reported the information cited in this GRI content index for the period from 01 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 in accordance with the GRI Standards.

The company pursues the goal of designing its properties to be resource-efficient, low-emission and user-friendly. At the same time, we not only play an important role in society as an employer but also provide real estate that meets people's basic need for space to live and work. In addition to encompassing labour standards, diversity and remuneration within our company, our aspiration demands a commitment to society and the local community. Handling the capital provided to us sustainably and with integrity is a key part of our corporate self image. As a listed company, we always have an obligation to our shareholders, but we also naturally have a responsibility to all other stakeholders at all times.\n\nLast year, we took important strategic and operational steps. Together with CPI and Immofinanz, we defined a Group-wide ESG strategy. This strategy sets out 15 goals in the areas of Environment, Social and Governance, which we will drive forward with joint forces. The reduction to these 15 strategic core goals enables us to focus clearly on material issues, and we expect targeted synergies from Group-wide cooperation. The goals include reducing greenhouse gas, water and energy intensity as well as, for example, increasing the proportion of certified buildings, a Code of Conduct for Suppliers and Groupwide standardised green lease agreements. The strategy adjustment was decided by the Management Board after consultation with the ESG Committee of the Supervisory Board; all goals with detailed definitions and respective deadlines can be found on page 6 of this non-financial report.\n\nImage /page/0/Picture/5 description: A professionally lit, medium shot captures a woman with fair skin, brown hair, and glasses, seated at a wooden table. She is dressed in a black blazer over a white top. Her hands rest on the table in front of her. The background is a neutral, light beige color, with a subtle horizontal line suggesting a wall or paneling. The lighting is soft and even, highlighting her face and clothing.\n\nRadka Doehring\n\n{1}------------------------------------------------\n\nOperationally, we also focused on harmonising processes and systems together with CPI and Immofinanz, at the same time ensuring that our actions are based on a common understanding of all ESG-relevant topics. In this area, we are also benefiting from the completed development of the data lake as a single point of truth to which all employees have access. This saves valuable time when working with and analysing data, but even more importantly, it enables patterns to be identified quickly. This means we can also simulate future scenarios and not just interpret data retrospectively. We learn from the past and create data-based future forecasts – this gives us a huge advantage in terms of the defined ESG goals.\n\nI am confident that the steps we have taken in the past year will make a significant contribution to further strengthening our intensive efforts in all ESG matters. The combined forces within the Group, through which we will dedicate ourselves to a common ESG strategy, make me confident not only that we will achieve our ambitious goals, but also that we will enjoy fruitful and inspiring cooperation at all levels of the Group. Only by pulling in the same direction will we succeed in becoming more mindful of our resources, our environment, and our society as a whole.\n\n# **Regulatory frameworks, principles and standards**\n\nS IMMO has published a non-financial report annually since the financial year 2017.

Since 2007, S IMMO has been committed to observing the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, which is available on the website of the Austrian Working Group for Corporate Governance. Details on the implementation of the Code at S IMMO can be found in the annual report starting on page 21. S IMMO is also included in CPI's participation in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC).\n\nAt an international level, the company applies various frameworks for the protection of human rights. Details of S IMMO's activities in the area of human rights issues, and especially the scope and content of these activities and their organisational and procedural implementation, can be found in the Human rights section starting on page 52 and in the Organisational Policy for Human Rights at www.simmoag.at/sustainability/governance. S IMMO's Code of Conduct for all executive bodies and employees of the company also covers human rights issues as well as compliance-related and environmental content. This Code, which is publicly accessible at www.simmoag.at/sustainability/governance, is binding for all executive bodies and employees and has been the subject of annual training since 2022.\n\nThe Management Board of S IMMO approves of the company's commitment to these principles and supports them fully. These frameworks currently apply only to S IMMO and all its fully consolidated subsidiaries. The plan is for them to be expanded to include external business relationships.\n\nTo facilitate the transparency and comparability of strategies, measures and results in the area of sustainability, S IMMO has applied international frameworks for its non-financial disclosures since the publication of the report on the financial year 2021. For this reason, S IMMO prepares and publishes a nonfinancial report in accordance with the applicable Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards once a year. The GRI content index provides an overview of the standards applied in this report and the sections containing the relevant information (starting on page 57).\n\nMoreover, disclosures are made in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) and the EPRA Sustainability Best Practice Recommendations (EPRA sBPR). The EPRA Sustainability Performance Measures can be found starting on page 31. The application of additional standards in non-financial reporting is continuously examined in terms of relevance and viability.\n\n# **Scope and boundaries of the report**\n\nThe company publishes the non-financial report each year as part of its annual report. The reporting period for this report is identical to that of the financial report and thus covers the period from 01 January 2023 to 31 December 2023. The report includes the key figures for the reporting year and, where possible, for the previous year. Significant events between the balance sheet date (31 December 2023) and the editorial deadline for this report (25 March 2024) are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements set out in section 5.7. This report was published on 25 March 2024.\n\n{2}------------------------------------------------\n\nThis non-financial report was published in accordance with the operational control approach (for the purposes of non-financial reporting). The scope of reporting includes S IMMO and all subsidiaries over whose operational decisions S IMMO can exercise a controlling influence. As in the previous year, this corresponds to all fully consolidated S IMMO companies (see annual report from page 125).\n\nThe Vienna Marriott and Budapest Marriott hotels are operated by fully consolidated subsidiaries under management agreements. S IMMO exercises a controlling influence over many operating activities in the area of hotel management and can exercise operational control with regard to environmental factors in particular. However, the management of the hotel staff is the sole responsibility of the respective hotel's management and lies outside S IMMO's control. This means that the employees of the two hotel companies are not covered by the operational control approach and are therefore not included in employeerelated key figures in terms of non-financial reporting as they are not material. The disclosure of the total number of employees at S IMMO, which also includes the hotel employees, is an exception.\n\nWhere reference is made to S IMMO elsewhere in the nonfinancial report, this should be understood to include all fully consolidated companies and properties of S IMMO and its employees in Austria, Germany and Croatia, but not the employees of the two hotels in Vienna and Budapest. If a key figure does not refer to all locations, this is explicitly stated. In the first quarter of the reporting year, S IMMO's office locations in Romania and Hungary were closed and the employees were largely taken on by local subsidiaries of CPI, which in turn were tasked with the local management of the respective properties. These employees are included in the key figures on a pro rata basis for 2023.\n\nReal estate-related key figures refer to S IMMO's entire property portfolio. This includes all lettable buildings and the owneroperated hotels. In addition, leasehold properties, development projects and land banks as well as any acquisitions and sales during the year are also included on a monthly basis for indicators such as energy consumption. This means that all fully consolidated properties are covered in full. The three buildings held by associates and joint ventures and accounted for using the equity method, which are therefore not fully consolidated, are only taken into account when calculating greenhouse gas emissions under the category Investments.\n\n# **Audits**\n\nThe Management Board submitted the non-financial report to the Supervisory Board for review. The Supervisory Board received, reviewed and discussed the non-financial report and found no reasons for objection. As part of the audit of the financial statements, the disclosure of all legally required information was reviewed by the appointed auditor, Ernst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H. The non-financial report has not been subjected to any further separate external audit.\n\nThe Internal Control System (ICS) and the risk management of the company are explained in detail in the risk management report in the annual report starting on page 104. The selection of the auditor is carried out by the Audit Committee and is described in the Supervisory Board report (annual report from page 18).\n\nS IMMO has not set any internal rotation interval for auditing above and beyond the statutory requirements. The last change in the auditor of the consolidated and individual financial statements of S IMMO AG was made for the financial year 2023. For the financial years 2018 to 2022, KPMG Austria GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft was appointed as the auditor of the consolidated and individual financial statements of S IMMO AG. The audit-specific and nonaudit-specific fees that the auditor receives from the company are listed in the annex to the annual report starting on page 166.\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **ESG strategy and sustainability management**\n\n# **Guiding principles**\n\nExperience shows that a company-wide approach to the topics of ESG and sustainability requires above all an intensive analysis of the company's identity and values and its corporate culture at the very outset. That is why S IMMO decided to revise and hone its guiding principles at the start of 2022 in a participative process with its employees. The company is characterised by lean structures and open cooperation across departments. It actively designs living environments by means of its properties and acts prudently and responsibly in this process. The S IMMO guiding principles consist of four related elements: purpose, vision, mission and values. Together, they describe S IMMO's identity and how it acts.\n\n### S IMMO guiding principles\n\n| Purpose | Investing in lasting values: people and real estate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Vision  | We design valuable living environments for today and tomorrow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Mission | We use our experience, passion and local know-how to turn individual properties into a future-proof and<br>high-performing portfolio based on forward-looking decisions                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Values  | Quality: Tenant satisfaction and consistently increasing business value thanks to highest standards<br>Tradition: Stability and reliability rooted in a successful past<br>Responsibility: Foresighted action for the benefit of our stakeholders and the environment<br>Collaboration: Achieving success as a team and together with our stakeholders |\n\n# **Materiality analysis**\n\nThis non-financial report is based on a materiality analysis conducted in 2021 in which potential areas of sustainable management were examined and assessed with internal and external experts in connection with the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (NaDiVeG) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. The impacts on people and the environment and the significance to key stakeholders such as shareholders, tenants, employees, other interest groups and business partners were addressed here. The materiality analysis was performed with assistance from the consulting firm Deloitte.\n\nTwo workshops were conducted with the responsible Management Board member and representatives of various specialist departments (Corporate Communications and Investor Relations, Project Development, Portfolio Management, HR, Compliance, Works Council) in which stakeholder groups were identified, and the stakeholders were assigned a weighting based on the criteria \"influence on S IMMO\" and \"interest in S IMMO\". As a result, the following stakeholder groups were identified as relevant:\n\n- Supervisory Board\n- Management Board\n- Local managing directors\n- Employees\n- Works Council\n- Tenants and brokers\n- Core shareholders\n- Institutional investors\n- Small investors\n- Banks and analysts\n\nGiven the low level of construction activity, stakeholder groups such as general contractors and suppliers were rated as non-material.\n\nTopics for the stakeholder survey were then determined in a multi-stage process. In the first step, the external consulting firm drew up a shortlist of possible topics for the survey on the basis of sector benchmarking, an analysis of reporting standards, current trends and an analysis of current and forthcoming legal conditions relating to non-financial reporting. These topics were verified at a workshop with Deloitte, and any existing gaps were scrutinised.\n\nThe identified topics were assessed on two levels: their influence on decisions of the stakeholders and their potential economic, environmental and social impacts. Stakeholder repre\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\nsentatives were then questioned via an online survey (period: July to September 2021) and in individual interviews. The aim of these surveys was to assess the impacts of economic, environmental and social aspects on S IMMO and to gauge the influence of these aspects on stakeholder decisions. Subsequently, the importance of the economic, environmental and social impacts of the topics was specified in the context of a workshop and a meeting with the Management Board member responsible for ESG.\n\nThe material topics for S IMMO are therefore the 14 aspects that have the greatest impacts on society and the environment, are the most important to stakeholders and are rated as the most significant for S IMMO's business activities.\n\n#### Material topic\n\n| Environment | Climate change adaptation<br>Energy consumption and use of resources<br>Renewable energy sources<br>Sustainable operation of buildings<br>Maintenance, repair, modernisation and renovation<br>Sustainable mobility |\n|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Social      | Diversity and equal opportunities<br>Employee satisfaction and employer attractiveness<br>Training<br>Tenant satisfaction                                                                                           |\n| Governance  | Sustainable value enhancement<br>Combating corruption<br>Digitalisation<br>Data protection                                                                                                                          |\n\nIn this non-financial report, S IMMO details its activities and the measures adopted in relation to the topics identified as material topics. These are dealt with in detail in the following chapters: Environment, Social and Governance.\n\nAgainst the background of closer cooperation in the area of ESG between S IMMO, CPI and Immofinanz, the materiality analysis is to be revised jointly in 2024.\n\n# **ESG strategy**\n\nIn the second half of 2022, S IMMO presented a comprehensive ESG strategy for the first time. As a result of the majority shareholdings of CPI and Immofinanz in S IMMO and the resulting consolidation, the ESG strategy was adapted and aligned across all three companies in the reporting year. This new Group-wide ESG strategy, consisting of 15 goals in the areas of Environment, Social and Governance, was developed jointly and replaces S IMMO's previous ESG strategy.\n\nIn particular, S IMMO has succeeded in incorporating its previous core goals into the Group-wide ESG strategy. At the same time, the strategic alignment means that some of S IMMO's previous goals will no longer be pursued in favour of a significantly more focused and streamlined approach. The company aims to achieve an even greater impact from the tighter focus and synergies of a common Group-wide strategy through joint measures, especially in highly relevant and challenging areas such as the reduction of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. It should be noted that the validation of the reduction target for greenhouse gas intensity by the Science Based Targets Initiative takes into account CPI as an entire group in which S IMMO is fully included. However, there is no validation explicitly for S IMMO alone.\n\nThe Management Board approved the current ESG strategy in August 2023 and is responsible for compliance with the strategic guidelines. The relevant specialist departments, based on the specific topics, are responsible for tracking individual targets and implementing measures, and the ESG & Sustainability department takes on the responsibility for coordinating implementation.\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Group ESG strategy and goals\n\n**E** Environment\n\nImage /page/5/Picture/2 description: The image shows a line drawing of an electrical plug with two leaves attached to the cord.

The area of digitalisation/ESG is established as a Management Board responsibility and assigned to a board member. Furthermore, the ESG & Sustainability department is a central point where sustainability issues across all departments and subsidiaries are consolidated and coordinated. This department reports directly to the Management Board, and they meet at least once a week. The ESG Committee of the Supervisory Board acts as a control and steering body. This committee monitors the company's activities and its social, economic and environmental responsibility and is informed by the Management Board and the department in detail about current focal points and areas of activity during its meetings.\n\nIn business operations, the ESG & Sustainability department works intensively with other departments on implementing S IMMO's strategic ESG goals and is responsible at the same time for collecting and analysing data on relevant key performance indicators. The awareness and understanding of ESG and sustainability is thus promoted in dialogue with the specialist departments throughout the Group and among all the employees. Moreover, the department is also responsible for the selection and implementation of international regulations, principles and standards in non-financial reporting and acts as an interface for cooperation with CPI and Immofinanz on all ESGrelated topics.\n\nExisting and potential risks that arise in the context of S IMMO's business activities and could have an impact on various sustainability matters have been incorporated into the Group's general risk management. This risk management is the responsibility of the correspondingly named function within S IMMO. Another independent function, which is currently also fulfilled operationally by a member of the Management Board, is Compliance Management, which is responsible for the areas of capital market and criminal compliance, including the associated organisational guidelines, employee training and grievance mechanisms as well as overarching responsibility for the Code of Conduct.\n\nIn order to improve the transparency and comparability of how companies deal with different sustainability issues, ESG rating agencies have been established around the world that can offer institutional investors in particular guidance when it comes to assessing companies and investment decisions.\n\nGroup-wide, the decision has been made to use the Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating and MSCI ESG Rating. Since S IMMO is currently no longer among the companies rated by MSCI, the company is focusing solely on the Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating. S IMMO was able to further improve this rating from 15.0 to 12.2 as a result of implemented measures and expanded reporting. As a result, it continues to be classified as \"low risk\" and is among the top 20% in an industry comparison and among the top 5% of all rated companies.\n\nAt the EPRA sBPR Awards 2023, S IMMO was honoured with bronze for its non-financial reporting for the second year in a row. Furthermore, S IMMO benefits from closer cooperation with CPI, as it is now an explicit part of CPI's consolidated CDP reporting, in which the Group achieved a B score in 2023.\n\n# **ESG risk management**\n\nSince September 2022, a comprehensive ESG risk management process has been established and the ESG risks have been fully integrated in all of the company's risk management processes. In terms of processes and contents, environmental, social and governance risks are handled in the same way as all other risks. Consideration of the double materiality plays an important role here, as both risks that have an impact on the company from outside and risks that may have an impact on the environment and other stakeholders from within the company as a result of its business activities are assessed.\n\nDetails of the material ESG risks and the measures for identifying, assessing, preventing and mitigating them are described in the separate risk management report starting on page 104 of the Group management report in the annual report.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Environment**\n\nConsideration of environmental aspects has been an integral part of S IMMO's strategic and operational activities for many years. In order to formalise a more responsible interaction with the environment, concrete environmental goals were defined that pursue, among other things, the reduction of energy and water consumption as well as the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. These environmental goals, which are anchored in the ESG strategy, also reflect the results of the materiality analysis conducted in 2021. With the involvement of various stakeholder groups, the following environmental topics were identified as material:\n\n- Climate change adaptation\n- Energy consumption and use of resources\n- Renewable energy sources\n- Sustainable operation of buildings\n- Maintenance, repair, modernisation and renovation\n- Sustainable mobility\n\nIn the reporting year, S IMMO aligned its ESG strategy together with CPI and Immofinanz, resulting in adjustments to individual goals. The year 2019 was also defined as the common baseline year for environmental targets. You can find out more on page 6. The Management Board of S IMMO is responsible for compliance with the goals set out in the ESG strategy. From an operational perspective, there is a portfolio-wide division of labour between S IMMO, CPI and Immofinanz. For example, the implementation of environmental measures to ensure resourceefficient building operations in Austria, Germany and Croatia is the direct responsibility of S IMMO and, in particular, the asset and property management teams there. S IMMO's properties in Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary are primarily managed by local CPI experts. The properties acquired in the Wienerberg district of Vienna in the reporting year are managed jointly by S IMMO and Immofinanz.\n\nThis close cooperation benefits not only from the joint ESG strategy, but also from the further standardisation of processes and systems between the three companies in the reporting year. In 2023, the Environmental Impact Reporting Directive was adopted by all three companies and also approved by the Management Board of S IMMO. This directive regulates the mandatory annual measurement of all relevant environmental indicators, including the necessary data collection and validation processes. It also includes annual reporting and the consideration of relevant regulatory requirements. CPI's centralised and digital environmental data management system is used for this purpose. A Group-wide solution was also found to implement the requirements for joint, modern climate risk management, which builds directly and seamlessly on S IMMO's previous work and the software program it had selected.\n\nThanks to the close cooperation, S IMMO was able to further expand the reported environmental indicators. For the first time, all relevant Scope 3 categories of greenhouse gas emissions can be reported, thus providing a complete overview of the company's carbon footprint, including a comparison with the base year 2019 now standardised Group-wide. This footprint is to be successively reduced through ongoing and property-level energy monitoring, operational optimisation measures and other measures such as increasing the proportion of renewable energy sources and modernising buildings in line with the environmental goals. The cross-company cooperation within the Group and the joint strategy should continue to make a decisive contribution to this.\n\n# **Boundaries on environmental key figures**\n\nThe key performance figures reported in this section relate to the group of fully consolidated companies of S IMMO (annual report from page 125) and follow the operational control approach. Shares accounted for using the equity method are only taken into account when calculating greenhouse gas emissions under the category Investments.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, S IMMO's property portfolio, which includes lettable buildings, owner-operated hotels, development projects and land banks, consisted of 244 properties (2022: 364) with a gross leasable area of around 1.5 million m² (2022: 1.4 million m²). Based on book value, properties in Austria accounted for 22.0% (2022: 14.5%) of the portfolio, while properties in Germany accounted for 15.7% (2022: 38.3%). Properties in CEE made up 62.3% of the portfolio (2022: 47.2%). Looking at the portfolio broken down by main type of use not including plots of land and based on book values, offices accounted for 67.2% (2022: 56.5%), retail properties for 19.4% (2022: 12.2%), residential properties for 6.1% (2022: 25.2%) and hotels for 7.3% (2022: 6.1%) as of 31 December 2023.\n\nThe property-related consumption and emissions data in this section refers to the entire real estate portfolio of S IMMO. Acquisitions and sales during the year are included on a monthly \n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\nbasis for key indicators such as energy consumption. The three buildings held by associates and joint ventures and accounted for using the equity method, which are therefore not fully consolidated, are only taken into account when calculating greenhouse gas emissions under the category Investments. The reference value of property-related environmental indicators is the reference gross leasable area. This includes – besides the gross leasable area of the properties that were part of the portfolio for the entire year – the gross leasable area of buildings that were acquired or sold during the year, normalised on a monthly basis, so that the area corresponds proportionately to the number of months relevant for reporting.\n\nAs part of the closer cooperation with CPI, the resulting standardisation of calculation methods and ongoing quality control, there may be changes to the previous year's figures.\n\nAt the end of this section of the non-financial report, you will find tables with details on the EU Taxonomy key performance indicators, the environmental key figures and the EPRA Sustainability Performance Measures.\n\n# **Implementation of the EU Taxonomy**\n\nWith the EU Taxonomy Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2020/852), the European Union has created a standardised set of rules for classifying environmentally sustainable economic activities. Economic activities should substantially support one or more defined environmental objectives and not negatively impact any of the others (Do No Significant Harm principle, DNSH).\n\nSince the reporting year 2021, S IMMO has been required to disclose the economic activities classified as taxonomy-eligible in accordance with the regulation in the form of the share in turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx) these activities account for. Taxonomy-eligible means in this case that an economic activity has been defined in the delegated acts of the EU Taxonomy and thus comes under the regulation's sphere of influence. Starting with the reporting year 2022, S IMMO discloses taxonomy-aligned economic activities, i.e. sustainable activities in accordance with the environmental objectives and technical assessment criteria of the taxonomy.\n\nAll disclosures are made on the basis of the current interpretation of the legal situation and the EU Taxonomy FAQ. Because the legal situation remains dynamic, S IMMO adopts a conservative approach in its declaration of taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic activities.\n\n# Determination of taxonomy alignment\n\nS IMMO has identified the economic activities \"acquisition and ownership of buildings\" (CCM 7.7) and \"hotels, holiday, camping grounds and similar accommodation\" (BIO 2.1) in general as well as \"installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment\" (CCM 7.3) only for CapEx as relevant and taxonomy-eligible, which avoids possible double counting. BIO 2.1 and CCM 7.3 are reported for the first time for 2023 and were not applicable in the previous year.\n\nWith its taxonomy-eligible economic activities CCM 7.3 and 7.7, S IMMO pursues the environmental goal of \"climate change mitigation\", thus double counting is avoided in this respect as well. In order to determine taxonomy alignment for the economic activity \"acquisition and ownership of buildings\" and the significant contribution to the environmental goal \"climate change mitigation\", several factors were taken into account to ensure alignment with the requirements of the EU Taxonomy and its criteria.\n\nS IMMO fundamentally ensures the minimum safeguards required by the EU Taxonomy. The topics of human rights, anticorruption, taxes and fair competition are covered by organisational policies, processes and grievance mechanisms, and employees are trained annually. Furthermore, there were no known violations of the policies or laws in the reporting year. For more details, please refer to the Governance section from page 50 onwards. Information on the gender pay gap is provided on page 48, while details on the gender diversity of the management bodies can be found on page 22 in the annual report. S IMMO is not involved in the manufacture or sale of controversial weapons.\n\nWith regard to the technical screening criteria relevant to the economic activity \"acquisition and ownership of buildings\" under the environmental goal \"climate change mitigation\", the buildings of S IMMO were checked individually for the date of the application for a construction permit and the existence of a valid Class A energy performance certificate, if possible based on the primary energy efficiency. If a class A energy performance certificate is available and the building is a non-residential building, the nominal capacity of the HVAC systems (heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration) was recorded and, if the threshold value of 290 kW was exceeded, the efficient operation within the meaning of the EU Taxonomy was verified. Czech buildings were analysed on the basis of a corresponding study to determine whether they belong to the top 15% of the national building stock in terms of energy efficiency in operation. If so, this replaced the requirement for a class A energy performance certificate, with the remaining criteria also having to be met.\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition, a climate risk assessment of all buildings in the S IMMO portfolio was carried out at the beginning of 2023 on the basis of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP). The RCPs, which were developed by scientists, describe scenarios for different increases in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and their amplifying effect on climate change. The climate risk assessment was carried out in accordance with the Representative Concentration Pathways RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 in order to avoid significant negative impacts. More information on this can be found in the risk management report starting on page 104 in the annual report. For properties that were only purchased in the course of 2023, the climate risk assessments of CPI and Immofinanz were used where necessary.\n\nIn total for the year 2023, S IMMO has identified 17 buildings (2022: 5) that currently meet the general and specific criteria according to the economic activity \"acquisition and ownership of buildings\". They consist of eight commercial properties in Bratislava, Brno, Bucharest, Hradec Králové, Mladá Boleslav, Prague and Vienna as well as a residential building in Leipzig that has since been sold. These buildings all have a Class A energy performance certificate or are in the top 15% of the national building stock in terms of energy efficiency in operation and the application for a construction permit was submitted before 31 December 2020. If HVAC systems with a nominal capacity of more than 290 kW are installed, they are operated efficiently, although in some cases the identification of efficiency losses and opportunities for energy efficiency improvements is regularly carried out by the local technicians and not automatically by the building services. The Czech properties are covered by CPI's ISO 50001-certified energy management system.\n\nThe Bucharest location is fundamentally affected by the chronic physical risks of heat stress and water stress. According to the company's assessment, the building's operation in its current use is not significantly impaired even if the water availability is reduced but not permanently heavily restricted. First response fire protection, for example by sprinkler systems, is ensured even if the water supply is interrupted. The direct impact of the climate risk of heat stress on the buildings is significantly greater, but the cooling capacity of the HVAC systems installed in the five Bucharest properties is considered sufficient for a foreseeable rise in temperature in the coming years, as evidenced by the building documentation. A building in Brno shows an increased, relevant flood risk. This is countered with a bundle of measures consisting of an emergency plan, the provision of sandbags on site and the contracting of an external service provider for flood protection. In total, 17 properties thus form the scope of the key performance indicators for taxonomy alignment under economic activity CCM 7.7.\n\nAdditionally, the investment in the chiller of another building in Vienna in 2023 fulfils the requirements for the economic activity \"installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment\" and is therefore explicitly reported only in the CapEx indicators under CCM 7.3. The economic activity \"hotels, holiday, camping grounds and similar accommodation\" is currently not taxonomy-aligned, which is why BIO 2.1 is only reported as taxonomy-eligible.\n\n# Determination of the EU Taxonomy indicators\n\nStarting out from the total revenues recognised in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, the taxonomy-eligible turnover consists of the rental income and revenues from operating costs that S IMMO generates in the course of renting out its properties as well as revenue from its hotel operations.\n\nThe basis for the capital expenditure (CapEx) in accordance with IFRS that is considered is provided by all additions to properties, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (before deprecation, amortisation, revaluations and impairments), including additions resulting from acquisitions. In terms of taxonomy eligibility, this relates to the purchase of buildings and capitalisations directly associated with existing buildings at S IMMO, including both operated hotels.\n\nThe relevant categories for determining the taxonomy-eligible operating expenses (OpEx) consist of direct, non-capitalised costs of research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leasing, maintenance and repairs as well as all other direct expenses in connection with the daily maintenance of property, plant and equipment. For S IMMO, only maintenance costs related to its property portfolio in accordance with IFRS are of material importance. S IMMO does not conduct any research and development. Short-term leasing is carried out only to an extremely limited extent and is thus not taken into consideration. The maintenance expenditure associated with existing buildings is therefore classified as taxonomy-eligible.\n\nTurnover, CapEx and OpEx are always considered taxonomyaligned if the taxonomy-eligible proportions of turnover, CapEx and OpEx are attributable to the 17 buildings classified as taxonomy-aligned. None of the taxonomy-aligned amounts are for own use. The taxonomy-aligned shares of turnover, CapEx and OpEx all increased year-on-year in 2023. The tables with the EU Taxonomy key performance indicators can be found from page 19 onwards. For further information on the underlying financial figures, please refer to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report (from page 116) and the related notes (from page 123).\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Use of resources**\n\nS IMMO is convinced that its business activities are compatible with environmentally conscious behaviour. That is why the company attaches great importance to handling the resources and raw materials it uses sparingly and carefully. This includes energy sources and water especially in the operation of the buildings on the one hand, but also raw materials and local land use and biodiversity on the other. Moreover, waste management and the offer of sustainable mobility solutions are topics that S IMMO actively addresses in the course of its activities.\n\n# Energy management\n\nBy their nature, the construction and operation of buildings are very energy-intensive – and this is also true of the S IMMO portfolio. The high global energy consumption contributes significantly to global warming and thus to climate change. In particular, the use of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas has a negative impact on the climate, as they release large amounts of greenhouse gases when burned. The associated rise in the average global temperature has scientifically proven negative impacts on humans and the environment. These include, for example, the rise in sea levels, the increase in extreme weather events such as heat waves and droughts, but also flooding due to precipitation events, as well as the loss of biodiversity and negative impacts on human health.\n\nThe company strives, both for its existing properties and for project developments, to find solutions to keep energy consumption, and thus also the operating costs for its tenants, as low as possible. In this regard, the Group-wide ESG strategy defined the goal of reducing the energy intensity of the buildings by 10% by 2030 compared to 2019. S IMMO's local teams and service providers, which also include CPI and Immofinanz, are instructed to take into account a catalogue of measures for the quick identification and implementation of optimisation and savings measures in their daily work with the individual buildings. Furthermore, in its cooperation with CPI, S IMMO benefits from the fact that most of the Czech buildings in the S IMMO portfolio are covered by CPI's ISO 50001-certified energy management system. This is to be extended to the Slovak properties in 2024, and the addition of further countries is currently under review.\n\nActual energy consumption – consisting of heating demand and electricity consumption – in the buildings managed by S IMMO is almost exclusively dependent on tenant behaviour and is therefore largely outside the company's direct control. However, S IMMO can influence the energy efficiency of buildings to a certain extent through structural measures in the course of maintenance and modernisation, including for example by upgrading building services, replacing the heating system or optimising the insulation, and therefore takes these into account in development projects and the energy and structural refurbishment of existing properties.\n\nWhen looking at energy management, it generally has to be noted that S IMMO is not able in every case to make the decision on the use of energy sources. In principle, it is responsible as the landlord for purchasing energy sources to meet the respective heating demand of the entire building, where it subsequently charges the costs on to the tenants. However, there are several exceptions, especially in Germany in the case of gas heating, where the tenants themselves obtain their heating supplies and consequently do not have to provide S IMMO with consumption information. S IMMO therefore endeavours to contribute to lower energy consumption by its tenants at least indirectly by increasing the energy efficiency of the buildings.\n\nIt is also the case in almost every Austrian and German property that S IMMO purchases electricity only for the common areas in the buildings. The areas exclusively for tenants are supplied through the tenants' own contracts. Here, too, there is no obligation on their part to provide information to S IMMO as the landlord. In CEE, S IMMO is – apart from a few exceptional cases – the sole contracting partner of the local utility companies and thus responsible for the entire energy procurement.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the allocation of costs to the tenants as part of service charge reconciliations, when entering into supply contracts S IMMO always pays attention to relevant cost and competition factors, in addition to the energy mix, in order to maintain conformity with the market.\n\nNatural gas and district heating, and in isolated cases also liquefied petroleum gas and heat pumps, are used in the properties of S IMMO to cover the heating demand. At the end of 2023, one building was still heated with heating oil by the tenant. All other properties of this kind were successfully converted to other heat sources or sold.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe electricity demand on the landlord's side for the property portfolio in Austria and for Germany has been largely covered since 2020 by purchased electricity from 100% renewable sources (solar energy, hydropower and wind energy as well as biofuels). Together with Immofinanz and the CPI subsidiary GSG Berlin, contracts were concluded in the reporting year for the procurement of electricity from 2024 for the properties on the Wienerberg and S IMMO's entire German portfolio. Not only will electricity be sourced exclusively from 100% renewable sources, but in both cases S IMMO is also utilising power purchase agreements (PPA) for the first time to cover significant portions of the agreed purchase volumes. In the course of 2021, the buildings in Croatia, Romania and Slovakia were switched to the purchase of electricity purely from sustainable sources, followed by Hungarian properties in 2022.\n\nIn 2023, 91.2% of the electricity purchased by S IMMO (2022: 95.6%) came from 100% renewable sources. The original goal of switching to 100% renewable sources across the entire portfolio by the end of 2022 was standardised as part of the Groupwide strategy adjustment to the end of 2024. The Group is also working on implementing the procurement of this type of electricity in the Czech Republic, but this has not yet been achieved. With regard to S IMMO's acquisitions in the Czech Republic, this circumstance must be taken into account in terms of key figures. For contractual reasons, it is also not currently possible to switch to electricity from 100% renewable sources for one property in Austria. In addition to external electricity procurement, existing properties are also gradually being equipped with photovoltaic systems, in order to offer the possibility for buildings to have their own, independent electricity supply. For this purpose, three photovoltaic systems in Bratislava with a total output of 299 kWp (kilowatt peak) were commissioned in 2023.\n\nIn the reporting year, S IMMO launched a pilot project for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for the automated optimisation of energy consumption. In this project, the individual elements of the building services in a commercial property in Vienna are linked together via software and controlled independently using an algorithm based on weather data and other parameters. S IMMO hopes to be able to apply the experience gained from this project to other buildings. In 2022, digital consumption meters, known as smart meters, were installed in the vast majority of German properties and connected to the IT infrastructure, where the aim is to record energy data in near real time and to be able to take corrective action when necessary and consequently optimise consumption. Both the ongoing conversion to renewable energy sources and the digitalisation of the properties contribute to more resource conservation in the operation of the buildings and consequently in improving the carbon footprint of S IMMO (for more details on this, please see from page 16).\n\nThe buildings' energy data required for the calculation of key figures is recorded by the respective internal and external property managers, managed centrally and, when necessary, harmonised for analysis by using conversion factors from the local utility companies. Consumption is considered to be within the organisation if it is based on procurement by S IMMO and cannot be allocated exclusively to tenant areas. Consumption that can be attributed exclusively to tenant spaces is considered to be outside the organisation, even if it is procured by S IMMO. Together with the disclosures on energy consumption when obtained directly by tenants, the energy data now represents the entire consumption outside the organisation in accordance with categories 3 and 13 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (see page 18). The energy consumption of the buildings is thus covered in its entirety.\n\nAs tenants who purchase their own energy are not required to disclose their consumption, the disclosures relating to this consumption are based almost exclusively on projections on the basis of actual consumption in comparable buildings in the company's portfolio as well as standard industry benchmarks at building level. Adapted to the type and size of the property, these benchmarks originate primarily from publications of the Bundesinstitut für Bau-, Stadt- und Raumforschung (BBSR – Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development), the German Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development (now the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport) and the German Energy Agency (dena).\n\nIn some cases, exact figures were not yet available for consumption on the part of S IMMO for this reporting year. These have also been extrapolated accordingly or comparable figures from the previous year were used. As the office areas that S IMMO uses itself are all located in properties in the company's portfolio, there was no need for an additional disclosure of this consumption, as it is already included. Significant consumption of fuels from renewable sources or the commercial sale of energy do not take place. Any consumption of cooling energy and steam is contained in the data on electricity and district heating and is not recorded separately.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\nMoreover, the energy data within the organisation also includes consumption by the Group's own vehicle fleet based on fuel consumption. Energy consumption outside the organisation, which is not related to properties owned by S IMMO, is not considered to be directly relevant from an energy management standpoint and is therefore not calculated. Instead, greenhouse gas emissions are recorded as the aim is to reduce the carbon footprint in this area. For more information on this, please see page 17. For an overview of the energy consumption related solely to S IMMO's property portfolio, the EPRA Sustainability Performance Measures are provided starting on page 31.\n\nCompared to the calendar year 2022, a noticeable reduction in energy intensity per net revenue was recorded across all countries in the reporting year. The intensity in relation to gross leasable area has remained constant at portfolio level.\n\n# Water management\n\nS IMMO is aware that a sufficient water supply, safe drinking water and the protection of ecosystems through appropriate sanitation facilities and equipment are material topics for the company. The company therefore ensures that employees and tenants are supplied with clean water throughout its entire property portfolio, both in property development and in property management. Water is supplied to and discharged from the properties through connections to the municipal water networks, and these processes are thus subject to the local regulations as well as requirements within the European Union.\n\nAttention is paid here to proportionate and economical use of water as a resource, especially since a large proportion of S IMMO's properties in Germany and Romania are located in an area with increased or high water stress according to the Group's own science-based climate risk assessment based on the Representative Concentration Pathways and are therefore exposed to the risk of potential water scarcity. Water stress occurs when water consumption exceeds the amount of water available in a region. Specifically, this affects properties in the cities of Berlin, Bremen, Erfurt, Halle (Saale), Kiel, Leipzig, Potsdam, Rostock and Weimar, as well as Bucharest and, in the previous year, the property in Puchheim, which has since been sold.\n\nThe operation of the properties does not involve any major water usage or water storage on an industrial scale and thus also does not trigger any impacts caused by process water. Nevertheless, in the future S IMMO will endeavour to monitor the use of water even more closely and to consult with its stakeholders. In this regard, the Group-wide ESG strategy has set a target to reduce water intensity by 10% by 2030 compared to 2019. The planned installation of digital main water meters and watersaving fittings should play a central role in this.\n\nIn almost all its properties, ensuring the overall water supply from the local utility companies is the responsibility of S IMMO. Only in a few properties is water obtained partly or directly by tenants on the basis of their own contracts, where there is no obligation for them to provide information to S IMMO. The data for the water consumption of the properties is recorded in parallel with the energy data at building level, transmitted by the property managers, consolidated on a central basis and evaluated at portfolio level. Recognising and responding to irregularities that can be attributed to increased consumption, for example as a result of a leak, forms part of the responsibilities of the local property management and service providers of the properties. This also includes the identification of water saving opportunities and the implementation of corresponding measures, for which S IMMO has created and communicated instructions to its service providers.\n\nIn order to ensure consistent comparability, the water consumption of the few properties in which the water is procured by the tenants is also included in the key figures. As accurate data is not continuously available in these cases because there is no obligation on the part of the tenants to provide this information, it has been extrapolated using the actual consumption of comparable properties in the portfolio after being adjusted to the size of the property in question. An extrapolation of this kind was also carried out in the few cases where no accurate figures were yet available for the consumption on the part of S IMMO.\n\nWater intensity fell in 2023 compared to the previous year, both in terms of net revenue and gross leasable area. This also applies in particular to the German and Romanian locations at material water risk.\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Raw materials and waste management\n\nResources are committed and waste of various kinds is produced over a long period during the construction and operating phases of properties. S IMMO is aware of its central role and responsibility here and takes steps to reduce the negative impacts to the minimum possible level. With the transition to the circular economy, S IMMO sees general potential for optimisation and an industry-wide need for action in this area. The company has therefore set itself the goal of checking the recyclability and circularity of the building materials it uses for future project developments and full refurbishments. In addition to reducing noise and dust pollution for residents, effective construction site waste management, the safe handling of dangerous substances and short transportation distances are also key priorities. Where necessary, professional disposal of waste or treatment of contaminated sites is agreed by means of framework construction contracts. Efforts are made to exclude contaminated sites by performing thorough location analyses during acquisitions.\n\nAs part of the Group-wide ESG strategy, a waste recycling rate of 55% by the end of 2025 and an increase in this rate to 60% by 2030 were defined as goals in addition to the elimination of waste sent to landfill wherever possible. In this report, S IMMO is reporting the relevant portfolio-wide waste streams from property operations for the first time. In doing so, it is drawing on the support of CPI, which has many years of experience in this area. As no complete real data is available for properties in Austria and Germany in particular, extrapolations based on comparable property portfolios and local waste data within the CPI portfolio were used in the event of data gaps. In future, waste volumes and streams are to be recorded and subsequently monitored on a portfolio-wide and software-based basis for each property, similar to energy consumption data.\n\nThe total amount of waste generated in 2023 fell slightly compared to the previous year, with the proportion of non-recycled waste increasing primarily due to the acquisition of Hungarian properties, which is attributable to the very low local recycling rate.\n\nIn its own office premises, S IMMO attaches great importance to waste separation and avoidance and, in addition to the use of environmentally friendly paper, also utilises intelligent follow-me printer technology with minimal toner consumption.\n\n# Biodiversity and land use\n\nIn view of climate change and biodiversity loss, S IMMO is engaged in the issues of biodiversity and land use. The greening of open spaces, building facades and roof areas serves in the urban area to create a more pleasant microclimate and reduces heat and noise inside and also in the immediate vicinity of the building. Because the properties enjoy a central location and because of the very high-density development of the plots of land, S IMMO's properties have few areas that are suitable for greening. It is planned to expand greening projects, taking economic viability into consideration, with the enhanced attractiveness for the users of the buildings also playing an important role. Extensive green areas around and on the buildings have been considered from the outset in the development projects currently planned in Bratislava and Budapest.\n\nIn times of increasing soil sealing in the course of ever more high-density developments, property construction projects on sites that are already sealed, known as brownfield developments, are gaining importance. These contrast with greenfield developments, where construction on areas that were previously totally undeveloped produces additional sealing of the soil. The result of soil sealing is that rainwater can no longer drain away, which in turn increases the risk of flooding. Moreover, these areas boost the rise in temperatures in the summer, as sealed ground surfaces heat up more than planted areas.\n\nAll S IMMO's current building developments are located in urban areas in capital cities in CEE, and the majority of them are on previously developed sites, which means the company is not contributing to significant additional soil sealing. The only exception to these brownfield developments is a project on an inner-city meadow site in Bratislava. In order to reduce the negative impacts, the property is being planned with a partially greened façade and extensive roof greening. S IMMO does not have any completely greenfield developments, meaning additional land use outside of urban zones, in its portfolio. In addition, possible soil desealing measures for existing properties are to be continuously examined and implemented where possible.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs part of the land bank in the areas surrounding Berlin, S IMMO manages approximately 240 ha of land area, including forests and meadows. Some of these areas are located in nature and water conservation areas in the state of Brandenburg. All the areas are managed in accordance with the applicable regulations and in harmony with nature. No properties are being developed or operated in these areas. Having plots in a land bank is a long-term investment that could provide areas for later development if they are zoned in a different way and a legally valid land use plan is produced in this connection. S IMMO is not planning any developments of its own in these areas.\n\n# Mobility\n\nIn addition to the development and operation of buildings, the theme of sustainable mobility also plays an essential role for S IMMO in many respects, as the greenhouse gas emissions caused by travel also have direct impacts on the environment and climate change. Here the company can exercise direct control over the Group's own vehicle fleet as well as national and international business trips on the one hand, while, on the other, a positive influence can be exerted on the commuting and travel behaviour of employees, tenants and other users of the properties, meaning that negative environmental impacts can be minimised.\n\nS IMMO's vehicle fleet consists of company cars and pool vehicles. As of 31 December 2023, it included a total of 16 vehicles (2022: 17) at locations in Germany and Austria, which are managed and maintained by local management. The size and cost of the vehicles are adapted to their respective purpose, and procurement has been subject to a separate organisational policy with a focus on electromobility since 2022. The distribution of the German property portfolio across several cities separated in some cases by a large distance requires a degree of flexibility that, in the company's opinion, can best be guaranteed by having a corporate fleet of its own. Several office bicycles have additionally been bought for short business journeys. The fleet is managed using management software and mobile applications.\n\nIn addition to journeys using the company's own vehicles, various kinds of business trips are necessary at all locations. The local on-site management of the properties requires a large number of short journeys, which can mainly be completed using public transport, although private cars may be needed in some cases. The Vienna location plays a special role here, as the portfolio and development projects in the CEE countries are covered from here and the aeroplane thus represents a frequently used means of transport. The company's travel policy explicitly encourages employees not to travel when it is not absolutely necessary and to hold online meetings instead or to travel by train where possible. For flights, only seats in economy class are booked in principle, although an exception is made for intercontinental flights. A greater need for international travel by plane also arises at the hotel operating companies in Vienna and Budapest as a result of their involvement in roadshows.\n\nKilometres travelled are recorded on a local basis by the individual S IMMO locations. An accurate record of the kilometres travelled is not always possible, especially when employees use a private car, taxi or public transport. Therefore, the data also contains estimates based on the average travel patterns of the employees in question, which comprise routes and frequency. The kilometres travelled are directly included in S IMMO's greenhouse gas emissions accounting.\n\nIn 2023, travelling was reduced by around 20% compared to the previous year. In the coming years, S IMMO will also try – as far as the current projects allow – to increase the use of more fuelefficient and public means of transport and to keep travel activity to a necessary minimum by using new forms of communication technology.\n\nFor 2023, S IMMO once again conducted a voluntary survey on the commuting behaviour of its employees at all locations and will continue this practice every two years in the future. The survey includes questions on the average commuting distance and the means of transport primarily used for this. The results are extrapolated on a country-specific basis to the entire workforce, with the hotel operating companies being excluded in accordance with the reporting approach. This data is also included in the greenhouse gas balance.\n\nFrom a Group-wide perspective, a number of different means of transport are used as a result of the different local circumstances and routes to the workplace. The company endeavours to actively encourage its employees to use environmentally friendly options for their commute. The central location of the workplaces featuring well-developed local public transport networks, cycle paths and footpaths is an important factor here. The reimbursement of the costs of discount cards and annual season \n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\ntickets for public transport and the creation of carpools are other measures that have already been implemented. In addition, the take-up of the offer to employees to work from home reduces the overall commuting distance.\n\nThe fact that the connection to the local public transport network is within walking distance is also an attractive benefit for the employees and the users of properties and helps to minimise the impact on the environment during operations. S IMMO therefore attaches special importance to the existing infrastructure for developments and acquisitions. Bike racks, showers and electric vehicle charging stations reinforce the incentive for more sustainable mobility among employees and visitors and are taken into consideration from the outset in new developments and when properties are modernised.\n\n# **Greenhouse gas emissions**\n\nS IMMO's efforts to reduce its own energy consumption and that of its tenants and where possible to cover the energy demand using renewable energy sources not only serve to increase energy efficiency, but also pursue the goal of reducing the carbon footprint related to the business activities. As climate change progresses, it poses new challenges for the economy and society and demands that companies live up to their responsibility in this respect. Not only the impacts of climate change on the company and its actions play a role here, but also the influence the company can exert on climate change. In this regard, S IMMO, together with CPI and Immofinanz, has defined in its Group-wide ESG strategy that the intensity of its property-related greenhouse gas emissions is to be reduced by 32.4% by 2030 compared to 2019. This total value for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 results from a goal validated for CPI as a whole by the Science Based Target initiative in July 2022, which is aligned with the well below 2°C scenario of the Paris Agreement. S IMMO is fully covered by this goal, but there is no validation explicitly only for S IMMO. An annual verification of the calculated carbon footprint is also carried out for CPI at Group level by an external company. Since the reporting year, S IMMO has also been subject to the Group-wide LCA policy together with CPI and Immofinanz. This policy stipulates that the global warming potential (GWP) must be calculated for project developments and full refurbishments of more than 5,000 m² and that a life cycle assessment (LCA) must be prepared for buildings with an area of more than 10,000 m².\n\nAs part of this goal adjustment, the base year was harmonised and changed for S IMMO from 2021 to 2019. In the reporting year, great attention was therefore paid to obtaining consistently comparable, meaningful and quality-assured data for the new base year, even if this was a long time ago.\n\nIn the context of double materiality, i.e. the mutual influences of climate and business activities on each other, S IMMO utilises, on the one hand, science-based and software-aided climate risk management with reference to the requirements of the EU Taxonomy and the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) see risk management report starting on page 109 in the annual report) and, on the other hand, once again expanded the calculation of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with its activities. This now includes all Scope 3 categories considered material. Following the recommendations of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) and in accordance with the operational control approach, the basic scope of the reporting for this carbon accounting is formed by the group of fully consolidated companies of S IMMO (see annual report from page 125).\n\nWith regard to the energy consumption of the property portfolio, this means that only the energy and refrigerants purchased by S IMMO and not directly attributable to tenants are included in the calculation of direct and indirect emissions in accordance with Scope 1 and Scope 2 of the GHG Protocol. Energy and refrigerant consumption that is directly and exclusively procured or used by the tenants is considered as Scope 3 emissions, as there is no operational control in accordance with the reporting approach. All emission values are calculated in CO2 equivalents and on the basis of the collected energy and water consumption data, waste data and refrigerant leakages as well as the kilometres travelled for business or commuting purposes and relevant expenditures. Other greenhouse gases are not shown on an itemised basis in light of the existing data. As biomass is not burned to any significant extent, no biogenic greenhouse gas emissions are recorded. As a result of the cooperation with CPI and Immofinanz, there has been a significant change in the calculation of greenhouse gas emissions in this report compared to previous years. In order to ensure Group-wide comparability, the emission factors previously used by S IMMO have been replaced by those of CPI, and all reported years have been calculated using these new emission factors. These are provided by the University Centre for Energy Efficient Buildings\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n(UCEEB) of the Czech Technical University in Prague and the company CI3, s.r.o. on the basis of renowned sources.\n\n# Direct and indirect energy-related emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2)\n\nS IMMO's direct greenhouse gas emissions under Scope 1 of the GHG Protocol arise on the one hand through the operation of the property portfolio and, on the other, as a result of the use of the Group's own vehicle fleet. The crucial factor here is that greenhouse gas emissions are released directly when fuel is consumed or when there is a refrigerant leakage. In the operation of buildings, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas and heating oil are used as fossil fuel sources alongside various refrigerants. The company's own vehicles with internal combustion engines use petrol and diesel fuels.\n\nIn the case of S IMMO, supplying the properties with electricity and district heating is the driver of the indirect energy-related emissions where energy is purchased externally and emissions arise in the course of this driver. In addition, the company's own electric and hybrid vehicles are also supplied with electricity. The GHG Protocol divides these Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions into location-based and market-based emissions. The emission factors of the respective overall local or national energy network are used as the basis here for calculating the location-based emissions of the energy consumption. The market-based emissions, in contrast, take into consideration contractual agreements between companies and utility companies and thus also specific emission factors that are guaranteed to the users by the utility companies. As S IMMO attaches great importance to renewable sources as the origin when purchasing electricity and regards this as a significant contribution to strengthening a sustainable energy network, the emissions from the consumption of electricity and district heating are calculated using both the location-based and the market-based method. The difference, in S IMMO's opinion, corresponds to an active saving of greenhouse gas emissions as a result of its deliberate choice of renewable energy sources.\n\nWhere possible based on information from local utility companies, electricity from 100% renewable sources is regarded as carbon-neutral for the calculation of the market-based emissions and, in addition, an emission factor of the utility company is applied to district heating obtained. On account of the lack of binding commitments on the part of the utilities, the locationbased country-specific emission factors are used for all other market-based calculations.\n\n# Other indirect emissions (Scope 3)\n\nFor the calculation of the other indirect greenhouse gas emissions, the Scope 3 emissions, the upstream and downstream supply chains of a company are evaluated for their relevance for the company's own emissions inventory. As part of the standardisation of the ESG strategy, S IMMO has classified the following ten out of a total of 15 categories pursuant to the GHG Protocol as material:\n\n- Category 1 Purchased goods and services\n- Category 2 Capital goods\n- Category 3 Fuel and energy-related activities\n- Category 4 Upstream transportation and distribution\n- Category 5 Waste generated in operations\n- Category 6 Business traveling\n- Category 7 Employee commuting\n- Category 11 Use of sold products\n- Category 13 Downstream leased assets\n- Category 15 Investments\n\nCompared to previous years, this selection is significantly broader and, at the company's discretion, now covers all categories that are material to S IMMO, whereby S IMMO also benefits from CPI's necessary expertise.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe figures for categories 1, 2 and 4 are based on the company's expenditure associated with the category names, whereby CPI data was used and extrapolated with adjustments for S IMMO due to inconsistent data availability. The energy data included in categories 3, 11 and 13 comprises the properties of all fully consolidated companies, whereby these categories also reflect energy and refrigerant consumption exclusively by tenants. Category 5 includes the waste generated by the properties owned by S IMMO. The travel and commuting activities of employees are recorded in categories 6 and 7. Category 15 covers the consumption of the three buildings accounted for using the equity method.\n\nIn the case of energy-related emissions, the calculations of the Scope 3 emissions distinguish between the location-based and the market-based approach in order to be able to show the positive effects on building operations when tenants choose renewable energy sources, and thus to further incentivise the societywide transition to green energy. The property-related Scope 3 emissions were consequently calculated using the emission factors specified under Scope 1 and Scope 2.\n\nGreenhouse gas intensity was significantly reduced in 2023 compared to both the previous year and the base year 2019. This applies to both location- and market-based greenhouse gas emissions in relation to net revenue and gross leasable area.\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **EU Taxonomy key performance indicators**\n\n**Environment**\n\nProportion of turnover from products or services associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities – disclosure covering year 2023\n\n**Proportion of taxonomy-aligned (A.1.) or eligible (A.2.) turnover, year 2022 (18)**\n\n| Economic activities (1)                                                                                              | Code<br>(2) | Turnover<br>(3)<br>EUR m | Proportion<br>of<br>turnover,<br>year 2023<br>(4)<br>% | Climate<br>change<br>mitigation<br>(5)<br>Y; N; N/EL | Climate<br>change<br>adaptation<br>(6)<br>Y; N; N/EL | Water<br>(7)<br>Y; N; N/EL | Pollution<br>(8)<br>Y; N; N/EL | Circular<br>economy<br>(9)<br>Y; N; N/EL | Bio-<br>diversity<br>(10)<br>Y; N; N/EL |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| A.

The scope and boundaries of the data can be found in the section Environment in the non-financial report. All disclosures relate exclusively to the property portfolio of S IMMO and cover 100% of the buildings within the reporting boundaries. The like-for-like comparisons (LfL) include all buildings that were part of the S IMMO portfolio in the last two reporting years. The gross leasable area was used as the metric for the calculation of the intensity ratios. As the calculation approach of the EPRA Sustainability Performance Measures within the CPI Group differs slightly from that of the other environmental key figures in this report, there may be deviations in individual key figures.\n\n| Impact area                 | EPRA Code                       | Unit             | Indicator                       | Austria          |

employer but also a provider of real estate that meets people's basic need for space to live and work. This mission gives rise to a particularly close relationship with and responsibility to our community at large. This responsibility is also reflected in the material topics our stakeholders defined during the materiality analysis conducted in 2021.\n\nThe following material topics are explained in this section:\n\n- Diversity and equal opportunities\n- Employee satisfaction and employer attractiveness\n- Training\n- Tenant satisfaction\n\nThe first three topics deal with employees, who are the lifeblood of S IMMO. After all, highly qualified and satisfied employees are an essential factor for the success of any company. Respect, trust and mutual esteem are the key pillars of social interaction at S IMMO. Qualified employees are S IMMO's most important asset. The company attaches particular importance to providing the team with a motivating working environment as well as the personal scope for development and the ability to strike a healthy balance between work and family life. This promotes team spirit and fosters a feeling of solidarity. S IMMO supports an open corporate culture in which cooperation as well as the satisfaction and health of all employees are promoted at all levels.\n\nAttaining these goals requires effective personnel management spearheaded locally by the subsidiaries at the various locations. This approach enables local managing directors to react to the needs and challenges of their local teams and provide them with support in specific issues.\n\nAs already outlined in chapter \"ESG strategy and sustainability management\", S IMMO's ESG goals were consolidated with those of Immofinanz and CPI and harmonised into a Groupwide ESG strategy in 2023. This process also led to a consolidation of the goals and measures in the social area.\n\n# Scope of reporting on social key figures\n\nS IMMO has not changed the scope of its reporting regarding employee data but there were major changes in the key figures as at 31 December 2023 compared with the previous year. This is due to the fact that at the beginning of 2023, S IMMO managed to pool the strengths in Hungary and Romania in the respective CPI subsidiaries, which now provide services for S IMMO properties in Budapest and Bucharest. As part of this process, the employees of S IMMO Hungary and S IMMO Romania were almost completely taken on by the respective CPI subsidiaries during the first quarter. As a result, there were no longer any employees at these S IMMO subsidiaries at the end of the quarter. Employees who moved within the Group during the year are included in this non-financial report on a pro rata basis. In order to avoid double counting at consolidated Group level, they are only included in all remuneration-related data in the company in which they were last employed.\n\nWhen reference is made in the following to S IMMO, all employees in Austria, Germany and Croatia are included. In contrast to the previous year, Management Board members are not included in the employee figures, resulting in changes to the previous year's figures. The employees of the two owner-operated hotels – Vienna Marriott and Budapest Marriott – are not included in the social key figures (for details, please refer section \"Scope and boundaries of the report\" of this non-financial report). If a key figure does not include all of the previously mentioned locations, this is explicitly stated in each case.\n\nAt the end of this section of the non-financial report, you will find tables with details of the social key figures.\n\n# **Employees**\n\nIn 2023, S IMMO had employees in Austria, Germany and Croatia and, until the first quarter of 2023, in Hungary and Romania. The local teams also manage business activities in Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria. Responsibility for human resources activities and compliance with all country-specific and labour-law requirements lies with the relevant subsidiaries. Moreover, team size and structure and the focus of business activities vary, sometimes substantially, from subsidiary to subsidiary, which is why uniform standards and processes relating to HR issues have not been consistently implemented across the S IMMO Group to date. S IMMO values direct channels of communication and the most immediate possible exchange of information between employees and their supervisors.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\nS IMMO's employees are the manifestation of the company's comprehensive expertise and make a significant contribution to the company's success. The Group employed an annual average of 100 people (2022: 136) on a headcount basis, excluding members of the Management Board, dormant employees and trainees. Including hotel employees, but excluding members of the Management Board, dormant employees and trainees, the annual average number of employees totalled 611 (2022: 583).\n\n# Diversity, equal opportunities and inclusion\n\nDiversity, equal opportunities and integration are key competitive advantages and fundamental tenets at S IMMO. As an internationally operating group, S IMMO employs people from many different countries. The Group considers a wealth of languages and cultures to be an extremely valuable resource. People from different backgrounds and with different perspectives encourage creativity and innovation and play a role in reducing harassment, discrimination and prejudices and promoting social cohesion.\n\nA lack of diversity can have negative impacts on the company and its business relationships. For example, a shortage of employees from a variety of cultural backgrounds or with a variety of language skills can make the cooperation with business partners in other countries more difficult. Furthermore, companies that lack diversity can be more susceptible to discrimination and employees from different groups may not feel valued or, in the worst case, not comfortable or safe.\n\nS IMMO is committed in its Code of Conduct to providing a discrimination-free work environment characterised by mutual trust in which everyone is valued and treated with dignity and respect. All people are equal and therefore enjoy the same rights and the same protection. Any discrimination on the basis of ethnic origin or nationality, language, social origin, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, political or other belief, mental or physical ability or other status is prohibited at S IMMO. It is not least against this backdrop that S IMMO is committed to respecting, protecting and promoting international human rights. For details, please see page 52 onwards.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, employees learned about the content of the applicable Code of Conduct as part of an annual training session and were made aware, among other things, that incidents of discrimination can be reported to defined contact points within the company or anonymously via the established digital whistleblower system.\n\nNo cases of discrimination on the basis of ethnic origin or nationality, language, social origin, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, political or other belief, mental or physical ability or other status in accordance with the definitions of the international frameworks forming the basis of the Code of Conduct were reported in 2023 (2022: 0).\n\nIn Austria and Germany, employees have the option to indicate other genders in addition to \"male\" and \"female\" in the human resources management system. In the reporting year, no employees have made use of this option to date, which is why only the categories \"male\" and \"female\" are indicated in the presentation of the employee data. There is currently no legal basis in Croatia for specifying gender options that are not categorised as either female or male.\n\n#### **Share of women**\n\nS IMMO AG has set itself the goal of continuously increasing the proportion of women in management positions and is expressly committed to the advancement of women. As of 31 December 2023, the proportion of female employees in the entire workforce was 50.0% (2022: 53.8%). The proportion of women across all managers was 34.8%, meaning that the Group-wide goal of 33.0% women in management positions was achieved. Broken down by employee category, 50.0% of employees in top management and 31.6% of employees in middle management and entry-level management were female.\n\nS IMMO has harmonised the definition of its employee categories with CPI and Immofinanz, which contributes to a more detailed presentation of the gender distribution. These are as follows:\n\n- Top Management: Non-Board C-Level, Country Managers\n- Middle Management: Department Heads\n- Entry-Level Management: Team Leads, Staff Unit Leads\n- Non-Management Employees: All other\n\nApproaching existing female employees for vacant positions in a targeted manner and supporting the transition to management roles through individual training will be continued. In the reporting year, three vacant management positions at the Vienna location were filled by existing female employees who previously had no management responsibility. S IMMO has set itself the internal goal of a 50% share of women in management positions and the entire workforce.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Reconciling work and family life**\n\nS IMMO is committed to the idea that a positive work-life balance is a key factor in ensuring greater motivation and dedication as well as improved performance by employees. In addition, a good work-life balance contributes substantially to equal opportunities within the company. S IMMO strives to offer all employees flexible working hours, the chance to work from home and the option of personalised working and part-time work models, including in conjunction with study or training. Since April 2023, employees with all-in contracts at the Vienna location have been able to reduce overtime worked as part of a flexitime account. This means that more labour-intensive phases can be compensated with time off and employees gain flexibility – an important step towards a healthy work-life balance. Moreover, paternal leave and sabbaticals are also supported, as are various schemes to simplify re-entry into the workplace after parental leave. These opportunities are positively viewed and very well received by S IMMO employees.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, 20.0% of staff members were employed on a part-time basis (2022: 18.5%), of whom 65.0% were women (2022: 75.0%. Correction of the 2022 figure). At the end of 2023, 100 employees were entitled to parental leave, of whom 50 were women and 50 were men (2022: 127, of which 67 women and 60 men). A total of 3 employees were on parental leave as of the reporting date of 31 December 2023, all of them women (2022: five women). In the 2023 reporting year, parental leave ended for 6 employees (five women and one man), of whom three returned to work after completing their parental leave (2022: one man). The other employees were transferred to Immofinanz as a result of the optimisation of the organisational structure mentioned above. The return to work rate is therefore 100%, or 50% if the analysis is limited to S IMMO AG (two women and one man).\n\nIt is particularly important for S IMMO that employees' families are also involved in various events. Children are happy when they get to know their parents' workplace, spouses and family members gain an understanding of the business model and contact between families strengthens team spirit and promotes identification with the company. A variety of events are organised in order to continuously encourage a feeling of togetherness. In Austria, these include an annual summer festival, to which families are also sometimes invited, a Christmas party, team excursions and joint participation in events such as the Business Run in Vienna.\n\n# Labour standards and occupational safety\n\nHealthy employees are the foundation of a successful company. This is why preserving and promoting the health of its employees is so important for S IMMO. S IMMO pledges to provide a safe and healthy working environment for all its employees and to practise accident prevention for the protection of employees, tenants and visitors.\n\n#### **Employee rights**\n\nThe company employs its staff exclusively in countries in the European Union and pledges to pay all of its employees a fair and living wage or salary and to fully respect the results of collective bargaining. Standard policies include fair work conditions and benefits based on the applicable legal entitlements (such as part-time work, job protection for expectant mothers, regular paid holiday, sick leave and paid parental leave).\n\nAt the Vienna location, there is a Works Council in place that represents the interests of employees within the company to the Management Board and is an important point of contact for employees on labour law issues. It has three members (two women and one man). The Works Council is authorised, for example, to enter into works agreements and is involved in dismissals and redundancies. In 2023, employees from the financing department were fully transferred to Immofinanz as part of an optimisation of the organisational structure agreed with Immofinanz. In addition to the HR and legal departments, the Works Council was also involved in the process in order to address potential negative effects on employees at an early stage and ensure a smooth transition.\n\nThe Management Board maintains an open relationship with the Works Council in Vienna based on a foundation of trust and conducts constructive and collaborative dialogue with this body to ensure a fair balance of interests. As a matter of course, S IMMO's corporate culture includes professional interaction with employee representatives without any preferential or disadvantageous treatment whatsoever. Moreover, two members (one woman and one man) were delegated to the Supervisory Board and one member each was delegated to the ESG and Audit Committees, thus providing additional representation of employee interests in these bodies.\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Health and safety**\n\nWith regard to employee health and occupational safety, S IMMO focuses primarily on prevention, offering employees various preventive programmes as part of the company's health services. At the Vienna location, for instance, employees can take advantage of an annual health check-up, melanoma screening and seasonal vaccinations. For this purpose, S IMMO is always looking into current and new options that can be implemented in the company health promotion plan.\n\nS IMMO ensures that local occupational safety laws are implemented in order to guarantee employee safety. These include first aid and fire prevention measures in particular. The Vienna location has a safety officer and several first-aiders on staff.\n\nThe locations in which S IMMO subsidiaries operate are wheelchair-friendly and ease of access is taken into account for all new buildings. As of 31 December 2023, a total of six people (2022: five) with long-term physical, mental or psychological impairments or impairment of their sensory functions were employed. This corresponds to 6.0% of the workforce (2022: 3.8%).\n\nThe company assesses the risk of accidents and injuries to be comparatively low for employees at S IMMO as their primary activity involves office work. Preserving and promoting the health of staff and avoiding workplace accidents and workrelated illnesses are clear goals the company pursues. However, the company considers sick days to be only minimally suitable as a performance key figure for assessing the health and well-being of employees. Employees are encouraged to recover fully from illnesses and injuries before returning to work. In addition, the company is dedicated to enabling employees to balance work and their personal lives, not least to offset stress and encourage mental health. In this context, all employees were offered an online seminar on burnout prevention in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nIn the reporting year, S IMMO collected accumulated sick leave data relating to its employees for all locations. On average, employees at all locations took 9.6 (counted from the first day) days of sick leave (2022: 9.8). An additional 5 employees were on long-term sick leave in 2023 (2022: 3). The definition of longterm sick leave is country-specific. Sick leave counted from the date on which the government, rather than the company, begins to pay continued wages is considered long-term sick leave by the company. Long-term sick leave has been taken into account up to now when calculating the average number of sick leave days in order not to distort the informative value of this figure.\n\nS IMMO recorded no work-related injuries in 2023 (2022: 0). There was one work-related illness in 2023 (2022: 0), no workplace accidents (2022: 2. Correction of the figure from 2022) and no deaths (2022: 0).\n\nIn addition to the safety of its own employees, S IMMO is also dedicated to ensuring safety at the company's construction sites. S IMMO's service providers and partner companies ensure that everyone involved in construction is protected in line with local statutory provisions. S IMMO therefore abides by high quality standards when selecting partner companies and opts for companies which attach great importance to factors such as safety in the workplace and employee protection. For example, in Germany S IMMO works in conjunction with partners who are ISO-certified in the area of energy, environmental and quality management. None of S IMMO's employees work primarily on construction sites. When selecting service providers, S IMMO will also exercise the utmost care and focus on the highest safety standards in the future.\n\nBoth management and the S IMMO team are very happy with the measures adopted in relation to occupational health and safety and will therefore continue to implement the existing measures in line with the ESG strategy.\n\n# Remuneration, training and employee loyalty\n\nMany of S IMMO's employees have completed high-quality training programmes and have many years of professional experience, which is also reflected in the statistics on age groups and years of service. The company therefore has a wealth of expertise to draw on. Attracting and retaining highly qualified and motivated employees is a major factor in the company's success. The company is negatively affected when employees of this kind leave. In addition to the loss of knowledge, a departure can also adversely affect business activities, for instance if projects are delayed as a result. Moreover, filling positions and training new employees takes up resources.\n\nWith this in mind, S IMMO actively takes measures to retain employees. A basic requirement is that all employees receive appropriate remuneration. In addition, it goes without saying that all legal regulations and requirements are meticulously fulfilled in all countries in which S IMMO has employees. Human resources management is handled locally by the individual subsidiaries so that individual employees' needs may be met optimally and to ensure that local law is followed.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Remuneration**\n\nS IMMO emphasises fair, sector-standard and competitive remuneration for its employees in order to secure the know-how within the company in the long term, but also to be perceived as an attractive employer by potential applicants. Salaries are based on strict gender equality and all employees are offered a fair basic salary.\n\nRemuneration depends on the position and professional experience and comprises a basic salary and often variable remuneration components depending on the position. Special payments such as performance bonuses, project bonuses or, in the last two years, cost-of-living bonuses are also paid on an ad hoc basis. The parameters for the variable remuneration components are determined in the course of annual performance reviews; the achievement of targets is a prerequisite for the annual bonus. To ensure comparability across years, only the basic salaries and variable remuneration components are included in the tables at the end of the chapter; special payments are not taken into account, nor are any special payments on resignation (e.g. remaining leave).\n\nBelow, the remuneration of employees in Austria and Germany is discussed. There is no disclosure of information for Croatia, as it would be possible to draw conclusions about individuals due to the small number of employees. Employees of S IMMO AG who transferred within the Group to CPI or Immofinanz in the course of the financial year 2023 are included in the respective reporting of these companies.\n\nFor the 2023 reporting year, the gender pay gap was analysed Group-wide for the first time. The gender pay gap reflects the ratio of the average total remuneration of female employees to male employees. The gender pay gap amounts to 1.42. In middle management it is 1.17 and among employees without a management function it is 1.24. Due to the small number of employees, no information is provided on employees in top management and in management at entry level.\n\nAccording to the analysis, existing differences in income between men and women are partly influenced by structural factors. At the Vienna location, for example, younger women in entry-level positions are more frequently contrasted with older men who have been with the company for longer. S IMMO will analyse the gender pay gap annually in future and is working to reduce the pay gap gradually.\n\nIn order to support employees in view of the increased inflation in the reporting year, the basic salaries of employees were adjusted to inflation.\n\n#### **Training and further education**\n\nS IMMO has identified the continuous professional development of its employees as a material topic and supports this with training and further education. Failure to provide training measures or adequate support for them can have negative impacts on employee satisfaction and consequently on productivity and staff turnover and even result in employees not possessing the required skills and knowledge to meet new challenges they may face in their departments. As part of the ESG strategy, the company has set the goal of ensuring that all employees complete at least eight hours of further training each year. In 2023, employees participated in an average of 10.1 hours of training and further education.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the primary focus is on expanding the employees' industry-specific expertise, for example through seminars from the fields of property management or ESG. The company also supports staff who wish to take advantage of coaching and language courses. The agreed training courses are provided by third-party institutions and service providers. In this context, the in-house training was expanded in 2023 with the goal of enabling knowledge existing within the company to be utilised more extensively and enhancing employees' digital skills. The digital learning platform that was introduced in the previous year was expanded to include mandatory training in the areas of compliance and IT in particular.\n\n3 apprentices underwent training at the property management company Maior Domus in Germany on average during the year under review (2022: 3). The apprentices are able to attend a private vocational college to provide them with a demanding training programme and the best possible preparation for their professional career. They spend time in all departments of the property management company as part of their three-year training programme and take on responsibility for overseeing their own properties from their second year, where they are supported by mentors. Apprentice training is an integral part of Maior Domus's human resources policy and a valuable investment in the future.\n\n#### **Employee loyalty**\n\nThe satisfaction and well-being of the team is one of S IMMO's key assets, and the greatest care will also be taken to maintain this in future. Making the best possible use of the personal strengths and potential of all employees not only is in the company's own interest, but also increases the motivation and identification of all employees with the company on a sustainable basis. S IMMO intends to remain an employer of choice and to continue to meet employee needs. S IMMO maintains a company-wide open-door policy and constantly strives to bring all kinds of conflicts to a quick and non-bureaucratic conclusion that is satisfactory to all sides.\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\nBesides ongoing communication between employees and managers, the annual employee reviews in particular provide an opportunity to address the concerns and needs of employees. In addition to goal setting, the aims of the review are, amongst others, to provide the opportunity for reciprocal feedback, to improve the quality of the cooperation between employees and their managers, to prepare employees in an efficient and targeted manner for their current and future roles and to improve the corporate culture and climate of communication. An employee review was conducted with 71.0% of employees in the reporting year (2022: 86.9%). Broken down by gender, 72.0% of female employees and 70.0% of male employees conducted such a review (2022: 81.4% of women and 93.3% of men). By employee category, 50.0% of employees in top management (2022: 50%), 52.6% of employees in middle management and entrylevel management (2022: 100%) and 76.6% of employees without a management function (2022: 87.1%) received an evaluation of their performance. The number of reviews has declined as a result of increased employee turnover, which is discussed in more detail below.\n\nIn the 2023 reporting year, 51 employees left S IMMO or its subsidiaries (2022: 19). At the beginning of 2023, 16 employees in Hungary and Romania left S IMMO. The employees of S IMMO Hungary and S IMMO Romania were almost entirely taken on by the respective local CPI subsidiaries. In addition, an optimisation of the organisational structure was agreed with Immofinanz at the Vienna location, as part of which the employees of the financing department were transferred in full to Immofinanz. Although these people are no longer employed by S IMMO, they are still part of the CPI Group. Excluding transfers within the Group, the fluctuation rate totalled 31.0%. The average period of service across all locations is 8.0 years (2022: 7.1 years).\n\n# **Tenants**\n\nAs a property holding company, tenants play a central role for S IMMO. Properties are designed for people and intended to meet their need for living and work space. S IMMO treats its tenants as equal partners and always strives for respectful dialogue and to meet tenants' needs. A positive relationship between S IMMO and its tenants is essential for the success of the business and the company's reputation.\n\n# Tenant communication\n\nS IMMO has always done its utmost to maintain a good, open and honest relationship with its tenants. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in particular, many questions remained unanswered, and the ongoing exchange of information with tenants was key to working together to quickly find suitable solutions for individual tenants. S IMMO is also meeting the current challenges resulting from rising inflation and interest rates by maintaining an ongoing and constructive dialogue with all tenants. S IMMO always strives to pursue a cooperative approach that complies with national laws – this is the only way to achieve an outcome acceptable to both parties. In this connection, the company benefits from being represented in the majority of its markets by on-site teams or otherwise by competent service providers that have often been in business for many years and that are not only fully familiar with local conditions but that can also build partnerships based on mutual trust with all stakeholders in the course of their day-to-day work.\n\nIn the context of its ESG strategy and the set goals, S IMMO is working on the introduction of Group-wide standardised green lease agreements for new commercial leases and renewals. These are lease agreements that are intended to encourage owners and tenants to jointly manage and use the properties in a way that preserves resources as much as possible. This includes, for example, provisions on the economical use of energy, water and waste as well as the exchange of data in this regard. Currently, the conclusion of this type of lease agreement is a voluntary option for S IMMO tenants. The first properties in Budapest and Vienna already saw the introduction of such green lease agreements by the end of 2023, and the level of coverage across the entire portfolio is to be gradually increased over the coming years.\n\n# Tenant satisfaction\n\nIt is particularly important for S IMMO to ensure that satisfied tenants occupy the company's properties for the long term. The company aims to achieve this goal by maintaining respectful and continual communications with tenants as equals, but especially by offering tenants a complete range of management services. A poor relationship with the tenants has the potential to exert a negative impact on the terms of tenancy agreements, vacancy rates and rental income and thus directly on S IMMO's business activities. On top of that, there is a risk to the company's reputation that could additionally complicate future lettings.\n\nDue to their in-depth knowledge of the properties and management of contacts with potential and current tenants, the local asset and portfolio management teams on-site play a key role in maintaining a positive relationship with the tenants. Further\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\nmore, S IMMO has its own property management company, Maior Domus, which manages properties and takes care of tenant matters in its real estate portfolio in Germany. Also at the other locations, tenants and properties are managed by dedicated teams, which are supported in most cases by external experts and service providers.\n\nThis approach allows S IMMO to quickly and flexibly act and react in all situations. For the company, regular dialogue and direct contact with its tenants are the foundation for long-term partnerships based on mutual trust and a key success factor. Tenant satisfaction can be assessed in the day-to-day work and by using criteria such as the rental term, the renewal of existing tenancy agreements and the success in reletting properties. The tenant satisfaction surveys planned for 2023 have been postponed for the time being in favour of other goals and measures and will be re-evaluated in 2024 with regard to implementation.\n\n# Building certifications\n\nOne of the biggest levers S IMMO as a real estate company has for making a significant contribution to a sustainable economy and society lies in designing the construction, operation and modernisation of the properties in a way that conserves as many resources, produces as few emissions and is as userfriendly as possible. This is why the Group started the step-bystep certification of its properties using internationally recognised certification frameworks for buildings with environmental and social characteristics – known as green buildings – in 2012. All S IMMO's development projects are now planned and implemented in accordance with these standards. Furthermore, acquisitions of properties are also evaluated with a view to certification or their ability to be certified. As part of the Groupwide ESG strategy, S IMMO has set itself the goal of further increasing the proportion of buildings certified according to Access4you, BREEAM, DGNB, EDGE, Green Key, Green Star, HQE, LEED and WELL, having significantly exceeded the previous year's target of 40% for commercial properties.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, S IMMO's property portfolio that was certified under BREEAM, LEED and WELL comprised a total of 34 properties (2022: 23) with a gross leasable area of 726,414 m² (2022: 496,375 m²) in Brno, Budapest, Bucharest, Hradec Králové, Prague, Vienna and Zagreb. This corresponds to 49.2% (2022: 34.8%) of the gross leasable area of the entire portfolio and a year-on-year increase of 46.3%. This also means that, as of the reporting date, 53.8% of the gross leasable area of commercial properties in the portfolio was certified in accordance with green building (2022: 45.4%). This further increase was achieved due to the fact that many of the buildings acquired in the year under review have green building certifications and non-certified properties were sold at the same time. The company also plans to continue to increase the proportion of certified properties through acquisitions, developments and modernisations.\n\nThe proceeds from the two green bonds issued by S IMMO in 2021 and 2022, which total EUR 95.5m following a partial repayment as a result of a change of control event in June 2022, went in their entirety into the (re)financing of acquisitions of properties certified as green buildings and were allocated in full as of the reporting date of 31 December 2022. In July 2023, S IMMO issued a third green bond in the amount of EUR 75m.\n\n# **Stakeholders and society**\n\nS IMMO takes care to cultivate relationships with its stakeholders and enable them to personally share their views and experiences. The Annual General Meeting was held as an in-person event in May 2023. In addition, many individual discussions were held with investors in 2023 – some in virtual form – while the Management Board and the Investor Relations team also took part in several roadshows. S IMMO was also invited as speaker to several ESG events and was thus able to actively contribute to the discourse on greater sustainability in the real estate industry.\n\n# Stakeholder communication\n\nContinual dialogue with various stakeholder groups is important to S IMMO. Regular communication allows the company to identify the needs and concerns as well as feedback and complaints of the stakeholders – whether they are shareholders, tenants, employees or other stakeholders – and to respond to these as quickly as possible. This has a positive effect on key performance indicators, such as the share price, the turnover rate or the occupancy rate, and can play a part in identifying potentially negative impacts for or caused by S IMMO.\n\nS IMMO is also responsible for negative effects on individual stakeholders in its day-to-day business. While the company endeavours to keep these potential effects to a minimum, it also ensures that the exchange with its dialogue groups always includes the opportunity to submit complaints and critical concerns. The large number of stakeholders, the diversity of their potential concerns and the fact that there is usually already direct contact with a department led S IMMO to decide to rely on the channels and contacts already established for receiving complaints.\n\nStakeholder concerns can be raised in person, by telephone or in writing with S IMMO employees, who will process these concerns themselves or forward them to the relevant internal department, depending on the specific issue and severity. It is also possible to contact the company as a whole, in particular via the public telephone number and the email address office@simmoag.at. Processing takes place in compliance with \n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nany applicable legal deadlines and can be carried out in the national language commonly spoken at the respective company location as well as in English. Critical concerns that have a potentially negative impact on the organisation or stakeholders are reported to the Management Board and, if necessary, also communicated to the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, the Compliance Management function and the digital and anonymous whistleblower system on S IMMO's website are available to all stakeholders in the event of compliance or other serious allegations.\n\nThe teams in the company's markets are familiar with local conditions and in some cases have long-standing relationships with the relevant stakeholders. Respectful interaction and communication with all stakeholder groups as equals is the foundation for successful cooperation. In this context, it is important for S IMMO to be aware of the needs of all stakeholders, to take their opinions seriously and – if necessary – to respond promptly and comprehensively to complaints.\n\nThe company communicates with individual stakeholder groups through the relevant departments or the local teams. A materiality analysis conducted in 2021 identified the following stakeholder groups whose influence on and interest in the company is particularly large. The details of the process for identifying the relevant stakeholders are explained in depth from page 4 onwards.\n\n- Supervisory Board\n- Management Board\n- Local managing directors\n- Employees\n- Works Council\n- Tenants and brokers\n- Core shareholders\n- Institutional investors\n- Small investors\n- Banks and analysts\n\nA constructive partnership between the Management Board and the Supervisory Board that is based on transparency is key to maintaining a rigorous corporate strategy. The Management Board provides the Supervisory Board at its meetings with detailed information on all the relevant business areas. In addition, the Supervisory Board is notified, also at short notice and if possible immediately, of all developments that are critical for the management of the company.\n\nThe employees are informed about recent developments using established channels of communication. In specific instances, the Management Board addressed the team in real time in order to provide information and context for the current situation. Moreover, employees are always free to meet one-on-one with the Management Board members. As the representative of the employees' interests at the Vienna location, the Works Council has the opportunity to present employee concerns to the Management Board as well as to the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn order to ensure optimal tenant satisfaction, S IMMO maintains an ongoing dialogue with its tenants and agents, while its local teams serve as their expert point of contact on site. These teams seek solutions that are individually tailored to meet our tenants' needs. Thanks to the close contact and regular dialogue, the expectations on the company as well as tenant satisfaction are met and continually improved on. For more information on this, please see the section on tenant satisfaction.\n\nThe company has a responsibility to core shareholders, institutional investors and small investors alike. S IMMO maintains a direct dialogue with the capital markets during its Annual General Meeting, roadshows, investor conferences and personal meetings. Regular communication with service providers, lending banks, analyst firms, brokers, etc. also forms part of our day-to-day business activities. S IMMO places great value on transparency and communication on an equal footing in all of its business relationships.\n\n# Partnerships and memberships\n\nS IMMO uses partnerships and memberships to meet its social responsibility in terms of sustainability at the sector and economic level and to promote dialogue between companies and organisations. As a long-standing member of the Austrian Business Council for Sustainable Development (respACT), the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) and the Austrian Sustainable Building Council (ÖGNI), the company is committed to the transfer of knowledge to increase sustainability. These partnerships will also be continued in 2024. In addition, the Management Board and the ESG & Sustainability department spoke at several ESG events about S IMMO's experience in dealing with sustainability challenges and contributed to the exchange of information within the industry and beyond.\n\n# Commitment to society and the local community\n\nS IMMO is pursuing its commitment to taking responsibility beyond its core business by supporting charitable projects in the countries in which it operates. In doing so, S IMMO focuses on long-term partnerships in order to contribute to development and change as sustainably as possible. In 2023, the longstanding partnership with Caritas Socialis was continued, in particular through support for the hospice. In addition, the company once again supported various Caritas projects in Austria, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria that aim to give young people prospects for the future and people in need a home under the guiding principle of \"giving shelter\".\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition, the \"Our House\" community centre in Hungary supports socially disadvantaged children and young people from the Roma minority, who are often affected by poverty and unemployment. A family children's home in Stremț (Romania), four houses of hope for children and young people in Alba Iulia (Romania) and a centre in the Bulgarian village of Pokrovan, which has long been affected by high levels of emigration, leaving many residents living in loneliness and poverty, are also supported.\n\nAs part of the traditional Christmas campaign in 2023, S IMMO supported neunerimmo, a non-profit subsidiary of the Viennese social organisation neunerhaus, which enables homeless people and those at risk of poverty to lead a self-determined and dignified life by providing affordable housing and advice.\n\nIn 2023, S IMMO was once again active in the art sector by providing facilities at Mariahilfer Strasse 103 for the 17th time for the Vienna Art Supermarket (Kunstsupermarkt), which once again proved very popular. From October 2023 to March 2024, numerous originals and unique pieces by both young, unknown and internationally renowned artists were once again exhibited and sold at modest prices. The Vienna Art Supermarket offers a low-threshold alternative to the traditional art trade for all those interested. In addition, the long-standing partnership with the Dom Museum Wien was also continued.\n\nFurthermore, S IMMO once again supported the International Summer Academy hosted by the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna (mdw Universität für Musik und darstellende Kunst Wien) by providing the Vienna Classical Music Awards and the OeAD's Green.Building.Solutions. Summer University, which focused on the topic of more sustainable construction, with a scholarship.\n\n# **Social key figures**\n\n#### Total number of employees by gender1\n\n|

Thereby, these rates represent the number of respective cases per one million hours worked. A rate based on 1,000,000 hours worked indicates the number of work-related injuries per 500 full-time people in the workforce over a one-year timeframe.

Handling the capital provided sustainably and with integrity is a key part of the company's corporate self image. This responsibility is fulfilled both by the in-house team and in the context of cooperation with our business partners. In addition to the section below, the corporate governance report (see annual report from page 21) and the Code of Conduct, the Organisational Policy for Human Rights, the Organisational Policy for Issuer Compliance and the Organisational Policy for the Prevention of Bribery, Acceptance of Benefits and Corruption are available on the Group's website (www.simmoag.at/ sustainability/governance) for further information.\n\nThis section deals with the topics of digitalisation and sustainable value enhancement, which were identified as material in the course of the materiality analysis conducted in 2021.\n\n# **Responsible governance**\n\nS IMMO has now been pursuing a prudent and proven business policy for 35 years. Sustainable value enhancement in the interest of shareholders is a key aspect of the corporate strategy. The company's business activities are not geared towards short-term profits but pursue balanced and consistent development that takes into consideration both financial success and social and ecological impacts. Details of the business model can be found in the Group fundamentals section starting on page 92 in the annual report.\n\nThe company plays its part in local value creation through its business activities by promoting economic and infrastructure development and creating and securing jobs by providing properties that are in line with demand. From the revenues that are generated, taxes are paid in turn to the states in which the company actively operates.\n\nThe focus of companies on making profits, however, can also have negative impacts on people and the environment. The most significant of these include negative impacts on employees and pressures on the environment and climate. As explained in the other sections of this non-financial report, the company has set itself the goal of continually identifying and minimising any negative impacts it creates.\n\nAlong with a corporate culture geared towards fairness and equality, S IMMO maintains clear guidelines as well as companywide standards and pursues a transparent information and training policy in order to make all relevant parties aware of governance-related issues. Since 2007, S IMMO AG has been committed to observing the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance (for details, please see the corporate governance report), which contains principles on transparency and good corporate governance. The Management Board has brought the company's corporate governance into line with the principles of the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance and, in conjunction with the Supervisory Board, declares that the company observes and complies with the C Rules of the Code (deviations from the C Rules are also explained in the corporate governance report). Furthermore, S IMMO is also covered by CPI's participation in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC).\n\n# Shareholders\n\nThe rights and obligations of shareholders arise from the Austrian Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the Articles of Association of S IMMO (www.simmoag.at/corporategovernance). The main rights include the right to profit-sharing and the right to participate in, vote and receive information at the Annual General Meeting. Shareholders with shareholdings above clearly defined thresholds also have rights such as the right to add items to the agenda. All rights of shareholders are published annually on the website in the notice of convening of the Annual General Meeting.\n\nDetails of the shareholder structure and the company's Investor Relations activities can be found in the \"S IMMO in the capital market\" section and at www.simmoag.at/share.\n\n# Management Board\n\nIn line with the Austrian Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Management Board of S IMMO runs the company under its own responsibility, taking the interests of all stakeholders into account. The Management Board is in charge of the operational management team, which is responsible in turn for the various divisions and functions. This cooperation is based on a constant, open exchange of information and short decision-making channels. The Supervisory Board is responsible for appointing the Management Board. In doing so, it pays particular attention to market expertise, experience, relevant skills and an appropriate track record. The key consideration regarding the composition \n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\nof the Management Board is that a wide range of skills must be covered while ensuring cordial and targeted cooperation.\n\nS IMMO is committed to performance-oriented remuneration in line with market conditions for its Management Board members with the aim of enabling the company to attract qualified managers and retain their services. In spring 2020, the S IMMO Supervisory Board set out the principles for the remuneration of members of the Management Board (remuneration policy) in accordance with section 78a AktG. This remuneration policy was submitted to and adopted by the 31st Annual General Meeting of S IMMO in October 2020 (www.simmoag.at/agm) with a majority of 75.58% of the vote.\n\nThe remuneration policy ensures that the total pay of the members of the Management Board is commensurate with the situation of the company and customary remuneration, that longterm incentives for sustainable corporate development are set and that the company's business strategy and long-term development are furthered. The aim is to create sustainable, valuecreating and growth-oriented corporate development by reconciling the interests of the company, shareholders and members of the Management Board. Based on this remuneration policy, a remuneration report is submitted to the Annual General Meeting each year and is published on the company's website (www.simmoag.at/agm) no later than three weeks before the respective Annual General Meeting. The remuneration report must be approved by the Annual General Meeting; the results of the vote are published on the company's website after the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe remuneration report presents the main features of the remuneration policy for the Management Board and Supervisory Board of S IMMO AG in the past financial year. In addition, the remuneration paid to current and former members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board during the reporting year is disclosed individually. Also disclosed is the average salary of all employees as well as the percentage increase yearon-year and in comparison to the Management Board salaries.\n\nIn line with its ESG strategy, S IMMO has set itself the goal of increasing the share of variable Management Board remuneration tied to ESG criteria. In 2022, the share was increased from 10% to the current 20%, and by 2025 it should be at least 25%.\n\n# Supervisory Board\n\nThe structure, composition and allocation of responsibilities of the Supervisory Board and the diversity concept of the company are set out in detail in the Supervisory Board report (see annual report from page 18) and the corporate governance report (see annual report from page 21). Since 2021, the Supervisory Board has had its own ESG Committee, which deals predominantly with the strategy and objectives in relation to sustainability criteria. In keeping with this, a member of the Management Board was also explicitly assigned to ESG matters in the same year.\n\nCollectively, the Supervisory Board has the relevant experience and expertise in the international property sector, finance sector, capital markets and law that are required in order to perform all its supervisory duties effectively. Accordingly, when looking for new members of the Supervisory Board, it prioritises the expertise required to strengthen the Supervisory Board, taking the avoidance of conflicts of interest and the number of existing Supervisory Board appointments into account in the selection process.\n\nMembers are elected to the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting. Under the Articles of Association of S IMMO, no shareholder has the right to nominate a member of the Supervisory Board for appointment. The CVs and declarations pursuant to section 87 (2) AktG are published on the issuer's website in good time before the Annual General Meeting. In accordance with the statutory provisions, the Works Council is also entitled to delegate Supervisory Board members from among its own members.\n\nThe term of office of all Supervisory Board members is published on the company's website (www.simmoag.at/boards), and the number of members who have declared themselves independent is disclosed in the corporate governance report starting on page 22 of the annual report.. Business relationships with related parties, including with members of the Supervisory Board, require the approval of the Supervisory Board and are disclosed on page 177 of the annual report.. Transactions undertaken by the Management Board, members of the Supervisory Board or related parties involving securities of S IMMO are reported as directors' dealings and published on S IMMO's website (www.simmoag.at/corporategovernance).\n\nS IMMO regularly conducts internal evaluations of the Supervisory Board's work – in particular the composition and activities of the Supervisory Board and its committees as well as cooperation with the Management Board. The last self-evaluation was carried out in 2022. As the current Supervisory Board was only constituted at the end of January 2024, an evaluation by the Supervisory Board is planned for the financial year 2025.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Compliance**\n\nThe observance of internationally applicable rules, the fair treatment of stakeholders and transparent communication with all target groups are basic cornerstones of S IMMO's corporate culture. As a listed company, S IMMO is subject to the provisions of Austrian and European capital market legislation. It has also established a Code of Conduct as well as binding guidelines which lay down principles of conduct for business activity on a Group-wide basis.\n\nThe members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board must make their decisions without being influenced by their own interests or those of controlling shareholders, on an informed basis and in compliance with all relevant legislation. Any conflicts of interest must be disclosed immediately, and executive functions – including those of senior management – at other companies must be approved by the Management Board and/ or Supervisory Board. The statutory prohibition on competition also applies. Critical issues such as complaints or processes with potentially negative consequences for the organisation or stakeholders must be reported to the Management Board and may also need to be communicated to the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn 2023, there were no cases of compliance violations, allegations of corruption or cases leading to disciplinary measures, legal proceedings or the termination of an employment relationship. Similarly, no critical issues were reported. In addition, no supplier contracts had to be terminated on account of breaches of the compliance guidelines. S IMMO was not required to pay any fines in connection with cases of corruption or breaches of competition law in the reporting year.\n\n# Code of Conduct and whistleblowing\n\nS IMMO has a Group-wide Code of Conduct that obliges all executive bodies and employees to act in accordance with the company's ethical standards. With reference to the corresponding organisational policies, this Code of Conduct provides the overriding regulations on the prevention of corruption, ensuring issuer compliance and safeguarding human rights, as well as taking environmental concerns into account. In this Code of Conduct, S IMMO has additionally undertaken not to make political contributions or donations to political parties or to engage in political lobbying.\n\nIf employees become aware of any demonstrable or potential violations of the Code of Conduct, they must immediately report them to Compliance Management at S IMMO or submit a corresponding anonymous notification via the digital whistleblower system that is publicly accessible on the company's website. Reported incidents are treated in confidence, and whistleblowers are guaranteed anonymity.\n\nIn line with the goals of S IMMO's ESG strategy, mandatory training on all relevant compliance issues was provided in the form of online courses in the financial year 2023. Among other things, employees were familiarised with the content and areas of application of the Group-wide Code of Conduct, associated policies and the available mechanisms for reporting violations and for whistleblowing. An explicit acknowledgement of the Code of Conduct was also required. These training courses were introduced in 2022 and will be continued annually in the future in order to promote the permanent anchoring of the key principles in the awareness and actions of all employees.\n\n# Human rights\n\nS IMMO is aware that it comes into direct and indirect contact with questions relating to human rights as a result of its business activity. An organisational policy introduced in 2022 established common procedural processes in the area of human rights management and integrated relevant human rights issues into S IMMO's active risk management.\n\nS IMMO is committed to respecting, protecting and promoting international human rights in the course of all of its activities and does not tolerate any form of discrimination. This involves preventing and dealing with human rights violations that may arise as a result of the company's activities on the one hand and, on the other, investing efforts in preventing or mitigating any negative impacts on human rights that may arise in the course of direct business relationships. S IMMO has undertaken to maintain a work environment that is characterised by mutual trust, in which diversity and inclusion are valued and in which everyone is treated with dignity and respect. S IMMO complies with laws and regulations on the protection of human rights, fair working conditions and other provisions of labour law and refers here explicitly to\n\n- the International Bill of Human Rights, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,\n- the Fundamental Principles and Core Labour Standards of the International Labour Organisation (ILO),\n- the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and\n- the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises\n\nas frameworks for defining its publicly available organisational policy on human rights, which governs its Group-wide approach \n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\nto human rights issues. This relates to how human rights are embedded in the organisation and operations and also includes the existing complaint mechanisms and the procedures for monitoring effectiveness and publishing disclosures.\n\nThe employees and the members of the executive bodies of S IMMO are required by the company's Code of Conduct to observe the precepts of this organisational policy and the rights and principles it contains in their day-to-day activities. Furthermore, S IMMO expects its non-Group service providers and suppliers, irrespective of their size, to observe the contents of this policy. A commitment from these external business partners is currently not yet required, but the preparation of a declaration to this effect is planned.\n\nThe implementation of human rights does not fall under the company's active sphere of influence in all cases, as most of the requirements have to be established and maintained at the state level. S IMMO has therefore identified human rights issues that it classes as particularly relevant and actively addresses in relation to its business activities and supply chains. A selection of these issues is listed below in line with the scope of application at S IMMO and briefly defined from the company's perspective. A general overview can be found in the relevant organisational policy at www.simmoag.at/sustainability/governance.\n\nS IMMO is committed to equal treatment and prohibits any discrimination on the basis of ethnic origin or nationality, language, social origin, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, political or other belief, mental or physical ability or other status. Sexual harassment, hatred and war propaganda of any kind are also prohibited. S IMMO protects the rights of ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities and recognises the freedom of thought, conscience and religion of every individual.\n\nS IMMO also recognises the right to just and favourable conditions of work and social security and undertakes to pay its employees a fair and living wage or salary and to fully respect both the right to and the results of collective bargaining. The company is committed to freedom of association and ensures that the interests of its employees are represented by the Works Council, which they freely elect. S IMMO's corporate culture includes professional interaction with employee representatives without any preferential or disadvantageous treatment whatsoever. The company maintains an open relationship with the Works Council based on a foundation of trust and conducts constructive and collaborative dialogue with this body in order to pursue a fair balance of interests. As of 31 December 2023, only the location in Vienna had a Works Council.\n\nThe company prohibits all forms of exploitation and explicitly forbids slavery, torture, forced and compulsory labour as well as child labour. Violations of occupational health and safety provisions or of employee rights are not permitted. Everyone has a right to physical and mental health, while mothers enjoy special protection for a reasonable period before and after giving birth. Everyone has the right to file a complaint in the event of a violation of human rights, and employees are required to report complaints and suspected incidents involving actual and potential human rights violations through the complaint mechanisms established for this purpose.\n\nThe Management Board of S IMMO has adopted and supports this organisational policy. The operational implementation and continual guarantee of human rights due diligence is the responsibility of S IMMO's Compliance Management, a Groupwide function that is currently performed by one of the members of the Management Board. This includes both the ongoing identification and assessment of actual and potential human rights violations in accordance with the precautionary principle and the initiation and follow-up of preventive, mitigation and remedial measures within the company's sphere of influence, if necessary in consultation with the rest of the Management Board and in so far as this lies within the company's control. In order to identify and address specific issues in the best possible way, Compliance Management coordinates closely with the Group departments or local management of the S IMMO branches when necessary.\n\nThe central point of contact for all complaints and suspicious activity reports regarding actual and potential human rights violations is S IMMO's Compliance Management. In addition, the local management in the branches can also be contacted as the first authority. An anonymous report can also be submitted via the Group's digital whistleblower system. All three channels are always open to employees and non-employees alike. All reported incidents are received by Compliance Management and are treated confidentially and with the assurance that anonymity is guaranteed. Once an incident is confirmed, possible countermeasures are identified. At least one additional member of the Management Board will be involved in this process.\n\nShould several human rights violations occur at the same time, the violations that involve serious and time-critical impacts will be prioritised. These complaint mechanisms pursue the goal of meeting the requirements of legitimacy, accessibility, predictability, equitability, transparency and compatibility with human rights at all times. The type of measures that are taken is decided entirely on a case-by-case basis and is determined individu\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\nally in accordance with applicable law and, where possible, in dialogue with the parties concerned.\n\nS IMMO's Compliance Management continuously documents actual and potential human rights violations that are identified, complaints that are received and measures that are implemented. This also includes measures for actively promoting human rights regardless of any complaints and suspicious activity reports as well as the further development of this organisational policy in general terms. This information, in particular the number of complaints that are received and confirmed and the measures that are implemented, is published annually in anonymised form. Cases are also processed internally in accordance with the confidentiality principle as learning examples in order to prevent similar cases from recurring as far as possible.\n\nIn the reporting year, no complaints or suspicious activity reports were received and no human rights violations were identified at S IMMO's branches.\n\nSince 2022, employees have received annual training on the contents and implementation of the organisational policy on human rights as well as on the digital whistleblower system, which plays a key role in the anonymous reporting of human rights violations.\n\n# Prevention of bribery and corruption\n\nS IMMO AG has a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to bribery, the acceptance of benefits and corruption. Corruption is typically defined as exploiting a position to benefit oneself, often at the expense of others. It is characterised by the abuse of a public role or comparable business function. Corruption entails financial losses but also dramatically undermines trust among customers and suppliers and jeopardises the company's competitive edge, and hence the jobs it provides. A binding guideline adopted by the Management Board governs the structural and procedural measures for preventing bribery, acceptance of benefits and corruption, and is also geared towards raising employees' awareness of the consequences of corruption and the opportunities to combat it. In addition, financial support for lobbying and political parties is strictly prohibited under the guideline and is not practised in any form whatsoever by S IMMO. Operational implementation of the measures is the responsibility of the Compliance Management function, which is currently performed by a Management Board member. Official S IMMO contact persons are available to all employees at their request and when a violation is suspected. Compliance violations can also be reported by contacting the local management team. As part of the Group-wide risk assessment, the company has reviewed the risks in the area of bribery, the acceptance of benefits and corruption and generally considers them to be low.\n\nAs in the year prior, an online course on the prevention of bribery, acceptance of benefits and corruption was held in the fourth quarter of 2023. Participants were informed about the applicable anti-corruption guidelines and how employees can recognise and prevent cases of corruption. A total of 76 employees took part in the training course, which corresponds to a participation rate of 87.4%. In total, 1 employee in top management (participation rate 50.0%), 11 employees in middle management (participation rate 78.6%), 5 employees in entry-level management (participation rate 100.0%) and 59 employees without a management function (participation rate 89.4%) completed the training course. Broken down by country, the number of participants was divided between 31 employees in Austria (participation rate 91.2%) and 45 employees in Germany (participation rate 86.5%). There were no participants in Croatia (participation rate 0%). In addition, two members of the Management Board (participation rate 100%) and three members of the Supervisory Board (participation rate 50%) took part in this training.\n\nIn addition, the Group-wide Organisational Policy for Issuer Compliance is binding for all employees, regulates the handling of insider information and the management of capital market compliance, and explains the legal consequences of abusing insider information. Employees also received training on this topic as part of an online course and a hybrid event. No cases of corruption or breaches of issuer compliance were reported in the reporting year.\n\n# Taxes and fair competition\n\nThe management approach to tax compliance at S IMMO is based on a commercially-oriented tax strategy with the overriding goal of complying with applicable tax regulations in all of our countries in a transparent manner. This strategy is monitored by the Management Board, and significant tax-relevant business transactions must be approved by the Management Board. In order to achieve this goal, S IMMO's internal tax department is integrated into business-related processes. The tax department is staffed with experienced tax experts at the headquarters and involving external tax experts if required. Reporting is made directly to the Management Board and the tax department is involved in the approval process for relevant business decisions in a standardised manner.\n\nThe tax compliance process includes a dual control mechanism, as external advisers are involved in the preparation process of tax returns. In addition, tax risk reporting is collected throughout the Group and each company is critically analysed \n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\nin terms of its tax risk level including ongoing reporting of all tax audits and litigation. The success of this low-risk approach has been evident in all previous tax audits, where no material findings have been identified.\n\nIn addition to local tax requirements, S IMMO also carefully observes international reporting requirements, for example the requirements of the DAC 6 EU Directive are monitored periodically. As CPI Property Group S.A. acquired a majority shareholding in both IMMOFINANZ AG and S IMMO AG in 2022, the relevant revenue threshold of EUR 750m for country-by-country reporting (CbCR) requirements was exceeded for the first time. Accordingly, from 2022 on S IMMO and its group companies are subject to CbCR requirements and fully comply with them. In addition, transfer price documentation is prepared annually in accordance with OECD principles.\n\nAll income in the S IMMO Group – in particular rental income, capital gains and internal financial income – is generated and taxed exclusively in Austria and in the operating country companies.\n\nS IMMO is subject to the CPI's Group Competition Law Compliance Policy and all S IMMO employees were familiarised with the content and principles of fair competition as part of an online training course in 2023. At the same time, there were no violations of competition law in the past year.\n\n# Digitalisation, data protection and IT security\n\nS IMMO deals intensively with the opportunities and risks of digitalisation in light of the company's activities and workflows. The issue of digitalisation is anchored in the structure of the Management Board's IT responsibilities. The aim is to continue to develop the company from a process-led to a data-led organisation in the medium term. External consulting firms and IT service providers are also involved in this process in addition to the Management Board and internal experts. At the beginning of this development, the focus was primarily on IT governance and IT security matters as well as collaboration processes. In the 2023 reporting year, more extensive projects were implemented in the areas of data and document management as well as automated reporting routines, the latter primarily against the backdrop of faster and standardised data exchange with CPI and Immofinanz. For this purpose, a data lake was set up and linked with existing software solutions and proprietary dashboards in order to create a harmonised data landscape across all systems within S IMMO Group and to generate information for reporting and strategic decision-making.\n\nDigitalisation enables work processes and workflows to be optimised and automated and employees' skills to be enhanced. These measures aim to raise productivity and efficiency and strengthen synergies in the collaboration with CPI and Immofinanz. The digitalisation initiative additionally aims to play a part in ensuring competitiveness and to increase flexibility of companies and employees in a changing business and working world. The company is aware that increased flexibility might also have a negative impact on work-life balance.\n\nS IMMO also sees potential in the digitalisation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions resulting from business trips and other travel. Virtual meetings have a role to play in saving costs and emissions by reducing the need for travel. These meetings do not require additional IT equipment to be purchased to any significant extent, meaning that S IMMO will not make materially negative contributions to electronic waste or increased energy consumption in this regard. If new company mobile phones, laptops and other devices have to be purchased, the emphasis will be placed on high-quality products with a long useful life. Old devices that are still serviceable will be given to an external company, which will refurbish and sell them to private users at affordable prices. The product lifecycle of the IT equipment can be extended in this way.\n\nRespecting personal privacy and protecting data are key issues for S IMMO and its stakeholders. Special importance is attached here to protecting the personal data of employees, tenants and business partners. The theft or loss of personal data can have a negative impact on the company and have a lasting effect on the foundation of trust between the company and its stakeholder groups. Business operations can grind to a halt if companies lose business data or are permanently or even only temporarily prevented from accessing it by third parties. This can also tarnish the company's reputation.\n\nThe issue of data protection is anchored in the structure of the Management Board's legal responsibilities. In operational terms, a designated person working with the Legal, IT and Corporate Communications and Investor Relations departments has operational responsibility for creating and implementing internal data protection policies and updating the processing register that documents flows of personal data. This person is an important internal point of contact for employees and other stakeholders in matters involving data protection law. In addition, decisions of the Austrian Data Protection Authority (DSB) along with recent developments are monitored and, if necessary, external legal experts are consulted. The Works Council of S IMMO AG is also included in meetings when necessary in order to ensure that the interests and rights of the employees are represented. In the context of the \n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\nextensive digitalisation efforts, there is also a company agreement that regulates the restriction of access to employees' personal data. As in the previous year, employees were trained in the company's IT and data protection policy as well as cybersecurity and data security topics as part of mandatory online courses in 2023. There were no complaints regarding violations of the GDPR by S IMMO in the financial year 2023.\n\nSecure IT infrastructure and protection against cybercrime are critically important for guaranteeing that both personal and business data and processes remain protected. The IT department at S IMMO is responsible for providing state-of-the-art IT infrastructure and reports directly to the Management Board. IT is additionally supported by renowned IT service providers. S IMMO implements a large number of measures and solutions to prevent breaches of the confidentiality, availability or integrity of business data as a result of unauthorised disclosures, encryption or losses. For example, S IMMO has a central user and log management system and runs an intelligent cyberdefence program and other programs to automatically identify data security risks around the clock. Moreover, hard drives, data storage media and mobile devices are encrypted and servers are hosted in a fail-safe data centre of an external service provider. The latest hardware is always used, while operating systems and software are regularly updated. The company's IT and data protection policy is constantly being developed and also covers the topic of data security.\n\nIn 2022, a penetration test was carried out by an external service provider, which is to be repeated in 2024 after some changes were made to the IT infrastructure in the reporting year. Attacks on the system were simulated in the course of this test in order to identify vulnerabilities and gaps in security and to assess the system security. Concrete measures to enhance the resilience of the IT systems were derived from the test results and subsequently implemented. Furthermore, additional security updates were carried out on the IT systems. No cyberattacks on S IMMO's IT infrastructure were recorded in 2023. There were also no leaks, thefts or loss of personal data.\n\n# Supply chain management\n\nThe suppliers commissioned by S IMMO are highly diversified and range from construction firms, property management companies and consultants to insurance providers and banks. The company is committed to the prudent, responsible selection of business partners, and takes particular care to reduce risks arising from child labour, forced labour and other social neglect or inequality. It works with well-known, recognised partners following a corresponding selection process. Business relationships are based on clear contractual conditions and regulations, with compliance with the high legal standards and provisions within the European Union being required as an absolute minimum. Along with the responsible selection of suppliers, the constant exchange of information with all service providers also plays a key role in the prevention of supply chain risks.\n\nCompared with buying, selling and letting properties, the issue of the supply chain in the context of construction activity is much more complex. The structures in the construction sector and the involvement of numerous companies and suppliers make it more difficult to monitor compliance with social and environmental standards. In particular, negative impacts can potentially arise in connection with transportation, space requirements and the disposal of problematic materials as well as violations of employment and social law.\n\nAlthough construction activity currently plays a secondary role in S IMMO's business activities, the company makes efforts to actively reduce any risks. To this end, S IMMO also relies on highly regarded and long-standing business partners in development and construction projects. As part of the joint ESG strategy, together with CPI and Immofinanz the company intends to draw up a Code of Conduct for Suppliers that will define social and environmental standards and be an integral part of new contracts. S IMMO regards this as another opportunity to contribute to a more environmentally sound and socially responsible property sector.\n\nThere was one significant change in the supply chains during the reporting period. In Romania, Slovakia and Hungary, local CPI subsidiaries have taken over asset management and, in some cases, property management services for S IMMO's properties there, replacing S IMMO subsidiaries and external service providers. CPI is also entrusted with such tasks for the properties acquired in the Czech Republic during the reporting year, while the properties acquired on Wienerberg in Vienna are managed by Immofinanz. In all cases, the local expertise and familiarity of the people managing the properties should enable synergies to be leveraged and the organisation to be streamlined as part of closer cooperation within the Group.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **GRI content index**\n\nS IMMO AG has reported the information cited in this GRI content index for the period from 01 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 in accordance with the GRI Standards.
