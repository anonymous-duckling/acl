This obligation applies for the first time for the 2023 fiscal year, in addition to the information related to eligible and aligned activities required in 2022 associated with the climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation objectives. Consequently, no comparative information on eligibility has been included in the accompanying NFIS in relation to the other environmental objectives listed above or to the new activities included in the 15 climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation objectives. Furthermore, inasmuch as the information relating to 2022 was not required to be as detailed as in 2023, the disclosures included in the accompanying NFIS are not strictly comparable. In addition, the directors of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. have included information on the criteria which, in their opinion, allow them to comply better with these obligations and which are defined in the \"EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Finances\" section of the accompanying NFIS.

Introduction**\n\nThis non-financial information statement, which forms part of the consolidated directors' report of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. and subsidiaries, is published in compliance with Law 11/2018 of 28 December 2018, amending the Commercial Code, the Revised Spanish Companies Act approved by Royal Legislative Decree 1/2010 of 2 July 2010 and Spanish Audit Law 22/2015 of 20 July 2015, on non-financial and diversity information (Non-Financial Information and Diversity Law).\n\nCorporación Financiera Alba, S.A. is an investment firm which holds significant interests in various listed and unlisted companies operating in different sectors of the economy and owns real estate assets. Stakes in companies are also acquired through venture capital activities. The group, whose parent is Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A., includes Deyá Capital IV, SCR, S.A., Alba Europe, S.à.r.l., Alba Investments, S.à.r.l., Alba Patrimonio Inmobiliario, S.A.U., Alba KKR Core International, SCA and Alba KKR Core International Blocker, S.à.r.l. (hereinafter, Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A., and collectively, **Alba** or the **Company**).\n\nIn relation to the scope of this non-financial information statement for 2023, in March 2023 Alba sold its entire interest in the subsidiary Artá Partners, S.A., which owns 100% of the shares of the venture capital management company Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U.\n\nAs a result of the loss of control over this company, Alba no longer exercises control over Nuadi, Facundo and Gesdocument (the **Subsidiaries**), and therefore, from the date of the sale, these subgroups are no longer considered Alba companies.\n\nThus, the information contained in this non-financial information statement in relation to the Subsidiaries is limited to the first quarter of 2023.\n\nHereinafter, Alba and its Subsidiaries shall be referred to collectively as the **Companies.**\n\nThis report also includes the EU Taxonomy report.\n\n# <span id=\"page-276-1\"></span>**1.1. About the non-financial information statement and its progress**\n\nThis non-financial information statement includes information on 2023 and is the fifth report prepared by Alba in accordance with the aforementioned regulations, having previously prepared four sustainability reports, from 2015 to 2018.\n\nDue to the loss of control of the three Alba Subsidiaries mentioned in the previous section, the quantitative information reflected in the previous non-financial information statement (2022) is not comparable with most of the quantitative information included in this nonfinancial information statement for 2023, due to the change in the perimeter reported. As information on the three Alba Subsidiaries is only shown for the first quarter of 2023, and to facilitate comparison of quantitative information in future non-financial information statements, quantitative data has been broken down by company for the purposes of simplification. Thus, the information on Alba covers\n\n{277}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/277/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" which are in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The background is a solid teal color.\n\n2023 (1 January to 31 December), while the information on Gesdocument, Nuadi and Facundo spans the first quarter of 2023 (1 January to 31 March).\n\nThe non-financial information statement has been prepared on the basis of the reporting requirements of the Non-Financial Reporting and Diversity Law, which in turn requires the adoption of a national, European or international framework. A selection of indicators from the Global Reporting Initiative Standards, included in the Table of Contents of the nonfinancial information statement, have been taken into account, so reference would be made to selected GRI Standards.\n\nIn order to gradually adapt to Directive 2022/2464 of 14 December 2022 on Corporate Sustainability Reporting (CSRD), which came into force in January 2024 (though it will not apply to Alba until 2025), the content of this non-financial information statement has been prepared in accordance with the principles of stakeholder engagement, taking into account the principle of double materiality (proposed by the CSRD), transparency and integrity. In addition, balance, accuracy, timeliness, comparability, clarity and reliability of the data presented have been sought.\n\nLastly, it should be noted that this report has been subject to an independent, external assurance process, in accordance with the terms of the Non-Financial Information and Diversity Law.\n\n# <span id=\"page-277-0\"></span>**2. Organisation of Companies**\n\n# <span id=\"page-277-1\"></span>**2.1. Description of the business model**\n\n# <span id=\"page-277-2\"></span>**2.1.1. Organisation and structure.**\n\nCorporación Financiera Alba, S.A. is an investment firm, listed on the continuous market of the Spanish stock exchanges since 1986. The company is majority owned by the March Group, which includes Banca March and Fundación Juan March.\n\n- Banca March, founded in 1926, is a family-owned Spanish bank headquartered in Palma de Mallorca. Banca March is the parent of the March Group and a significant shareholder of Corporación Financiera Alba.\n- Fundación Juan March, created in 1955, is a family and heritage institution, which carries out its activities in the field of humanistic culture, with exhibitions, concert series and conferences, and promotes scientific research.\n\nThe following diagram shows the companies in which Alba is a shareholder and its percentage interest in them at 31 December 2023:\n\n{320}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/320/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif letters on a teal background. Below \"ALBA\" is \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white, sans-serif letters. The entire logo is contained within a teal border.\n\nare essential in order to obtain this certification. At 31 March 2023, nine customer complaints had been received, complaint being defined as any action taken by a customer as a result of any dispute in the dealings between the two organisations. Customer complaints can be received by various means: telephone, fax, letter, e-mail, in person, or via an employee reporting to Quality.\n\nSadeca also has a complaints system, essentially implemented via the customer satisfaction index (CSI), which analyses aspects such as punctuality of deliveries, urgent transport, quality complaints and stoppages in the production chain, among others.\n\n- **Gesdocument** has a technology department that ensures security in terms of IT services. This department and a number of security partners ensure that IT services are provided correctly. It also has cybersecurity insurance. In 2023, it began implementing a system to measure customer satisfaction by means of quality surveys that will be logged by customer, service and the team/professional assigned to each customer. It records customer \"cases\", customer and professional complaints and incidents in its CRM, and the steps taken to resolve them are then monitored. One complaint was received in the first quarter of 2023.\n- Guaranteeing its consumers' health and safety is of **paramount** importance to Facundo. For this reason, it has renewed its IFS (International Food Standard) certification, one of the strictest regulations in relation to food safety, installation quality and process optimisation in product preparation. It also has in place a Food Safety and Quality Policy. It has implemented a mandatory Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system, in line with the European Union's Regulation EC 852/2004. These policies and procedures ensure the food safety of its products and the health and safety of its consumers, customers and users.\n\nIn its quest to offer excellent customer service and safeguard the health of its consumers, it has an allergens table for all of its products on its website and provides a contact telephone number.\n\nConsumers and other interested third parties can send complaints, comments and suggestions to the company's customer service department via its corporate website, by e-mail or telephone. The customer service department then forwards the communications to Management and the Quality Department. No distinction is drawn between different complaints and grievances. They are all treated in the same way. Facundo received a total of 56 complaints in the first quarter of 2023. All claims are assessed and receive a reply, and the data collected is used to improve internal processes.\n\nIn addition, it organises visits to its factory, giving consumers the opportunity to see how the factory works and how its products are made, thereby strengthening the relationship between the brand and its customers.\n\n{321}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/321/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy**\n\nThe EU Taxonomy reporting carried out by Alba and its Subsidiaries is driven by Regulation (EU) 2020/852, published by the European Parliament on 22 June 2020. This Regulation seeks to contribute to the decarbonisation of the European economic system by providing a reference framework for identifying environmentally sustainable economic activities. Substantial contribution to the six environmental objectives set out in article 9 of the Regulation will also be determined.\n\nJuly 2021 saw the publication of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139, which set out to supplement Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and specify the Technical Selection Criteria (TSC) for the first two environmental objectives, namely climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation.\n\nAdditionally, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 of 27 June 2023 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 further specifies the disclosures to be made in respect of the substantial contribution of activities to the sustainability objectives by establishing the TSC for determining the conditions under which an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, to the transition to a circular economy, to pollution prevention and control, or to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems and for determining whether that economic activity causes no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives.\n\nFurthermore, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214, amending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 as regards economic activities in certain energy sectors and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 as regards specific public disclosures for those economic activities, was published on 9 March 2022.\n\nUndertakings that are subject to the obligation to disclose non-financial information under Law 11/2018 of 28 December 2018, which transposed Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, are required to disclose the extent to which their activities are in line with the Taxonomy.\n\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 of 6 July 2021, supplementing Regulation 2020/852, specifies the content and presentation of information to be disclosed by undertakings subject to the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD).\n\nIn this connection, the aforementioned requirements laid down in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 are fulfilled in this section, based on the activity data for 2023. To continue with the taxonomy exercise carried out in the previous year, which concluded with the publication of the eligible financial indicators according to the activities referred to in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139, the activities identified as eligible according to the mitigation and adaptation criteria established in the Regulation have been reviewed. With regard to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486, the economic activity eligibility analysis has been performed in relation to the four sustainability objectives that are relevant for the purposes of this report.\n\n{322}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/322/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Below \"ALBA\" is \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font.\n\n# <span id=\"page-322-0\"></span>**10.1. Compliance with the EU Taxonomy**\n\nAlba is an investment company the purpose of which is to acquire long-term holdings in listed and unlisted companies operating in various economic sectors. Alba is majority owned by the shareholders of the March Group, one of Spain's leading private family-owned financial groups. Alba currently focuses its investments on listed and unlisted companies and real estate assets.\n\nIn accordance with the applicable regulations on the disclosure of non-financial information, the Company must disclose the proportion of eligible and non-eligible and aligned and nonaligned activities according to the EU Taxonomy, in addition to the KPIs associated with Revenues, CapEx and OpEx.\n\nEligible activities are those listed in Annexes I and II to Regulation 2021/2139 and in Annexes I, II, III and IV to Delegated Regulation 2023/2486, which will potentially contribute to the defined objectives by meeting the technical criteria established for the climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives. Non-eligible activities would therefore be those which do not comply with the relevant provisions and/or are not included in the list of Taxonomy-eligible activities defined in the legislation.\n\nAligned activities are those which are considered eligible and meet the criteria of substantial contribution (SCC) to one of the set objectives (mitigation or adaptation), which ensure that they do no significant harm to the other objectives (DNSH) and which are carried out in accordance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (Minimum Social Safeguards). Non-aligned eligible activities are thus those which do not meet any of the requirements of the aforementioned alignment analysis phases (SCC, DNSH and Safeguards).\n\n# <span id=\"page-322-1\"></span>**10.2. Analysis and calculation procedure**\n\nIn order to calculate the indicators required by the EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy, an eligibility analysis was conducted on the activities pursued by Alba in 2023 and by its Subsidiaries up to the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe analysis was based on a description of the various activities carried out by the companies. Furthermore, in order to avoid double counting, the percentages allocated to just one activity were accounted for. The different indicators required by the relevant regulations were determined for each of them, including the calculation of the numerator and denominator for Alba's Revenue, CapEx and OpEx figures at the end of 2023, and those of its Subsidiaries at the 31 March 2023 close.\n\n- Revenues: the proportion of turnover referred to in article 8(2)(a) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 was calculated as the proportion of net turnover derived from products or services, including intangibles, associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities (numerator), divided by net turnover (denominator) as defined in article 2(5) of Directive 2013/34/EU.\n- CapEx: this includes the calculation of the CapEx figure associated with activities classed as eligible following the analysis performed on Alba and its\n\n{323}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/323/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The numerator shall include the part of the capital expenditure included in the denominator that:\n\n- a) is related to assets or processes that are associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities;\n- b) is part of a plan to expand Taxonomy-aligned economic activities or to allow Taxonomy-eligible economic activities to become Taxonomy-aligned (\"CapEx plan\") under the conditions specified in the second subparagraph of this point 1.1.2.2 (relating to the \"CapEx plan\");\n- c) is related to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and individual measures enabling the target activities to become low-carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas reductions, notably activities listed in sections 7.3 to 7.6 of Annex I to the CDA, as well as other economic activities listed in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to articles 10(3), 11(3), 12(2), 13(2), 14(2) and 15(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and provided that such measures are implemented and operational within 18 months.\n\nThe denominator of the CapEx indicator shall cover additions to tangible and intangible assets during the financial year considered before depreciation, amortisation and any re-measurements, including those resulting from revaluations and impairments, for 2023 in the case of Alba and the first quarter of 2023 in the case of its Subsidiaries, excluding fair value changes.\n\n- OpEx: this includes the calculation of the Taxonomy-eligible OpEx figure associated with the activities deemed eligible in the analysis. It is equal to the part of the operating expenditure included in the denominator that:\n\t- a) is related to assets or processes that are associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities;\n\t- b) is part of the CapEx plan to expand Taxonomy-aligned economic activities or allow Taxonomy-eligible economic activities to become Taxonomy-aligned as set out in the second paragraph of this point 1.1.2.2; and\n\t- c) is related to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and individual measures enabling the target activities to become low-carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas reductions, notably activities listed in sections 7.3 to 7.6 of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act, as well as other economic activities listed in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to articles 10(3), 11(3), 12(2), 13(2), 14(2) and 15(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and provided that such measures are implemented and operational within 18 months.\n\n{324}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/324/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif letters on a teal background. Below \"ALBA\" is the text \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller font, also in white.\n\nIt includes direct non-capitalised costs that relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term lease, maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment by the undertaking or third party to whom activities are outsourced that are necessary to ensure the continued and effective functioning of such assets. Since the information systems of Alba and its Subsidiaries (up to 31 March 2023) do not currently allow the specific data corresponding to the type of expenditure referred to in the regulations to be obtained, and in view of the nature of the activities carried out by these companies, this indicator was prepared on the basis of the \"Other Operating Expenses\" heading of the Consolidated Annual Accounts of Alba and its Subsidiaries.\n\n# Eligibility analysis\n\nFor the climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives, the eligible activities resulting from the eligible activities analysis study previously carried out by an independent third party for both Alba and the Subsidiaries covered in this report -the activities of which remained unchanged in 2023- were selected.\n\nAn eligibility study was carried out in respect of the other objectives set out in Regulation 2023/2486 for the preparation of this report. To determine the eligibility of the economic activities of Alba in 2023, and those of its Subsidiaries up to 31 March 2023, account was taken of whether they are described in the relevant Regulations. The NACE codes stated in the descriptions also served as a guideline without being a prerequisite.\n\nNeither Alba nor its Subsidiaries (in the first quarter of 2023) carried out any eligible activities per the descriptions of the objectives provided for in Regulation 2023/2486.\n\nEligible activity alignment analysis\n\nOn identifying the eligible activities, the criteria set out in Annexes I and II to the Climate Delegated Regulation were then reviewed and analysed.\n\nThe technical interpretation of the activities identified as eligible, on which the alignment analysis was carried out, is detailed below:\n\n• Activities that contribute to climate change mitigation:\n\n**Activity 7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings:** The acquisition of real estate and exercise of the ownership rights over such assets carried out by Alba Patrimonio Inmobiliario, S.A. in respect of five buildings located in Madrid are considered here. All of these buildings were constructed prior to 31 December 2020. Thus, according to the TSC, in order to contribute substantially to the climate change mitigation objective, they should at least have a class A energy performance certificate or, alternatively, be among the 15% most energy efficient buildings in the national or regional building stock in terms of primary energy demand. Also, as large non-residential buildings, they need to be managed efficiently through energy efficiency monitoring and assessment.\n\n{325}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/325/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA Grupo March. The letters \"ALBA\" are in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller font. The background is a teal color, and the entire logo is enclosed in a teal border.\n\nThe analysis performed at the 2023 close suggests that there is no energy performance certificate such as the one referred to in the TSC; nor are there any plans to control or assess the energy efficiency of the buildings considered. It is thus concluded that this activity could not be classed as aligned as it does not comply with the TSC. Likewise, for the purposes of complying with the DNSH criteria and, specifically, the climate change adaptation objective, no analysis has been conducted on physical climate risks or specific plans for adaptation to climate change in these buildings; although Alba has implemented a number of the mechanisms required by the Minimum Social Safeguards provided for in the Regulation, at corporate level.\n\nIn future years, work will be done to analyse the steps required in order to adapt to these criteria with a view to aligning the Company's business model with the requirements laid down in the Regulation, thus supporting the transition towards a more sustainable economy.\n\n# <span id=\"page-325-0\"></span>**10.3. Results in 2023**\n\nThe analysis shows that the Subsidiaries had no eligible activities during the first quarter of 2023, while 22.48% of Alba's Revenues, 32.92% of its CapEx and 23.51% of its OpEx were Taxonomy-eligible. However, the analysis did not reveal any activities that were actually aligned with the Taxonomy.\n\nThe information contained in this report considers the methodology applied by Alba and its Subsidiaries, as well as the results obtained in the second exercise performed to comply with Sustainable Finance Taxonomy Regulation 2020/852. Nonetheless, changes in sectoral interpretations and positions, the development of new implementing guidelines and the publication of the remaining four environmental objectives could lead to amendments to, or the restatement of, the information set out in this analysis.\n\nMoreover, the activities of Alba and its Subsidiaries are unrelated to nuclear energy and fossil gas for the purposes of Regulation 2022/1214.\n\nThe results of the analysis are detailed below:\n\n{326}------------------------------------------------\n\n| 2023                                                                                                        |          | 2023          |                              | Substantial contribution criteria |                           |                       |                  |            |              | Do no significant harm criteria (DNSH) |                           |                            |                  |           |              |                    |                                                                                                                            |                              |                                  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|-----------|--------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Economic activities (net revenues)                                                                          | Code     | Turnover      | Proportion of turnover, 2023 | Climate change mitigation         | Climate change adaptation | Groundwater resources | Circular economy | Pollution  | Biodiversity | Climate change mitigation              | Climate change adaptation | Water and marine resources | Circular economy | Pollution | Biodiversity | Minimum safeguards | Proportion of turnover that complies with the Taxonomy (A.1) or is from eligible activities under the Taxonomy (A.2), 2022 | Category (enabling activity) | Category (transitional activity) |\n|                                                                                                             | CCM      | €             | %                            | Y; N; N/EL                        | Y; N; N/EL                | Y; N; N/EL            | Y; N; N/EL       | Y; N; N/EL | Y; N; N/EL   | Y / N                                  | Y / N                     | Y / N                      | Y / N            | Y / N     | Y / N        | Y / N              | %                                                                                                                          | E                            | T                                |\n| A.

BOARD OF ADMINISTRATION**\n\nLadies and gentlemen, shareholders:\n\nOnce again, I am pleased to inform you on the performance of Alba and its main investees over the past year and the first few months of 2024.\n\nAs an introduction, we could say that 2023 has been, to some extent, a transition year between the post-pandemic recovery and a new global geopolitical and macroeconomic scenario, which started in 2022 with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the notable increase in inflation in the world´s main economies, with the consequent reaction of the Central Banks via very significant increases in interest rates.\n\nIf we delve deeper into the **geopolitical situation**, the uncertainty and the level of risk have increased, or perhaps simply become more tangible, as a result of the war in Ukraine and the renewed conflict in the Middle East, always in the context of the more or less hidden tensions between the United States and China.\n\nLeaving aside the terrible cost and suffering caused by the aforementioned conflicts, it should be noted that, at least so far, they have generally remained contained in their respective geographic areas, with relatively brief one-off economic impacts outside of these regions, such as the increase in gas prices in Europe during 2022.\n\nHowever, these conflicts are far from being resolved and have the potential to rapidly escalate with global effects, making geopolitical risk very material and a real threat.\n\nThis instability could also be contributed to by the massive electoral cycle in 2024, which will involve more than 70 countries and close to 50% of the world's population, including regions and countries as relevant as the European Union, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Indonesia and, of course, the United States at the beginning of November. Although the rise of populist and/or extremist electoral spectrum, both left and right, may increase instability in certain countries or the risk of local conflicts, there is no doubt that a radical change in US economic and foreign policy could have significant implications at global level, contributing to an increase in overall geopolitical risk.\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/8 description: The image contains the number 7 inside of a white rectangle with a black border.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom Alba's point of view, its strategy of investing for the long term in a relatively limited number of holdings of significant size makes it difficult to quickly change the composition of its portfolio in the face of geopolitical events. However, Alba tries to reduce the geopolitical risk of its portfolio as a whole. On the one hand, by focusing its investments on companies that operate in stable countries with a high level of legal certainty and a political, social and regulatory environment that respects the free market and, on the other hand, with adequate geographic diversification.\n\nIf we focus on the second mentioned aspect - the **macroeconomic situation – the**  last year was marked by the evolution of inflation and the monetary policies of the Central Banks, with two very differentiated parts: the first half of the year where interest rate hikes initiated in mid-2022 continued with the inflation rates already decreasing, but still very high, and the second half without new rate increases, awaiting the evolution of inflation towards the target levels of Central Banks.\n\nLogically, such substantial and rapid rises in both inflation and interest rates significantly increased uncertainty about the evolution of the world's main economies, raising the probability of a recession during the year. However, this possibility declined over the course of the year, with economies showing remarkable resilience in terms of growth and employment generation.\n\nIt is true that the effect of monetary policy on the economy always shows a certain time lag and that there were transitory factors in inflation originated in 2021 and 2022, such as the supply chain crisis in the post-Covid reopening or the impact of the Ukrainian war on energy costs. However, macroeconomic performance in 2023 was generally very satisfactory and clearly better than overall market expectations. In fact, the two largest economies that performed worst last year - Germany and China - were affected by very specific factors, such as, in one case, the war in Ukraine and its impact on energy costs and, in the other, a real estate crisis and a slowdown in domestic consumption.\n\nHowever, we must not forget that, despite the increase in interest rates, the effect liquidity excess liquidity from previous years is still dragging on and that this monetary restriction has been still accompanied in many cases by expansive fiscal policies. Although lower than in previous years, these fiscal policies have been largely financed by the positive effect of inflation on tax collection – having Spain as an example- and \n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\nalso thanks to the fact that the average cost of public debt is still low, since interest rate increases have only had an effect on new debt issues since mid-2022.\n\nIt is precisely at this point that some uncertainties arise with a view to 2024 and beyond, since it is to be expected that the positive impact of inflation on revenue collection will gradually dissipate and, although interest rates may fall, the average financing costs of the Countries will gradually increase in a context of greater pressure to reduce public deficits - due to high public indebtedness - which will lead to less expansionary fiscal policies. And, although in general, the private sector has a substantially lower level of indebtedness than before the Financial Crisis 15 years ago, the gradual increase in financial expenses, together with the impact of inflation on household disposable income, could contribute to a certain economic slowdown in the coming years. Although it is still to be confirmed, it is possible that, to some extent, the time lag of the changes in monetary policy has been underestimated and we could see in 2024 and 2025 the impacts that had been predicted for 2023.\n\nAlthough a more detailed reference in the matter later on, it is necessary to highlight that monetary policy and, more specifically, the calendar of possible interest rate reductions have marked the evolution of the markets during the second half of 2023 and the first months of 2024 and we believe this will be likely to continue until a stable level of interest rates in the long term is settled. Clearly, interest rates have a big impact on company valuations, especially in high-growth sectors such as technology, the big player over the past two to three years. But we think that markets may not be aware of key issues such as, for example, that the possible lowering of interest rates will only occur if inflation slows and, at the same time, if economies show clear signs of slowing. Thus, interest rates would stabilize at levels above those of the last 10-15 years, which are extraordinarily low from a historical perspective. In summary, investors should never forget that the key long-term variable in the markets is companies' earnings and cash flow generation potential, which is more closely linked to general macroeconomic developments in the medium and long term than to interest rate variations in the short term.\n\nIf we focus briefly on the macroeconomic evolution of **Spain**, the most relevant data is that real GDP grew by 2.5% in 2023, in line with the growth rates prior to the pandemic and higher than those of the main economies of the Euro zone. This growth is\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\nexplained by the good performance of both internal and external demand but presents a declining quarterly evolution and a fall in gross capital creation in the second half of the year, especially in the real estate sector.\n\nThis economic growth has translated into a good **employment** performance, with a considerable increase in the number of employees - reaching an all-time high of more than 21 million people by the end of 2023 - and a reduction in unemployment to levels slightly above 2.8 million people, the lowest since the third quarter of 2008. According to the Working Population Survey, the unemployment rate ended 2023 at 11.8%, the lowest level at the end of a fiscal year since 2007.\n\nThe **CPI** showed a substantial moderation of the inflation rate to 3.1% year-onyear at the end of 2023, compared to 5.7% in 2022 and 6.5% in 2021. Core inflation closed the year at a higher level - 3.5% - but far from the 7.5% year-on-year at the end of the previous year.\n\nAs for **public indebtedness**, it stood at 108% of GDP in Spain at the end of 2023, a level below the historical peak of 120% reached in 2020. As in 2021 and 2022, this percentage fell in 2023 thanks to GDP growth, but the gross amount of public debt continued to increase, although this increase (4.7%) was slightly lower than in previous years, due to a fall in the public deficit, which fell to 3.7% of GDP.\n\nHowever, this lower deficit was made possible by the increase in tax revenues due to economic growth, the higher tax burden and, to a large extent, the positive effect of inflation, but public spending continued to increase, even above GDP growth, which could turn into a weakness if economic activity were slow down.\n\nDue to all of the above, and despite this slight improvement in the deficit and debt ratio, the level of public debt continues to be very high, which is why we reiterate, once again, the need for structural reforms that favor economic growth and private initiative and make progress in the containment of public spending, the sustainability of pensions and the improvement and modernization of our educational system.\n\nAs of the **stock markets**, they performed extraordinarily positive in 2023 after the falls of the previous year, thanks to the momentum of technology, the remarkable resilience of economic growth, the moderation of energy costs (in Europe) and, as we have already mentioned, expectations of lower interest rates; and all this despite continued and growing geopolitical uncertainties.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn fact, all of the world's major indices showed increases in 2023, except for the major indices of the Chinese markets; for example, the Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell by -13.8% in the year.\n\nWithin the main world stock markets, it is worth highlighting the performance of the North American indexes, which once again beat the record highs reached at the end of 2021: the S&P 500 (+24.2%) and the Nasdaq 100 (+43.4%) presented some of the highest revaluations due to their strong exposure to technology companies, thanks to the development of Artificial Intelligence and expectations of lower interest rates. The Dow Jones, although also at record levels, showed more moderate gains (+13.7%). The performance was similar in many European markets, such as the French CAC 40 (+16.5%), the German DAX (+20.3%), the Dutch AEX (+14.2%) and the Italian Mibtel (+28.0%), while only the British FTSE and the Swiss SMI posted gains of less than 5.0% for the year.\n\nThe **Ibex-35** also performed very positively (+22.8%), thanks largely to the weight of the financial sector - one of the sectors that has benefited most from the normalization of interest rates - and the stock market performance of companies such as Inditex.\n\nThe Japanese Nikkei deserves special mention, which was one of the indices that appreciated the most during the year (+28.2%), and in February 2024 surpassed the level of 40,000 points, a new all-time high since December 1989. Although its origins lie in a local real estate, credit and macroeconomic crisis, this 35-year span is nonetheless a warning of the long-term impact that a stock market bubble can have on investors.\n\nWithin this positive market performance, it is necessary to highlight the high influence that technology has on the performance of some indexes, among which the S&P 500 stands out, where seven stocks together represent 30% of the index and account for most of the recent gains. This high concentration reduces the representativeness of the indices with respect to the market and the economy in general, increases market volatility and hinders diversification, all in a context of continued growth of passive management.\n\nThis positive trend has continued in the equity markets in the first months of 2024, with rises in all the main world indices up to 18th March (date of approval of the 2023 Annual Accounts by Alba's Board of Directors), with Japan once again standing out with\n\nImage /page/10/Picture/6 description: The image contains the number 11.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\na +16.0% increase and the North American indices, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both rising by nearly 8.0%. All of them at new all-time highs. Over the same period, the Eurostoxx 600 rose by 5.2% and the Ibex 35 by 4.9%.\n\nIn the current environment, at Alba we maintain a high level of prudence, as we believe that market valuations may not be adequately capturing the risks and factors mentioned above. In any case, at Alba we maintain our investment philosophy unchanged, focusing on the long term, with low debt, an appropriate balance between return and risk and giving priority to companies with solid balance sheets and management models. The key to investing in the equity markets over the medium and long term ultimately lies in the performance of companies' earnings and cash generation. We believe that Alba can find good investment opportunities, even in the current environment, thanks to its long-term vision, flexibility and zero debt.\n\nTurning now to **Alba'**s performance in 2023, Net Asset Value (NAV) increased by 9.6% during the year, to €5,797 million at year-end. NAV per share increased by 7.7%, ending the year at €96.12 per share. The difference in the annual evolution of NAV and NAV per share is explained by the capital increase carried out in the middle of the year as a result of the flexible dividend.\n\nIn contrast, in the first months of 2024, through March 18, NAV and NAV per share declined by 8.1% to €5,325 million and €88.31 per share, respectively.\n\nAlba's share price rose 11.2% in 2023 to €48.00 per share at year-end, outperforming the Eurostoxx 600 (+19.2%) and the Ibex-35 (+22.8%).\n\nIn the year to 18 March, Alba's share price fell by 1.4% to €47.35 per share, compared to increases of 4.9% for the Ibex-35 and 5.2% for the Eurostoxx 600.\n\n**Alba'**s consolidated net income in 2023 was €234.0 million after taxes, compared to €436.4 million of the previous year. This decline was mainly due to lower earnings contributed by some of our investees, a decline in the fair value of investment properties, lower capital gains on asset sales and an accounting impairment at one of our investees.\n\nAs a result, Alba reported net income of €3.88 per share for the year, compared to net income of €7.37 per share in 2022.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\nThis report provides a more detailed analysis of the various items comprising Alba's income statement and balance sheet, as well as information on the performance of our main investees in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, the volume of **investments amounted to** €209.3 million, compared with €268.8 million in the previous year. The main investments made in the year were as follows:\n\n~ The purchase of an additional 1.97% stake in Technoprobe for €82.5 million, to reach 5.23% at the end of the year.\n\n~ The acquisition of an additional 2.54% stake in Inmobiliaria Colonial, for €77.4 million, to reach 5.01% at the end of the year.\n\n~ The granting of a subordinated loan to our investee Profand in the amount of €28.6 million, for the acquisition of a productive asset in the United States.\n\n~ Other financial investments, for a total amount of €20.8 million.\n\n**In addition, divestments** totaling €34.0 million were made last year, compared with €168.0 million in 2022, including the sale of financial investments in the trading portfolio and the sale of the stake in Artá Partners to its management team. This sale, which took place in March 2023, means that the holdings in Nuadi, Facundo and Gesdocument will no longer be fully consolidated as of that date.\n\nAs a result of these asset purchases and sales, Alba's net cash decreased from €110.2 million at the end of 2022 to €16.4 million at the end of 2023. Despite this reduction, the cash position, combined with the dividend and income streams received from our portfolio and Alba's borrowing capacity, gives our Company significant financial capacity to undertake new investments. Faithfull to the philosophy of prudence and long-term vision, Alba continues to analyze new investment opportunities in listed and unlisted companies, both in Spain and abroad.\n\nWith regards to **good corporate governance standards and practices**, Alba has continued its efforts to incorporate into its internal regulations and practices the latest regulatory developments and recommendations on good corporate governance.\n\nRegarding internal regulation and policies, during 2023, the Board approved a new Sustainability Policy, to incorporate best practices in environmental, social and \n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\ncorporate governance matters, without radical changes to the principles, commitments and objectives of the Policy. For the same purpose, a review of the Investment Policy was also carried out, concluding that it was consistent with the approved Sustainability Policy and that, for the sole reason of its approval, it was not necessary to modify the Investment Policy. Likewise, the modification of the Board's Remuneration Policy was submitted to the General Shareholders' Meeting for approval, to bring the remuneration of the members of the Audit and Compliance and Appointments and Remuneration Committees in line with those of other comparable companies, and the maximum amount of the remuneration of the Board Members in their capacity as such was also approved. Finally, in January 2023, the Shareholder Remuneration Policy was approved to replace the Dividend Policy, still in effect until then, with the purpose of expressly including the possibility of applying \"flexible dividends\" and maintaining the objective of an annual recurring dividend - in cash or by means of a flexible dividend - of €58,240,000.\n\nIn addition, as part of its internal regulations, the Board approved a new Code of Ethics and Conduct, which incorporates certain provisions of Law 2/2023 of 20 February, which regulates the protection of people who report regulatory infringements and the fight against corruption, although it is not fully applicable as Alba does not have the required number of employees.\n\nIn the organizational area, it is worth mentioning the modification of the agreement regulating the Investment Committee, so that up to seven members of the Board may form part of it and that all independent Board Members may form part of this Committee during part of their term of office.\n\nAs regards to gender diversity in the composition of the Board, following Recommendation 15 of the Good Governance Code of Listed Companies, the Board set in 2020, as per the proposal of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, the target for representation of the underrepresented sex on the Board of Directors at 40% of the total number of Board members and the guidelines for meeting it, this target having been achieved on the occasion of the General Meeting held in June 2021 and the same percentage being maintained during 2023 and at the present time.\n\nIn relation to the evaluation of the Board, in accordance with recommendation 36 of the Good Governance Code of Listed Companies, the Board of Directors carried out the evaluation of its performance during 2023 internally due to the fact that the previous \n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\nyear it already had the collaboration of an external consultant for the evaluation of the Board's performance in 2022.\n\nAlso, in relation to the recommendations of the Good Governance Code for Listed Companies, it should be noted that in 2023 Alba complied almost in full with these recommendations. Specifically, out of a total of 64 recommendations, 54 were applicable, of which 53 were fully complied with and only one was partially complied with, relating to the compensation provided for in Alba's Remuneration Policy in the event of termination or cancellation of the contract of Executive Directors, but which is not actually applicable as there have been no such Directors since 2020.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the following reports and documents were approved: the Annual Corporate Governance Report, the Report on Directors' Remuneration, the Statement of Non-Financial Information, the Report on Related-Party Transactions and the Evaluation of the Board, as well as other additional reports issued by the Board Committees. The Internal Audit and Follow-up reports on Risk Control and Management, Regulatory Compliance and Crime Prevention have also been prepared and submitted to the corresponding bodies.\n\nIn connection with the **distribution of profit for the year**, in July 2023 a gross dividend of €0.961 per share was distributed as a flexible or *scrip dividend*, subject to the approval of Alba's shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. This dividend included the issuance of 1,060,012 new ordinary shares to shareholders who chose to receive the dividend in shares, and a cash payment of €6.0 million to the remaining shareholders.\n\nFor 2024, the Board of Directors has proposed to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders the distribution of a gross dividend of €0.96 per share in cash.\n\nFinally, in previous occasions, I would like to end this letter by expressing, on behalf of the entire Board of Directors, our gratitude to the employees of our Company and of all our investee companies for their professionalism, enthusiasm and dedication, and to all of you, our shareholders, for your trust and support.\n\nCordially yours,\n\n Carlos March Delgado Madrid, 18th March 2024\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **MOST SIGNIFICANT DATA**\n\n#### **ECONOMIC – FINANCIAL INFORMATION**\n\n<span id=\"page-15-0\"></span>\n\n| (In millions of euros, unless otherwise indicated) | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Share capital                                      | 60     | 59     | 58     | 58     |\n| Net equity                                         | 4,786  | 4,619  | 4,205  | 4,024  |\n| Shares outstanding (thousands)                     | 60,305 | 59,245 | 58,240 | 58,240 |\n| Net income                                         | 234    | 436    | 303    | (102)  |\n| Dividends (1)                                      | 57     | 87     | 58     | 58     |\n| Earnings in euros per share                        | 3.88   | 7.37   | 5.20   | (1.76) |\n| Dividend in euros per share (1)                    | 0.96   | 1.49   | 1.00   | 1.00   |\n\nNote 1: Includes both cash dividends and share-based disbursement.\n\n# **STOCK MARKET**\n\n|                                                    | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Closing price in euros per share                   |       |       |       |       |\n| Maximum                                            | 51.00 | 57.00 | 51.50 | 48.55 |\n| Minimal                                            | 43.15 | 42.50 | 37.85 | 30.85 |\n| Last                                               | 48.00 | 43.15 | 51.50 | 38.95 |\n| Market capitalization at 12/31 (millions of euros) | 2,895 | 2,556 | 2,999 | 2,268 |\n| Volume traded                                      |       |       |       |       |\n| Number of shares (thousands)                       | 3,168 | 4,489 | 3,668 | 6,706 |\n| Millions of euros                                  | 147   | 225   | 167   | 244   |\n| Daily average (millions of euros)                  | 0.6   | 0.9   | 0.7   | 0.9   |\n| Dividend yield (on last price)                     | 2.0%  | 3.5%  | 1.9%  | 2.6%  |\n\nAlba's share price increased by 11.2% in 2023, although this was lower than the Ibex-35, which rose by 22.8%, and in line with the growth of the Eurostoxx 600, which increased by 12.7% over the year.\n\n#### 16\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/16/Figure/0 description: The image is a line graph that shows the share price, Ibex 35 (base ALB), and Eurostoxx 600 (base ALB) from December 2022 to December 2023.

In contrast, in this period it fully divested from the Construction and Services sector (ACS, in 2017), the Financial sector (Bolsas y Mercados Españoles, in 2020) and the Telecommunications sector (Euskaltel, in 2021) sectors. Within the Security sector, the shareholdings in Prosegur were sold in 2013 and since \n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n2019 it has again been present in this sector with the investment in Verisure. In the Technology sector, Indra Sistemas was completely divested in 2022, but invested in Technoprobe in the same year. The \"Miscellaneous\" category mainly includes holdings in unlisted companies through the Deyá Capital IV vehicles and March PE Global, varying its weight according to the different investments and divestments made, as well as the financial shareholdings in other listed companies.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-25-0\"></span>**CONSOLIDATED ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION**\n\nThe consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS-EU).\n\nAs a result of the loss of control of the private equity management company Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., the Group has ceased to exercise control over Grupo Disfasa, S.L. (\"Facundo\"), Miralda Activos, S.L.U. (\"Nuadi\") and Gesdocument y Gestión, S.A. (\"Gesdocument\"), and therefore, from the second quarter of 2023, these subgroups have ceased to be fully consolidated and have been accounted for at fair value. Therefore, the consolidated income statement for 2023 includes the results for the first quarter results of Grupo Disfasa, S.L. (\"Facundo\"), Miralda Activos, S.L.U. (\"Nuadi\") and Gesdocument y Gestión, S.A.

As mentioned above, these companies were fully consolidated until the date of sale of the private equity management company Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., and are now accounted for at fair value from the second quarter of the year.\n\nThe *Real Estate Investments* account, which includes rental properties, decreased by €16 million in 2023 to €301 million, mainly due to a decrease in the fair value of these properties. This decrease was partially offset by the purchase of several garage spaces and by improvements made to the real estate portfolio. The valuation of the properties is carried out every six months by an independent expert, with the increase or decrease in value being recognized in the income statement under the heading *Change in the fair value of real estate investments*.\n\nThe changes in *Goodwill* and *Other intangible assets*, as well as the significant reduction in *Tangible fixed assets,* were due to the exclusion of Facundo, Gesdocument and Nuadi from the scope of consolidation.\n\n*Investments in associate companies,* increased by €65 million in 2023. This increase is mainly explained by the results contributed of the investees (€161 million), as well as by the changes in their consolidated equity (€15 million), among other elements. Partially offsetting the aforementioned increases, are the impairment recorded on the Ebro Foods shareholding (€45 million) and the dividends distributed by investees (€71 million).\n\n*Financial investments at fair value with changes in P&L,* increased from €1,364 million to €1,831 million in 2023. This change is mainly due to the acquisitions made during the year for a total amount of €222 million, the increase in the fair value of financial investments for €118 million and the classification under this heading of the short-term investment held by Alba in 2022 in Inmobiliaria Colonial (€80 million), as well as, the investments in Facundo, Gesdocument and Nuadi due to the aforementioned loss of control (€57 million). Among the financial investments made, we would highlight the increase in the shareholding in Inmobiliaria Colonial and Technoprobe, for €77 and €83 million, respectively. At this point, we consider it necessary to recall that, in 2023, this heading includes all the shareholdings in unlisted companies (except for Verisure, Parques Reunidos and Profand, which are included as \n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\ninvestments *in associates*) and the shareholdings in other long-term listed companies (Befesa, Technoprobe, Global Dominion and Inmobiliaria Colonial).\n\n*Other financial investments* increased by €20 million, mainly as a result of the subordinated loan arranged in June 2023 with Profand for the acquisition of a production asset in the United States (€29 million) and, to a lesser extent, the increase in the fair value of the put option held by the Group on its shareholding in the same company, which were partially offset by the collection of receivables from third parties.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, all the assets and liabilities of Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U. and Artá Partners, S.A., which were sold at the end of the first quarter of 2023, as mentioned above, were classified under *Non-current assets held for sale.* As of December 31, 2023, there were no *non-current assets held for sale*.\n\nThe balance of *Cash and cash equivalents* decreased from €572 million to €406 million in 2023, mainly due to investments made. As of December 31, 2023, Alba's net cash, calculated as the cash position less short- and long-term financial liabilities, was €16 million, compared with net cash of €110 million at the end of the previous year.\n\nFor its part, *Other current assets* decreased by €79 million, mainly due to the aforementioned changes in the scope of consolidation.\n\n*Retained earnings and others* increased by €244 million, mainly due to the net income for the year (€234 million) and, to a lesser extent, to positive changes in the equity of investee companies (€15 million). These increases were partially offset by the effect of the flexible dividend distributed by Corporación Financiera Alba in the year detailed below, with no interim *dividend* paid during 2023.\n\nIn this regard, in relation to the aforementioned flexible dividend, the Shareholders' Meeting of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A., held on June 19, 2023, approved a capital share increase in the Company to implement the flexible dividend. On July 5, 2023, the trading period for the free-of-charge allocation rights ended, through which the Company proceeded to purchase 6,244,550 free-of-charge allocation rights for an amount of €6 million; this option was accepted by 10.5% of the holders of these rights. The final number of new ordinary shares with a par value of €1 per unit issued in the capital increase was 1,060,012. As a result of the capital increase, the share capital of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. at December 31, 2023, amounted to 60,305,186 shares with a par value of €1 each. The new shares of the Company were admitted to trading on the stock exchange on July 19, 2023.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe *Minority shareholders* item decreased from €138 million to €60 million during the year, mainly because of the deconsolidation of Facundo, Gesdocument and Nuadi.\n\nAs a result of the above, *Net Equity*, including *Minority shareholders*, increased by 3.6% during the year to €4,786 million.\n\n*Non-current liabilities* include financial debt with a maturity of more than one year amounted of €70 million, which was reduced by €92 million during the year due to the deconsolidation of Facundo, Gesdocument and Nuadi (€82 million) and the transfer to short term of loans maturing in 2024 (€10 million). Other non-current liabilities decreased mainly due to changes in the scope of consolidation.\n\n*Current liabilities*, which include both bank loans with maturities of less than one year and other short-term debt, increased from €463 million at the end of 2022 to €478 million at the end of 2023. This change is mainly explained by the higher bank debt due to the investments made, which was partially offset, once again, by the exclusion of the liabilities of Facundo, Gesdocument and Nuadi from the scope of consolidation.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT(1)**\n\n|                                                                         | In Millions of euros |         |         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------|---------|\n|                                                                         | 2023                 | 2022    | 2021    |\n| Share of net results of associate companies.                            | 160.8                | 231.4   | 245.0   |\n| Revenue and other income.                                               | 53.1                 | 166.9   | 235.9   |\n| Changes in the fair value of real estate investments.                   | (19.4)               | 1.1     | (0.8)   |\n| Financial income.                                                       | 77.5                 | 21.5    | 17.6    |\n| Impairment of assets and change in fair value of financial instruments. | 82.9                 | 173.4   | 66.1    |\n| Result from asset sales.                                                | 2.5                  | 47.5    | 1.0     |\n| <b>Total</b> .                                                          | 357.4                | 641.8   | 564.8   |\n| Procurement.                                                            | (16.2)               | (61.9)  | (66.0)  |\n| Operating expenses.                                                     | (84.6)               | (110.3) | (138.0) |\n| Financial expenses.                                                     | (13.2)               | (6.3)   | (5.4)   |\n| Depreciation.                                                           | (4.2)                | (18.1)  | (29.2)  |\n| Corporate income tax.                                                   | (7.1)                | (0.6)   | (13.1)  |\n| Minority shareholders.                                                  | 1.9                  | (8.2)   | (10.4)  |\n| <b>Total</b> .                                                          | (123.4)              | (205.4) | (262.1) |\n| <b>NET INCOME</b> .                                                     | 234.0                | 436.4   | 302.7   |\n| Net income per share (euros).                                           | 3.88                 | 7.37    | 5.20    |\n\nNote 1: This Income Statement is presented grouped according to management criteria, which explains the differences between certain chapters and the data included in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **INCOME STATEMENT**\n\nAlba's *net income* amounted to €234 million in 2023, 46.4% lower than the previous year's result. *Net income per share* decreased from €7.37 in 2022 to €3.88 in 2023.\n\nIncome under *Share of net results of associate companies* decreased by 30.5%, from €231 million in the previous year to €161 million in 2023. This decrease is mainly due to the lower results contributed by Acerinox and Parques Reunidos, which were partially offset by the greater contribution to the result of the shareholdings in Naturgy and Ebro Foods.\n\n*Revenue and other income* decreased by €114 million to €53 million in the year, mainly due to changes in the scope of consolidation of fully consolidated shareholdings. As mentioned above, only three months of the sales of Gesdocument, Facundo and Nuadi were included in 2023, whereas in 2022, six months of the sales of Facundo and Gesdocument, three months of Preving and Satlink and the entire revenue of Nuadi were included. This item also includes income from Alba's real estate investments, which increased by 16.3% in 2023, to €15 million, because of the higher occupancy level of the properties and the increase in the average rent, with the leasable area remaining unchanged compared to 2022. In this sense, as of December 31 of both years, the gross leasable area amounted to 42,420 square meters, with an occupancy rate of 97.7% as of December 2023, compared to 88.4% at the end of 2022.\n\nAccording to the assessment report performed by an independent expert, the estimated value of the real estate assets decreased by €19 million in 2023, this amount being included in the item *Changes in the fair value of real estate investments.* As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of real estate investments amounted to €301 million.\n\n*Financial income* amounted to €78 million in 2023, compared with €22 million in the previous year, due to higher interest and dividends received.\n\nThe heading *Impairment of assets and changes in the fair value of financial instruments* showed a positive result of €83 million in the year, due to the increase in the valuation of *Financial investments at fair value with changes in P&L (*€120 million) and, to a much lesser extent, to other non-current assets included under the heading *Other financial investments* and the reversal of the impairment made in 2022 on the Profand shareholding. This was partially offset by the impairment recorded on the Ebro Foods shareholding (€45 million).\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n*The results from asset sales* includes income of €3 million in 2023 corresponding to the capital gains obtained on the sale of the private equity management company Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., compared to the €48 million obtained in 2022 from the capital gains recorded, among others, on the sale of Satlink, the entire shareholdings in Indra Sistemas and a building in Madrid.\n\n*Procurements* and *Operating expenses* decreased in 2023 to €16 million and €85 million, respectively, 73.8% and 23.3% less than in the previous year due to the changes in the scope of consolidation mentioned under the heading of *Revenue and other income.*\n\n*Financial expenses* increased by €7 million in the year to €13 million due to the increase in interest rates in 2023.\n\nChanges in the scope of consolidation of our fully consolidated investees explain the variation in the *Minority shareholders* item in the consolidated income statement for the year.\n\n*Corporate income tax amounted to* an expense of €7 million in 2023, compared with €1 million in the previous year.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-34-0\"></span>**INFORMATION ON INVESTEE COMPANIES**\n\n# **NATURGY**\n\n#### **Company description**\n\nNaturgy is an integrated multinational energy company, with a presence in the gas and electricity sector.

The acquisition is expected to be completed in the second half of this fiscal year.\n\n#### **Company's main activity during 2023**\n\nAcerinox's business in 2023 was marked by the significant reduction of inventories at sector level. This reduction, which started at the end of last year, mainly affected the demand and prices of stainless steel, and was partially offset by the good performance of the special alloys sector, where Acerinox recorded an all-time record in results as in the previous year.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Most significant data<br>(In millions of euros unless otherwise stated) | 2023                       | 2022                         | 2021                       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Sales……<br>EBITDA<br>EBIT<br>Net income (loss)                          | 6,608<br>703<br>374<br>228 | 8,688<br>1,276<br>876<br>556 | 6,706<br>989<br>810<br>572 |\n| Total assets<br>Net financial debt<br>Net equity                        | 6,099<br>341<br>2,463      | 6,318<br>440<br>2,548        | 5,984<br>578<br>2,215      |\n| Employees (31-dec.) ….……………………….……………                                   | 8,229                      | 8,201                        | 8,206                      |\n| Share price (closing 31-dec.)

Thus, while **Stainless Steel** sales were affected by the aforementioned inventory adjustment and showed a 30.0% drop year-on-year to €5,195 million, revenues from the **Specialty Alloys** segment increased by 13.9% year-on-year, mainly due to the positive evolution of the demand in the oil and gas and chemical sectors.\n\nImage /page/38/Figure/2 description: The image contains two pie charts.

Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, sales would have increased by 4.2% compared to 2022.\n\nBy activity, sales of the **Traditional Business** showed growth of 2.3% over the previous year, reaching €985 million due to the aforementioned factors. Revenues from the **New Businesses** division increased by 4.9% compared to 2022, to €152 million. Finally, revenues in the **Other Energy Revenues** segment were 4.8% lower than in the previous year, at €89 million, due to the normalization of electricity prices in the Spanish market following a 2022 that saw an exceptional increase in prices. \n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/47/Figure/0 description: The image contains two pie charts.

Excluding the impact of currency variations, EBITDA would have increased by 7.9% compared to 2022.\n\nNet income increased to €141 million, 1.1% higher than in 2022, thanks to EBITDA growth and lower tax expenses, which offset higher depreciation and amortization, higher financial expenses and the higher negative impact of exchange rates.\n\nNet bank debt, excluding IFRS 16 and other net financial liabilities, increased to €138 million in December 2023, compared with €101 million at the end of the previous year, reflecting the Company's investment effort, the increase in working capital requirements and the dividend payments made.

In an inflationary context, with greater pressure on consumers' disposable income, Ebro Foods has managed to maintain or increase its market share in 2023 in the main markets and categories in which it operates.\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Most significant data                                 |       |       | 2021(1) |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|---------|\n| (In millions of euros unless otherwise stated)        | 2023  | 2022  |         |\n|                                                       |       |       |         |\n| Sales……                                               | 3,084 | 2,968 | 2,427   |\n| EBITDA                                                | 387   | 335   | 302     |\n| EBIT                                                  | 284   | 234   | 207     |\n| Net income (loss) of continuing operations(2)<br>     | 205   | 122   | 145     |\n| Total assets                                          | 3,872 | 3,900 | 3,939   |\n| Net financial debt(3)<br>                             | 570   | 763   | 505     |\n| Net equity                                            | 2,222 | 2,198 | 2,133   |\n| Employees (31-dec.) ….……………………….……………                 | 6,135 | 6,141 | 6,515   |\n| Share price (closing 31-dec.)

Likewise, EBITDA and EBIT increased by 15.7% and 21.7%, respectively, to €387 million and €284 million, representing margins of 12.6% and 9.2%, significantly higher than in 2022 thanks to stabilizing raw material costs and lower transportation and energy costs. Net income attributable to the parent company totaled €187 million, an increase of 53.2% compared with 2022, a year whose result was affected by the losses on the sale of Roland Monterrat.\n\nBy business area, there was a positive performance in both Rice and Pasta, with solid EBITDA growth and a notable recovery in Pasta. Sales and EBITDA in the **Rice** division increased by 4.9% and 7.3%, to 2,444 and €311 million, respectively, supported by the increase in capacity in ready-to-eat products, thanks to the investments made and the aforementioned progressive migration to higher value-added products. On the other hand, sales in the **Pasta**  division remained in line with the previous year, being 0.1% higher at €652 million. However, the EBITDA of this division increased by 54.6% to €90 million, with a strong performance both in fresh pasta, especially in France, and significantly driven by the growth in gnocchi, and in \n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n*premium* dry pasta (Garofalo), highlighting the increase in volumes, in a highly competitive environment, and the improvement in profitability following the containment of energy costs and the consolidation of price increases.\n\nImage /page/51/Figure/1 description: The image contains two pie charts.

However, the demand outlook for 2024 and beyond is positive, supported by the expected strong development of segments and customers related to generative artificial intelligence and by a recovery in consumer electronics.\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Most significant data                                 |       |       |       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| (In millions of euros unless otherwise stated)        | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  |\n|                                                       |       |       |       |\n| Net sales…                                            | 409   | 549   | 392   |\n| EBITDA                                                | 123   | 245   | 175   |\n| EBIT                                                  | 80    | 208   | 150   |\n| Net income (loss)                                     | 97    | 148   | 119   |\n| Total assets                                          | 928   | 867   | 537   |\n| Net cash                                              | 351   | 403   | 135   |\n| Net equity                                            | 817   | 737   | 446   |\n| Employees (31-dec.) ….……………………….……………                 | 2,746 | 2,120 | 1,536 |\n| Share price (closing 31-dec.)

In addition, the Group has an important presence in the business of fishing and commercialization of other species, such as salmon and shrimp.\n\nThe Company is vertically integrated, controlling (i) the origin, through a fleet of its own vessels and agreements with local fishermen, with access to some of the main fishing grounds worldwide; (ii) the processing through production plants in several countries; and (iii) the distribution of the final product, with sales in four continents. The Company has a significant presence in Spain, the USA and Argentina, among other countries.\n\nProfand has shown solid progress in recent years, following a strategy that combines organic and inorganic growth.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, Alba held a 23.71% interest in Profand's share capital.\n\n# **[www.profand.com](https://profand.com/en/meet-us/)**\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **INVESTMENTS THROUGH THIRD PARTIES**\n\nAlba's strategy focuses on the active management of direct minority stakes in the share capital of companies - both listed and unlisted, Spanish and foreign - with only occasional consideration of investments through funds or vehicles managed by third parties.\n\nAlba currently has investments through vehicles managed by **Artá Capital SGEIC SCR** (\"Artá Capital\", private equity) **and March PE Global** (\"March PE\" or \"March PE Global\", fund of funds): in the first case, these are private equity investments in small and medium-sized companies in Spain and Portugal, while in the second case they are portfolios of international funds that combine various strategies (LBO, venture capital, secondaries, etc.) with, in some cases, specialization in specific sectors such as technology or healthcare.\n\nBoth strategies complement Alba's core investment activity and are not in conflict with its investments. In addition, Alba also considers the possibility of co-investing directly in companies owned or managed by these managers, which would bring these investments closer to its core strategy.\n\n#### **Main aspects of Private Equity investments in fiscal year 2023**\n\nIn March 2023, Alba sold its entire stake in Artá Capital to the managing partners. Following this sale, Alba continues to be a core investor in the funds managed by the latter, including a commitment to contribute to its third fund.\n\nIn its Fund I (2008), Artá Capital obtained fund commitments totaling €400 million, 75% of which corresponded to Alba. In-Store Media is the only company from this fund currently in the portfolio.\n\nIn Fund II (2016), commitments totaled €405 million, 47% of which corresponded to Alba. At the end of 2023, Artá Capital had divested a significant portion of the investments made, with the following investees in its portfolio: Vitaly, Nuadi, Alvic, Satlink, Facundo, Gesdocument, Food Delivery Brands and Monbake. In the case of the latter, an agreement was reached in March 2024 for the sale of the entire stake together with the other shareholders, which is expected to be completed during the year.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, Artá is currently in the process of obtaining commitments for its Fund III from various investors, including Alba with a commitment of €100 million. At the end of 2023, the fund had one investee, the Portuguese company Ferreira de Sá, acquired in June of the same year.\n\n#### **Main aspects in investments of the fund of funds in fiscal 2023**\n\nUnder this investment strategy, Alba currently participates in two vehicles managed by Banca March (March PE Global I and March PE Global II), in which it committed a total of €25 million in each. In 2023, Alba has disbursed close to €9 million between the two vehicles.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **REAL ESTATE ACTIVITY**\n\n<span id=\"page-72-0\"></span>The rental market for offices in Madrid in fiscal year 2023 was marked by the adjustment to the new post-COVID scenario, the boost in technology, the concern for sustainability and wellbeing, the preference for strategic locations, stable prices with an upward trend in *prime* areas and greater flexibility in terms of contracts and services.\n\nThe concern for environmental sustainability and employee well-being influenced office leasing decisions. Buildings certified with environmental standards, such as LEED or BREEAM, and those that incorporated wellness-focused designs, such as natural lighting and green spaces, were highly valued by companies.\n\nDespite the work from home flexibility patterns, strategic locations in Madrid, such as Paseo de la Castellana or Azca, maintained or increased their attractiveness. Thus, the demand for office spaces in central and well-connected locations remained strong. As a result, there was an upward trend in office rental prices in *prime* areas due to high demand and the limited availability of quality space in these locations.\n\nAlba's real estate investment strategy focuses on the acquisition of office properties in *prime* areas of Madrid, buildings as a whole only, preferably leased to companies of reputable solvency.\n\nThe leasable area at December 31, 2023 amounted to 42,420 sqm and 1,038 parking spaces, with no changes in the portfolio during the year. The occupancy rate stood at 97.7% at the end of the year, compared to 88.4% of the previous year.\n\nThe value of the properties is updated every six months by an independent expert, who, as of December 31, 2023, valued them at €301 million.\n\nIncome from property leases amounted to €15 million in 2023, 16.3% higher than in 2022, as a result of the higher occupancy level of the properties and the increase in the average rent of the leases.\n\nDuring the year, investments of €3 million were made to improve leasable spaces, strengthen the image of the properties that required it and modernize the facilities, achieving greater efficiency, better compliance with ESG standards and the generation of added value in them.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\nLastly, in the last quarter of the year, the drafting of the project for the integral refurbishment of a building located at Castellana, 44 Bis (Ottea Building) was completed, and which remodel began in 2024 and is expected to be completed in the last quarter of 2025.\n\nAt year-end 2023, Alba's portfolio included the following properties: Castellana Building, 89; Castellana Building, 42; Castellana Building, 44; Oasis Building and Castelló Building, 74.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-74-0\"></span>Image /page/74/Picture/0 description: The image shows the KPMG logo.

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/79/Picture/0 description: The image shows the KPMG logo.

Its basic activities include the operation of buildings under lease agreements and the holding of interests in companies through venture capital activity. Alba and its subsidiaries make up the Alba Group (hereinafter, Alba or the Group).\n\nGiven Alba's activities, it does not have any environmental liabilities, expenses, assets, provisions or contingencies that could be material with respect to its equity, financial position or results.

All mandatory accounting principles and measurement criteria with a significant effect on the consolidated annual accounts have been applied.\n\nThe directors of the Parent consider that the consolidated annual accounts for 2023, authorised for issue on 18 March 2024, will be approved with no changes by the shareholders at their annual general meeting.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/89/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The logo is in a teal color and features the word \"ALBA\" in large, bold, white letters. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white letters.\n\n- c) Standards and interpretations published by the IASB but not yet approved by the European Union.\n\t- Amendment to IAS 1.

Amendments to disclosures in the financial statements regarding supplier agreements and their effects on liabilities, cash flows and liquidity risk.\n\nThe Group's directors do not expect significant future impacts from the application of such amendments.\n\n#### **2.2. Use of judgement and estimates in the preparation of the consolidated annual accounts**\n\nThe preparation of certain information included in these consolidated annual accounts has required the use of judgements and estimates based on assumptions that affect the application of accounting criteria and policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses and obligations. The most significant estimates used in preparing these consolidated annual accounts are as follows:\n\n- The estimate of the recoverable amount of interests in associates with indications of impairment.\n- The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of certain unlisted financial assets and investment property.\n- The determination of the fair values in business combinations and the assessment of possible impairment losses on certain assets.\n\nThe estimates and assumptions used are periodically reviewed. Any change in accounting estimates following such a review or due to future events is recognised in the consolidated income statement for that and successive periods, in accordance with IAS 8.\n\n#### **2.3. Subsidiaries**\n\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated. The Group obtains control when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with a subsidiary and it has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary. Specifically, the Group controls a subsidiary if and only if, the Group has:\n\n- Power over the subsidiary (existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the subsidiary).\n- Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary.\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/91/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, bold, white letters, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white letters. The entire logo is set against a teal background and is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n• The ability to use its power over the subsidiary to affect the amount of the returns.\n\nIt is generally assumed that a majority of voting rights amounts to control. In cases where the Group manages venture capital entities or holds investments therein, internal procedures and criteria that take into consideration IFRS 10 are applied to determine whether control exists and, therefore, whether or not the entity should be fully consolidated. These methods take into consideration, among other aspects, the scope of its decision-making authority, the rights held by other parties, the remuneration to which it is entitled in accordance with the remuneration agreement(s) or the decision-maker's exposure to variability of returns from other interests that it holds in the investee.\n\nThe assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are measured initially at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. a bargain purchase) the difference is recognised in profit or loss on the acquisition date.\n\nThird-party interests in the Group's equity and profit or loss for the year are recognised as non-controlling interests within total equity in the consolidated balance sheet and as profit or loss attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated income statement.\n\nIn accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, Group companies and business combinations are fully consolidated and all their assets, liabilities, income, expenses and cash flows are included in the consolidated annual accounts after making the adjustments and eliminations relating to intra-Group transactions.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/92/Picture/0 description: The image shows a logo for ALBA Grupo March.

Ltd.\n\n(2) At 31 December 2022 this subgroup was made up of Disfasa, S.A., Facundo Blancos, S.A.U., Los Girasoles, S.A.U., Incofasa, S.L.U. and PDV Gesfasa D. S.L.U.\n\n(1) (2) (3) Alba's interests are held through Deyá Capital IV, SCR, S.A.U.\n\nAdditionally, at 31 December 2022, 53.21% of Gesdocument, 42.57% of the Nuadi subgroup and 48.8% of the Facundo subgroup belonged to other companies /\nventure capital funds in which Alba did not hold an interest, but which were managed by Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., which exercised control over said vehicles and determined what investments to make. There were no restrictions regarding management and they were exposed to variable returns. As a result of the\nforegoing, Alba considered that it had control over these subgroups in 2022.\n\nThe main changes in the scope of consolidation in 2023 relating to subsidiaries were as follows:\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/93/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, and \"GRUPO MARCH\" is in a smaller, white, sans-serif font below it. The text is set against a teal background, and the entire logo is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n*(Free translation from the original in Spanish. In the event of discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.)* Sale of the entire stake in Artá Partners, S.A.\n\nIn March 2023, the Company sold all the shares it held in the subsidiary Artá Partners, S.A., the owner of 100% of the shares of Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U. The sale gave rise to a gain of Euros 2.5 million, recognised under proceeds from disposal of non-current assets. At 31 December 2023, Euros 4.5 million of long-term receivables are outstanding under other non-current receivables.\n\nAt 31 December 2022 the assets and liabilities of these two companies were classified as held for sale.\n\nAs a result of the loss of control of the venture capital management company Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., the Group has ceased to exercise control over the Nuadi, Facundo and Gesdocument subgroups. Therefore, since the date Artá Partners, S.A. was sold, these subgroups have ceased to be fully consolidated and have been recognised at fair value under investments at fair value through profit or loss (see note 11), generating a gain of Euros 7.3 million at 31 December 2023.\n\nWhen control over Nuadi, Facundo and Gesdocument was lost, Alba held direct interests of 37.43%, 31.92% and 46.53%, respectively, in each of the companies. In addition, there were stakes of 42.57% (Nuadi), 48.08% (Facundo) and 53.21% (Gesdocument) belonging to other companies / venture capital funds in which Alba did not hold an interest, but which were managed by Artá (a company in which Alba is the majority shareholder). This meant that the percentage managed before the loss of control was 80.00% in the cases of Nuadi and Facundo and 90.64% in the case of Gesdocument.\n\nSince the sale, Alba has ceased to participate in the management of these companies via Artá and has only held direct stakes of 37.43% (Nuadi), 31.92% (Facundo) and 46.53% (Gesdocument), therefore exerting no control over them.\n\nThe fair value of the Nuadi Group was calculated by Kroll Advisory, S.L., an independent expert, and the methodology used was the same as that described in note 11 for the measurement of investments at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe main assumptions used to calculate the fair value were as follows:\n\n- Growth rate in perpetuity (g): 2%\n- Weighted average cost of capital (WACC): 12.5%\n\nIn the case of Facundo and Gesdocument, the investments had been in Alba's portfolio for less than one year at the time of the loss of control of the holdings. They have therefore been valued at their purchase price plus the profit obtained since the acquisition of the holdings. This amount is consistent with their fair value, as there have been no events that would have changed the value of the investment in the short period of time between purchase and loss of control. Therefore, due to the proximity\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/94/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA Grupo March. The logo is in a teal rectangle. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font. Below \"ALBA\" is \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The words \"GRUPO MARCH\" are underlined by a teal line.\n\n*(Free translation from the original in Spanish. In the event of discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.)* of the dates between the acquisition and the loss of control of the holdings, the fair value and consolidated net assets of the two companies are the same.\n\nThe main changes in the scope of consolidation in 2022 relating to subsidiaries were as follows:\n\n#### Sale of the entire ownership interest in the Satlink subgroup\n\nOn 31 March 2022, the sale of the Group's entire ownership interest in the Satlink Group, which at the time of the sale amounted to 28.07%, was completed. The sale amounted to Euros 48.5 million, giving rise to a gain of Euros 36.4 million recognised at 31 December 2022 under proceeds from disposal of non-current assets.\n\n#### Loss of control of the Preving subgroup\n\nIn May 2022, the Preving Group acquired all the shares of Cualtis, S.L.U.; concurrent to the acquisition, a capital increase was carried out at Preving to allow new shareholders to join the subgroup. As a result of these transactions and the entry of new shareholders, the Alba Group's interest in Preving was diluted from 24.81% to 21.41%, and it lost control over the Preving Group as a result of the loss of control of the majority interest by the venture capital management company Artá Capital SGEIC, S.A.U. and the new shareholders' agreements between the parties.\n\nSince the Alba Group's loss of control, the Group's 21.41% ownership interest in Preving has been recognised at fair value under investments at fair value through profit or loss (see note 11), giving rise to a gain of Euros 16.1 million in 2022.\n\n#### Acquisition of 37.43% of the Facundo Group\n\nIn June 2022, through Deyá Capital IV, SCR, S.A., Alba acquired 37.43% of the share capital of Disfasa, S.A. (parent of the Facundo Group) for Euros 21.9 million. The Facundo Group has its registered office in Spain and its principal activity is the production and distribution of nuts, dried fruit and snacks. The main reason for control over this group was that the venture capital management company Artá Capital SGEIC, S.A.U. managed a majority ownership interest (see business combination in note 5). Subsequently, in December, the Group sold its 5.51% interest in the Facundo Group for Euros 3.3 million, giving rise to a gain of Euros 0.1 million in 2022. At 31 December 2022, Alba held 31.92% of the Facundo Group.\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/95/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The entire logo is set against a teal background and is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n*(Free translation from the original in Spanish. In the event of discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.)* Acquisition of 46.79% of Gesdocument y Gestión, S.A.\n\nIn June 2022, through Deyá Capital IV, SCR, S.A., Alba acquired 46.79% of the share capital of Gesdocument y Gestión, S.A. for Euros 8.2 million. Gesdocument y Gestión, S.A. has its registered office in Spain, and its principal activity is the provision of tax, economic, financial, administrative, employment and accounting advisory services. The main reason for control over this group was that the venture capital management company Artá Capital SGEIC, S.A.U. managed a majority ownership interest (see business combination in note 5).\n\nIn 2023 KPMG Auditores, S.L. was the auditor of all of the companies mentioned except for Alba Europe, S.à r.l. and Alba Investments, S.à r.l., which were audited by Audit Consell Services, S.à r.l., and Alba KKR Core International, S.C.A., which was audited by Deloitte, S.L.\n\nIn 2022 KPMG Auditores, S.L. was the auditor of all of the companies mentioned except for Alba Europe, S.à r.l. and Alba Investments, S.à.r.l., which were audited by Audit Consell Services, S.à r.l., Alba KKR Core International, S.C.A., the Preving subgroup, and the Facundo subgroup, which were audited by Deloitte, S.L., and the Nuadi subgroup, which was audited by Ernst&Young, S.L.\n\n#### **2.4. Associates**\n\nEntities over which Alba exercises significant influence even though its interest therein is less than 20% are considered associates. To determine whether significant influence exists, among other situations the Parent considers representation on the Board of Directors, involvement in establishing policies and the permanence of the interest.\n\nDetails for 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/96/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Alba sits on the Board of Directors of Rioja Acquisition, S.à.r.l., a subsidiary of Rioja Luxembourg, S.à.r.l. and direct shareholder of Naturgy.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/97/Picture/0 description: The image shows a logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, bold, white letters on a teal background. Below \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white letters.\n\nThere were no acquisitions or disposals of investments in associates in 2023. Alba has increased its stakes in Acerinox, S.A. and CIE Automotive, S.A. due to the redemption of own shares carried out by these companies. As a result of these transactions, Acerinox, S.A. reduced its share capital by 4% and, therefore, Alba's ownership interest increased by 0.77%. CIE Automotive, S.A. reduced its share capital by 2.2% and, consequently, Alba increased its stake by 0.31%.\n\nIn 2022 Alba saw its ownership interest in Acerinox, S.A. increase because of Acerinox's redemption of own shares. As a result of this transaction, Acerinox, S.A. reduced its share capital by 4% and, therefore, Alba's ownership interest increased by 0.74%. The ownership interests in CIE Automotive, S.A., Ebro Foods, S.A. and Viscofan, S.A. increased through new acquisitions in 2022.\n\n#### **3. Distribution of Profit**\n\nThe distribution of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A.'s profit for 2023 to be submitted by the Board of Directors for approval by the shareholders at their general meeting, and the distribution of profit for 2022 approved by the shareholders at their general meeting, are as follows (in millions of Euros):\n\n| Basis of allocation | 2023  | 2022 |\n|---------------------|-------|------|\n| Profit for the year | 194.1 | 41.2 |\n| Total               | 194.1 | 41.2 |\n| Distribution        |       |      |\n| Reserves            | 194.1 | 41.2 |\n| Total               | 194.1 | 41.2 |\n\nIn addition, Alba's Board of Directors plans to propose for approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2024 a scrip dividend of up to Euros 58,566,264.47 (equivalent to Euros 0.938 per share), whereby the Company's shareholders may choose between (i) receiving newly issued bonus shares; (ii) obtaining an equivalent amount in cash by transferring to the Company the free allotment rights they receive for the shares they hold; and/or (iii) obtaining the cash value by transferring such rights on the market.\n\nThe dividends paid by the Company in 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n\n|                               | No. of shares<br>with rights | Euros/Share | Millions<br>of Euros |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|\n| 2023                          |                              |             |                      |\n| Scrip dividend 2023 (note 15) | 6,244,550                    | 0.96        | 6.0                  |\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/98/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Significant Accounting Policies**\n\nThe main accounting policies used in preparing the accompanying consolidated annual accounts were as follows:\n\n#### **a) Business combinations and non-controlling interests (minority interests) (note 5)**\n\n#### **Business Combinations**\n\nAlba applies the acquisition method for business combinations. The acquisition date is the date on which Alba obtains control of the acquiree.\n\nThe consideration transferred in a business combination is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred or assumed, the equity instruments issued and any consideration contingent on future events or compliance with certain conditions in exchange for control of the acquiree.\n\nThe consideration transferred excludes any payment that does not form part of the exchange for the acquired business. Acquisition costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.\n\nThe Group recognises the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair value. Noncontrolling interests in the acquiree are recognised at the proportionate interest in the fair value of the net assets acquired. This criterion is only applicable for non-controlling interests which grant present access to economic benefits and entitlement to a proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets in the event of liquidation. Otherwise, non-controlling interests are measured at fair value or value based on market conditions. Liabilities assumed include any contingent liabilities that represent present obligations arising from past events for which the fair value can be reliably measured. The Group also recognises indemnification assets transferred by the seller at the same time and following the same measurement criteria as the item that is subject to indemnification from the acquiree, taking into consideration, where applicable, the insolvency risk and any contractual limitations on the indemnified amount.\n\nWith the exception of lease and insurance contracts, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are classified and designated for subsequent measurement based on contractual agreements, economic terms, accounting and operating policies and any other conditions existing at the acquisition date.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/99/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, and \"GRUPO MARCH\" is in a smaller, white, sans-serif font below it. The background is a teal color, and there is a thin white border around the entire logo.\n\nThe excess of the consideration given, plus the value assigned to non-controlling interests, over the net of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognised as goodwill. Any shortfall, after evaluating the consideration given, the value assigned to non-controlling interests and the identification and measurement of net assets acquired, is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nIf it has only been possible to determine a business combination provisionally at the end of the reporting period, the identifiable net assets are initially recognised at their provisional amounts and adjustments made during the measurement period are recognised as if they had been known at that date. Comparative figures for the previous year are restated where applicable. In any event, adjustments to provisional amounts only reflect information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date and, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognised at that date.\n\nThe potential benefit of the acquiree's income tax loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets, which are not recognised as they did not qualify for recognition at the acquisition date, is accounted for as income tax income provided that it does not arise from a measurement period adjustment.\n\nThe contingent consideration is classified in accordance with the underlying contractual terms as a financial asset or financial liability, equity instrument or provision. Subsequent changes in the fair value of a financial asset or financial liability are recognised in consolidated profit or loss or other comprehensive income, provided that they do not arise from a measurement period adjustment. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured, and subsequent settlement is accounted for in equity.\n\nContingent consideration classified as a provision is subsequently recognised in accordance with the relevant measurement standard.\n\nThe cost of the business combination includes contingent consideration, if this is probable at the acquisition date and can be reliably estimated. Subsequent recognition of or changes to contingent consideration are recognised as a prospective adjustment to the cost of the business combination.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/100/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, bold, white letters, and the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" are in smaller, white letters below \"ALBA\". The background is a teal color, and there is a teal border around the logo.\n\n#### **Non-controlling interests (minority interests)**\n\nNon-controlling interests in subsidiaries are recognised at the acquisition date in the amount of the proportionate share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries acquired prior to the date of first-time consolidation were recognised in the amount of the proportionate share of the equity of those subsidiaries at that date.\n\nThe consolidated profit for the year and changes in equity of the subsidiaries attributable to Alba and to noncontrolling interests after consolidation adjustments and eliminations is determined in accordance with the percentage ownership at year end, without considering the possible exercise or conversion of potential voting rights and after discounting the effect of dividends, agreed or not, on cumulative preference shares classified in equity accounts. However, Group and non-controlling interests are calculated taking into account the possible exercise of potential voting rights and other derivative financial instruments which, in substance, currently allow access to the economic benefits associated with the interests held, such as entitlement to a share in future dividends and changes in the value of subsidiaries.\n\nProfit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are allocated to equity attributable to shareholders of the Parent and to non-controlling interests in proportion to their investment, even if this results in a balance receivable from non-controlling interests. Agreements entered into between the Group and non-controlling interests are recognised as a separate transaction.\n\n#### **b) Investment property (note 6)**\n\nInvestment property and buildings used for rental purposes are initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value, determined by independent experts in accordance with the following definition: \"The price at which the building could be sold under private contract between a willing seller and an arm's length buyer on the date of valuation, it being assumed that the property is publicly exposed to the market, that market conditions permit orderly disposal and that a normal period, having regard to the nature of the property, is available for the negotiation of the sale\". Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement for the period in which they arise. These investments are not depreciated.\n\n#### **b.1) Leases**\n\nDetermination of whether a contract is, or contains, a lease is based on the economic substance of the agreement at the inception date thereof. The contract is analysed to determine whether its fulfilment depends on the use of an asset or specific assets or the agreement implies the right of use of an asset or assets, even though this right is not explicitly specified in the contract.\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/101/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, with each letter equally spaced. Below \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The entire logo is set against a teal background.\n\nLeases in which the Group maintains substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are classified as operating leases. Contingent rents are recognised as income in the year in which they are obtained.\n\n#### **c) Property, plant and equipment (note 7)**\n\nIn application of IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, buildings for own use were recognised on 1 January 2004 at fair value, determined by independent experts as defined in the previous note, considering this amount to be the cost of acquisition. This increase in value was credited to equity in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe remaining property, plant and equipment are valued at cost of acquisition; interest and exchange differences are not included. Costs of expansion, modernisation or improvements which increase the productivity, capacity or efficiency or extend the useful lives of assets are capitalised as an increase in the cost of those assets.\n\nDepreciation is provided on a straight-line basis, distributing the carrying amount of the assets over their estimated useful lives, in accordance with the following percentages:\n\n|                                  | Annual<br>depreciation<br>rates |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Buildings and constructions      | 2                               |\n| Technical installations          | 8                               |\n| Furniture and fixtures           | 10                              |\n| Information technology equipment | 25                              |\n\nIf the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and its carrying amount is immediately written down to its recoverable amount.\n\n#### **d) Intangible assets**\n\n#### **d.1) Goodwill**\n\nGoodwill is determined using the same criteria as for business combinations (see note 5).\n\nGoodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently where events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Goodwill on business combinations is allocated to the cashgenerating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs which are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination and the criteria described in note 8 are applied. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/102/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The text is set against a teal background.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the assets is the higher of their fair value less costs of disposal and their value in use.\n\nIf the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the difference is recognised under impairment losses in the consolidated income statement.\n\n#### **d.2) Customer portfolio**\n\nThe relationships with customers that Alba recognises under customer portfolios are separable and based on a contractual relationship, thus meeting the requirements set out in prevailing legislation for consideration as intangible assets separate from goodwill. In general, these are customer service contracts that have been recognised in the allocation of fair values in business combinations.\n\nThe fair value allocated to customer contract portfolios acquired from third parties is the acquisition price.\n\nThe income approach was used to determine the fair value of intangible assets allocated in business combinations in the form of customer relationships; discounting the cash flows generated by these relationships at the date of acquisition of the subsidiary. Cash flows are estimated based on the sales, operating investments and EBITDA margins projected in the Company's business plans.\n\nCustomer portfolios are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The useful life is estimated based on indicators such as average length of relationship with customers or the average annual customer churn rate. The useful lives allocated to these intangible assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. The useful life of customer portfolios is between 10 and 15 years.\n\nCustomer portfolios are allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) in accordance with their respective business segment and the country of operation.\n\n#### **d.3) Other intangible assets**\n\nThese are intangible assets that were recognised in business combinations.\n\nThey are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life, which is between 3 and 60 years.\n\nOther intangible assets are allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) in accordance with their respective business segment and the country of operation.\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/103/Picture/0 description: The image shows the word \"ALBA\" in white letters on a teal background. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller white letters.\n\nIf an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of assets subject to amortisation may not be recoverable, Alba determines whether impairment losses have been incurred. An impairment loss is recognised as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value of the asset less costs of disposal, and value in use. For impairment testing purposes, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which separate identifiable cash flows can be identified (cashgenerating unit, CGU). Impaired non-financial assets other than goodwill are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to assess whether the loss has been reversed.\n\n#### **e) Investments in associates (note 10)**\n\nInvestments in associates are accounted for using the equity method from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases. However, if on the acquisition date all or part of the investment qualifies for recognition as non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale, it is recognised at fair value less costs of disposal.\n\nInvestments in associates are initially recognised at cost of acquisition, including any cost directly attributable to the acquisition and any consideration receivable or payable contingent on future events or on compliance with certain conditions.\n\nThe excess of the cost of the investment over the Group's share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill, which is included in the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nThe Group's share of the profit or loss of associates is recognised as an increase or decrease in the value of the investments, with a credit or debit to share of the profit or loss for the year of associates. The Group's share of other comprehensive income of associates from the date of acquisition is recognised as an increase or decrease in the value of the investments in associates with a balancing entry in other comprehensive income based on the nature of the investment. The distribution of dividends is recognised as a decrease in the value of the investment. The Group's share of profit or loss, including impairment losses recognised by the associates, is calculated based on income and expenses arising from application of the acquisition method.\n\nThe Group's share of the profit or loss of an associate and of changes in equity is calculated without considering the possible exercise or conversion of potential voting rights.\n\nImpairment is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the net investment in the associate with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. Accordingly, value in use is calculated based on the Group's share in the present value of estimated cash flows from ordinary operations and the income generated on final disposal of the associate.\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/104/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, and the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" are in a smaller, white, sans-serif font below the word \"ALBA\". The background is a teal color, and there is a teal border around the logo.\n\nImpairment losses are not allocated to goodwill or other assets implicit in the investment in associates derived from application of the acquisition method. In subsequent years, reversals of impairment of investments are recognised in profit or loss to the extent of any increase in the recoverable amount. Impairment losses are presented separately from the Group's share of profit or loss of associates.\n\n#### **f) Investments at fair value through profit or loss (note 11)**\n\nInvestments held with the intention of not selling them in the short term and those held through venture capital companies are included in this line item pursuant to IAS 28.18.\n\nThey are recognised at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe fair value of investments in unlisted companies was determined using either the analysis of multiples of comparable companies or the discounted cash flow method, whichever was the most suitable method for each investment.\n\n#### **g) Non-current assets and liabilities held for sale (note 30)**\n\nAlba classifies non-current assets or disposal groups as non-current assets held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale, provided that they are available for sale in their present condition subject to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets and that the transaction is highly probable.\n\nAlba does not depreciate non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale, rather it measures them at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less the costs of disposal.\n\nImpairment losses on initial classification and subsequent remeasurement of assets classified as held for sale are recognised under profit or loss from continuing operations in the consolidated income statement, unless it is a discontinued operation. Impairment losses are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill and then to reduce pro rata the carrying amounts of other assets in the unit.\n\nAlba recognises gains arising from increases in the fair value less costs of disposal in profit or loss to the extent of the cumulative impairment previously recognised due to measurement at fair value less costs of disposal or to impairment of non-current assets.\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/105/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, with each letter being capitalized. Below \"ALBA\" is the text \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The entire logo is set against a teal background and is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n#### **h) Calculation of fair value (notes 6, 11 and 20)**\n\nAlba measures financial instruments and non-financial assets such as investment property at their fair value at the reporting date of the financial statements. Details of the fair value of financial assets measured at amortised cost are provided in note 20. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the transaction date. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n\n- In the principal market for the asset or liability; or\n- In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability\n\nThe principal or most advantageous market must be a market that is accessible for Alba.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is calculated using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\n\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\n\nAlba uses valuation techniques appropriate to the circumstances and for which sufficient information is available to calculate the fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nAll the assets and liabilities for which calculations or disclosures of their fair value are made in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy described below, based on the lowest level input necessary for the calculation of the fair value measurement in its entirety:\n\n- Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input used that is significant for the calculation is directly or indirectly observable.\n- Level 3 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input used that is significant for the calculation is unobservable.\n\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, at the end of each year Alba reviews their categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant for the calculation of fair value as a whole) to determine whether there have been any transfers between the different levels of the hierarchy.\n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/106/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif letters on a teal background. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white, sans-serif letters.\n\nAlba determines the policies and procedures for recurring fair value calculations, such as investment property and unlisted financial assets.\n\nFor the valuation of significant assets and liabilities, such as investment property, financial assets and contingent consideration, internal and external valuers are used.\n\nFor the purposes of the required disclosures of fair value, the Group has determined the different classes of assets and liabilities based on their nature, characteristics, risks and fair value hierarchy as explained previously.\n\n#### **i) Loans and receivables (notes 12, 13 and 14)**\n\nThe Group initially measures the financial assets included in this category (other financial assets and trade and other receivables) at fair value, which is the transaction price. In transactions with a due date within one year for which there is no contractual interest rate, dividends receivable and receivables on called-up equity instruments expected to be collected in the short term are measured at their nominal amount, as the effect of not discounting the cash flows is immaterial.\n\nSubsequently these financial assets are measured at amortised cost and the interest accrued is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method. At least once a year, and whenever there is objective evidence that a loan or receivable is impaired, Alba carries out impairment testing. Based on this analysis, Alba recognises the corresponding impairment losses where applicable.\n\nThe impairment loss on these financial assets is calculated as the difference between their carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.\n\nImpairment and reversals thereof are recognised as an expense or income, respectively, in the income statement. The loss can only be reversed up to the limit of the carrying amount of the receivable that would have been recorded at the reversal date had the impairment loss not been recognised.\n\n#### **j) Cash and cash equivalents (note 14)**\n\nThis line item of the balance sheet includes cash on hand, demand deposits and other current highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n#### **k) Financial liabilities (note 19)**\n\nFinancial liabilities generally include loans and borrowings that are initially recognised at the cash amount received, less transaction costs. In subsequent periods they are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/107/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, with each letter taking up a significant portion of the image. Below \"ALBA\" is the text \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, sans-serif font. The entire logo is set against a teal background.\n\n#### **l) Own shares (note 15)**\n\nOwn shares are recognised as a reduction in equity. No gain or loss is recognised for the purchase, sale, issue, redemption or cancellation of Alba's own equity instruments.\n\n#### **m) Provisions (note 17)**\n\nProvisions are recognised for present obligations arising from a past event when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. If the effect of the time value of money is significant, the provision is discounted using a pre-tax rate. When discounted, increases in the provision due to the passage of time are recognised as a finance cost.\n\n#### **n) Income tax (note 22)**\n\nThe income tax expense is calculated as the sum of current tax, calculated by applying the relevant tax rate to the taxable income or tax loss for the period, less any existing deductions and credits, plus any changes in recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period. The income tax expense is recognised in the income statement, except when it relates to transactions recognised directly in equity, in which case the associated tax is also recognised in equity, or as part of a business combination with a charge or credit to goodwill.\n\n#### **o) Alternative pension plan schemes**\n\nAlba has three plans – two defined benefit plans and one defined contribution plan – which are externalised to insurance companies and require that contributions be made to a separately managed fund.\n\nThe Group recognises the contributions payable to a defined contribution plan in exchange for a service when an employee has rendered service to the Group. The amount of the contributions accrued are recognised as personnel expenses. If the contribution already paid exceeds the accrued expense, the Group only recognises the corresponding asset to the extent that the prepayments will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.\n\nWhen contributions to a defined contribution plan are not expected to be paid in full within the 12 months after the end of the year in which the employees render the related service, they are discounted using the market yield on high quality corporate bonds.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/108/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif font on a teal background. Below \"ALBA\" is \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font.\n\nThe projected unit credit method was used to measure the obligation derived from pension commitments. With this method the benefits are financed as and when they are generated, based on the employee's years of service at the Company, so that the commitment is fully funded by the end of the employee's working life when they reach retirement age.\n\nPast service cost is recognised in the consolidated income statement at the earlier of the following dates:\n\n- When the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and\n- When the Group recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.\n\nThe discount rate of obligations and of assets intended to settle the commitments was determined considering the return on high quality corporate bonds with a similar maturity to the commitments measured, using German public debt as a benchmark.\n\nThe main assumptions used in 2023 and 2022 to measure defined benefit obligations were as follows:\n\n|                                                                                     | 2023                   | 2022                   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Mortality tables                                                                    | PERM 2020_Col_1st_rank | PERM 2020_Col_1st_rank |\n| Technical interest agreed in the policies                                           | 2.5%                   | 2.5%                   |\n| CPI growth                                                                          | 2.0%                   | 2.0%                   |\n| Pay rises                                                                           | 2.5%                   | 2.5%                   |\n| Changes in Social Security base                                                     | CPI + 1.20%            | 2.0%                   |\n| Discount rate of obligations and<br>of assets intended to settle the<br>commitments | 3.0%                   | 3.7%                   |\n| Retirement age                                                                      | 65                     | 65                     |\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/109/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Revenue is recognised when it can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. It is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.\n\nRevenue is recognised when the customer obtains control of the goods or services sold, i.e. when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain benefits from the goods or services. Depending on the commercial terms of sale, the transfer of control and risk relating to the goods may occur when the materials are dispatched from the Group's facilities or delivered to the customer. The Group takes these terms of sale into account in determining the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when control over the goods is transferred to the customer. Revenues associated with the rendering of services are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the service at the reporting date; this occurs when revenues can be estimated reliably, it is probable that the benefits of the transaction will flow to the company and the stage of completion and the costs already incurred can be measured reliably.\n\nPurchases, consumables used and changes in merchandise and raw materials, as well as work carried out by other companies, are included under supplies.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/111/Picture/0 description: The image shows the word \"ALBA\" in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The text is set against a teal background, and the entire image is contained within a teal rectangle.\n\nThe Group has not made any significant judgements in determining the recognition of the revenue of any of the aforementioned subgroups.\n\nThe Group uses the five-step model to determine when revenue should be recognised and how much revenue should be recognised.\n\n- 1. Identify the contract with the customer.\n- 2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract.\n- 3. Determine the transaction price.\n- 4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations.\n- 5. Recognise revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.\n\nRevenue associated with the rendering of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period, provided the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably.\n\nLease income from investment property is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\nInterest income is recognised applying financial criteria, based on the outstanding portion of the principal, the time to maturity and the applicable effective interest rate.\n\nDividend income from investments is recognised when the right to receive it is recognised.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, in addition to the income from the lease of Alba's properties, the amount recorded under revenue includes the income contributed by the Nuadi, Facundo and Gesdocument subgroups during the first three months of the year. At 31 December 2022, the revenue of the Nuadi, Facundo, Gesdocument, Preving and Satlink subgroups was included.\n\nThe nature of the revenue of each of these subgroups in 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\n\n- Satlink subgroup: Revenues are generated primarily from the sale of buoys for fishing activities and the provision of communications services.\n- Nuadi subgroup: Revenues are generated primarily from the sale of stamped metal components, plates, electrical wiring and other brake accessories in the automotive sector.\n- Preving subgroup: Revenues are generated primarily from the provision of occupational risk prevention services.\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/112/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, and the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" are in a smaller, white, sans-serif font below the word \"ALBA\". The background is a teal rectangle.\n\n- Facundo subgroup: Revenues are generated primarily from the sale of nuts, dried fruit and snacks.\n- Gesdocument: Revenues are generated primarily from the provision of legal, employment and financial advisory services.\n\n#### **r) Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities**\n\nAssets are recognised under right-of-use assets and are classified based on the nature of the underlying asset. At the commencement date they are measured at the amortised cost of the contract, and subsequently they are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.\n\nThe lease liability reflects the fixed instalments agreed and the initial or future payments that are considered highly probable (direct costs related to start-up or penalties, among others), excluding from this calculation variable rent tied to the future measurement of a parameter. The liability is measured at amortised cost using the interest rate implicit in the lease agreement or, if this rate cannot be easily determined, the incremental interest rate payable by the Group for such an agreement.\n\nThe liability is discounted using the effective interest method and decreased by the payments made.\n\nThe Group remeasures the lease liability by discounting the lease payments at a revised discount rate, if there has been a change in the lease term or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.\n\nThe Group accounts for a lease modification as a separate lease if the modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets; and the consideration for the lease increases by an amount commensurate with the stand-alone price for the increase in scope and any appropriate adjustments to that stand-alone price to reflect the circumstances of the particular contract.\n\n#### **5. Business combinations**\n\n#### **Goodwill generated in 2023**\n\nThe Group did not carry out any business combinations in 2023.\n\n#### **Goodwill generated in 2022**\n\n#### Acquisition of 37.43% of the Facundo Group\n\nIn June 2022, through Deyá Capital IV, SCR, S.A., Alba acquired 37.43% of the share capital of Disfasa, S.A. (parent of the Facundo Group) for Euros 21.9 million. The Facundo Group has its registered office in Spain and its principal activity is the production and distribution of nuts, dried fruit and snacks. The main reason for this business combination was that the venture capital management company, Arta Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., controlled a majority interest.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/113/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA Grupo March.

Had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2022, the Group's revenue and consolidated profit for the year ended 31 December 2022 would have amounted to Euros 29.8 million and Euros 7.8 million, respectively.\n\nThe fair value of this business combination was estimated by an independent third party. The recognition of this business combination was considered as definitive at 31 December 2022, since at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated annual accounts the valuation had been finalised. Therefore, Group management did not modify the fair value of the assets acquired in 2023.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/114/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The MEEM estimates the value as the present value of the earnings anticipated from ownership of the intangible asset in excess of the returns required on the investment in the contributory assets necessary to realise those earnings. It is based on the theory that all operating assets contribute to a company's profitability. Accordingly, if the estimated earnings associated with a company's specific asset are dependent on the use of the company's other assets, then the estimated excess earnings of the asset should include charges for the use of these contributory assets. This method was applied for the valuation of the customer portfolio, using a discount rate of 11.50%.\n\nAs a result of the loss of control of the venture capital management company Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., the Group no longer exercises control over the Facundo Group, which is therefore no longer fully consolidated and is now carried at fair value (see note 2.3).\n\n#### Acquisition of 46.79% of Gesdocument y Gestión, S.A.\n\nIn June 2022, through Deyá Capital IV, SCR, S.A., Alba acquired 46.79% of the share capital of Gesdocument y Gestión, S.A. for Euros 8 million. Gesdocument y Gestión, S.A. has its registered office in Spain, and its principal activity is the provision of tax, economic, financial, administrative, employment and accounting advisory services. The main reason for this business combination was that the venture capital management company, Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., controlled the entire ownership interest in this company.\n\nDetails of the consideration given, the fair value of the net assets acquired and goodwill are as follows:\n\n| Cash paid                         | 8.2 |\n|-----------------------------------|-----|\n| Fair value of net assets acquired | 2.1 |\n| Goodwill                          | 6.1 |\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/115/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2022, the Group's revenue and consolidated profit for the year ended 31 December 2022 would have amounted to Euros 13.8 million and Euros 0.2 million, respectively.\n\nThe estimate of the fair value of this business combination was calculated internally by Company management, considering that there are no differences between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The recognition of this business combination in the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2022 was considered provisional, and any adjustments are to be made within one year from the date of acquisition. In 2023 Company management did not modify the fair value of the assets acquired, on considering such values definitive.\n\nAs a result of the loss of control of the venture capital management company Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., the Group no longer exercises control over Gesdocument, which is therefore no longer fully consolidated and is now carried at fair value (see note 2.3).\n\n#### **6. Investment Property**\n\nThis line item comprises buildings leased out. CBRE Valuation Advisory, S.A., a specialist in appraisals of this type of investments, valued these properties at 31 December 2023 and 2022. The valuation was performed according to the Property Appraisal and Valuation Standards and Observations Guide published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in the United Kingdom, and is based on the discounted cash flow and comparables method.\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/116/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, with each letter in a separate box. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The background of the logo is a teal color.\n\nThe methodology used to calculate the market value consists of preparing 10 years' worth of income and expense projections for each asset, which will subsequently be updated at the reporting date using a market discount rate. The residual amount at the end of year 10 is calculated applying a rate of return (\"exit yield\" or \"cap rate\") to the net income projections for year 11. The market values thus obtained are analysed by calculating and analysing the yield capitalisation implicit in these values. The projections are aimed at reflecting the best estimate of future income and expenses of the real estate assets. Both the rate of return and the discount rate are defined in accordance with the domestic market and considering the conditions prevailing in the institutional market.\n\nThe valuation method used considers each property on an individual basis, without contemplating any adjustments in respect of the asset belonging to a large portfolio of properties. For each property a rent capitalisation rate considered to be a market rate has been assumed, which was subsequently adjusted based on the following parameters:\n\n- The duration of the lease contract and the solvency of the tenant.\n- The location of the premises within the municipality (centre, metropolitan area or periphery).\n- The immediate surroundings of the property.\n- The state of conservation of the property (external and internal).\n- The distribution of the property's surface area between below ground and above ground.\n- The facade looks onto one or more streets (corner, chamfer).\n- The rental situation compared to market rent.\n\nAll of the Group's investment property is located in Madrid. Movement in this item is as follows:\n\n| Balance at 1-1-22    | 334.8  |\n|----------------------|--------|\n| Increases            | 2.0    |\n| Decreases            | (20.4) |\n| Change in fair value | 1.1    |\n| Balance at 31-12-22  | 317.5  |\n| Increases            | 3.1    |\n| Change in fair value | (19.4) |\n| Balance at 31-12-23  | 301.2  |\n\nThe increases in 2023 and 2022 mainly related to improvements to the properties and the acquisition of several parking spaces amounting to Euros 0.4 million and Euros 0.2 million, respectively. In 2022 the Group sold a building in Madrid for Euros 22 million; this sale gave rise to a gain of Euros 1.6 million.\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/117/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Goodwill**\n\nMovement in goodwill is as follows:\n\n| Balance at 1/1/2022                                                      | 79.6   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Acquisition of Gesdocument y Gestión, S.A. (note 5)                      | 6.1    |\n| Acquisition of Facundo Group (note 5)                                    | 43.0   |\n| Loss of control of Preving subgroup (note 2.3)                           | (54.5) |\n| Entry of Nuadi Group CGU                                                 | 1.1    |\n| Balance at 31/12/2022                                                    | 75.3   |\n| Loss of control of Nuadi, Facundo y Gesdocument and subgroups (note 2.3) | (75.3) |\n| Balance at 31/12/2023                                                    | -      |\n\nAs a result of the loss of control of the venture capital management company Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., the Group has ceased to exercise control over the Nuadi, Facundo and Gesdocument subgroups (see note 2.3) and, therefore, in 2023 all the goodwill that the Group held in relation to past acquisitions of these subgroups was derecognised.\n\nGoodwill arising from new acquisitions in 2022 was allocated to new cash-generating units (CGUs) arising as a result of these acquisitions.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to CGUs for impairment testing purposes. Goodwill is allocated to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination from which the goodwill arose.\n\nThe Group tests goodwill for impairment at the end of each reporting period, or earlier if there are indications of impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy described in note 4.d.1. At 31 December 2023 it was not necessary to perform an impairment analysis as the goodwill had been fully derecognised. No impairment losses were recognised on goodwill in 2022.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the various CGUs was determined on the basis of fair value calculations, based on the valuation report prepared by the independent external appraiser, Kroll Advisory, S.L. The method used to determine the recoverable amount was based on the discounted future cash flow method.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/120/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, and the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" are in a smaller, white, sans-serif font below the word \"ALBA\". The background is a teal rectangle.\n\nFinancial projections (sales, EBITDA, investments, etc.) are based on the budgets (if any are available) and business plans of the companies themselves (which are the same as the CGUs), approved by their respective boards of directors. These projections are not published and were presented to the Group at board meetings. In any case, the reasonableness of the projections prepared by the companies is contrasted with different market comparables and the Group's own opinion based on its past experience. Financial projections are made for a fiveyear period.\n\nThe key valuation variables are as follows: Discount rate (WACC) and perpetual growth rate (g):\n\n- The WACC is calculated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) generally accepted by the financial community, and on the basis of market variables obtained through Bloomberg, such as the rate of return on the 10-year bond or levered beta with respect to the benchmark stock market index. In addition, various internal estimates are used, such as: the spread for the Company's noncurrent debt in respect of the 10-year bond, the tax rate (same as for the cash flows used in the terminal value calculation) and the target capital structure.\n- The perpetual growth rate is calculated based on each company and the market in which it operates.\n\n#### **9. Other Intangible Assets**\n\nAs a result of the loss of control of the venture capital management company Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., the Group has ceased to exercise control over the Nuadi, Facundo and Gesdocument subgroups (see note 2.3) and, therefore, in 2023 all the intangible assets that the Group held in relation to these subgroups were derecognised.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, all intangible assets comprised other intangible assets in the amount of Euros 0.1 million, of which Euros 0.4 million corresponds to cost and Euros 0.3 million to accumulated amortisation.\n\nThe amortisation expense for 2023, up to the loss of control, amounted to Euros 2.4 million.\n\nDetails of the cost and accumulated amortisation of each class of intangible asset at 31 December 2022 were as follows:\n\n|                          | Trademarks | Customer portfolio | Other intangible assets | Total  |\n|--------------------------|------------|--------------------|-------------------------|--------|\n| Cost                     | 18.5       | 101.5              | 19.9                    | 139.9  |\n| Accumulated amortisation | -          | (14.7)             | (1.5)                   | (16.2) |\n|                          | 18.5       | 86.8               | 18.4                    | 123.7  |\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/121/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The word \"ALBA\" is in large, bold, white letters. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white letters. The background is a teal color.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, Alba recognised an impairment loss of Euros 45.2 million on the ownership interest in Ebro Foods, S.A. Alba also reversed in full the impairment of the interest in Profand Fishing Holding, S.L. of Euros 3.1 million recognised in 2022.\n\nProfand Fishing Holding, S.L. was valued by Kroll Advisory, S.L., an independent expert, which has issued its corresponding report. The method used by the independent expert to determine the recoverable amount of this investment is based on discounted future cash flows.\n\nFinancial projections (sales, EBITDA, investments, etc.) are based on the budgets and business plans of the company itself, approved by its Board of Directors. These projections are not published and are presented to Alba at board meetings. The financial projections used in the valuation were for five years. In addition, the reasonableness of the Company's projections has been tested against various market comparables.\n\nKey valuation variables: discount rate (WACC) and perpetual growth rate (g).\n\n- The WACC rate has been calculated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) adjusted by an additional risk premium. The discount rate was calculated after tax.\n- The perpetual growth rate has been calculated on the basis of a normalised cash flow based on the explicit projection of the last year (2028).\n\nThe most significant assumptions used in the valuation of Profand Fishing Holding, S.L. in 2023 were as follows:\n\n|                        | Profand Fishing Holding, S.L. |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Perpetual growth rate  | 2.0%                          |\n| Discount rate (WACC)   | 9.0%                          |\n| Capital structure:     |                               |\n| Capital                | 72.0%                         |\n| Debt                   | 28.0%                         |\n| Equity ratio           | 10.4%                         |\n| Cost of debt after tax | 4.7%                          |\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/125/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

In these cases Alba's Investment Department calculates the value in use of each investment, which was reviewed by the Finance Department without involving any independent experts. The discounted cash flow method is used, subsequently subtracting the amount of net debt and non-controlling interests. The assumptions used in 2023 were as follows:\n\n|                                  | Acerinox, S.A. | Ebro Foods, S.A. |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|------------------|\n| Perpetual growth rate            | 1.8%           | 1.5%             |\n| Discount rate (WACC)             | 9.4%           | 7.2%             |\n| Capital structure:               |                |                  |\n| Capital                          | 80%            | 80%              |\n| Debt                             | 20%            | 20%              |\n| Equity ratio                     | 10.7%          | 8.0%             |\n| Cost of debt after tax           | 4.4%           | 3.9%             |\n| Estimated value in use (€/share) | 13.34          | 16.60            |\n\nFinancial projections (sales, EBITDA, investments, etc.) are based, where available, on the annual budgets and business plans of the investees themselves approved by their respective boards of directors. In the event of any subsequent updates or reviews of these business plans by the companies themselves, the latest available version is used. In most cases the budgets and business plans of the investees are internal and have not been announced to the market. In any case, the reasonableness of the projections is contrasted with and supplemented by consensus estimates available through platforms such as Bloomberg and Factset, historical data and the opinion of Alba's own team based on its past experience.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/126/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The entire logo is contained within a teal rectangle.\n\nIn theory, no adjustments are made to the projections prepared by the companies or to consensus estimates. However, it may be necessary to use internal estimates prepared by Alba in certain situations:\n\n- When the existing projections, either those prepared by the companies themselves or consensus estimates, do not cover the minimum projected period required, established as at least five years, and it is necessary to extend the estimate to this minimum period.\n- When the analysts' consensus sample is considered to be insufficiently representative because it consists of too few estimates. In general, the number of analysts that contribute to consensus estimates declines as the period gets longer, and the consensus ceases to be representative in the final years of the explicit period.\n- Moreover, consensus estimates tend to be significant for sales and EBITDA, but less so for other relevant cash flow variables such as investments, the tax rate or the change in working capital. For these variables, own estimates are prepared based on a representative sample of analysts' estimates, the company's history, and the knowledge acquired by Alba through its presence on the respective boards of directors and its past experience in the company or similar companies.\n- All internal estimates are contrasted with the Company's historical data and analysts' reports, where appropriate.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 financial estimates with a time horizon of five years (2024-2028) were used for all the associates analysed, subsequently calculating a terminal value on the basis of this explicit five-year period.\n\nA summary of the main assumptions applied in the financial projections used in the explicit valuation period (2024-2028) for Acerinox, S.A. and Ebro Foods, S.A. is as follows:\n\n- Revenue growth: Ebro Foods, S.A. shows moderate growth in the projected period. The expected cumulative annual growth rate for revenues in the explicit period is in line with the perpetual growth rate used. Conversely, Acerinox, S.A. reflects the dynamics of the cyclical sector in which it operates and, after the record results posted in 2022, revenues are expected to fall steadily until they return to normal levels.\n- EBITDA margins: after the decline suffered in 2022, Ebro Foods, S.A. returned to profitability in 2023 thanks to more stable raw materials prices and lower transport and energy costs. A slight fall is foreseen in 2024 and 2025 before a return to normal levels. In Acerinox, S.A., the margin is expected to contract sharply in the 2023-2026 period until it reaches a normalised level in line with the historical average, and remain stable in the following years.\n\nThe deviations between the revenue and EBITDA margin growth projections for Acerinox, S.A. and Ebro Foods, S.A. estimated for 2023 in the 2022 financial valuation and the results actually obtained by both associates in 2023 are shown below:\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/127/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, and the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" are in a smaller, white, sans-serif font below the word \"ALBA\". The background is a teal color, and there is a teal border around the logo.\n\n|                         | Ebro Foods, S.A. | Acerinox, S.A. |\n|-------------------------|------------------|----------------|\n| Growth in sales         | +4.7%            | +3.7%          |\n| Change in EBITDA margin | -1.0 p.p.        | -0.3 p.p.      |\n\nIn the case of Ebro Foods, in the valuation exercise carried out based on analysts' consensuses in December 2022, the amount of revenues estimated for 2023 was 4.7% lower than those reported. On the other hand, the EBITDA margin estimated for 2023 at December 2022 was 1.0 p.p. higher than that reported in 2023.\n\nIn the case of Acerinox, the amount of 2023 revenues estimated in the December 2022 valuation exercise, based on analysts' consensuses, was 3.7% lower than those reported at the end of 2023. On the other hand, the EBITDA margin estimated for 2023 at December 2022 was 0.3 p.p. higher than that reported in 2022.\n\nThe differences between the estimated and the actual results of Acerinox, S.A. and Ebro Foods, S.A. in 2023 have different causes. In the case of Acerinox, S.A., the cyclical, volatile nature of the international stainless steel market generally makes it difficult for both the company and analysts to draw up entirely accurate financial projections. In the case of Ebro Foods, S.A., the figures for 2023 were undermined by expectations of higher demand than that which materialised during the year, a difficult factor to foresee when the projections were drawn up.\n\n- Investments (expressed as a percentage of sales): these are projected to remain stable in the explicit period in both companies, in line with the historical average. Historical averages do not include acquisitions and, likewise, the financial projections do not take into consideration acquisitions or sales of businesses.\n- The tax rate applied ranges from 27.0% to 27.5%, as both companies have activities in jurisdictions where tax rates are higher than those in Spain (25.0%).\n- The change in working capital assumes convergence with the historical data.\n\nThe WACC discount rate is calculated on the basis of the CAPM generally accepted by the financial community and based on the calculation of the following parameters:\n\n• The CAPM —a method generally accepted by the investment community to calculate the expected return on an investment in an asset based on the risk assumed— is used to calculate the equity ratio. The variables necessary to calculate the return on equity were determined as follows:\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/128/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The text is set against a teal background, and the entire logo is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n- Risk-free rate: since the companies under analysis are of Spanish origin (Acerinox, S.A. and Ebro Foods, S.A.), the yield on the Spanish 10-year bond at the time of valuation is taken as the benchmark.\n- Beta: calculated as the average of the betas of each of the companies with respect to the benchmark index (Ibex 35). The average of the betas calculated for different periods (one, three and five years) and different time frames (daily, weekly or monthly correlation) are used for the calculation.\n- Market risk premium: historically calculated as a spread of 500 basis points over the risk-free rate used.\n- Specific risk premium: an additional risk premium is added to the equity ratio in order to capture the higher risk of low liquidity of shares, for example. This additional risk premium is strictly based on Alba's internal estimates and contributes to raising the cost of equity to levels higher than would have resulted from the direct application of the WACC formula which, in Alba's view, would result in discount rates that are too low in an environment of rising interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty. This risk premium has a similar effect to using an average historical return versus present value in the risk-free rate.\n- The variables necessary to calculate the cost of debt after tax were calculated as follows:\n\t- Risk-free rate: the greater of the yield of the Spanish 10-year bond or the Euribor 10-year swap is conservatively used to calculate the cost of debt. Both figures are obtained from public market sources (Bloomberg and/or Factset) when performing the valuations.\n\t- Long-term credit spread: Drawing on its experience, Alba uses a different spread for each company based on its level of risk. This spread ranges between 200 and 350 basis points depending on the company. In addition, the resulting cost of debt is compared with the actual data of the investees (always lower than Alba's estimates) and with the available analysts' consensus.\n\t- Tax rate: To calculate the cost of debt after tax, the same tax rate is used as the rate used to calculate the free cash flows for the terminal value of discounted cash flows. This rate is normally the general corporate income tax rate applicable to each company in Spain, adjusted in some cases for the estimated weight of activities in different jurisdictions.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/129/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The entire logo is set against a teal background, and the text is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n• Based on the calculation of the equity ratio and the cost of debt after tax, the WACC is calculated by assuming a weighting of debt and equity following a target capital structure for each company.\n\nIn the valuations carried out at 31 December 2023, the cost of equity varies by company, between 8.0% (Ebro Foods, S.A.) and 10.7% (Acerinox, S.A.), while the WACC rate ranges from 7.2% (Ebro Foods, S.A.) to 9.4% (Acerinox, S.A.). These discount rates are in line with those used in previous years' valuations for these companies and have first been contrasted with the available analyst estimates and, more generally, with the historical information and experience of Alba.\n\nA comparison of the equity ratio and 10-year bond yield with those in the prior year for investees with indications of impairment in 2023 is shown below:\n\n| Acerinox, S.A.     | 2023  | 2022  |\n|--------------------|-------|-------|\n| Cost of equity     | 10.7% | 10.6% |\n| 10-year bond yield | 3.0%  | 3.3%  |\n| Ebro Foods, S.A.   | 2023  | 2022  |\n| Cost of equity     | 8.0%  | 7.8%  |\n| 10-year bond yield | 3.0%  | 3.3%  |\n\nAfter a significant increase in interest rates from mid-2022 and during 2023, the lower yield on the 10-year bond as of December 2023 reflects the expectation of a fall in rates in 2024. The beta coefficients and market risk premiums of associates remained virtually unchanged. However, the equity ratio of Acerinox, S.A. and Ebro Foods, S.A. rose with respect to the previous year's valuation due to the changes made to the specific risk premium, which showed the following progression compared to the previous year:\n\n|                  | 2023 | 2022 |\n|------------------|------|------|\n| Acerinox, S.A.   | 2.9% | 2.5% |\n| Ebro Foods, S.A. | 1.5% | 1.0% |\n\nIn 2023, an increase commensurate with the fall in the Spanish 10-year bond yield was applied due to the expectation that interest rates would drop in 2024.\n\nAs indicated, applying this specific risk premium raises the cost of equity, thereby increasing the discount rate (WACC). To confirm the reasonableness of the resulting discount rates, Alba contrasts them with those used by analysts for each of the companies.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/130/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The logo is in a teal color and features the word \"ALBA\" in large, bold, sans-serif font. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, sans-serif font. The entire logo is enclosed in a teal border.\n\nIn order to calculate the terminal value, a normalised cash flow is used based on the explicit projection for the last year. This normalisation focuses exclusively on the long-term sustainable EBITDA margin assumption, since the other variables either do not have an impact (for example, it is always assumed that investments and depreciation are equal in the terminal value), they do not vary with respect to the explicit projections (for example, the tax rate remains constant throughout the explicit period) or they have a limited impact given that there are no significant variations between both.\n\nThe long-term sustainable EBITDA margin is estimated internally based on the projections used in the explicit period, the historical information available (for comparison) and the experience of Alba's team. The margin used in estimating cash flows for the terminal value is lower or, at most, stable with respect to the explicit period. If the estimated margin used to calculate long-term sustainable EBITDA were substantially higher than that of the last explicit year, it would indicate that the Company has not reached a sufficient level of maturity or stability and would lead us to reconsider our estimate of the terminal EBITDA margin or to extend the explicit projection period until that level were reached.\n\nAs in all the projections made for these valuations, the estimation and justification of these variables is contrasted with historical information and with a significant sample of recent analyst reports.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the perpetual growth rate ranged from 1.5% to 1.8% per annum, in line with the most recent valuations of these same companies in the past. This variable was also contrasted with a significant sample of recent analyst reports and, as previously commented, there were no significant variations compared to previous valuations.\n\nIn 2023, the following sensitivity analysis was performed:\n\n|                                                          | Acerinox, S.A. | Ebro Foods, S.A. |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------|\n| Discount rate (WACC)                                     |                |                  |\n| Rate used in 2023                                        | 9.4%           | 7.2%             |\n| Rate to equal the carrying amounts                       | 9.7%           | 7.2%             |\n| Perpetual growth                                         |                |                  |\n| Rate used in 2023                                        | 1.8%           | 1.5%             |\n| Rate to equal the carrying amounts                       | 1.2%           | 1.5%             |\n| EBITDA margin used to calculate terminal value           |                |                  |\n| Rate used in 2023                                        | 8.8%           | 12.0%            |\n| Margin to equalize the carrying amounts                  | 8.5%           | 12.0%            |\n| Variation in total sales to equal the carrying amounts   | -6.3%          | -                |\n| Variation in EBITDA margin to equal the carrying amounts | -0.2%          | -                |\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/131/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The text is set against a teal background.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, Alba recognised an impairment loss of Euros 3.1 million on the ownership interest in Profand Fishing Holding, S.L.\n\nProfand Fishing Holding, S.L. was valued by Kroll Advisory, S.L., an independent expert, which issued its corresponding report. The method used by the independent expert to determine the recoverable amount of this investment was based on discounted future cash flows.\n\nFinancial projections (sales, EBITDA, investments, etc.) were based on the budgets and business plans of the company itself, approved by its Board of Directors. These projections are not published and are presented to Alba at board meetings. The financial projections used in the valuation were for five years. In addition, the reasonableness of the Company's projections was tested against various market comparables.\n\nKey valuation variables: discount rate (WACC) and perpetual growth rate (g).\n\n- The WACC rate was calculated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) adjusted by an additional risk premium.

The assumptions used in 2022 were as follows:\n\n|                                  | Acerinox, S.A. | CIE Automotive, S.A. | Ebro Foods, S.A. |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|\n| Perpetual growth rate            | 2.0%           | 2.0%                 | 1.5%             |\n| Discount rate (WACC)             | 9.4%           | 8.6%                 | 7.1%             |\n| Capital structure:               |                |                      |                  |\n| Capital                          | 80.0%          | 80.0%                | 80.0%            |\n| Debt                             | 20.0%          | 20.0%                | 20.0%            |\n| Equity ratio                     | 10.6%          | 9.6%                 | 7.8%             |\n| Cost of debt after tax           | 4.6%           | 4.8%                 | 4.1%             |\n| Estimated value in use (€/share) | 15.54          | 33.17                | 18.64            |\n\nThe method used to calculate value in use in 2022 was the same as that used in 2023 described above in note 10 (a), \"Investments in associates in 2023\".\n\nA summary of the main assumptions applied in the financial projections used in the explicit valuation period (2023-2027) for Acerinox, S.A., CIE Automotive, and Ebro Foods, S.A. is as follows: S.A.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/135/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" which are in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The text is set against a teal background, and the entire logo is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n• Revenue growth: CIE Automotive, S.A. and Ebro Foods, S.A. show moderate growth in the projected period. Their expected cumulative annual revenue growth in the explicit period is slightly higher than the perpetual growth rate used in each case; growth is higher at the start of the period and converges with the perpetual growth rate in subsequent years. The higher initial growth at CIE Automotive, S.A. is due to the expected recovery in global car production, while at Ebro Foods, S.A. it is due to the strength of particularly resilient demand in periods of macroeconomic uncertainty, as well as the expected rise in prices in the first few years in an inflationary environment.\n\nConversely, Acerinox, operating in a cyclical sector and having reached its all-time sales record last year, expects a steady fall in revenues until normal levels are reached.\n\n• EBITDA margins: at Ebro Foods, S.A., after the drop in profitability recorded in 2022 in an environment of high raw material prices and other costs (energy, transport, etc.), slight growth is projected to reach a normalised level in line with the historical period (2015–2021) and at CIE Automotive, S.A., as it is currently at historical average profitability, margins are projected to remain stable. At Acerinox, S.A., the margin is expected to contract sharply in 2023 to a normalised level and remain stable in the following years.\n\nThe deviations between the 2022 revenue and EBITDA margin growth projections for Acerinox, S.A. and Ebro Foods, S.A. estimated in the 2021 financial valuation and the results actually obtained by both associates in 2022 are shown below:\n\n|                         | Ebro Foods, S.A. | Acerinox, S.A. |\n|-------------------------|------------------|----------------|\n| Growth in sales         | +17.6%           | +18.3%         |\n| Change in EBITDA margin | -1.4 p.p.        | -0.4 p.p.      |\n\nIn the case of Ebro Foods, the 2022 revenues estimated in the December 2021 valuation exercise, based on the analysts' consensuses, was 17.6% lower than those reported at the end of 2022. On the other hand, the 2022 EBITDA margin estimated at December 2021 was 1.4 p.p. higher than that reported in 2022.\n\nIn the case of Acerinox, the 2022 revenues estimated in the December 2021 valuation exercise, based on the analysts' consensuses, was 18.3% lower than those reported at the end of 2022. On the other hand, the 2022 EBITDA margin estimated at December 2021 was 0.4 p.p. higher than that reported in 2022.\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/136/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA Grupo March. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif letters on a teal background. Below \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white letters.\n\nThe differences between the estimated and actual financial figures recorded by Acerinox, S.A. and Ebro Foods, S.A. had different causes. In the case of Acerinox, the cyclical, volatile nature of the international stainless steel market generally made it difficult for both the company and analysts to draw up entirely accurate financial projections. The figures for Ebro Foods in 2022 were mainly affected by price increases during the year to pass on high cost and raw material inflation to the end customer, a positive exchange rate trend and a corporate transaction, all of which were difficult to foresee at the start of the year, when the projections were made.\n\n- Investments (expressed as a percentage of sales): these are projected to remain stable in the explicit period in the three companies, in line with the historical average. Historical averages do not include acquisitions and, likewise, the financial projections do not take into consideration acquisitions or sales of businesses.\n- The tax rate applied ranges from the general Spanish income tax rate of 25.0% to 27.5% for companies operating in jurisdictions with higher tax rates.\n- The variation in working capital generally has little impact on these projections, and in any case remains in line with historical data.\n\nIn the valuations carried out at 31 December 2022, the cost of equity varies by company, ranging from 7.8% (Ebro Foods, S.A.) to 10.6% (Acerinox, S.A.), while the WACC rate ranges from 7.1% (Ebro Foods, S.A.) to 9.4% (Acerinox, S.A.). In the case of CIE Automotive, S.A., both figures were within the indicated ranges, with a cost of equity of 9.6% and a WACC of 8.6%. These discount rates were in line with those used in previous years' valuations for these companies and were contrasted first with the available analyst estimates and, more generally, with the historical information and experience of Alba.\n\nThe 10-year bond yield and the equity ratio for investees with indications of impairment in each of the periods are shown below:\n\n|                      | 2022  | 2021  |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|\n| Acerinox, S.A.       |       |       |\n| Cost of equity       | 10.6% | 10.0% |\n| 10-year bond yield   | 3.3%  | 0.7%  |\n| Ebro Foods, S.A.     |       |       |\n| Cost of equity       | 7.8%  | 7.5%  |\n| 10-year bond yield   | 3.3%  | 0.7%  |\n| CIE Automotive, S.A. |       |       |\n| Cost of equity       | 9.6%  | n/a   |\n| 10-year bond yield   | 3.3%  | 0.7%  |\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The logo is in a teal rectangle. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font. Below \"ALBA\" is the text \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font.\n\nThe equity ratios of Acerinox and Ebro (CIE Automotive was not valued in 2021 as it did not show indications of impairment) increased compared to the valuation performed in 2021, mainly due to the increase in interest rates reflected in the higher yield on the Spanish 10-year bond, as both the betas and the market risk premiums of the associates remained virtually unchanged.\n\nHowever, the rise in equity was less than the rise in the Spanish 10-year bond yield due to changes made to the specific risk premium, the details of which are shown below:\n\n|                      | 2022 | 2021 |\n|----------------------|------|------|\n| Acerinox, S.A.       | 2.5% | 4.5% |\n| Ebro Foods, S.A.     | 1.0% | 3.5% |\n| CIE Automotive, S.A. | 2.5% | n/a  |\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the perpetual growth rate ranged from 1.5% to 2.0% per annum, with no variations compared to the most recent valuations of these same companies in the past. This variable was also contrasted with a significant sample of recent analyst reports and, as previously commented, there were no significant variations compared to previous valuations.\n\nIn 2022, the following sensitivity analysis was performed:\n\n|                                                     | Acerinox, S.A. | CIE Automotive, S.A. | Ebro Foods, S.A. |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|\n| Discount rate (WACC)                                |                |                      |                  |\n| Rate used in 2022                                   | 9.4%           | 8.6%                 | 7.1%             |\n| Rate to equal the carrying amounts                  | 10.9%          | 10.2%                | 7.1%             |\n| Perpetual growth                                    |                |                      |                  |\n| Rate used in 2022                                   | 2.0%           | 2.0%                 | 1.5%             |\n| Rate to equal the carrying amounts                  | -1.0%          | 0.0%                 | 1.4%             |\n| EBITDA margin used to calculate terminal value      |                |                      |                  |\n| Rate used in 2022                                   | 9.0%           | 16.5%                | 13.0%            |\n| Margin to equalize the carrying amounts             | 7.5%           | 13.8%                | 12.9%            |\n| Variation in total sales to equal carrying amount   | -14.1%         | -15.9%               | -0.5%            |\n| Variation in EBITDA margin to equal carrying amount | -1.0%          | -2.0%                | -0.1%            |\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/138/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The text is set against a teal background, and the entire logo is enclosed in a teal rectangle.\n\nMovement during 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\n\n| Balance at 01/01/22                                    | 973.3   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Additions                                              | 210.3   |\n| Changes in fair value                                  | 164.5   |\n| Other movements                                        | 16.1    |\n| Balance at 31/12/2022                                  | 1,364.2 |\n| Additions                                              | 222.1   |\n| Changes in fair value                                  | 118.4   |\n| Reclassification from “other current financial assets” | 79.8    |\n| Reclassification to “other current financial assets”   | (10.7)  |\n| Other movements                                        | 57.2    |\n| Balance at 31/12/2023                                  | 1,831.0 |\n\nIn 2023, additions mainly reflect acquisitions of holdings in Technoprobe Spa (Euros 82.5 million), Inmobiliaria Colonial, SOCIMI,S.A. (Euros 77.4 million) and Artá Capital Fund III F.C.R. (Euros 8.7 million). The Group also reinvested the dividend received from Atlantic Aviation FBO Inc. amounting to Euros 44 million in the company itself.\n\nOther movements include the recognition under this heading of the ownership interest in the Nuadi, Facundo and Gesdocument subgroups following the loss of control over them (see note 2.3).\n\nThe main increases in fair value in 2023 were in the ownership interests in Technoprobe Spa, Atlantic Aviation Holding Corporation and Inmobiliaria Colonial, SOCIMI, S.A. Conversely, the main decrease was in the interest in Befesa Holding, S.à.r.l. In 2022, the main increases were in the ownership interests in Atlantic Aviation Holding Corporation and Nature Topco UK Limited, partially offset by the decrease in value of the interests in Befesa Holding, S.à.r.l. and Global Dominion Access, S.A.\n\nIn 2023, the Group did not dispose of any investments held at 31 December 2022. However, it has classified its short-term investment in Inmobiliaria Colonial, SOCIMI, S.A. amounting to Euros 79.8 million under this heading.\n\nIn 2022, the additions related mainly to the acquisitions of shares in Technoprobe Spa and Befesa Holding, S.à.r.l. for Euros 115.2 million and Euros 57.5 million, respectively. Other movements included the recognition of the ownership interest in the Preving subgroup as a result of the loss of control over it (see note 2.3).\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/141/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, and \"GRUPO MARCH\" is in a smaller, white, sans-serif font below it. The text is set against a teal background.\n\nAlso, during the first half of 2022 the Group sold its entire 3.21% equity investment in Indra Sistemas, S.A. Up to the sale date, the change in the fair value of this equity investment amounted to Euros 3.5 million, and the sale generated a gain of Euros 4.8 million, which was recognised under proceeds from disposal of and income from assets at 31 December 2022.\n\nAlso, in relation to the other investments held by the Group through Deya Capital IV, SCR, S.A.U. and which are also managed by Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., in 2023 and 2022 the valuations were carried out by Kroll Advisory, S.L., an independent expert, which issued the related report. One exception is the valuation of InStore Media Group, S.A., which is drawn up by personnel of Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U. in charge of this. At 31 December 2022, the investment in Topco Satlink, S.L., which was acquired in 2022, was valued at its acquisition value, which coincides with its fair value.\n\nThe method used by the independent expert to determine the recoverable amount of these investments was based on discounted future cash flows.\n\nFinancial projections (sales, EBITDA, investments, etc.) are based on the budgets and business plans of the companies themselves approved by their respective Board of Directors. These projections are not published and are presented to Artá Capital at board meetings. In any case, the reasonableness of the projections prepared by the companies is contrasted with different market comparables and Artá Capital's own opinion based on its past experience. The financial projections have a five-year time frame for all the valuations performed.\n\nKey valuation variables: discount rate (WACC) and perpetual growth rate (g).\n\n• The WACC is calculated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) generally accepted by the financial community, and on the basis of market variables obtained through Bloomberg, such as the rate of return on the 10-year bond or levered beta with respect to the benchmark stock market index.\n\nIn addition, various internal estimates are used, such as: the spread between the non-current debt of the Company and the 10-year bond, the tax rate (same as for the cash flows used in the terminal value calculation) or the target capital structure.\n\n• The perpetual growth rate is calculated based on each company and the market in which they operate.\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/142/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The main assumptions used in the valuation at 2022 year-end were a volatility of 40% and an unlevered beta coefficient of 0.77. At 31 December 2023 this investment was fully impaired.\n\nThe valuations held by the Group through Alba-KKR Core I., S.C.A. have been performed by the global valuation committee of KKR, supported by Kroll Advisory, which provides assistance in the valuation process. KKR's global valuation committee is the body responsible for coordinating and implementing the process for the valuation of KKR investees worldwide.\n\nValuations are prepared and furnished, on a quarterly basis, to all investors in the various funds and vehicles invested in the two companies.\n\nMoreover, these valuations are the same as those used by KKR itself in its financial statements, given that it invests part of its own balance sheet in the KKR Core Fund, a direct shareholder in both Atlantic Aviation and ERM. These accounts are audited by Deloitte, which reviews the valuations of the investees as part of the regular audit process. As a US listed entity, KKR is under the supervision of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe methods used to determine the fair value of each investment were the discounted cash flows method and the market multiple approach.\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/145/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif font. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font.

The final repayment date of this loan is May 2030 and it accrues interest at market rates.\n\nIn 2021 the Group acquired 23.71% of Profand Fishing Holding, S.L.'s capital. As a result of this transaction, Alba and the other shareholder of Profand Fishing Holding, S.L., formerly the holder of Alba's current ownership interest, entered into a shareholders' agreement (which was amended in the first half of 2023) setting out a number of binding covenants and conditions relating to their rights and obligations, the terms on which Profand would be managed and governed and the arrangement to transfer the shares. In relation to the latter, among other agreements, Alba was granted a put option on all of its shares in Profand Fishing Holding, S.L., such that Alba holds a unilateral put option on this interest vis-à-vis the other shareholder for an amount agreed in advance. This put option will remain in force from 2025 until 28 October 2031. This option was valued at 31 December 2023 and 2022 by an independent expert, Kroll Advisory, S.L., and is recorded under other non-current financial assets in the consolidated balance sheet amounting to Euros 39.1 million (Euros 33.9 million at 31 December 2022), which generated an impact on the consolidated income statement for 2023 of Euros 5.2 million, recognised under change in fair value of financial instruments.\n\n#### **13.

Risk Management Objectives and Policies**\n\nThe Board of Directors of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. has drawn up the following Risk Management and Control Policy:\n\n#### **1.- Types of risk faced by the Company**\n\nRisk is inherent in all business activity and is defined as uncertainty concerning the occurrence of an event or action that could adversely affect the Company's ability to maximise its value for stakeholders and to achieve its goals; it also refers to the possibility of threats materialising and opportunities not being taken.\n\nCorporación Financiera Alba engages in two principal activities:\n\n(i) investment in the capital of listed and unlisted companies, and\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/155/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA Grupo March. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif letters on a teal background. Below \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white, sans-serif letters.\n\n(ii) investment in buildings leased as office space.\n\nAs a result of its activities, the markets and sectors in which it operates and its environment, the Company is exposed to the following categories of risks:\n\n• Strategic risks related to the mission and vision of the Company, achievement of business goals and the creation and preservation of value for shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nThese include risks related to the corporate governance of the Company, its reputation and responsibility, investment and divestment strategies, and market dynamics.\n\n• Operational risks involving potential direct or indirect economic losses related to external events: uncertainty in the Company's own business activities; or internal events: failures or inadequacies in the processes, systems or resources of the Company.\n\nThese include risks related, mainly, to revenue, investments and divestments and monitoring thereof, the acquisition of goods and services, physical assets, human resources, information technologies, and natural disasters, terrorism and other criminal acts.\n\n• Financial risks resulting, broadly speaking, from any financing operation which the Company must carry out in order to perform its activities, as well as the reliability of financial information reported by the Company.\n\nThese include liquidity and credit risks, market, tax, accounting and reporting risks.\n\n• Regulatory compliance risks arising from a potential failure to comply with laws, regulations, internal standards and codes of conduct, as well as greater exposure to such risks.\n\nThese include legal risks, regulatory risks and risks involving codes of ethics and conduct.\n\n• Technological, environmental and social risks, including risks associated with information technology, cybersecurity and technological obsolescence, climate change and employee health and safety.\n\n#### **2.- Integrated Risk Management System**\n\nAware of the importance and advantages of adequately and efficiently managing its risks, Corporación Financiera Alba has established an Integrated Risk Management System mainly focused on:\n\n• Enabling the identification and proactive and efficient assessment of Company risks, as well as monitoring and continually tracking these risks.\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/156/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif font. Below \"ALBA\" is \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The text is set against a teal background, and the entire logo is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n- Integrating, coordinating and directing the various risk management actions performed by the Company.\n- Achieving responsible risk acceptance and reinforcing the responsibility of the Company's employees.\n- Ensuring that control systems are aligned with the actual risks of the Company.\n- Facilitating and streamlining the application of corrective measures.\n\nThe Integrated Risk Management System unites three key components:\n\n- (i) The continuous risk management process, understood as the activities performed by all individuals in the Company under the supervision of the Audit and Compliance Committee that are focused on identifying potential risk events, managing the risks identified and providing reasonable assurance that the Company will achieve its goals.\n- (ii) An organisational focus, with clearly defined and communicated roles and responsibilities. Integrated risk management affects all Company personnel; therefore it is vital to establish an organisational focus on risk management tailored to the organisational structure and corporate culture of the Company.\n\nAlthough the Integrated Risk Management System affects and involves all Company personnel, the main participants are as follows: risk managers, the Risk Control and Management Department, the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\n(iii) A monitoring model, which identifies and provides the timely information needed so that all those involved in the risk management process can make informed decisions concerning the risks.\n\n#### **2.1. The continuous risk management process**\n\nBy way of a summary, the continuous risk management process involves performing the following activities:\n\n• Identifying and assessing the risks that could affect the Company.\n\nDetermining the main strategic, operational, financial and regulatory compliance risks affecting the Company's strategy and goals, assessing the probability of occurrence and potential impact and prioritising risks based on these factors.\n\n• Setting the level of risk that is considered acceptable.\n\nDefining key risk indicators (KRIs) for each critical risk and establishing tolerance levels for these risks.\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/157/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked on top of the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" which are in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The text is set against a teal background.\n\n#### • Identifying controls.\n\nSpecifying existing controls (or those to be implemented) in the Company to mitigate the aforementioned risks.\n\n• Identifying the processes in which these risks and controls arise.\n\nDetermining the existing relationship between the Company's key risks – and its controls – and the Company's processes, identifying and analysing the processes that are critical for risk management.\n\n• Assessing controls.\n\nAssessing the effectiveness of the controls in mitigating the risks identified.\n\n• Designing and implementing action plans in response to the risks.\n\nDetermining action plans to be carried out to lower residual risk to an acceptable risk level, bearing in mind the costs and benefits of such efforts. As a direct result of this reduction in the level of risk, a reassessment and prioritisation of the risks will be necessary and appropriate, as part of a continuous risk management process.\n\nIn this regard, Corporación Financiera Alba has prepared the Company's Risk Map, which shows, based on their impact and probability, the key risks in the categories listed above. In order for this map to be effectively used as a management tool that allows the Company to make informed decisions, the map is reviewed and updated periodically to adjust it to the Company's current circumstances.\n\nLikewise, the Company has prepared Risk Indices for the most critical risks, identifying the key risk indicators with their corresponding tolerance levels, the associated controls and, where applicable, the action plans to be implemented. These Indices allow the Company to periodically assess and monitor its risks and to determine the most appropriate response to these risks.\n\n#### **2.2. Organisational model of roles and responsibilities**\n\nAlthough the Integrated Risk Management System affects and involves all Company personnel, the main players are as follows:\n\n(i) Risk managers:\n\nThese managers are responsible for monitoring the risks assigned to them and for reporting to the Risk Control and Management Department any relevant information concerning the risks.\n\n(ii) Risk Control and Management Department:\n\nThe Risk Control and Management Department is expressly tasked with the following duties:\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/158/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The logo is in a teal box with white text. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, bold letters, and the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" are in smaller letters below.\n\n- Ensuring the smooth running of the risk control and management systems and, specifically, that all the important risks affecting the Company are identified, managed and quantified correctly.\n- Actively participating in preparing the risk strategy and important decisions concerning risk management.\n- Ensuring that the risk control and management systems adequately mitigate risks, as part of the policy established by the Board of Directors.\n- (iii) Audit and Compliance Committee:\n\nThis body supervises, pursuant to the Regulations of the Company's Board of Directors, the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls and risk management systems, among other aspects.\n\nLikewise, it discusses with the auditor any significant weaknesses in the internal control system detected during the audit.\n\n(iv) Board of Directors:\n\nAs indicated previously, the Board of Directors has the power to determine the risk control and management policy, including for tax risks, and is tasked with supervising the internal reporting and internal control systems.\n\nWith regard to the risk management processes, it is noteworthy that, in addition to the aforementioned Risk Control and Management Department, Corporación Financiera Alba has Regulatory Compliance processes which are performed by the various operational and support departments, as well as an Internal Audit Service (SAI), defined as an advisory and control body serving the Audit and Compliance Committee, that is independent within the organisation as regards its actions, aimed at assessing the various areas and functional activities of the Company.\n\nThe duties of the Internal Audit Service include the analysis and proposal of recommendations to improve the risk management processes. The Internal Audit Service also performs independent assessments of the efficiency and effectiveness of internal controls, although this is always in coordination with the Risk Control and Management Department, in order to avoid duplicating tasks and/or areas existing without adequate coverage.\n\n#### **2.3. Monitoring and Reporting Model**\n\nThe last component of the Integrated Risk Management System is a monitoring and reporting model capable of providing relevant information, in a timely and appropriate manner, to all players involved in the risk control and management process, both upwards and downwards in the hierarchy.\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/159/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, with each letter on a teal background. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font, also on a teal background.\n\nThis cross-departmental monitoring model allows the System to behave dynamically and, above all, to anticipate risks, rendering risk management and control, within the limits set by the Company, possible.\n\nSpecifically, the Integrated Risk Management System established by Corporación Financiera Alba is a management, communication, monitoring and support mechanism for all activities related to risk control and management. It is vital for responding to individual risks and risks that are specific to each activity, while it provides the framework needed for coordinated management by the Company.\n\nAs mentioned in the Policy, the Group's activities are exposed to various financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk, and cash flow interest rate risk. The Group's Risk Management and Control Policy establishes the basic principles, guidelines and general framework for actions to control and manage the various types of risk (financial and non-financial) faced. The Group does not use derivatives to mitigate certain risks.\n\n#### Market risk\n\nGiven the Group's activities, the exposure to market risk depends on the performance of the investees, whether listed or not.\n\n• Currency risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to currency risk through its investments in foreign currencies.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 and 2022 the Group has direct investments in companies whose currency is not the Euro.\n\n• Price risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to price risk relating to equity instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss. To manage price risk derived from investments in equity instruments the Group diversifies its portfolio.\n\n• Cash flow and fair value interest rate risks\n\nThe Group's interest rate risk arises from non-current borrowings. Borrowings at variable interest rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risks. Fixed interest loans expose the Group to fair value interest rate risks.\n\nThe Group holds almost 100% of borrowings at variable interest rates.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 and 2022 the Group had not arranged any interest rate swaps.\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/160/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA Grupo March. The logo is set on a teal background and features the word \"ALBA\" in large, white, sans-serif font. Below \"ALBA\" is the text \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The entire logo is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n#### Liquidity risk\n\nThe Group applies a prudent policy to cover its liquidity risks, based on having sufficient cash to settle all payments derived from its activity and to assure its objectives are met, underpinned by providing its subsidiaries with sufficient economic resources to carry out their activities.\n\nThe Group has a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents, as well as high positive working capital.\n\nIts liquidity management is based on forecasting and analysing cash inflows and outflows.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 the Group's cash position amounted to Euros 337.9 million, of which Euros 85.1 million comprised cash in hand and at banks, and Euros 252.8 million reflected current deposits and investments that are readily convertible into cash and not subject to a risk of change in value.\n\nThe most significant cash outflows of the Group not related to expenses and investments are distributions of dividends to shareholders.\n\nThe Group's exposure to liquidity risk at 31 December 2023 and 2022 is shown in the debt maturity table in note 19.\n\n#### Credit risk\n\nThe Group does not have significant concentrations of credit risk as its principal activity consists of investing in the capital of different companies. Credit risk arises from potential losses derived from customers or counterparties failing to meet, in part or in full, their financial obligations with the Group.\n\nDetails of credit risk exposure at 31 December 2023 and 2022, by type of asset and maturity, are as follows (in millions of Euros):\n\n|                                    |        | 2023      |        | 2022      |  |\n|------------------------------------|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|--|\n|                                    | Amount | Maturity  | Amount | Maturity  |  |\n| Trade receivables                  | 0.3    | 2024      | 23.9   | 2023      |  |\n| Other non-current financial assets | 92.9   | 2024-2031 | 72.3   | 2023-2029 |  |\n| Other payables                     | 26.1   | 2024      | 21.3   | 2023      |  |\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/161/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Specifically, they relate to the activities carried out by companies in which the Group has a direct ownership interest and which belong to vehicles managed by Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., which exercises control over said vehicle and determines what investments are made, whether there are no restrictions on management and whether they have exposure to variable returns. In 2023, this segment includes only the results contributed by the Nuadi, Facundo and Gesdocument subgroups in the first three months of the year (see note 2.3).\n\nNo transactions are carried out between the different segments.\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/164/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

This calculation will be performed excluding own shares and without taking into account taxes resulting from the theoretical settlement.\n\nThere is also an annual variable remuneration component based on a number of parameters that enable an assessment of performance and the degree of fulfilment, as well as deferral of half of the accrued remuneration, which will be payable, together with the revaluation and dividends, in no less than five years as of the accrual date and no later than eight years after that date, whichever the beneficiary chooses.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of articles 227, 228, 229 and 231 of the Spanish Companies Act (\"LSC\"), as per the wording of Law 31/2014 of 3 December 2014, which amended the LSC in order to improve corporate governance, the Directors of Alba have informed Alba that, during the years ended 31 December 2023 and 2022 they had no conflicts of interest with Alba and, to the best of their knowledge and based on the information which they have been able to obtain with the utmost due diligence, nor did any parties related to them.\n\n#### **28. Audit Fees**\n\nIn 2023, KPMG Auditores, S.L., the auditor of the Group's annual accounts, accrued fees totalling Euros 121.7 thousand, of which Euros 80.2 thousand were for audit services and Euros 41.5 thousand for assurance services on the Non-financial Information Statement, the limited review of the half-yearly consolidated financial statements, the agreed-upon procedures report on the ICOFR description, and translations of annual accounts previously authorised for issue by the Board of Directors and for which an audit opinion had already been issued.\n\n#### **29. Statement of Cash Flows**\n\nThis statement has been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 7.\n\nThe statement comprises three types of cash flow:\n\n- Net cash flows from operating activities: operating cash flows of all the businesses managed by the Group.\n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/171/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale**\n\nAt 31 December 2023 the Group does not own any non-current assets and liabilities held for sale.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the Group classified all the assets and liabilities of Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U. and Artá Partners, S.A. as non-current assets and liabilities held for sale. Although the sale took place in the first quarter of 2023, the decision was taken earlier. The disposal group consisted of assets of Euros 3.6 million (of which Euros 2.9 million was in cash and Euros 0.7 million in trade and other receivables) and liabilities of Euros 1.4 million (entirely composed of trade and other payables). In 2022 the Group did not recognise any impairment losses due to the carrying amounts being lower than fair value less costs to sell.\n\n#### **31.

Business performance and position of the Company**\n\nThe consolidated annual accounts at 31 December 2023 give a true and fair view of the Group's equity, financial position, results of operations, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been authorised for issue by the Company's directors.\n\nThe non-financial information statement is attached as an appendix to this directors' report, of which it forms an integral part, and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Law 11/2018 of 28 December 2018, amending the Spanish Code of Commerce, the Revised Spanish Companies Act approved by Royal Legislative Decree 1/2010 of 2 July 2010 and Audit Law 22/2015 of 20 July 2015, on non-financial and diversity information.\n\nDuring 2023, the Alba Group's activities comprised the following:\n\n- ∗ Management of a number of controlling and influential interests in a series of companies operating in different sectors of the economy.\n- ∗ Promotion and holding of interests in companies.\n- ∗ Operation of buildings through lease or sale.\n\nAlba recognised consolidated net profit of Euros 235 million in 2023, compared to Euros 436 million in the previous year. This decline is mainly due to the weaker performance of certain of our investees, the decrease in the fair value of investment property, lower capital gains on the sale of assets and the impairment loss posted by one of our investees. In addition, as a result of the sale of the stake in the venture capital management company Artá Capital, Nuadi, Facundo Group and Gesdocument ceased to be fully consolidated as of the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNet asset value (NAV) rose by 9.6% in the year to Euros 5,797 million at 31 December 2023, equivalent to Euros 96.12 per share. Alba's share price ended the year at Euros 48.00 per share, after climbing 11.2%.\n\nDuring this period, Alba invested Euros 209 million and sold assets totalling Euros 34 million, reducing its net cash position to Euros 16 million at 31 December 2023.\n\nA released share capital increase was approved in June to implement a flexible dividend for a total of Euros 57 million, the result of which was as follows: (i) Alba acquired a total of 6,244,550 free allotment rights for Euros 6 million, representing 10.5% of the total; (ii) a capital increase of Euros 51 million was carried out through the issue of 1,060,012 new ordinary shares with a par value of Euros 1 each (option chosen\n\n{176}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/176/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

As a result, Alba's share capital was represented by 60,305,186 shares of Euros 1 par value each at 31 December 2023.\n\n## **2. Most significant transactions**\n\nAlba made the following investments:\n\n- Acquisition of an additional 2.0% stake in Technoprobe for Euros 83 million.

Outlook for the Company**\n\nAlba's foremost objective is to ensure that its investees achieve maximum profitability, improving their competitiveness and enhancing their human, financial and technological potential. Furthermore, the Company's financial structure, size and flexibility will enable it to take advantage of investment opportunities that may arise.\n\nPerformance of the main investees:\n\n- Acerinox posted sales of Euros 6,608 million, 23.9% down on 2022 due to the considerable sector-wide decline in inventories, primarily stainless steel, commencing at the end of the previous year. Meanwhile, the high performance alloys sector performed adequately (up 13.9% on 2022). In comparison with 2022, steel production fell by 11.3% to 1.9 million tonnes, while cold rolling was down by 15.0% to 1.2 million tonnes. Annual EBITDA dropped to Euros 703 million, 45.0% down on the prior year due primarily to the aforementioned fall in revenues suffered by the Stainless Steel division. The performance of the Special Alloys division (VDM) remained solid, with EBITDA hitting an all-time high. Net profit totalled Euros 228 million (59.0% down on 2022), affected by the impairment loss of Euros 156 million recognised at Bahru Stainless. Lastly, net financial debt at 31 December 2023 was down to Euros 341 million (0.5 times EBITDA for the year). On 5 February 2024, Acerinox announced an agreement to acquire 100% of US special alloys producer Haynes International for USD 798 million. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the third quarter of this year.\n- CIE Automotive's revenue amounted to Euros 3,959 million in 2023, representing a 3.1% increase on 2022, bolstered by the pick-up in demand, enabling the business to perform well in all locations except for Asia. EBITDA rose to Euros 713 million (12.6% higher than in 2022) and the margin was expanded to 18.0% (+1,5 p.p. vs. 2022). Despite the rise in finance costs, net profit grew by 6.7% to Euros 320 million. Net financial debt at 31 December 2023 amounted to Euros 1,135 million, 1.6 times EBITDA for the year.\n- Ebro Foods posted sales of Euros 3,084 million in 2023, up 3.9% on the prior year, driven by growth in the Rice (+4.9%) and Pasta (+0.1%) divisions, the latter in line with the previous year's performance. EBITDA increased to Euros 387 million, up 15.7% on 2022, with a considerable increase in margin (up 1.2 p.p. vs. 2021), thanks to more stable raw materials prices and lower transport and energy costs. Meanwhile, net profit amounted to Euros 187 million, reflecting an increase of 53.2% on 2022, when profit was affected by the loss incurred on the sale of Roland Monterrat. Net financial debt had fallen to Euros 570 million (1.5 times EBITDA for the year) at 31 December 2023, thanks to a sound operating performance and reduced working capital requirements.\n\n{178}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/178/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font on a teal background. Below \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The entire logo is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n- Naturgy achieved sales of Euros 22,617 million in 2023, down 33.4% on 2022, as energy prices returned to normal levels following the unprecedented increase in 2022 as a result of the conflict in Ukraine. EBITDA in 2023 amounted to Euros 5,475 million, up 10.5% on the prior year, driven by the strong performance of both liberalised and regulated international activities. Net profit amounted to Euros 1,986 million in 2023, up 20.4% on 2022 thanks to the sound EBITDA performance mentioned above and the positive trend observed in respect of net finance income, due to the reduction in average debt in the period, despite the rise in interest rates. Net financial debt at 31 December 2023 amounted to Euros 12,090 million (2.2 times EBITDA for the year).\n- Verisure, a company that also operates under the \"Securitas Direct\" trademark, achieved revenues of Euros 3,090 million in 2023, up 9.3% on 2022, driven by growth in the customer portfolio and a rise in the ARPU (up 1.8% vs. 2022). Adjusted EBITDA of the customer portfolio amounted to Euros 1,885 million, up 11.3% vis-à-vis 2022. Total adjusted EBITDA reached Euros 1,340 million, which is 16.4% higher than in the previous year. Net profit totalled Euros 29 million, down 31.7% on 2022. Net financial debt at 31 December 2023 amounted to Euros 7,408 million (5.3 times adjusted EBITDA for the annualised last two quarters).\n- Viscofan sales grew by 2.1% to Euros 1,226 million compared to the previous year, due mainly to the improved selling price mix. EBITDA stood at Euros 268 million, representing a slight increase on 2022 (+0.5%), driven by the performance of revenues and cost control, which offset the lower profits from cogeneration activities and the negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations against the Euro. Net profit totalled Euros 141 million, up 1.1% on the prior year. At 31 December 2023, Viscofan recognised net bank debt of Euros 138 million (0.5 times EBITDA for the year), compared to Euros 101 million at the end of 2022, in light of the increase in working capital and payment of dividends.\n\n{179}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/179/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Risk management and control policy**\n\nThe Board of Directors of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. has drawn up the following Risk Management and Control Policy:\n\n#### **1.- Types of risk faced by the Company**\n\nRisk is inherent in all business activity and is defined as uncertainty concerning the occurrence of an event or action that could adversely affect the Company's ability to maximise its value for stakeholders and to achieve its goals; it also refers to the possibility of threats materialising and opportunities not being taken.\n\nCorporación Financiera Alba engages in two principal activities:\n\n- (i) investment in the capital of listed and unlisted companies, and\n- (ii) investment in buildings leased as office space.\n\nAs a result of its activities, the markets and sectors in which it operates and its environment, the Company is exposed to the following categories of risks:\n\n• Strategic risks related to the mission and vision of the Company, achievement of business goals and the creation and preservation of value for shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\n{183}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/183/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" which are in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The background is a teal color, and the logo is surrounded by a thin, teal border.\n\nThese include risks related to the corporate governance of the Company, its reputation and responsibility, investment and divestment strategies, and market dynamics.\n\n• Operational risks involving potential direct or indirect economic losses related to external events: uncertainty in the Company's own business activities; or internal events: failures or inadequacies in the processes, systems or resources of the Company.\n\nThese include risks related primarily to revenue, investments and divestments and monitoring thereof, the acquisition of goods and services, physical assets, human resources, information technologies, and natural disasters, terrorism and other criminal acts.\n\n• Financial risks resulting, broadly speaking, from any financing operation which the Company must carry out in order to perform its activities, as well as the reliability of financial information reported by the Company.\n\nThese include liquidity and credit risks, market, tax, accounting and reporting risks.\n\n• Regulatory compliance risks arising from a potential failure to comply with laws, regulations, internal standards and codes of conduct, as well as greater exposure to such risks.\n\nThese include legal risks, regulatory risks and risks involving codes of ethics and conduct.\n\n• Technological, environmental and social risks, including risks associated with information technology, cybersecurity and technological obsolescence, climate change and employee health and safety.\n\n#### **2.- Integrated Risk Management System**\n\nAware of the importance and advantages of adequately and efficiently managing its risks, Corporación Financiera Alba has established an Integrated Risk Management System mainly focused on:\n\n- Enabling the identification and proactive and efficient assessment of Company risks, as well as monitoring and continually tracking these risks.\n- Integrating, coordinating and directing the various risk management actions performed by the Company.\n- Achieving responsible risk acceptance and reinforcing the responsibility of the Company's employees.\n- Ensuring that control systems are aligned with the actual risks of the Company.\n\n{184}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/184/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, with each letter connected to the others by a thin white line. Below \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The entire logo is set against a teal background.\n\n• Facilitating and streamlining the application of corrective measures.\n\nThe Integrated Risk Management System unites three key components:\n\n- (i) The continuous risk management process, understood as the activities performed by all individuals in the Company under the supervision of the Audit and Compliance Committee that are focused on identifying potential risk events, managing the risks identified and providing reasonable assurance that the Company will achieve its goals.\n- (ii) An organisational focus, with clearly defined and communicated roles and responsibilities. Integrated risk management affects all Company personnel; therefore it is vital to establish an organisational focus on risk management tailored to the organisational structure and corporate culture of the Company.\n\nAlthough the Integrated Risk Management System affects and involves all Company personnel, the main participants are as follows: risk managers, the Risk Control and Management Department, the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\n(iii) A monitoring model, which identifies and provides the timely information needed so that all those involved in the risk management process can make informed decisions concerning the risks.\n\n#### **2.1. The continuous risk management process**\n\nBy way of a summary, the continuous risk management process involves performing the following activities:\n\n• Identifying and assessing the risks that could affect the Company.\n\nDetermining the main strategic, operational, financial and regulatory compliance risks affecting the Company's strategy and goals, assessing the probability of occurrence and potential impact and prioritising risks based on these factors.\n\n• Setting the level of risk that is considered acceptable.\n\nDefining key risk indicators (KRIs) for each critical risk and establishing tolerance levels for these risks.\n\n• Identifying controls.\n\nSpecifying existing controls (or those to be implemented) in the Company to mitigate the aforementioned risks.\n\n• Identifying the processes in which these risks and controls arise.\n\nDetermining the existing relationship between the Company's key risks – and its controls – and the Company's processes, identifying and analysing the processes that are critical for risk management.\n\n{185}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/185/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" which are in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The text is set against a teal background, and the entire logo is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n• Assessing controls.\n\nAssessing the effectiveness of the controls in mitigating the risks identified.\n\n• Designing and implementing action plans in response to the risks.\n\nDetermining action plans to be carried out to lower residual risk to an acceptable risk level, bearing in mind the costs and benefits of such efforts. As a direct result of this reduction in the level of risk, a reassessment and prioritisation of the risks will be necessary and appropriate, as part of a continuous risk management process.\n\nIn this regard, Corporación Financiera Alba has prepared the Company's Risk Map, which shows, based on their impact and probability, the key risks in the categories listed above. In order for this map to be effectively used as a management tool that allows the Company to make informed decisions, the map is reviewed and updated periodically to adjust it to the Company's current circumstances.\n\nLikewise, the Company has prepared Risk Indices for the most critical risks, identifying the key risk indicators with their corresponding tolerance levels, the associated controls and, where applicable, the action plans to be implemented. These Indices allow the Company to periodically assess and monitor its risks and to determine the most appropriate response to these risks.\n\n#### **2.2. Organisational model of roles and responsibilities**\n\nAlthough the Integrated Risk Management System affects and involves all Company personnel, the main players are as follows:\n\n(i) Risk managers:\n\nThese managers are responsible for monitoring the risks assigned to them and for reporting to the Risk Control and Management Department any relevant information concerning the risks.\n\n(ii) Risk Control and Management Department:\n\nThe Risk Control and Management Department is expressly tasked with the following duties:\n\n- Ensuring the smooth running of the risk control and management systems and, specifically, that all the important risks affecting the Company are identified, managed and quantified correctly.\n- Actively participating in preparing the risk strategy and important decisions concerning risk management.\n- Ensuring that the risk control and management systems adequately mitigate risks, as part of the policy established by the Board of Directors.\n\n{186}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/186/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" which are in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The text is set against a teal background, and the entire logo is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n(iii) Audit and Compliance Committee:\n\nPursuant to the Regulations of the Company's Board of Directors, this body supervises the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls and risk management systems, among other aspects.\n\nLikewise, it discusses with the auditor any significant weaknesses in the internal control system detected during the audit.\n\n(iv) Board of Directors:\n\nAs indicated previously, the Board of Directors has the power to determine the risk control and management policy, including for tax risks, and is tasked with supervising the internal reporting and internal control systems.\n\nWith regard to the risk management processes, in addition to the aforementioned Risk Control and Management Department, Corporación Financiera Alba has Regulatory Compliance processes which are performed by the various operational and support departments. It also has an Internal Audit Service (SAI), defined as an advisory and control body serving the Audit and Compliance Committee, that is independent within the organisation as regards its actions, aimed at assessing the various areas and functional activities of the Company.\n\nThe duties of the Internal Audit Service include the analysis and proposal of recommendations to improve the risk management processes. The Internal Audit Service also performs independent assessments of the efficiency and effectiveness of internal controls, although this is always in coordination with the Risk Control and Management Department, in order to avoid duplicating tasks and/or areas existing without adequate coverage.\n\n#### **2.3 Monitoring and Reporting Model**\n\nThe last component of the Integrated Risk Management System is a monitoring and reporting model capable of providing relevant information, in a timely and appropriate manner, to all players involved in the risk control and management process, both upwards and downwards in the hierarchy.\n\nThis cross-departmental monitoring model allows the System to behave dynamically and, above all, to anticipate risks, rendering risk management and control possible, within the limits set by the Company.\n\nSpecifically, the Integrated Risk Management System established by Corporación Financiera Alba is a management, communication, monitoring and support mechanism for all activities related to risk control and management. It is vital for responding to individual risks and risks that are specific to each activity, while it provides the framework needed for coordinated management by the Company.\n\n{187}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/187/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif letters on a teal background. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white, sans-serif letters.\n\nAs mentioned in the Policy, the Group's activities are exposed to various financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk, and cash flow interest rate risk. The Group's Risk Management and Control Policy establishes the basic principles, guidelines and general framework for actions to control and manage the various types of financial and non-financial risks faced. The Group does not use derivatives to mitigate certain risks.\n\n## **13.

The definitions and calculation methods used are as follows:\n\n**NAV (Net Asset Value):** the value of the company calculated as the fair value of the Group's assets less its liabilities, before tax. The Group discloses five categories for the calculation: (i) listed securities, (ii) unlisted securities, (iii) properties, (iv) other assets and liabilities, and (v) net cash.\n\n**Net cash**: the value of the Group's cash and cash equivalents (including bonds and promissory notes) less financial debt, both current and non-current.\n\nThe components of each of the NAV categories are as follows:\n\n- (i) Listed securities: the stock market value of the following investments:\n\t- a) Investments in listed associates recognised on the balance sheet (Acerinox, S.A., CIE Automotive, S.A., Ebro Foods, S.A., Viscofan, S.A. and Rioja Luxembourg, S.à.r.l. (value of the interest in Naturgy, net of Rioja debt).\n\t- b) Listed investments recognised on the balance sheet under \"Investments at fair value through profit or loss\" (Global Dominion Access, S.A., Technoprobe, Spa, Befesa Holding, S.á.r.l. and Inmobiliaria Colonial, SOCIMI, S.A).\n\t- c) Listed investments recognised on the balance sheet under \"Other current financial assets\" (trading portfolio).\n- (ii) Unlisted securities: the fair value of the following investments:\n\t- a) Investments in UNLISTED associates recognised on the balance sheet (Aegis Lux 2. S.à.r.l., Piolin II, S.á.r.l. and Profand Fishing Holding, S.L.).\n\t- b) UNLISTED investments recognised on the balance sheet under \"Investments at fair value through profit or loss\".\n- (iii) Properties: fair value of investment property and real estate recognised on the balance sheet.\n- (iv) Other assets and liabilities: at carrying amount.\n- (v) Net cash: includes the following:\n\n{189}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/189/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Among its objectives and principles for the selection of candidates, the Policy contemplates that the selection of Directors must be based on the analysis of the Company carried out by the Board of Directors with the advice of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee. Likewise, the candidates must be selected considering that his/her appointment shall promote diversity of skills, knowledge, experience, gender and age within the Board. It is also stated that in the selection of candidates, care should be taken to ensure that an appropriate balance is achieved on the Board as a whole, which enriches decision-making and brings a plurality of viewpoints to the discussion of matters within its competence.\n\nIn addition to this Policy, the Appointments and Remunerations Committee has approved the requirements that candidates must meet for the various classifications of Board Members of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A.:\n\n1. Executive Board Members will be selected bearing in mind their knowledge of the activities of the Company, their professional background and experience, which will be suited to performing executive duties therein.\n\n2. In order to elect proprietary Board Members, who are appointed on the proposal of a significant shareholder, gender diversity must be respected, avoiding gender discrimination and candidates must also have a suitable professional background and experience for his office of Director.\n\n3. In the case of independent Board Members, the professional background and experience of the candidate must be taken into account. Gender diversity and nationality or habitual residence shall be considered, if relevant to provide the Board with a different point of view.\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/210/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV). The logo is set against a red background. The letters \"CNMV\" are stacked on top of the words \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\".\n\nIn 2020, the Board of Directors considered that the target for representing the least represented gender should reach 40% of all members of the Board of Directors. Since the General Shareholders' Meeting held on 21 June 2021, 40% of the positions on the Board are held by female Directors.\n\nDuring 2023 the Appointments and Remuneration Committee has made the corresponding follow-up of the Selection of Candidates for Director Policy, which has been applied in the re-election of the Board Members Ms. María Luisa Guibert Ucín, Ms. Ana María Plaza Arregui, Mr. Antón Pradera Jáuregui and Mr. Juan March Juan.\n\nC.1.6 Describe the measures, if any, agreed upon by the nomination committee to ensure that selection procedures do not contain hidden biases which impede the selection of female directors and that the company deliberately seeks and includes women who meet the target professional profile among potential candidates, making it possible to achieve a balance between men and women. Also indicate whether these measures include encouraging the company to have a significant number of female senior executives:\n\nExplanation of measures\n\n- Including female candidates in all Board Member selection processes.\n- Including, to the extent possible, a comparable number of candidates of each gender in the selection process.\n\n- When the quality of the candidates is the same, in terms of training and experience, provided the representation target has not been met, the selection of female candidates will be prioritised.\n\nThese guidelines were ratified by the Appointments and Remuneration Committee in 2020, which, in accordance with the amendments to the Good Governance Code of Listed Companies approved by the CNMV on 26 June 2020, considered that the target for representing the least represented gender should comprise reaching 40% of the total number of members of the Board of Directors.

Explain the scope of the company's financial and non-financial risk management and control system, including tax risk.\n\nThe Company, which includes Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. and its Group companies, has defined an Integrated Risk Management System aimed mainly at:\n\n• Enabling the identification and proactive and efficient assessment of Company risks, as well as monitoring and continually tracking these risks.\n\n- Integrating, coordinating and directing the various efforts which, in terms of risk management, the company is performing.\n- Achieving reasonable risk acceptance and reinforcing the responsibility of employees of the Company.\n- Ensuring the control systems are aligned with the real risks of the Company.\n- Facilitate and streamline the application of the corrective measures that mitigate the exposure to such risks.\n\nThis Integrated Risk Management System has been implemented at corporate level to mitigate the risks, both financial and non-financial, to which the Company is exposed, given the nature and degree of complexity of its operations and the environment in which it operates. This System unites three key components:\n\n(i) Continued Risk Management process, understood as those activities performed by all individuals in the Company under the supervision of the Audit and Compliance Committee that are focused on identifying those potential risk events that could affect it, managing the risks identified and ensuring reasonable security in achieving the Company's objectives.\n\nBy way of a summary, the continued risk management process involves performing the following activities:\n\n- Identifying and assessing the risks that could affect the Company.\n- Prioritizing the critical risks to which the Company is exposed.\n- Determining the level of risk that is can be tolerated, by defining key risk indicators (KRIs) for each critical risk and establishing tolerance levels for these risks.\n- Identifying the processes in which these risks occur.\n- Identifying the mitigating controls of the risks.\n- Assessing the effectiveness of the checks in mitigating the risks identified.\n- Designing and implementing action plans as a response to the risks, when deemed necessary.\n\nIn this regard, the Company has prepared the company's Risk Map, which shows the company's key risks based on their impact and probability. In order for this map to effectively become a management tool that allows the Company to make informed decisions, the map is reviewed and updated periodically to adjust it to the Company's current circumstances.\n\nThe Company has likewise defined the Risk Datasheets for the most critical risks, identifying the key risk indicators (with their corresponding tolerances), the associate controls and, where applicable, the action plans to be implemented.\n\nThese Indexes allow the Company to periodically assess and monitor its risks and to determine the most appropriate response to these risks.\n\nThe most recent update of the Alba Risk Map took place in 2022, along with the corresponding Risk Sheets. In 2023, the Audit Committee reviewed the Risk Map again and did not consider it necessary to update it again in that year. A further review of the Risk Map is planned for 2024.\n\n(ii) An organisational focus, with clearly defined and communicated roles and responsibilities. Full risk management affects all staff of the Company, as a result, it is vital to establish an organisational focus on risk management that is suited to the organisational structure and the Company's corporate culture.\n\nThough the Integrated Risk Management System affects and involves all Company staff, the main participants, as are described in the next section (E.2), are as follows: risk managers, the Risk Control and Management Department, the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\n(iii) A tracking model, which identifies and provides the crucial information needed so that all those involved in the risk management process can make informed decisions concerning the risks. This tracking model is cross-sectional as it allows the System to behave dynamically and, above all, to anticipate risks, rendering risk management and control, within the limits set by the Company, possible.\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/235/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV). The logo is set against a red background. The letters \"CNMV\" are stacked on top of each other in white, with the words \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\" written below in a smaller font size, also in white.\n\nThese elements constitute a model that provides for an adequate management of the risks and mitigating controls over such a corporate level, which is applied to all risks indicated in section E.3, which includes fiscal risks.\n\nE.2. Identify the bodies within the company responsible for preparing and executing the financial and non-financial risk management and control system, including tax risk.\n\nThe Company's Integrated Risk Management System involves all the Company's staff, though the main parties responsible for the System are as follows:\n\na) Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors has reserved the right to determine the risk control and management policy, including for tax risks, and to supervise the internal reporting and control systems.\n\nIn this regard, the Board of Directors is the main body responsible for the risk management system, since it develops the mechanisms needed so that all the relevant risks involved in the activities and business dealings are adequately identified, managed and controlled within the limits established.\n\nb) Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee, which has been entrusted, among other duties, with supervising the effectiveness of the Company's internal checks, internal audits and risk management systems. It assesses whether or not there is sufficient organisation, staff, policies and processes needed to identify and control its main risks.\n\nc) Risk Control and Management Department.\n\nThe Risk Control and Management Department is under the direct supervision of the Audit and Compliance Committee and has been expressly given the following duties, which are included in its Articles of Association, and which have been approved by the Board of Directors:\n\n• Ensuring the smooth running of the risk control and management systems and, specifically, that all the important risks affecting the company are identified, managed and appropriately quantified.\n\n• Actively participating in preparing the risk strategy and important decisions concerning its management.\n\n• Ensuring that the risk control and management systems appropriately mitigate risks, as part of the policy identified by the Board of Directors.\n\nd) Risk Managers.\n\nThey are responsible for monitoring the risks assigned to them and for reporting any relevant information in this regard to the Risk Management and Control Unit.\n\nAs regards the risk management processes, it should be noted that in addition to the previously mentioned Risk Management and Control Unit, the Company has in place a Regulatory Compliance model, which establishes the regulatory requirements that must be followed by the different operational and support areas, as well as an Internal Audit Service, which is defined as an advisory and control body that reports to the independent Audit and Compliance Committee within the organisation concerning its activities, focusing on the assessment of the different functional areas and activities of the Company, as indicated in the Internal Audit Service Regulations.\n\nThe analysis and proposal of recommendations for improving the risk management processes, as well as performing independent assessments concerning the effectiveness and efficiency of internal checks are included among the duties entrusted to the Internal Audit Service, which works in partnership with the Risk Control and Management Department in order to avoid duplicating tasks and/or areas without sufficient coverage.\n\nWith regard to crime prevention, the Company has an Organisational and Management Model in place to prevent the commission of offences, along with the Crime Prevention Manual, which was updated in 2022 to include the identification of the new offences incorporated by Law 10/2022 of 6 September, which reforms the Criminal Code. In 2023, the Audit and Compliance Committee carried out the corresponding monitoring of the effectiveness of the Crime Prevention Model, without having detected any favourable or unfavourable controls with recommendations. A review of the Organisation and Management Model to prevent the commission of crimes is planned for 2024.\n\n{236}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/236/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV). The logo is set against a red background. The acronym \"CNMV\" is prominently displayed in white, stacked above the full name of the organization, which is also in white and arranged in a stacked format.\n\nE.3. Indicate the main financial and non-financial risks, including tax risks, as well as those deriving from corruption (with the scope of these risks as set out in Royal Decree Law 18/2017), to the extent that these are significant and may affect the achievement of business objectives.\n\nThe Group is subject to various risks inherent to the different sectors and markets in which it or its associated companies or companies in which it has holdings operate, and which could prevent it from achieving its targets and successfully executing its strategies.\n\nAs indicated above, the Company has a Risk Map, which is a tool that makes it possible to put the risks that could affect corporate targets into context, in addition to identifying and prioritising the most relevant and critical risks, making it possible to make decisions concerning steps to take to mitigate these risks.\n\nThe Company has a risk tracking and updating system which makes it possible to identify and incorporate any new risk identified during the financial year in the Company's Risk Map. Likewise, the system ensures that all key risks are reviewed at least twice per year. As a result of this review and analysis process, the current Risks Map, updated in 2022, has a total of eleven risks.\n\nAs a result, in the process of identifying and assessing risks, both financial and non-financial, affecting the Group, the following risk factors were considered to be the most inherently relevant (in other words, before applying the checks established):\n\n- · Macro-economic and socio-political factors\n- · Performance of investee companies\n- · Investment and divestment processes\n- · Catastrophic events\n- · Technological security\n- · Corporate reputation\n- · Corporate responsibility and sustainability (ESG)\n- · Measurement and monitoring of investments\n- · Tax management\n- · Culture\n- · Regulatory non-compliance\n\nThe Crime Prevention Manual, by identifying the criminal risks likely to affect the Company, highlights the crimes of corruption in business dealings, among other offences. Based on the risk tracking reports, there do not appear to be any significant corruption risks that affect the Company. The Code of Ethics and Conduct formally expresses the Company's condemnation of any form of corruption.\n\nE.4. Indicate whether the entity has risk tolerance levels, including for tax risk.\n\nThe Company's risk assessment and management model categorises risks, including tax, into four classifications, based on the impact of the risk and the probability of occurrence, as well as the perceived degree of internal control mitigating these risks.\n\nBased on these parameters, the risks are classified as:\n\n• Minor risks: Risks whose inherent criticality is medium-low and whose perceived degree of internal control is medium-high. These risks are managed with a view to rationalising the efforts made to mitigate these risks, without this causing appreciable damage to the perceived degree of internal control.\n\n• Average risks: Risks whose inherent criticality is medium-low and whose perceived degree of internal control is medium-low. These risks are tracked with a view to confirming that they maintain a medium-low level of inherent criticality, otherwise, the corresponding corrective measures will be taken.\n\n• High risks: Risks whose inherent criticality is medium-high and whose perceived degree of internal control is medium-high. For this type of risk, the associated checks are assessed in order to confirm the effectiveness of their design and method, and to confirm that the checks adequately mitigate the risks.\n\n• Critical risks: Risks whose inherent criticality is medium-high and whose perceived degree of internal control is medium-low. These risks are continually monitored by the of the Company's Management and action plans will be established to increase their degree of internal control, where necessary.\n\nThe Company has identified Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) for all risks categorised as high and critical and has established tolerance levels for\n\n{237}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/237/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV). The logo is set against a red background. The letters \"CNMV\" are stacked on top of each other in white, bold font. Below the letters, the words \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\" are stacked in smaller, white font.\n\neach of the risks. The results are periodically assessed and reported within Alba's Integrated Risk Management System tracking model (see detailed explanation in section E.6).\n\nE.5. Indicate which risks, including tax risks, have materialised during the year:\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, the most relevant risks for the Group, both financial and non-financial, including fiscal risks, did not materialise.\n\nE.6. Explain the response and oversight plans for the company's main risks, including tax risks, as well as the procedures followed by the company in order to ensure that the Board of Directors responds to any new challenges that arise.\n\nAs stated in the previous sections, the Company has appointed a Risk Manager for each risk assessed as being critical or high. The Risk Manager is responsible for monitoring each risk assessed and for informing the Risk Control and Management Department of relevant information concerning such risks, basically:\n\n- Changes in the perception of the risk level.\n- Effective operation of the checks identified for mitigation of these risks (and, where applicable, the potential effects).\n- Values collected using the indicators and comparison with established tolerance levels.\n- Status of the actions plans underway (if there is an action plan for this risk) and, where applicable, proposal of new action plans.\n\nThe effective operation of this key process of the Integrated Risk Management System is based on the existence of a Tracking Model (as indicated in section E.1) which is a cross-sectional component that allows the System to have dynamic behaviour and, above all, to anticipate risks, allowing for risk management and control within the limits set by the Company. With this as a basis, the persons in charge of risk management periodically provide relevant information to the Risk Unit, which conducts an independent and informed assessment of the Risk Unit and prepares the relevant risk report for the Audit and Compliance Committee, which is assigned to, among others, the role of monitoring the effectiveness of internal control of the Company, internal audit and risk management systems.\n\nThe Integrated Risk Management System, alongside of Alba's policies and management and control systems, have made it possible to identify risks and new threats sufficiently in advance, which are the focus of the tracking report that is submitted for inspection to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Regulatory Compliance function coordinates, systematizes and monitors the various actions and efforts in this regard with the Board of Directors approving the compliance model established and its tracking. In 2023, tracking reports were drawn up and submitted to the Audit and Compliance Committee and to the Board of Directors, which have approved them.\n\nLikewise, in relation to crime prevention, the corresponding monitoring reports were submitted to the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Board of Directors in 2023 and approved.\n\nThe Integrated Risk Management System (described in section E.1), together with the Risk Management Policy, the Risk Management and Control Function Charter, and the remaining elements of that System, such as the ongoing risk management process, the main participants (section E.2) allow the Board of Directors to identify and respond to issues arising in relation to the risks that may affect the Company.\n\n{238}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/238/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV).

(hereinafter, \"Alba\" or the \"Group\"), the purpose of which is to ensure reasonable security over the reliability of the financial information that Alba, as a listed company, distributes to the stock markets.\n\nThe bodies of Alba responsible for the existence and maintenance of an appropriate and effective SCIIF, as well as its duties, are as follows:\n\n(i) The Board of Directors, which has ultimate responsibility in this regard, according to the provisions of article 5 section 2.2.b) of the Regulation of the Board of Directors.\n\n(ii) The Audit and Compliance Committee, for its part, is responsible for supervising the effectiveness of the company's internal checks and audit services, as well as supervising the process of preparing and presenting regulated financial information and the company's internal control systems in this regard. Following Recommendation number 19 of the Technical Guide of the CNMV 3/2017, on Audit Committees of Public Interest Entities, the Board of Directors, at its meeting held in 2017, approved the Audit and Compliance Committee Regulation, which was amended on 26 October 2020 and 13 May 2021.\n\nAccording to this Regulation, the Audit and Compliance Committee is responsible for:\n\n- Periodically reviewing the internal control and risk management systems, so that the main risks are identified, managed and suitably reported.\n\n- Reviewing the process for preparing the Company's financial information, in order to establish its integrity, technological quality and internal check quality, compliance with regulatory requirements, proper delimitation of the consolidation perimeter, proper application of generally accepted accounting principles and standards, which are duly documented in an Accounts Plan, and compliance with remaining legal requirements concerning this information.\n\n- Ensuring the independence of the department assuming internal audit duties.\n\n- Reviewing updates to financial information on the Company's website.\n\n(iii) The Audit and Compliance Committee is supported by the Internal Audit Service which is responsible for, among other matters, the preparation and execution of an annual action plan; ensuring compliance with established standards and instructions; assessing the sufficiency and application of internal checks; informing the Audit and Compliance Committee of irregularities detected and tracking accepted recommendations. These responsibilities are formalised in the Charter of the Internal Audit Service, which were updated by the Board of Directors in 2017.\n\nIn relation to the audit plans on the review of the SCIIF, in 2023, the Audit and Compliance Committee examined the internal audit on the review of the SCIIF carried out in 2022, which indicated that the Company complied with the standards defined within the regulatory framework in the principles proposed by the CNMV and making some proposals to improve its wording. Furthermore, the review of the SCIIF was included in the Internal Audit Plan of Activities for 2023, without any irregularities being detected. The review of the SCIIF was included among the audits of the Plan of Activities for 2024.\n\n(iv) Finally, Financial Management is responsible for designing, establishing and operating the SCIIF, as well as identifying and assessing risks and determining the checks to be established.\n\n- F.1.2 Indicate whether the following exist, especially in relation to the drawing up of financial information:\n- · Departments and/or mechanisms in charge of: (i) the design and review of the organisational structure; (ii) clear definition of lines of responsibility and authority with an appropriate distribution of tasks and functions; and (iii) ensuring that adequate\n\n{239}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/239/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV).

Currently, all but two of Alba's listed companies are headquartered in Spain.\n\nAlba's most significant investment transactions in 2023 include the acquisition of an additional 2.00% stake in the Italian company Technoprobe, S.p.A. and a further 2.5% stake in Inmobiliaria Colonial Socimi, S.A. Moreover, Alba has increased its interests in Acerinox, S.A. and CIE Automotive, S.A. by 0.77% and 0.31%, respectively, as a result of the redemption of own shares carried out by both companies.\n\nThis non-financial information statement has been prepared taking into account the companies that make up Alba, as well as information on the Subsidiaries that formed part of Alba during the first three months of the year only.\n\n# <span id=\"page-278-0\"></span>**2.1.2. Main activities and services carried out**\n\n**Alba's** principal activity is the acquisition of long-term holdings in listed and unlisted companies operating in various sectors of the economy, which are industry leaders, with solid management teams and profitable and sustainable growth models. In addition, Alba channels investments into smaller unlisted companies in Spain and Portugal in the form of venture capital. Alba also leases office and commercial properties.\n\nThe main activities and services carried out by Alba's Subsidiaries until the first quarter of 2023 were as follows:\n\n• **Nuadi** was first incorporated in Spain in 1958 as \"ADI\". Its principal activity is the manufacture and marketing of disc brake pad components for different applications: motorbikes, automobiles, road freight transport, public works and railways. Its main customers are brake pad and brake system manufacturers. For the past 60 years, Nuadi has been a major supplier of brake technologies and components to the after sales and original equipment markets, as well as an innovative driver of future technologies.\n\n{279}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/279/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The background is a dark teal color.\n\nIn 2021 Nuadi added Sadeca Automotive, founded in 1983, to its group and whose core business is the production of high quality electrical wiring harnesses and metal components for automotive, medical, household appliance and electronic applications.\n\n- **Gesdocument** has been providing tax, economic, financial, administrative, labour and accounting advisory services to individuals and legal entities since 1989, as well as recruitment services for third parties. It is a leading consultancy firm in its field with a nationwide presence.\n- **Facundo** is a business group incorporated in Palencia in 1944. Its principal activity is the production and distribution of nuts and snacks, with its main product being a variety of sunflower seeds. Other lines include mixed nuts, peanuts, pistachios, almonds, original corn ring snacks (Chaskis) and different flavours of potato crisps. Facundo's activity involves carefully selecting quality raw materials, and manufacturing and distributing its wide range of products.\n\n# <span id=\"page-279-0\"></span>**2.1.3. Main markets in which the Companies operate**\n\nIn terms of geography, **Alba** invests in both the domestic and international markets in order to diversify risk. It thus has investments in listed foreign companies such as Befesa, S.A., Technoprobe S.p.A. and unlisted companies such as Atlantic Aviation Holdings Corporation, Verisure Group and ERM International Group Limited.\n\nInternational investment is carried out preferably through local partners and in companies that are characterised by their stability, reliability and security, many of which are leaders in their sector.\n\nThrough its investments, Alba moves in the following main sectors: energy, food, security and industrial. The Company's stakes in entities and other assets are representative of its weight in the corporate structure and the responsibility, dedication and commitment to its investees.\n\nIn addition, Alba channels investments into smaller unlisted companies in Spain and Portugal through venture capital.\n\nAlba's real estate activity involves the leasing of high-level office and commercial properties, all of which are located in prime central or peripheral areas of Madrid.\n\nThe activities of Alba's Subsidiaries until the first quarter of 2023 were carried out in the following markets:\n\n• **Nuadi**, based in Spain, is also active internationally. It has group companies in Spain (Pamplona and Sentmenat), Morocco (Tangiers), China (Shanghai) and Mexico (Querétaro), the latter under construction in the first quarter of 2023. The subgroup has two divisions involved in the manufacture of components for the automotive sector. Its industrial activity is located in Sentmenat (Barcelona, Spain), from where it centralises its logistical operations and operational services such as engineering, quality and sales, and in Tangiers (Morocco), where its main factory is located.\n\n{280}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/280/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif letters. Below \"ALBA\" is the text \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white, sans-serif letters. The text is set against a teal background.\n\n- **Gesdocument** has five offices strategically located in Spain to offer nationwide coverage. It operates in the domestic (93.9%), European (4.6%) and international (1.5%) markets. Its main objective and strategy is to be the leading consultancy firm in Spain and Portugal through organic and inorganic transactions (integration of consultancy firms).\n- **Facundo**, with headquarters in Palencia (Spain), has two production facilities very close to each other from which it distributes its products throughout Spain. The first factory was built in Villada (Palencia) in 1968 and, in 1992, a new plant was built in Villamuriel de Cerrato (near Palencia), which manufactures potato crisps, snacks and appetizers. Los Girasoles, a group company, was in charge of its own distribution network in Palencia, Valladolid and Burgos until 1999, when Facundo commenced retail sales nationally. The Facundo brand is clearly positioned in terms of quality and has a very relevant share in the northwest quadrant of Spain.\n\n# <span id=\"page-280-0\"></span>**3. Identification and engagement of Alba's stakeholders**\n\nA basic principle of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is the proper management of stakeholder expectations. An organisation is considered to be socially responsible when it responds satisfactorily to its stakeholders' expectations and needs as regards how it functions.\n\nFrom a strategic and CSR perspective, stakeholders are important because of the possibility of intervening in the organisation's activity and results. When relations with them are well managed, existing risks are minimised and the possibility of generating competitive advantages is enhanced, improving the climate and reputation of the organisation or promoting learning and innovation.\n\n**Alba** deems it essential to know the expectations and needs of its stakeholders in order to manage them better and forge relationships of trust between the parties. Alba's strategy also focuses on maximising value by creating close and lasting relationships with all of them. It therefore works to improve active communication, with effective dialogue through different channels such as intranet, regular meetings, surveys, website, email, post, videoconferencing and the presentation of reports.\n\nIn order to identify the main stakeholders, special attention has been paid to the two stakeholder groups indicated in the CSRD that can affect or be affected by a company's decisions and actions. Some, but not all, stakeholders may belong to both groups:\n\n- Affected stakeholders: individuals or groups who have interests that are or may be affected - positively or negatively - by the company's activities and through its upstream and downstream value chain.\n- Users of sustainability information: individuals or groups who are users of information about the company.\n\nThe six main stakeholder groups are as follows:\n\n{281}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/281/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, serif font. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The entire logo is set against a teal background.\n\nImage /page/281/Figure/2 description: The image contains two diagrams illustrating stakeholders. The diagram on the left is a circular chart with the title \"STAKEHOLDERS ALBA GRUPO MARCH\" in the center. Surrounding the center are six circles connected by a blue-green line. Each circle represents a different stakeholder group: \"PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION\", \"DIRECTORS\", \"SHAREHOLDERS\", \"SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT\", \"EMPLOYEES\", and \"SUPPLIERS\". The diagram on the right is a flow chart with the title \"Affected stakeholders\" at the top. The chart shows two arrows pointing in opposite directions. The top arrow points to the right and includes the stakeholder groups \"SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT\", \"PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION\", \"SUPPLIERS\", and \"EMPLOYEES\". The bottom arrow points to the left and includes the stakeholder groups \"SHAREHOLDERS\", \"DIRECTORS\", and \"PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION\". Below the bottom arrow is the text \"Users of the information\".\n\n# <span id=\"page-281-0\"></span>**3.1. Stakeholder engagement channels**\n\n**Alba** is aware of the importance of knowing its stakeholders' expectations as regards its activities and their possible impact on the environment, both at an environmental and social level. For this reason, it fosters a fluid and transparent relationship with its stakeholders across all its businesses.\n\nBoth employees and other stakeholders have access to the Whistleblowing Channel on the corporate website. This channel can be used to safely report any acts or conduct that may be contrary to applicable regulations or Alba's Code of Ethics and Conduct. Suggestions, queries or proposals related to this Code of Ethics and Conduct may also be submitted.\n\nIn order to improve communication with its stakeholders, Alba made changes to the Whistleblowing Channel in 2023 to incorporate certain provisions of Law 2/2023 of 20 February 2023, which regulates the protection of informants who report regulatory infringements and corruption (the Whistleblower Law), though this law does not apply to Alba.\n\nFurthermore, Alba has a Communication Policy which sets out the principles and guidelines relating to the Company's communication of financial, non-financial and corporate information through the media, social networks and other communication channels, within a framework that guarantees respect for and transparency of information.\n\nThe most important stakeholder relations channels, both face-to-face and online, and the main global issues detected, both across the board and specific to each stakeholder, are indicated below:\n\n• **Shareholders and investors**: the Annual General Meeting is the primary conduit for shareholders to participate in Alba's governance. Informed and responsible shareholder participation is encouraged through\n\n{282}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/282/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif font. Below \"ALBA\" is the text \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The background is a teal color.\n\nmeasures such as an electronic shareholders' forum, accessible on the corporate website. An e-mail address is also available for enquiries and information requests.\n\nThe Company's management team is available for briefings with shareholders, institutional investors and analysts to present information of interest to these groups. Through its Investment Department, Alba communicates with the media and manages relations with investors and analysts.\n\n- **Managers and employees:** Alba's managers and employees have access to information and resources on the intranet on issues related to their work and Alba's activities.\n- **Suppliers:** communications with suppliers are carried out through face-to-face or telematic meetings, by telephone, e-mail and, when necessary, through reliable means of communication.\n- **Social environment:** Alba uses communication tools that can be accessed by any entity, organisation or interested person from the social, public-administrative or corporate domain. The CNMV website is the Company's official information channel for its shareholders, investors and the market as a whole. Alba's corporate website also provides relevant information and financial, non-financial and corporate information, as well as other information that may be of interest to shareholders, investors, institutions, proxy advisors and stakeholders related to the Company, including press releases. Whenever possible, content is uploaded to this corporate website simultaneously in Spanish and English to facilitate consultation from other countries. In addition, the Company can be contacted via a contact form on its website, at a postal address and by e-mail.\n\n# **4. Alba's dual materiality analysis**\n\nAlba has identified the financial, economic, social and environmental issues that are a priority for its stakeholders and its business, with a view to determining the information that may be of most interest and focussing its objectives and resources on managing and reporting them.\n\nUnder the framework of this commitment, and to meet the expectations of its stakeholders, in 2023 Alba updated its materiality analysis by applying a new approach to the dual materiality required by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), based on the EFRAG (European Commission Technical Advisory Group) guide and the cross-cutting ESRSs (European Sustainability Reporting Standards), published in July 2023, which establish guidelines on how to develop this type of analysis in organisations.\n\nThis methodology takes into consideration both the impact of the organisation's activities on its surroundings and the environment (impact materiality) and the impact of its surroundings on the value of the business (financial materiality).\n\nThe methodology applied to perform the dual materiality analysis, which enabled Alba to determine those areas of greatest relevance to its stakeholders, and which comprises four main phases, is detailed below:\n\n{283}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/283/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked on top of the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" which are written in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The background is a teal color.\n\n# Stage 1. Analysis of Alba's context and establishment of consultation mechanisms with stakeholders\n\nAlba has established the following consultation mechanisms as the most appropriate for understanding the sustainability expectations of its most relevant stakeholders, and for cooperating jointly in identifying the impacts, risks and opportunities (commonly known as \"IROs\") associated with the material issues, as well as their assessment:\n\n- Interviews with managers on the possible IROs arising from Alba's activity in its surroundings, as well as the impact of external factors on the Company's value and the surroundings, resulting from the profound changes arising from climate change.\n- *Focus group* with employees from different areas of Alba to identify and assess potential ESG IROs that are caused by the Company and affect the social or environmental surroundings.\n- Supplier questionnaire with a view to finding out their views on possible IROs generated by Alba on its surroundings, and their expectations in this connection.\n- Significant shareholder questionnaire on the financial materiality and the implications of sustainability-related risks, as well as their impact on the Company's interests, to identify and assess potential ESG IROs affecting Alba's business.\n\nGlobal and sector trends were also analysed, such as the Sustainability Accounting Standard Board (SASB) sector standard and a benchmarking of the sector, relating to possible risks, impacts and opportunities that should be taken into account for the materiality analysis, in order to have a global vision of Alba's surroundings.\n\n# Stage 2. Identification of positive and negative, potential and actual impacts\n\nTo identify and define the relevant ESG issues affecting Alba, an exhaustive internal and external analysis has been carried out, based on the topics and sub-topics proposed by the CSRD's ESRS standard. This analysis also includes an analysis of Alba and its sector in the press and a study of its internal policies, its previous sustainability reports, in order to align its approach, and also focuses on the due diligence procedures implemented at Alba to prevent, manage and mitigate the risks that most affect it. Thus, the IROs related to each potentially relevant issue were identified.\n\nOnce the potentially relevant issues have been identified, fluid communication with Alba's staff and management team has been maintained to determine and classify the positive and negative, real and potential impacts arising from these issues and affecting the Company, as well as to determine those impacts caused by its activities that affect its surroundings, with the aim of defining a definitive list of the relevant issues that have been assessed by stakeholders.\n\n# Stage 3. Impact assessment and identification of material issues\n\nThe definitive list of material issues was presented to the stakeholders through the consultation mechanisms mentioned in Phase 1, for them to assess the list of IROs relating to the relevant issues. The stakeholders assessed the\n\n{284}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/284/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white letters.\n\nseverity or magnitude of the impacts and their likelihood of occurrence, as well as the timeframe (short, medium or long) in which the impacts are expected to materialise.\n\nThe information obtained from the surveys and questionnaires was included as part of the internal sources of the dual materiality analysis. To identify the material issues from the relevant issues, the corresponding study groups from internal and external sources were ranked and weighted in both the impact materiality and financial materiality assessments.\n\n# Stage 4. Consolidation of information and reporting\n\nBased on the information obtained, the 17 main issues identified were set out in a double materiality matrix, in which the aspects considered relevant by stakeholders were prioritised based on a double analysis of information sources, and were consolidated, aligning them with the reporting areas established in the Non-Financial Reporting and Diversity Law:\n\n- *Impact materiality analysis:* materiality of issues from an inside-out view of the sustainability impacts - positive and negative - that the Company's activities generate or may generate.\n- *Financial materiality analysis:* materiality of issues from an outside-in view with a potential impact on the Company's value.\n\nTo estimate materiality, we have taken into account both the severity of the impact and the likelihood of these aspects occurring for stakeholders, as well as Alba's level of exposure thereto in terms of the magnitude of the financial effects and their likelihood of occurrence.\n\nThus, the following graph and table shows the prioritisation of the aspects considered in the dual materiality analysis, with those considered to be of medium and high priority - both for impact and financial materiality - on which the information reported in this Non-Financial Information Statement has been mainly focused:\n\n{285}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/285/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

For this reason, average figures are not reflected in this report, as the difference does not significantly affect the interpretation of the data.\n\nAlthough the perimeter changes in the companies between 2023 and 2022, mentioned in section 1, distort the comparability of year-on-year data, the main aspects related to social and employee-related issues are described below.\n\nThe number of employees at Alba has fallen by 22% from 2022 to 2023, as the latter year does not include those of Artá Capital SGEIC, S.A., which in 2023 ceased to form part of Alba due to the sale of the shares of Artá Partners, S.A., as described in section 1 of this report.\n\n# <span id=\"page-289-0\"></span>**6.1.1.

Average employee remuneration**\n\n**Alba** reaffirms its commitment to maintaining a remuneration model for its employees that ensures effective application of the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. In addition, it is committed to ensuring that there are no gender-based or other discriminatory pay differentials, with remuneration based strictly on merit. Remuneration is based on salary bands adjusted to the level of responsibility, type of work and alignment with market remuneration for positions with equivalent conditions. This approach takes into account the financial sustainability of the Company in this area.\n\nIn relation to Alba, average salaries have increased from 2022 to 2023 in terms of gender, age and professional category. However, this data is not comparable, as these salary differences are exclusively due to the fact that the average remuneration of the employees of Artá Capital SGEIC, S.A. is not included in this last financial year. This situation also affects the results of the pay gap (section 6.2.3.).\n\n{295}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/295/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Average remuneration by professional category**\n\n# <span id=\"page-295-0\"></span>**6.2.2. Average remuneration of the Board of Directors**\n\nCorporación Financiera Alba, S.A. has a Board Remuneration Policy, the latest update of which was approved at the General Meeting on 19 June 2023.\n\nThis Policy stipulates that directors' remuneration should be in reasonable proportion to the importance of the Company, its economic situation at any given time and the market standards of comparable companies, and should be geared to promoting the long-term profitability and sustainability of the Company, incorporating the necessary safeguards to avoid excessive risk-taking and the rewarding of poor results.\n\n{296}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/296/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif font. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The background is a teal color.\n\nThe remuneration paid to directors in their capacity as such, as well as for sitting on Board Committees, is set at moderate amounts, especially when compared to those established for other listed companies.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. is composed of 10 members, 4 women and 6 men. The remuneration of the Board of Directors in 2023, by virtue of sitting on the Board and its Committees, and including the multi-year variable remuneration paid in the year, totalled\n\nEuros 6,080,500, with the average remuneration for men being Euros 916,333 and Euros 145,625 for women. This difference in average remuneration between male and female directors is due to the following: (i) the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen receive additional remuneration for the positions they hold on the Board, which is not received by the other directors; and, (ii) a bonus is included as a result of a variable remuneration plan for executive directors, agreed in 2020, and provided for in Alba's Remuneration Policy. Therefore, these differences are not the result of any gender bias since, in their capacity as directors, all members of the Board of Directors receive the same remuneration and a plus for sitting on different committees. The average remuneration of the members of the Board, excluding the aforementioned circumstances, is Euros 134,167 for male directors and Euros 145,625 for female directors.\n\nAs in the previous year, there are no commitments at 31 December 2023 in respect of pension supplements, guarantees or sureties granted to the Board of Directors.\n\n# <span id=\"page-296-0\"></span>**6.2.3. Pay gap**\n\nBoth **Alba** and its Subsidiaries are committed to a remuneration model for their employees that guarantees effective application of the principle of equal pay for work of equal value.\n\nThere are no discriminatory criteria, nor are any guidelines or criteria encouraged or maintained that could lead to a gender pay gap for similar categories, and the principle of equality is a key element of Alba's organisational culture.\n\nThe pay gap is measured as the difference between the average pay received by men and the average pay received by women, expressed as a percentage of the average pay of men. Alba has conducted this exercise including the data of its subsidiaries in Spain until the first quarter of 2023, but excluding the average remuneration of employees abroad, as these are not comparable with employees in Spain due to the different salary bands in each of these countries and the different currencies in which they are paid, the conversion of which into euros would significantly distort the data. For this reason, data on employees abroad and their average remuneration have been included in a separate section (see section 6.4.).\n\nIn 2023 there was a change of perimeter at Alba, as indicated above, with movement in the number of employees compared to 2022, so it is not possible to strictly monitor and compare the gross pay gap figure for the Companies, which in 2023 was 63% compared to 42% in 2022.\n\n{297}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/297/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The background is a dark teal color.\n\nIn addition, this aggregate gross pay gap figure does not adequately represent the situation in this area, given that the salaries of each professional category are very different in each company, and in some professional categories the presence of women is residual.\n\nIn order to provide more representative data, the pay gap data by professional category in each of the Companies referred to in this report is broken down below, with no comparison between 2023 and 2022 for the reasons indicated above.\n\n|             | 2023       |                      |                                             | 2022       |                      |                                             |\n|-------------|------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| COMPANY     | MANAGEMENT | MIDDLE<br>MANAGEMENT | OPERATORS<br>AND<br>ADMINISTRATIVE<br>STAFF | MANAGEMENT | MIDDLE<br>MANAGEMENT | OPERATORS<br>AND<br>ADMINISTRATIVE<br>STAFF |\n| ALBA        | n/a        | -12.20%              | 1.50%                                       | n/a        | 55.00%               | -16.00%                                     |\n| NAUDI       | 27.52%     | 66.56%               | 21.91%                                      | 22%        | n/a                  | 18.00%                                      |\n| GESDOCUMENT | 25.44%     | 3.33%                | 5.73%                                       | 3.00%      | 8.00%                | 8.00%                                       |\n| FACUNDO     | n/a        | 36.30%               | 9.10%                                       | n/a        | 36.00%               | 9.00%                                       |\n\n**Figure 16.

Organisation of work3**\n\n**Alba**'s Code of Ethics and Conduct includes the Company's respect for the personal and family lives of its professionals, and implements measures aimed at facilitating the enjoyment of flexibility and a work-life balance that promote this necessary balance for employees, such as the possibility of remote working. Special days are established at different times of the year: Easter and Christmas, and certain bank holiday weekends. The working day in July and August is reduced. No meetings are held outside of office hours, to encourage digital disconnection.\n\nIn 2023, Alba did not have to adopt any furlough schemes (ERTEs).\n\nThe actions carried out in this connection in the Subsidiaries, which were controlled by Alba only in the first quarter of 2023, are the following:\n\n• **Nuadi** already established shift flexibility measures in 2021, which have remained in place since then. The administrative department has flexible start and finish times and lunchbreaks, as well as the option to leave earlier on Fridays. The other operational departments have rotating shifts to spread the workload.\n\nAt Sadeca there are also different work shifts, which help to improve organisation, efficiency and the work-life balance.\n\n- **Gesdocument** has implemented policies and measures to disconnect from work. In its \"flexi-work\" policy, the ability to remote work has been improved. This subsidiary also offers flexible start and finish times and lunchbreaks. It has a holiday policy that is better than the applicable collective bargaining agreement.\n- **Facundo** has work-life balance measures in place. In the centres that are not factories, no meetings are held and, except in urgent situations or force majeure circumstances, no calls are made or mails are sent, outside of working hours. A reminder of the right to disconnect from work is included in the electronic equipment delivery forms. With the exception of the Villamuriel de Cerrato factory, which has work shifts in place, the rest of the centres do not work on Friday afternoons, and there are flexible start and finish times. An Equality Plan has been agreed with factory personnel to encourage the use of new information technologies (conference calls, telephone calls, etc.) as a means of achieving a balance between employees' personal lives and work lives, reducing, whenever possible, travel, as well as holding, whenever possible, internal meetings and training sessions during working hours.\n\n# <span id=\"page-299-1\"></span>**6.5.1.

Health and safety4**\n\nAlba and its Subsidiaries have measures in place to monitor and promote health and safety in the workplace. Initiatives include carrying out training activities in this connection for employees, health monitoring programmes and external audits to verify that the procedures established in this field are being applied correctly.\n\n**Alba** has specific health and safety commitments that are set out in its Code of Ethics and Conduct and in the procedures and manuals established for this purpose. All employees have the option of undergoing an annual medical check-up. In 2023, a course on first aid, basic life support and semi-automatic defibrillation was given, and an occupational health and safety assessment was carried out.\n\nAlba's subsidiaries had in place the following measures in the first quarter of 2023:\n\n• To comply with its health and safety policy, **Nuadi** has an occupational health and safety management system, integrating preventive activities in all aspects of management and at all hierarchical levels. It has an occupational health and safety plan, approved by management, adopted by all its organisational structure, and known by all its workers, and its essential instruments include risk assessments and the planning of preventive activities. Furthermore, periodic surveillance of workers' state of health is carried out, bearing in mind the risks inherent in their work.

Social relations5**\n\nAlba and its Subsidiaries strive for effective and meticulous management of its labour relations with employees, with a view to ensuring compliance with the labour rights of all employees. Furthermore, social dialogue is based on the different collective bargaining agreements in force, which guarantees respect for and adherence to the principles set out in each agreement.\n\nThe collective bargaining agreements that apply are listed below:\n\n- For **Alba**, the Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Offices and Firms Sector of the Madrid region.\n- For **Nuadi**, the Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Iron and Steel Sector of Navarra. Relations in China are governed by a State workers' agreement, and in Morocco, there is no concept of an agreement, but they do have rules based on a \"Workers' Statute\" with a workers' committee.\n- For **Gesdocument**, the Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Offices and Firms Sector of Catalonia, Bilbao, the Madrid region, the Valencia region and Zaragoza.\n- For the **Facundo** subgroup, the Food Trade Agreement of Valladolid, the Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Offices and Firms sector of Palencia, the General Trade Agreement of Palencia, the Food Trade Agreement and a Collective Company Agreement in one of the group companies.\n\nAll employees of Alba and its Subsidiaries in Spain are covered by collective bargaining agreements.\n\nIn those companies where it is applicable, there are also workers' committees and/or union representatives who ensure compliance with the principles established in the applicable agreements and the establishment of fluid means of communication between all workers and the relevant bodies of the company.\n\n# <span id=\"page-302-1\"></span>**6.8. Training6**\n\n**Alba** has training procedures adapted to the needs of its employees, which take into account the characteristics of the duties they perform, their careers and their professional development, so that resources are focused on the requirements of each job position and the current market. Alba offers the training it considers useful for its employees, who can also request the training they consider necessary for the correct performance of their duties.\n\nIn 2023, employees were able to access the online and face-to-face training they needed. Worthy of note is the ESG training that has been provided to all employees and to the board of directors.\n\nTraining in the Subsidiaries is organised as follows:\n\n• **Nuadi** has an employee welcome plan with the necessary information packages for new employees. In addition, Nuadi detects the training needs of its employees mainly from the performance evaluations of its\n\n<sup>5</sup> GRI 3-3 and GRI 2-30\n\n<sup>6</sup> GRI 3-3 and GRI 404-1\n\n{303}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/303/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The heads of each functional area are responsible for determining the training needs of their employees, which are set out in the training proposal sent annually to the human resources department.\n\n- **Gesdocument** has several training policies for its employees: internal training provided by its specialists; external training for all employees if it is required for the job position, with a view to them improving professionally or developing skills; and a foreign language training policy, which is partially funded by the company and the rest is paid by means of a flexible remuneration. Career plans are also offered to all employees, from junior team members (interns and assistants) to seniors team members and team leaders. In addition, this subsidiary collaborates in creating jobs by working with different universities to offer internships to students to facilitate the start of their professional development and the possibility of them becoming part of the group's workforce.\n- **Facundo** has a training policy for one of its companies. In the rest of its group companies, when an employee or the company detects a need for training, the need is assessed. Fundae training credits are used.\n\nThe training hours for employees of Alba and its Subsidiaries for 2023 are detailed below, taking into account that only the first quarter of 2023 is provided for the latter, thus not allowing for a sufficient comparison with 2022:\n\n|                      | 2023       |                      |                                             |       |\n|----------------------|------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------|\n| COMPANY              | MANAGEMENT | MIDDLE<br>MANAGEMENT | OPERATORS<br>AND<br>ADMINISTRATIVE<br>STAFF | TOTAL |\n| ALBA                 | 101        | 262                  | 1,642                                       | 2,005 |\n| NUADI                | 93         | 35                   | 276                                         | 404   |\n| GESDOCUMENT          | 9          | 318                  | 453                                         | 780   |\n| FACUNDO              | 0          | 0                    | 0                                           | 0     |\n| TOTAL COMPANIES 2023 | 203        | 615                  | 2,370                                       | 3,189 |\n| TOTAL COMPANIES 2022 | 444        | 1,754                | 2,533                                       | 4,731 |\n\n**Figure 25.

The background is a teal color.\n\nThe premises in which the general meetings are held are universally accessible for people with special needs.\n\nAll buildings owned by Alba have measures in place to ensure universal accessibility for people with disabilities, in compliance with all applicable regulations. In addition, although not compulsory, accessible toilets have been installed on all floors.\n\nAlba's subsidiaries had the following measures in place in the first quarter of 2023:\n\n- **Nuadi** has signed a collaboration agreement with Areté Activa covering the 2023 to 2025 period, for the implementation and roll out of actions linked to the measures agreed in the 1st Nuadi Equality Plan, signed in 2021. The non-discrimination and prevention of harassment principles set out in the Code of Ethics and Conduct also apply.\n- **Gesdocument** has an equality plan, which is the basis for the mandatory training on gender equality provided for all employees: \"Fostering equality in Gesdocument\". This training is also included in the initial training plan for new hires. This subsidiary also has a harassment prevention code and a confidential internal ethics channel available to all employees. Moreover, its offices comply with the measures required to facilitate access for people with disabilities.\n- **Facundo** has an equality plan, which describes the measures for its implementation and development. Furthermore, in the event that in a selection process there are two or more finalists that equally meet the requirements and fit in the role for the position offered, preference is given to the candidate who belongs to an under-represented group. This subsidiary also has a policy of bringing the workplace closer to employees' homes for the care of children under 12 years of age or dependent family members with a disability rating of over 65%. In addition, factory visits are universally accessible.\n\n# <span id=\"page-304-1\"></span><span id=\"page-304-0\"></span>**7. Information on environmental matters**\n\n# **7.1. Policies8**\n\nAs part of Alba's commitment to its stakeholders, the Board of Directors of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. has approved various internal policies and regulations, such as the Sustainability and Investment Policies and the Code of Ethics and Conduct, which sets out the guidelines for action on environmental issues. Alba's Code of Ethics and Conduct sets out its commitment to the environment, both in terms of its direct activity and in the environmentally responsible behaviour of the companies in which it invests.\n\nAlba's Sustainability Policy reflects its unwavering commitment to preserving the natural environment, reducing the negative impact of its activities and highlighting the fight against climate change. Based on the definitions of these\n\n8 GRI 3-2 and GRI 3-3\n\n{305}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/305/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The background is a teal color.\n\ncommitments, Alba focuses on pollution prevention and the responsible and sustainable use of resources, as well as appropriate waste management. Furthermore, since 2017 its Investment Policy has included criteria for assessing responsible investments, ensuring that it invests in companies with sound environmental practices.\n\nIn addition, as a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, Alba is actively committed to environmental conservation, abiding by legal requirements and carrying out its activities while endeavouring to minimise potential environmental impacts. The environmental Principles of the Global Compact use, as their baseline framework, three principles enshrined in the earlier Rio Declaration on the Environment and Development, whereby companies should adopt a precautionary approach that favours the environment, foster initiatives that promote greater environmental responsibility and promote the development and spread of environmentally-friendly technologies.\n\nIn view of the activities carried out by Alba, the details of which are set out under section 2.1.2 of this report, no significant environmental impact has been identified either at present or potentially in the future.\n\nEnvironmental topics are not among the most salient matters for its stakeholders. The most significant issues, as can be observed in the materiality analysis in section 4, are the topics related to sustainable resource use and the circular economy, and those related to energy and energy efficiency measures.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, Alba's Subsidiaries have the following environmental regulations and measures in place:\n\n• Nuadi has a certified Environmental Management System that meets the stipulations of ISO 14001:2015. This system contains an Environmental Policy that completely respects the environment where it operates. It also has an Environmental Management Department that involves the entire organisation in these issues. It has taken out public liability insurance for all types of environmental incident, although no such incidents have taken place. Implementation of its Waste Reduction Plan began in 2020.\n\nSadeca's environmental targets are included in the company's overall objectives. Simulations are carried out and environmental incidents are monitored as KPIs.\n\n- **Gesdocument** applies environmental criteria across its activity and has somebody in charge of executing the procedures for the prevention and management of environmental and health and safety impacts, despite the fact that its activity has little impact on the environment.\n- **Facundo** has an Environmental Policy, the main principles of which are as follows: (i) to ensure compliance with the environmental legislation and regulations applicable to its facilities and operations; (ii) to apply the necessary measures to prevent pollution, minimise waste generation and make responsible use of material and energy resources; and (iii) to promote environmental training and awareness among all employees. The environmental control function is carried out by its quality department, the activity of which is geared towards preventing environmental risks and promoting ways to achieve a sustainable organisation.\n\n{306}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/306/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif font on a teal background. Below \"ALBA\" is the text \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font.\n\n# <span id=\"page-306-1\"></span><span id=\"page-306-0\"></span>**7.2. Environmental management and performance**\n\n# **7.2.1. Energy and climate change9**\n\nOne of Alba's commitments, as set out in its Sustainability Policy, revolves around mitigating climate change and minimising the impact that its activities may have in this regard. Given the nature of its activity, the impacts are monitored using indicators that measure energy consumption and the generation of the associated emissions. Furthermore, for the purposes of this Non-Financial Information Statement, the indicators have been calculated in accordance with the EU Taxonomy of Sustainable Finance Regulation 2020/852. These indicators help Alba to ascertain and optimise the impact of its activities on climate change and the natural environment, encouraging the consideration of sustainable and environmentally-friendly business models.\n\nAlba will continue to work on identifying, assessing and managing climate change risks and opportunities, as well as evaluating the financial impacts that these could have on its activity.\n\nAt **Alba**, energy consumption is mainly from the use of lighting, air conditioning and IT equipment at its owned offices and buildings (Castellana 42, Castellana 44, Castellana 89 and the Oasis buildings). With a view to reducing this consumption, various energy efficiency measures have been implemented, such as the replacement of traditional light bulbs with LEDs, building renovations to increase energy efficiency and external energy efficiency controls and audits, all of which helps Alba to reduce its environmental impact.\n\nIn addition, the Castellana 89 building has held the LEED Gold Seal awarded by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) since 2021, which guarantees the eco-efficiency of the building. In addition, an agreement was signed in 2023 to ensure the supply of energy from 100% renewable sources. A process got underway in 2022 to remove gas boilers and replace chillers with heat pumps to further improve energy efficiency and reduce Alba's carbon footprint. The above-mentioned renovations were completed in 2023. New aerothermal chillers with heat pumps were installed and three of the four existing boilers were removed, reducing natural gas consumption to instances of extreme necessity only. In addition, a study has gotten underway to install photovoltaic panels for self-supply on the building's roof.\n\nA photovoltaic plant has been in operation at the Oasis building since January 2021, providing part of the energy needed for the building's installations and services, with a consequent reduction in electricity consumption. Production during the year totalled 194,979 kWh, up 62% on the previous year. This avoided the equivalent of 34,364 kg of CO2e being released into the atmosphere (CNMC emission factor). In addition, the potable water system has been replaced to limit leakage and consumption meters have also been installed.\n\nAt the end of the 2022 financial year, work began on the ESG improvement study for the Castellana 42 building. In addition to the foregoing, work was also carried out in 2023 to improve the building's energy efficiency and ensure optimum working conditions, as well as the health and\n\n<sup>9</sup> GRI 3-3, GRI 302-1, GRI 302-2, GRI 302-4 and GRI 305-1\n\n{307}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/307/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Key improvements include the replacement of light fittings with LED panels, which reduce energy consumption and optimise the use of lighting through motion sensors and smart programming; the enhanced insulation of façades and roofs, which improves the thermal insulation of the building and helps to reduce heat loss in winter and heat input in summer. This reduces the need for heating and cooling, respectively, and contributes to greater thermal comfort for occupants; the installation of low consumption timed taps, which reduces wasteful consumption of drinking water in the building; the installation of individual water consumption meters; air ionisation with monitored air quality, which contributes to improving indoor air quality by reducing the presence of pollutants and pathogens and promotes a healthier environment for building occupants. The continuous monitoring of air quality is essential to ensure its effectiveness and to maintain optimal levels of comfort and health. A roof terrace with vegetation has also been created for tenants' use and enjoyment. This building has a 100% renewable electricity supply contract and is currently undergoing a pre-assessment process for LEED certification.\n\nThe Castellana 89 and Castellana 42 buildings have vinyl solar filters on their façades that reduce solar radiation and, therefore, the energy needed for air conditioning.\n\nWork continued in 2023 to prepare the Castellana 44 building for its comprehensive refurbishment. This includes the replacement of its façades and new, more efficient installations, all with the aim of increasing its energy efficiency and sustainability and achieving better levels of comfort and maintenance. These works will also enable it to secure sustainable building certification.\n\nLikewise, six electric vehicle charging points were installed at the Castellana 42 building in 2023. The Oasis and Castellana 89 buildings have had electric vehicle charging points since 2021, which can be used by their users after arranging the service with the electricity supplier.\n\nThe Castellana 42 and Oasis buildings have bicycle parking facilities to promote cycling, which is an alternative to other more polluting modes of travel.\n\nThe environmental performance of Alba's Subsidiaries during the first quarter of 2023 is detailed below:\n\n- **Nuadi** has installed LED lighting throughout its plant in Spain as a measure to reduce energy consumption.\n- As part of its efforts to respect the environment and optimise resource use, **Gesdocument** has installed LED lights, fostered the elimination of paper, arranged cleaner energy supply agreements, and contributed to the progressive reduction of its carbon footprint by eliminating unnecessary travel and using, wherever possible, trains instead of planes.\n- **Facundo** is committed to improving the energy performance of both its facilities and equipment, taking into consideration opportunities to improve the design and procurement of energy-efficient products and services. It has continued to replace conventional light fittings with LEDs and has forged ahead with the installation of stepper motors,\n\n{308}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/308/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Greenhouse gas emissions**\n\n*Note: the 2023 data for Subsidiaries refers to Nuadi and Facundo's activities for Scope 1 emissions.*\n\nAlba's electricity consumption stems from the operation of its buildings. Alba's electricity consumption fell by 11% with respect to 2022, thanks to energy efficiency improvements, in particular the above-mentioned improvement at the Castellana 89 and Castellana 42 buildings. Energy self-supply at the Oasis building in 2023 came in at 125,877 kWh, up 34% on 2022. Energy efficiency certifications were renewed in 2023 at the Castellana 89, Castellana 42 and Oasis buildings,\n\n{309}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/309/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The background is a teal color.\n\nsecuring better ratings and a reduction in CO₂ emissions.\n\nNatural gas consumption was down by a considerable 64% with respect to 2022, due to the removal of three natural gas boilers at the Castellana 89 building.\n\nWith regard to GHG emissions, as indicated in other sections of this Report, the change in the scope of consolidation in 2023 prevents a comparison and strict monitoring of that year's data with previous years. However, Alba's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint are reflected in the share of energy consumed from renewable sources, rising from 17.48% in 2022 to 50.43% in 2023. Across Alba's buildings, 54.14% of total energy consumed is from renewable sources, of which 6.18% is from its own clean self-supply. As of the first quarter of 2023, the Castellana 89 building terminated its conventional energy contract and entered into an agreement for the supply of energy from certified renewable sources, which avoided the release of 347,006 kg CO₂e into the atmosphere in 2023. Alba also offset 100% of its transport emissions with Cabify. In this regard it offset the kilometres travelled using this service, which amounted to 11 kg of CO₂.\n\n# <span id=\"page-309-0\"></span>**7.2.2. Sustainable resource use and circular economy10**\n\n**Alba** has adopted a raft of measures which, as mentioned above, aim to improve efficiency and foster the sustainable and responsible use of resources. Given that the main material used in its activities is paper, to order to minimise consumption, Alba has a digital archive in place for all departments, through which files can be consulted, downloaded and shared. In addition, all paper used is certified with the FSC environmental stamp.\n\nThe environmental performance of Alba's Subsidiaries during the first quarter of 2023, in terms of the sustainable use of resources, is detailed below:\n\n• The main raw material input in **Nuadi**'s production process are steel coils of various sizes. After the manufacturing process, surplus material is sent to a waste metal management company. The reduced size of the waste shavings make them highly suitable for use in automatic dosing systems at foundries or steel mills to control the composition of the molten mix. The waste management company sends the vast majority of surplus material to a steel mill located some\n\n40 kilometres away, where they are converted into engine blocks and cylinder heads for reuse in the automotive manufacturing sector. As for water, this will feature in future phases of its Waste Reduction Plan.\n\nWith regard to Sadeca, this company's water consumption is only for human and sanitary purposes and is not used in the industrial process. The company uses recycled raw materials such as polyamide or PVC injection pellets, harnessing the injection waste of both for subsequent sale as a by-product for the manufacture of recycled material. The waste that is recycled and recovered includes paper and cardboard, film, wood from pallets, leftover stainless steel parts, cable and nonhazardous waste.\n\n• For **Gesdocument**, the water consumption at its various branches remains insignificant and has been assumed by the lessors of the properties. Although there is no formal waste management, Gesdocument\n\n10 GRI 3-3, GRI 301-1 and GRI 303-3\n\n{310}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/310/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The background is a solid teal color.\n\ncontinues to promote digitalisation as opposed to the use of paper.\n\n• In its manufacturing processes, **Facundo** has always sought to optimise the use of natural resources and remains steadfast in its commitment to carry out its activity in a sustainable manner, using the most advanced techniques available and adopting the necessary measures to reduce its environmental impact. It has therefore paid particular attention to improving its production equipment, so that there are no breakdowns or leaks leading to raw material losses. The same can be said of water supply networks to avoid uncontrolled water leakage.\n\nIn view of market quality requirements and to prevent food waste, it has continued to improve conveyor elements, such as belts and vibration equipment to minimise waste. Moreover, all manufactured products are stored at room temperature, which has a favourable environmental impact, and the vehicles used to transport products comply with current regulations. The primary suppliers of maize and potato submitted the relevant agricultural records that show the traceability of the treatments carried out. The \"dry\" organic waste is used as animal feed.\n\nThe following figure shows the consumption of materials by Alba and its Subsidiaries up until 31 March 2023:\n\n| COMPANY                 | 2023                      |                           |                          |                              |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                         | WATER<br>CONSUMED<br>(m³) | PAPER<br>CONSUMED<br>(kg) | OTHER MATERIALS          |                              |\n|                         |                           |                           | FILM<br>CONSUMED<br>(kg) | STEEL<br>CONSUMED<br>(tonne) |\n| ALBA                    | 32,678                    | 1,068                     | n.a.                     | n.a.                         |\n| TOTAL ALBA 2023         | 32,678                    | 1,068                     | n.a.                     | n.a.                         |\n| TOTAL ALBA 2022         | 29,896                    | 930                       | n.a.                     | n.a.                         |\n| NUADI                   | 1,302                     | 268                       | n.a.                     | 6,480                        |\n| GESDOCUMENT             | n.a.                      | 140                       | n.a.                     | n.a.                         |\n| FACUNDO                 | 3,065                     | 122,355                   | 35,079                   | n.a.                         |\n| TOTAL SUBSIDIARIES 2023 | 4,367                     | 122,763                   | 35,079                   | 6,480                        |\n| TOTAL SUBSIDIARIES 2022 | 9,987                     | 5,764                     | 141,000                  | n.a.                         |\n| TOTAL COMPANIES 2023    | 37,045                    | 123,831                   | 35,079                   | 6,480                        |\n| TOTAL COMPANIES 2022    | 39,883                    | 6,694                     | 141,000                  | n.a.                         |\n\n# **Raw materials used**\n\n#### **Figure 28. Raw materials used**\n\n*Note: 2023 includes the Nuadi data for all applicable countries. Nuadi's steel consumption excludes data from Morocco due to the difficulty in obtaining data from that unit.*\n\nGiven the diversity of Alba's Subsidiaries, the consumption of materials is likewise heterogenous and does not affect all the Subsidiaries to the same extent. This is the case of Facundo's film consumption, for example, which amounted to 141,000 kg during the first quarter of 2023. As mentioned earlier, the change in the scope of consolidation prevents a comparison and strict monitoring of this year's data with that of previous years.\n\n{311}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/311/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The background is a solid teal color.\n\nAt **Alba**, on the other hand, the consumption of natural resources has increased slightly compared to 2022. Water consumption increased by 9% as the buildings reached almost full occupancy in 2023. Paper consumption has increased by 15%.\n\nAlba continues to channel efforts into reducing its consumption and adopting specific measures to cut down waste generation and ensure its correct treatment and handling. Water fountains are installed at Alba's offices and all employee have been given their own glass bottle and personalised mug to avoid using disposable cups. Improvements continue to be made in terms of waste management, such as coffee capsules, batteries and other office waste, as well as in the recycling of polluting waste such as printer toner cartridges.\n\nAt the buildings operated by Alba, taps fitted with timers have continued to be installed to reduce the consumption of drinking water, as well as dual flush cisterns and individual water consumption meters, which result in better water use. The water leakage prevention measures mentioned earlier have been implemented at the Oasis building to avoid water wastage.\n\nThe data below shows the waste generated by Alba and its Subsidiaries up until 31 March 2023:\n\n| COMPANY                 | 2023<br>WASTE GENERATED (tonne) |               |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------|\n|                         | HAZARDOUS                       | NON-HAZARDOUS |\n| ALBA                    | 0                               | 163           |\n| TOTAL ALBA 2023         | 0                               | 163           |\n| TOTAL ALBA 2022         | n.a.                            | n.a.          |\n| NUADI                   | 114                             | 65            |\n| GESDOCUMENT             | n.a.                            | n.a.          |\n| FACUNDO                 | 5                               | 27            |\n| TOTAL SUBSIDIARIES 2023 | 119                             | 91            |\n| TOTAL SUBSIDIARIES 2022 | 429                             | 19,272        |\n| TOTAL COMPANIES 2023    | 119                             | 254           |\n| TOTAL COMPANIES 2022    | 429                             | 19,272        |\n\n# **Waste generated**\n\n#### **Figure 29.

This Code affects all persons who, in the discharge of their duties and conduct of their employment, commercial and professional relationships, have dealings with the Company. The following such values are particularly noteworthy:\n\n- Respect for human rights and commitment to the Global Compact, of which it is a Signatory Partner.\n- Ethical and lawful conduct.\n- Fair and respectful treatment, based on equal opportunities and non-discrimination.\n- Respect for the environment.\n- Respect for the interests of other persons related to the Company.\n- Prudence in the pursuit of the Company's activities, risk-taking and dealings with customers.\n- Information processing based on rigour, integrity and transparency.\n\nThe above Code lays down mandatory rules of conduct for Alba's governing bodies, executives and employees, as well as for third parties that have dealings with Alba.\n\nAlso, given the importance of internal whistleblowing channels, there is a procedure for reporting -confidentially and in certain cases anonymously- any acts or conduct occurring within the Company or in dealings with third parties that may be contrary to the applicable regulations or to Alba's Code of Ethics and Conduct, or that may be detrimental to Alba. The Whistleblowing Channel may be used by all persons inside and outside the Company, the latter including Alba's customers, suppliers, contractors and partners. As noted in section 3.1 of this report, the Whistleblowing Channel was adapted to certain provisions of the Whistleblowing Law in 2023.\n\nAlba provides its employees with a reminder of the Code of Ethics and Conduct each year. The reminder circulated in 2023 reiterated the general rules of conduct to be followed, the functions of the Monitoring Committee and the procedure for monitoring compliance with the Code and the Whistleblowing Channel, which guarantees whistleblower confidentiality and establishes the scenarios in which anonymous communications are accepted.\n\nNo complaints or Code of Ethics and Conduct-related suggestions or queries were received in 2023.\n\nAlba's subsidiaries also had measures of this kind in place in the first quarter of 2023:\n\n<sup>11</sup> GRI 3-3, GRI 3-2, GRI 2-23, GRI 2-26 and GRI 406-1\n\n{313}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/313/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Anti-corruption and anti-bribery management12**\n\n**Alba** takes the necessary steps to ensure compliance with its oversight duties with a view to preventing the commission of the offences referred to in its crime prevention model. Ethical values and responsible conduct permeate the everyday lives of everyone who forms part of Alba. To safeguard these values and, in particular, combat all forms of corruption, the Board of Directors of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. approved the Crime and Fraud Prevention Policy in 2015.\n\nOn the back of this Policy, a Crime Prevention Manual was established, the latest update of which was approved in 2020 by the Audit and Compliance Committee. This Manual constitutes the reference framework of the Crime Prevention Model. The Manual sets out a series of effective measures aimed at preventing, detecting and reacting to criminal conduct. It applies to directors, executives and employees, and enables situations involving the potential commission of wrongdoings to be monitored. The principles upon which it is based, namely, coordination and participation of all professionals, transparency and communication, effective action, training, etc., ensure the proper implementation, monitoring and improvement of the Model.\n\nContracts with third parties also contain clauses requiring such third parties to monitor situations involving a risk of crimes, infringements or serious irregularities, and to reject corruption and fraud, including extortion, bribery and kickbacks.\n\nMoreover, Alba's general rules of conduct in the Code of Ethics and Conduct specifically mention bribes, commissions, gifts and presents, and Alba is\n\n12 GRI 3-3, GRI 3-2, GRI 2-23 and GRI 2-26\n\n{314}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/314/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Only gifts of negligible financial value may be accepted.\n\nAlba's Code of Ethics and Conduct also refers to compliance with the provisions on the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.\n\nAlba's subsidiaries also had measures of this kind in place up to 31 March 2023.\n\n- **Nuadi** has several documents over and above the aforementioned Code of Ethics, which regulate and control any such conflicts of interest as may arise in the conduct of the business and cases relating to intellectual property and the confidentiality of the information handled by the company, which are applicable both in Spain and in China. These documents are the \"Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Agreement Non Solicitation Agreement - NUADI Europe\" and the \"Code of Ethics and Business Conduct - NUADI Europe v.2\".\n- **Gesdocument** has several internal codes in place in respect of the fight against corruption within the company, such as the 2018 Harassment Prevention Code, the 2020 Money Laundering Prevention Manual, the 2020 Corporate Report and a 2018 Anti-Corruption Policy.\n- **Facundo** does not have a policy in place in this area, as the nature of its business means that the risk of corruption and money laundering is low. An analysis of these risks has revealed the risk of the misappropriation of small amounts of cash during distribution to stores. To ensure control, the money is deposited and checked by different people. Although the risk associated with bribery practices is also very low, efforts are made to maintain good business practices.\n\n## <span id=\"page-314-1\"></span><span id=\"page-314-0\"></span>**9.

All this, based on a relationship of ongoing dialogue and close cooperation with the public administrations, particularly the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV).\n\nSince 2020, Alba has adhered to the State Tax Agency's Code of Good Tax Practices, promoted by the Large Companies Forum.\n\nFinally, Alba's commitment to sustainability is reflected in its listing in October 2023 on the IBEX ESG, one of the Bolsas y Mercados Españoles (BME) sustainability indexes. Alba and six of its investees are among the 47 companies listed on this index. The six Alba investees that are included on BME's Ibex ESG are Acerinox, S.A. and Inmobiliaria Colonial Socimi, S.A.

Any remuneration received by the Directors for the exercise or termination of their position and for the performance of executive functions must be consistent with the applicable Remuneration Policy at each time, except for remunerations expressly approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe principles underpinning the Remuneration Policy are:\n\n- Balance and moderation.\n- Alignment with best market practice.\n- Generally monitoring the recommendations on good corporate governance relating to the remuneration of the Directors.\n- Compatibility with (i) adequate and effective risk management, not providing incentives to take risks that are based on the level of risk tolerated, and (ii) the Group's long-term business strategy, goals, values and interests, avoiding potential conflicts of interest.\n- Being subject to the decisions taken by the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n- Non-discrimination, recognising equal pay for services of equal value.\n\nThe Remunerations Policy distinguishes the remuneration of the Directors in their capacity as such and the remuneration of the Directors for their performance of executive functions.\n\n{358}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/358/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV).

The letters \"CNMV\" are in white and are stacked on top of the words \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\", which are also in white but in a smaller font size.\n\n#### **ANNUAL REPORT ON DIRECTOR REMUNERATION OF LISTED COMPANIES**\n\nThe remuneration of Directors as such is based on the following principles:\n\n- Sufficiency to compensate for their dedication, skill and responsibility, but without this being so high as to compromise their independence.\n\n- Relationship with the effective dedication.\n\n- Connection with the responsibility and the development of their functions by the various Directors.\n\n- Absence of variable components.\n\n- Incentive by nature, but in measures that do not affect their independence.\n\n- To take into account, as reference, market criteria, focusing on the remuneration foreseen for Directors of listed companies with which a comparison can be established.\n\nThe remuneration of executive directors, if appointed, it is based on the following principles:\n\n- To reward the performance of their functions with a comprehensive offer of cash and non-cash elements that meet the variety of needs and expectations in a professional environment, and that serve as a tool for the communication of organizational and business objectives. - To align performance with the objectives of the group at different timelines, encouraging the sustainability of results.\n\n- To recognise the capacity for creating value, as well as personal abilities and characteristics.\n\n- To promote a culture of commitment of the group's objectives, taking into account that it is essential to have the contribution of both the individual and the team.\n\n- To evaluate professional development and the results of activities using standardised criteria.\n\n- To provide equitable and competitive remuneration, bearing in mind the responsibilities of the position and a flexible approach to the market, in order to attract and retain the best professionals.\n\n-Variable remuneration may comprise two components: one with an annual vesting period and one with a multi-year vesting period.\n\n- To review the systems and remuneration updates so that, the necessary adjustments can be introduced, where appropriate, addressing the results and the capacity for motivation.\n\nIn 2023, no external advisor assisted in the updating of the Remuneration Policy, but a comparison was made with remunerations of directors of other listed companies, leading to the updating of the remuneration indicated above.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy provides for the possibility of the Board approving temporary exceptions to applying the Policy for executive Directors, subject to a report from the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, which may be assisted by an external expert. Temporary exceptions to the Remuneration Policy are limited to exceptional situations where the non-application of the Remuneration Policy is necessary to serve the long-term interests and sustainability of the Company as a whole, or to ensure its viability. The remuneration components that may be exempted are those foreseen for Executive Directors. The maximum period of application will be 24 months. There are no Executive Directors and therefore no temporary exceptions are foreseen in 2024.\n\nA.1.2 Relative importance of variable remuneration items vis-à-vis fixed remuneration (remuneration mix) and the criteria and objectives taken into consideration in their determination and to ensure an appropriate balance between the fixed and variable components of the remuneration. In particular, indicate the actions taken by the company in relation to the remuneration system to reduce exposure to excessive risks and to align it with the long-term objectives, values and interests of the company, which will include, as the case may be, mention of the measures taken to ensure that the long-term results of the company are taken into account in the remuneration policy, the measures adopted in relation to those categories of personnel whose professional activities have a material impact on the risk profile of the company and measures in place to avoid conflicts of interest.\n\nFurthermore, indicate whether the company has established any period for the accrual or vesting of certain variable remuneration items, in cash, shares or other financial instruments, any deferral period in the payment of amounts or delivery of accrued and vested financial instruments, or whether any clause has been agreed reducing the deferred remuneration not yet vested or obliging the director to return remuneration received, when such remuneration has been based on figures that have since been clearly shown to be inaccurate.\n\nIn 2023 there were no Executive Directors, the only ones for whom variable remuneration is provided for, so there is no information that can be provided regarding the relative importance of variable remuneration compared to fixed remuneration.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy anticipates that the remuneration of the Directors must save a reasonable proportion with the importance of the Company, the financial position it has at any time and the comparable business market standards, to be driven by promoting the longterm profitability and sustainability of the company, incorporating the necessary precautions to prevent excessive risk taking and unfavourable results.\n\nFees for Directors in their capacity as such, as well as those established for their participation in the committees of the Board, are established in moderate amounts, especially if compared with those established for other listed companies.\n\nExecutive Directors, if appointed during the term of the current Remuneration Policy, may be beneficiaries of annual and multi-year variable remuneration plans, through the award of share options and/or delivery of shares. Once these plans have been approved by the\n\n{359}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/359/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV). The logo is set against a red background. The letters \"CNMV\" are displayed in white at the top, followed by the words \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\" in smaller white letters below.\n\n#### **ANNUAL REPORT ON DIRECTOR REMUNERATION OF LISTED COMPANIES**\n\nGeneral Meeting, the Board of Directors shall, at the recommendation of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, establish the criteria for the award of variable remuneration, indicating the financial and non-financial performance criteria, the methods to be applied to determine to what extent the criteria will have been met and how the variable remuneration contributes to the corporate strategy and to the long-term interests and sustainability of the company.\n\nTo reduce exposure to excessive risks, the Board of Directors has agreed that investment and divestiture decisions are taken collectively, by the Board of Directors itself, if they exceed the two hundred million euros, or by the Investment Committee, when operations exceed the limits set by the Managing directors, who will make these decisions jointly only for amounts under twenty-five or ten million euros, depending on the investment concerned.\n\nThus, no Executive Director can take decisions that may involve a risk to the Company. There are no plans for there to be any Executive Board Members in 2024.\n\nIn order to address the company's long-term performance, the annual variable remuneration system follows an annual accrual basis, with remuneration paid in two tranches, a first payment at the beginning of the year following the year in which targets are measured, and a second payment over a period of between five and eight years. The deferred portion is linked to the performance of the Company's net asset value per share during the deferral period.\n\nIn the case of multi-year variable remuneration, the agreement establishing the multi-year variable remuneration plan shall set out the specific duration of the plan.\n\nThe current Remuneration Policy establishes a clawback clause for variable remuneration paid within the three years following the date on which the Company paid the variable remuneration, in the event of exceptional circumstances occurring that could affect the Company's results or derive from inappropriate conduct. Exceptional circumstances are considered to be, and the Company shall be entitled to claim the return of the corresponding components of the variable remuneration from the Director, by way of example, (i) that the variable remuneration is paid on the basis of data whose inaccuracy is accredited after the time it is paid (for example, on the basis of any qualifications included in the external auditor's report that reduce the results), (ii) that the Director has acted fraudulently, or (iii) that the Director has caused serious harm to the Company through fault or gross negligence.\n\nA.1.3 Amount and nature of fixed components that are due to be accrued during the year by directors in their capacity as such.\n\nAccording to the Remuneration Policy in force, the remuneration of the Directors acting as such is as follows:\n\n- The remuneration of all members of members of the Board of Directors in their capacity as such is 100,000 euros per year. Similarly, the following additional remuneration is established.\n\nFor the Chairman, 550,000 euros per year.\n\nFor the Vice-Chairpersons, 450,000 euros per year.\n\nFor the members of the Audit and Compliance Committee, 30,000 euros per year and for its Chairman, 40,000 euros per year.\n\nFor the members of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, 20,000 euros per year and for its Chairman, 30,000 euros per year. For the members of the Investment Committee, 30,000 euros per year and for its Chairman, 50,000 euros per year.\n\nThere is an additional remuneration of 15,000 euros per year with the same accrual system as the annual remuneration, for the participation in any Committee other than those mentioned above, that may be established.\n\nThe amounts indicated are fixed, not depending on the number of meetings held throughout the year. In the event that any membership of the Board of Directors does not extend throughout the year, the amounts will be prorated by quarters.\n\nThe annual amount of the fixed remuneration expected to be accrued for the Directors in their capacity as such for 2024 is 2,870,000 euros.\n\nA.1.4 Amount and nature of fixed components that are due to be accrued during the year for the performance of senior management functions of executive directors.\n\nDuring this financial year, there are no executive Board Members sat on the Board of Directors, nor is it expected to appoint any during the year, therefore, no amounts will be paid under this heading.\n\nA.1.5 Amount and nature of any component of remuneration in kind that will accrue during the year, including, but not limited to, insurance premiums paid in favour of the director.\n\n{360}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/360/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV). The logo consists of the letters \"CNMV\" in white, stacked on top of the words \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\", also in white. All of this is set against a red background.\n\nDuring this financial year, there are no executive Board Members sat on the Board of Directors, nor is it expected to appoint any during the year, therefore, no remuneration in kind will be accrued given that the Remuneration Policy only provides such for Executive Board Members.\n\n#### A.1.6 Amount and nature of variable components, differentiating between those established in the short and long terms.\n\nFinancial and non-financial, including social, environmental and climate change parameters selected to determine variable remuneration for the current year, explaining the extent to which these parameters are related to performance, both of the director and of the company, and to its risk profile, and the methodology, necessary period and techniques envisaged to be able to determine the effective degree of compliance, at the end of the year, with the parameters used in the design of the variable remuneration, explaining the criteria and factors applied in regard to the time required and methods of verifying that the performance or any other conditions linked to the accrual and vesting of each component of variable remuneration have effectively been met.\n\nIndicate the range, in monetary terms, of the different variable components according to the degree of fulfilment of the objectives and parameters established, and whether any maximum monetary amounts exist in absolute terms.\n\nIn the current financial year, the Company does not have any executive directors on its Board, and there are no plans to appoint any during the year.\n\nHowever, the Remuneration Policy does provide that in the event that executive Directors are appointed, they may be beneficiaries of two types of variable remuneration at the Company's discretion:\n\n#### 1) Annual variable remuneration.\n\nThis is a variable remuneration which will take into account parameters linked to the performance of the net asset value, total shareholder return and/or value creation (which could include, by way of example, the execution of the international strategy, the monitoring of existing investments, the analysis and execution of investments and divestments, and corporate governance). The annual variable remuneration for each executive Director will represent a maximum of up to 100% of their annual fixed remuneration, and will depend on the degree of the executive Director's contribution to the achievement of the objectives.\n\nIn accordance with the Remuneration Policy of the Board, the maximum amount of the Variable Remuneration for all the Directors discharging executive functions is 3,000,000 euros. If the number of executive directors exceeds three, the limit would be increased proportionally.\n\nThere are no plans to appoint executive directors in 2024 and therefore there will be no annual variable remuneration for executive directors.\n\nNon-financial parameters are taken into account in the annual variable remuneration, considering that corporate governance, environmental and social issues are set out in Alba's Corporate Governance, Sustainability and Investment Policies, and in the Code of Ethics and Conduct, as guiding principles for its activities.\n\nGiven the characteristics of the annual variable remuneration, and the manner in which investment and divestment decisions are taken in the Company, as detailed in section A.1.2 above, it cannot be said that an executive Director has a certain risk profile or generates a particular risk.\n\n#### 2) Multi-year variable remuneration.\n\nThe multi-year variable remuneration shall refer to the difference between the \"initial\" (\"initial NAV\") and \"final\" (\"final NAV\") net asset value per share of the Company, where: the \"initial NAV\" of each share shall be the average net asset value per share of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. during a number of trading sessions prior to the \"initial day\" of the plan, which shall be the day that is fixed in the plan implementation agreement; and the \"final NAV\" shall be the average net asset value per share of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. during a number of trading sessions prior to the \"final day\" of the plan, which shall be the day on which the number of years established in the plan elapses since the \"initial day\" of the plan. Such plans may be realised, if the Company so chooses, by way of cash payments, the granting of stock options and/or shares.\n\nAt present, the multi-year variable remuneration plan in force that affect Directors (2021, adopted in accordance with the Remuneration Policy prior to the one currently in force) are expected to be settled in cash, although, at the Company's discretion, they may be settled by payment in shares valued at the closing price on the day prior to the day on which they are transferred to the Directors. The mentioned plan is the only one in force applicable to Directors.\n\nThe multi-year variable remuneration does not take into account non-financial parameters.\n\nGiven the characteristics of the multi-year variable remuneration systems, and how investment and divestment decisions at the Company\n\n{361}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/361/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV). The logo is set against a red background. The letters \"CNMV\" are stacked vertically above the words \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\".\n\nare made, it cannot be said that Executive Directors have a certain risk profile or that they generate a particular risk.\n\nIn the multi-year variable remuneration plan referred to in detail in Section B.7 of this Report, the monetary range for the 2021 Plan will be between 0 and 2,010,500 euros\n\nTaking into account the evolution of the Company's NAV, as at the date of this report, it is forecast that in 2024 there will be an accrual of the multi-year variable remuneration corresponding to the 2021 plan, described in Section B.7.\n\nVariable remuneration clawback agreement. The Board's Remuneration Policy provides for the possible recovery of variable remuneration paid in the event of exceptional circumstances that could affect the Company's performance or arising from inappropriate behaviour.\n\nThe following are considered exceptional circumstances, for example: (i) if the variable remuneration is paid on the basis of information that is proven to be inaccurate after the variable remuneration has been paid, (ii) if the Director has acted fraudulently, or (iii) if the Director has caused serious harm to the Company through fault or gross negligence. In these cases, the Company will have the right to reclaim the reimbursement of the relevant components of the variable remuneration from the Director discharging executive functions (the claim may be presented within a period of three years counted from the moment that the Company paid the variable remuneration object of the claim).\n\nA.1.7 Main characteristics of long-term savings schemes. Among other information, indicate the contingencies covered by the scheme, whether it is a defined contribution or a defined benefit scheme, the annual contribution that has to be made to defined contribution schemes, the benefits to which directors are entitled in the case of defined benefit schemes, the vesting conditions of the economic rights of directors and their compatibility with any other type of payment or indemnification for early termination or dismissal, or deriving from the termination of the contractual relationship, in the terms provided, between the company and the director.\n\nIndicate whether the accrual or vesting of any of the long-term savings plans is linked to the attainment of certain objectives or parameters relating to the director's short- or long-term performance.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy provides that in the event that executive directors are appointed, an alternative defined contribution pension scheme will be established, the terms of which have not yet been determined.\n\nIn the current financial year, there are no Executive Board Members sitting on the Board of Directors who may be granted a pension scheme.\n\nThe maximum amount of contributions by the Company to the alternative defined contribution pension scheme to be defined would be 1,500,000 euros per annum. If the number of executive directors exceeds three, the limit would be increased proportionally.\n\nAccrual or receipt of benefits is not linked to the achievement of certain short or long-term objectives or parameters by the Director. As there are no Executive Board Members during the current financial year, no contributions will be paid out by the Company.\n\nA.1.8 Any type of payment or indemnification for early termination or dismissal, or deriving from the termination of the contractual relationship, in the terms provided, between the company and the director, whether at the company's or the director's initiative, as well as any type of agreement reached, such as exclusivity, post-contractual non- competition, minimum contract term or loyalty, that entitles the director to any kind of remuneration.\n\nWith respect to the basic conditions of the contracts of Directors who, where applicable, perform executive functions in the Company, the Remuneration Policy establishes the following clauses relating to indemnities or golden parachutes in the event of early termination or termination of the contractual relationship between the Company and the Director:\n\n- If, upon ceasing to perform the executive functions assigned under contract, the Director takes on other functions that are also executive ones, the remuneration agreed upon in his contract shall be maintained, unless some other arrangement is mutually agreed on.\n\n- If, upon termination of the Director's executive duties, there is no prior employment relationship that would resume, the Director shall be entitled to indemnification equal to the amount of one year's Fixed Remuneration, increased by one twelfth of such yearly amount for each year of service with the Group, up to a limit of two years' total annual remuneration, less the amount of the fund set up as pension supplement, which shall correspond to him in full in any case.\n\n- If, upon the Director's termination of his executive duties, a previous employment relationship resumes and it is also decided to terminate such employment relationship, the indemnification payable in the event of termination of the relationship by the Company shall be in\n\n{362}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/362/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV).

In the event that the exercise of other activities is authorised and these are paid, the amount of such remuneration may be deducted from the Director's remuneration, if the Company so decides when granting authorisation.\n\nPost-contractual non-competition and permanence agreements may be entered into, the amount of which, together with severance pay and accrued pension rights, may not exceed two years' total annual remuneration. This limit shall not apply in the event of early termination, at the discretion of the Company, of the employment relationship between the Company and the Director who has resigned from his executive duties, in respect of the part of the severance payment that complies with the provisions of labour legislation.\n\nAs there are no Executive Board Members during the current financial year, and their appointment is not foreseen, the above provisions will not be applied.\n\nA.1.9 Indicate the conditions that contracts of executive directors performing senior management functions must contain. Among other things, provide information about the duration, the limits on amounts of compensation, the permanence clauses, periods of notice, as well as the payment as a substitute for the said period of notice, and any other provisions relating to contracting premiums, as well as compensation or protective payments for early termination or cancellation of the contractual relationship between the company and the executive director. Include, among other things, the pacts or agreements of non-concurrence, exclusivity, permanence or loyalty and post-contractual non-competition, unless they have been stated in the previous section.\n\nThe basic terms and conditions of the contracts of directors who, where applicable, perform executive functions at Corporación Financiera Alba are as follows:\n\n- Contract duration: indefinite.\n- Notice periods: fifteen days.\n- Remuneration:\n\n•Fixed remuneration: This consists of a fixed annual monetary remuneration. Amounts received from the Company as a director in their capacity as such or for any position or function in other companies or subsidiary, investee or related entities shall also be counted as fixed remuneration, the amount of which shall be reduced by the amount paid directly by the Company.\n\n•Variable remuneration: Annual and multi-year variable remuneration plans approved by the General Meeting may be established, and for which the Board of Directors, at the proposal of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, shall establish the criteria for their award. Both systems make reference to section A.1.6 above.\n\n•Remuneration in kind: The following coverage may be established for executive directors: life, accident and disability insurance; health insurance with coverage for the director, their spouse and children; and the use of a leased vehicle.\n\n- Indemnification for early termination or termination of the contractual relationship between the company and the executive director: as explained in section A.1.8 of this report.\n\n- Clawback agreement: as explained in section A.1.6 above.\n- Benefits system applicable to Directors: as described in section A.1.7 of this report.\n\nIn the current financial year, the Board has no Executive Directors, nor are there any plans to appoint any, and therefore no remuneration will be paid in this respect.\n\nA1.10. The nature and estimated amount of any other supplementary remuneration that will be accrued by directors in the current year in consideration for services rendered other than those inherent in their position.\n\n{363}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/363/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV).

The nature and estimated amount of any other planned supplementary remuneration to be accrued by directors in the current year that is not included in the foregoing sections, whether paid by the company or by another group company.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy provides that the Board of Directors, subject to a report from the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, may establish, for extraordinary reasons, a supplement for one or more of these Directors that may be paid on a one-time basis and may not exceed a total aggregate sum of 1,000,000 euros per annum.\n\nThis complement, which is intended to be a reward for the efforts and special dedication made by the executive Directors, may be established for the extraordinary achievements that have contributed to the Company's results, provided that an added value is generated for the shareholders or that a significant economic benefit or increase in equity is generated that reinforces the sustainability and longterm growth of the Company.\n\nIn the current financial year, the Board has no executive directors and therefore no remuneration will be accrued in this respect.\n\n- A.2. Explain any significant change in the remuneration policy applicable in the current year resulting from:\n\t- a) A new policy or an amendment to the policy already approved by the General Meeting.\n\t- b) Significant changes in the specific determinations established by the board for the current year regarding the remuneration policy in force with respect to those applied in the previous year.\n\t- c) Proposals that the Board of Directors has agreed to submit to the general shareholders' meeting to which this annual report will be submitted and for which it is proposed that they be applicable to the current year.\n\nGiven that the Board of Directors of the Company does not have any Directors assigned executive functions during this financial year, the updates to the fixed remuneration for this class of Director provided for in the current Remuneration Policy have not been applied.\n\nThe Board of Directors intends to submit the following proposals for remuneration before the General Shareholders' Meeting: (i) proposed approval of the Remuneration Report for 2023; (ii) proposed multi-year variable remuneration approval system referenced to the net asset value (NAV) for the year 2024 (similar to that agreed in previous years) for executives.\n\nA.3. Identify the direct link to the document where the current company remuneration policy is posted, which must be available on the website of the company.\n\n<https://www.corporacionalba.es/en/corporate-governance/remuneration-of-the-board-of-directors/> <https://www.corporacionalba.es/en/corporate-governance/corporate-policies/>\n\nA.4. Explain, taking into account the data provided in Section B.4, how account has been taken of the voting of shareholders at the General Shareholders' Meeting to which the annual report on remuneration for the previous year was submitted on a consultative basis.\n\nThe Annual Remuneration Report for the 2022 financial year was approved at the 2023 General Meeting with 99.95% of votes in favour, therefore no changes to the Company's Remuneration Policy would be deemed necessary, the update of which was also approved at the 2023 General Meeting with 99.94% of votes in favour.\n\n{364}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/364/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV).

OVERALL SUMMARY OF HOW REMUNERATION POLICY WAS APPLIED DURING THE YEAR LAST ENDED**\n\nB.1.1 Explain the process followed to apply the remuneration policy and determine the individual remuneration contained in Section C of this report. This information will include the role played by the Remuneration Committee, the decisions taken by the Board of Directors and, as the case may be, the identity and the role of the external advisors whose services have been used in the process to apply the remuneration policy in the year ended.\n\nThe Articles of Association refer to the remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors in their article 39.\n\nIn 2023, the Remuneration Policy approved at 2022 was updated regarding to the remuneration of the members of the Audit and Compliance Committee and Appointments and Remuneration Committee, taking into consideration comparable companies.\n\nThe Appointments and Remuneration Committee submitted the proposal to update the Remuneration Policy of the Board of Directors of Corporación Financiera Alba and issued the corresponding report on this proposal, which it submitted to the Board of Directors, which, in turn, submitted it to the General Meeting, which approved the update on 19 June 2023.\n\nFurthermore, the Appointments and Remuneration Committee considered that the remuneration policy established by the Company in relation to the Board of Directors has been observed during the financial year 2023.\n\nDuring financial year 2023 there were no executive directors, so the mainly remuneration paid to directors was for the directors in their capacity as such, consisting of the remuneration referred to in section A.1.3. of this report.\n\nThe Board of Directors submitted the proposal for the multi-year variable remuneration plan for executives, which was approved by the General Meeting of 19 June 2023, and implemented by the Board of Directors before the end of the 2023 financial year, as reported by the Appointments and Remuneration Committee. The Variable Remuneration Plans for 2021 and 2022 were also favourably reported on and, after approval by the General Shareholders' Meetings for these years, were implemented by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Appointments and Remuneration Committee has approved this ARR for the 2023 financial year, which contains in its section C the remuneration actually received by the Directors in said financial year, which has been submitted to and approved by the Board, which will in turn submit it to the consultative vote of the General Meeting.\n\nIn 2023, the Company did not have external advisors for matters related to the application of the Remuneration Policy of the Board of Directors.\n\nB.1.2 Explain any deviation from the procedure established for the application of the remuneration policy that has occurred during the year.\n\nIn 2023, there were no deviations from the procedure for the application of the Remuneration Policy during the financial year.\n\nB.1.3 Indicate whether any temporary exception has been applied to the remuneration policy and, if so, explain the exceptional circumstances that have led to the application of these exceptions, the specific components of the remuneration policy affected and the reasons why the entity believes that these exceptions have been necessary to serve the long-term interests and sustainability of the society as a whole or ensure its viability. Similarly, quantify the impact that the application of these exceptions has had on the remuneration of each director over the year.\n\nIn 2023 no temporary exceptions to the Remuneration Policy have been applied.\n\nB.2. Explain the different actions taken by the company in relation to the remuneration system and how they have contributed to reducing exposure to excessive risks, aligning it with the long-term objectives, values and interests of the company, including a reference to the measures adopted to ensure that the long-term results of the company have been taken into consideration in the remuneration accrued. Ensure that an appropriate balance has been attained between the fixed and variable components of the remuneration, the measures adopted in relation to those categories of personnel whose professional activities have a material effect on the company's risk profile and the measures in place to avoid any possible conflicts of interest.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the Company followed the principles of the Remuneration Policy, which have been set out in section A.1.1 of this Report.\n\n{365}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/365/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV). The logo consists of the letters \"CNMV\" in white, stacked on top of the words \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\" in white. The background is a solid dark red color.\n\nThe remuneration paid to the Directors in their capacity as such, both for membership of the Board and the various Committees, if compared to those of comparable companies, must be of moderate quality.\n\nThe multi-year variable remuneration agreed in previous years has been granted on the basis of the net asset value of the Company's shares, meaning that it has only been received if there has been a positive performance. The 2020 Plan that matured in 2023 had a positive result of €32.43/unit.\n\nIn addition, in connection with multi-year variable remuneration, this is not paid until three years have elapsed from the date the Board of Directors agrees to implement the variable remuneration system approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting, thereby verifying compliance at all times with the established conditions.\n\nAll stated circumstances ensure that the remuneration accrued are based on long-term results, which includes the Company's right to reclaim from a Director any variable remuneration received (clawback) based on the assumptions and during the period referred to in section A.1.2 of this report.\n\nAs indicated in the sections A.1.2 and A.1.6, of this report, the method of application of investment and divestiture decisions does not permit individuals whose activity could individually impact the Company's risk profile.\n\nB.3. Explain how the remuneration accrued and consolidated over the financial year complies with the provisions of the current remuneration policy and, in particular, how it contributes to the company's long-term and sustainable performance.\n\nFurthermore, report on the relationship between the remuneration obtained by the directors and the results or other performance measures of the company in the short and long term, explaining, as the case may be, how the variations in the performance of the company have influenced changes in the remuneration of directors, including those accrued whose payment would have been deferred, and how the latter contribute to the short and long-term results of the company.\n\nThe remuneration accrued by the Directors in the 2023 financial year fully complies with the Company's Remuneration Policy, having applied the items provided for therein and no others.\n\nFurthermore, the remuneration follows the principles of the Remuneration Policy referred to in section A.1.1 of this Report, which contributes to the sustainable and long-term performance of the Company.\n\nThe breakdown of the individual remuneration set out in section C below includes the amounts of the items mentioned in the corresponding points of section A above.\n\nThe performance of the entity's results does not affect the fixed remuneration of the Directors as such, the only ones who receive it, as there were no executive Directors in 2023.\n\nThe annual variable remuneration depends on the parameters described in section A.1.6 of this report and on the performance of each recipient of such remuneration, although it did not accrue in 2023, as there were no executive directors in that year.\n\nThe multi-year variable remuneration paid in 2023, corresponding to the 2020 Plan, was dependent not so much on the Company's performance as on the performance of its net asset value (NAV).\n\nB.4. Report on the result of the consultative vote at the General Shareholders' Meeting on remuneration in the previous year, indicating the number of votes in favour, votes against, abstentions and blank ballots:\n\n|                 | Number     | % of total      |\n|-----------------|------------|-----------------|\n| Votes cast      | 57,319,607 | 96.74           |\n|                 | Number     | % of votes cast |\n| Votes against   | 31,134     | 0.05            |\n| Votes in favour | 57,288,473 | 99.92           |\n\n{366}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/366/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV).

Explain how the fixed components accrued and vested during the year by the directors in their capacity as such were determined, their |\n|--|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\nrelative proportion with regard to each director and how they changed with respect to the previous year.\n\nObservations\n\nIn order to determine the fixed components accrued during the 2023 financial year by the Directors in their capacity as such, the Remuneration Policy approved in 2022, and updated on 19 June 2023, has been taken into account. There are amounts and nature are indicated in section A.1.3 of this report. With respect to the remuneration of the previous year, the remuneration of the members of the Audit and Compliance and Appointments and Remunerations Committees has changed, as the remuneration of the members and chairmen of these Committees has been increased in the Remuneration Policy, taking into account the remuneration of comparable companies.\n\nEach Director receives their remuneration in accordance with the position held both on the Board of Directors and the Committees on which they sit.\n\nB.6. Explain how the salaries accrued and vested by each of the executive directors over the past financial year for the performance of management duties were determined, and how they changed with respect to the previous year.\n\nIn 2023 there were no Executive Directors and therefore no accruals were made for the items indicated above.\n\nB.7. Explain the nature and the main characteristics of the variable components of the remuneration systems accrued and vested in the year last ended.\n\nIn particular:\n\n- a) Identify each of the remuneration plans that determined the different types of variable remuneration accrued by each of the directors in the year last ended, including information on their scope, date of approval, date of implementation, any vesting conditions that apply, periods of accrual and validity, criteria used to evaluate performance and how this affected the establishment of the variable amount accrued, as well as the measurement criteria used and the time needed to be able to adequately measure all the conditions and criteria stipulated, explaining the criteria and factors applied in regard to the time required and the methods of verifying that the performance or any other kind of conditions linked to the accrual and vesting of each component of variable remuneration have effectively been met.\n- b) In the case of share options and other financial instruments, the general characteristics of each plan will include information on both the conditions to acquire unconditional ownership (consolidation) and to exercise these options or financial instruments, including the price and term to exercise them.\n\n{367}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/367/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV).

There is no provision for remuneration in the form of profit-sharing.\n\nC– Classes of directors who are beneficiaries of the annual variable remuneration. Variable remuneration is only foreseen to be approved for Executive Directors. In 2023 there were no Executive Directors.\n\nExplain the long-term variable components of the remuneration systems\n\nA- Multi-year variable remuneration plans of which the Directors are beneficiaries.\n\n#### A.1. Plan 2020\n\nThe 2020 Plan matured on 30/6/2023, which had been approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on 08/6/2020, and which consisted of a variable remuneration system linked to the performance of the Net Asset value (NAV) of the Company, in which each beneficiary would have been allocated a determined number of units, which in the case of Executive directors totalled 100,000 units. The multi-year variable remuneration took into account the difference between the \"final NAV\" and the \"initial NAV\" of Alba. In order to establish the initial NAV and the final NAV of Alba, the valuation of the Company's assets shall be in accordance with the following criteria:\n\n- The scope of consolidation will comprise Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. and the companies in which it has a state of more than 50%.\n\n- Listed companies: the closing share price on the day of the calculation\n\n- Non-listed companies: the value determined in the report as at 30 June carried out by the independent expert.\n\n- Real estate: the appraisal value as at 30 June determined by the independent expert.\n\n-Other assets and liabilities: at book value, less the provision for the multi-year variable remuneration recognised in the company's accounts, and those of a tax nature relating to Corporation Tax.\n\nThe calculation of the initial NAV of each share will take into account the mean net asset value per share of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. during the ten stock exchange trading sessions prior to the \"initial date\" of the Plan. The calculation of the final NAV will take into account the mean net asset value per share of Alba during the ten stock market sessions prior to the \"final date\" of the Plan.\n\nThe characteristics detailed in the 2020 Plan can be found in Relevant Fact no. 2.860, communicated to the CNMV and published on 18 June 2020. The Directors benefiting from this Plan were allocated the following \"Units\": Mr Juan March de la Lastra, 30,000 units; Mr Juan March Juan, 20,000 units; and Mr Santos Martínez-Conde Gutiérrez-Barquín, 50,000 units.\n\nThe \"initial\" NAV of 2020 Plan was 64.97 euro/share, and the \"final\" NAV was 97.40 euro/share for which reason a multi-year variable remuneration corresponding to the 2020 Plan of 32.43 euros/unit has accrued in the financial year 2023.\n\n#### A2. Plan 2021\n\nThe system was approved by the General Assembly held on 21-06-2021 and was implemented by agreement of the Board on the same date. Its characteristics are:\n\n- The plan consists of a variable remuneration system linked to the performance of the Net Asset value (NAV) of the Company.\n\n- The Beneficiaries of the Plan are the Executive Directors and Directors that represent Alba on the Board of Directors of subsidiaries, investees or associated companies and any directors or personnel as determined by the Board. Each beneficiary is assigned a certain number of units, totalling 50,000 units for all the Directors.\n\n- Value of the units. Each unit will grant the right to receive the difference between the \"final NAV\" and the \"initial NAV\" of Alba. The calculation of these is the same as that foreseen for the 2020 Plan, referred to in the previous point. Therefore, the \"initial\" NAV is 80.42 euros, equivalent to the mean net value of the assets of Alba during the ten trading sessions prior to the \"initial day\" of the Plan (01/07/2021) and the \"final\" NAV will be the mean net asset value per share of Alba during the ten stock market sessions prior to the\n\n{368}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/368/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV). The logo consists of the letters \"CNMV\" in large, bold, white font stacked on top of each other. Below the letters, there are three lines of text in a smaller, white font that read \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\". The background of the logo is a solid dark red color.\n\n#### **ANNUAL REPORT ON DIRECTOR REMUNERATION OF LISTED COMPANIES**\n\n\"final date\" of the Plan, which will be the date on which the number of years established in the plan counted from the \"initial date\" have elapsed (30/06/2024).\n\nThe maximum difference between the \"final\" NAV and the \"initial\" NAV may not be more than 50% of the \"initial\" NAV.\n\n- In the event of a dilution effect caused by a capital increase, the \"initial NAV\" shall be adjusted downward by the theoretical value of the preferential subscription right. A similar adjustment will occur in the event that a resolution is passed to distribute any extraordinary dividend or any other circumstance having a similar economic effect.\n\n- Plan maturity. The Plan will mature after three years counted from 1/7/2021, which is the \"initial date\" agreed by the Board of Directors. On the \"final date\", the Company will perform the corresponding calculation and pay the remuneration along with the corresponding salary. This notwithstanding, the Company may also choose to settle the Plan through payment in shares valued at the quoted price at the close of the day before the date when they are transferred to the beneficiaries of the 2021 Plan.\n\n- The rights arising from the application of the Plan are not transferable, except when due to death.\n\n- It is a basic condition of the Plan that the beneficiary is still on the workforce or on the Board of Alba or its subsidiaries at the time the Plan matures.\n\n- The amounts resulting from the application are considered to be \"gross\" and the fiscal regime currently in force shall apply to them, with the beneficiaries paying the corresponding amounts due.\n\n- In the event that (i) the variable remuneration is paid based on data whose inaccuracies are demonstrated after it has been paid (e.g., based on any reservations in the external auditor's report that undermine the results), (ii) a fraudulent action is committed by the Director, or (iii) the Director causes serious harm to the Company due to fault or gross negligence, the Company shall have the right to claim the reimbursement of the relevant components of the variable remuneration from the Director. This claim may be executed within a period of three years of the moment when the Company made payment of the variable remuneration claimed.\n\nThe characteristics detailed in the 2021 Plan can be found in Relevant Fact no. 10115, communicated to the CNMV and published on 21 June 2021. The Directors benefiting from this Plan were allocated the following \"Units\": Mr Juan March de la Lastra, 30,000 units; and Mr Juan March Juan, 20,000 units.\n\nB- Remuneration in respect of participation in benefits or premiums.\n\nRemuneration consisting of profit sharing is not established, but there is a multi-year variable remuneration for the Directors as established in letter A above.\n\nC - Classes of directors who are beneficiaries of remuneration systems that include a variable remuneration. Multi-year variable remunerations will apply only to Executive Directors.\n\nD – Basis of the systems of variable remuneration, criteria for evaluation of performance, methods of evaluation and estimation of the absolute amount of the variable remunerations according to the current remunerations plan.\n\nVariable remuneration is based on the management carried out by the management team and the results obtained with it and the value created for the shareholders will be taken into consideration when quantified.\n\nAt this time it is not possible to estimate the absolute amount of Directors' variable remuneration under the Plan mentioned in letter A.2 of this section.\n\nE- Periods of deferral of payment or retention of shares.\n\nThe multi-year variable remuneration system provided for in letter A.2. of this section implies a three-year deferral in its receipt.\n\nF- Share option plans.\n\nShare option plans are not approved.\n\n#### G- Accounting.\n\nThe amount accrued in accounting terms by the Directors receiving multi-year variable remuneration in 2023 represented 3,243,000 euros, which are recognised in the Financial Statements under \"Staff costs\".\n\nThe amounts effectively received in 2023 in accordance with the multi-year variable remunerations are detailed in the tables in Section C.1.a.i.\n\nB.8. Indicate whether certain variable components have been reduced or clawed back when, in the former case, payment of non-vested amounts has been deferred or, in the latter case, they have vested and been paid, on the basis of data that have subsequently been clearly shown to be inaccurate. Describe the amounts reduced or clawed back through the application of the \"malus\" (reduction) or clawback clauses, why they were implemented and the years to which they refer.\n\nNo assumptions have occurred during the year 2023 which would have resulted in the reduction or claim referred, although in the Remuneration Policy and in the Contracts of the Directors the corresponding reduction or return clauses are foreseen.\n\nB.9. Explain the main characteristics of the long-term savings systems where the amount or equivalent annual cost appears in the tables in\n\n{369}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/369/Picture/0 description: The image contains the logo for the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV).

Explain, where appropriate, the severance pay or any other type of payment deriving from early dismissal or early resignation, or from the termination of the contract in the terms provided for therein, accrued and/or received by directors during the year ended.\n\nThere were no removals of Directors during the financial year 2023.\n\nB.11. Indicate whether there have been any significant changes in the contracts of persons exercising senior management functions, such as executive directors, and, if so, explain them. In addition, explain the main conditions of the new contracts signed with executive directors during the year, unless these have already been explained in Section A.1.\n\nThere were no Executive Directors during the 2023 financial year.\n\nB.12. Explain any supplementary remuneration accrued by directors as consideration for services rendered outside of their post.\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, no Member of the Board has provided the Company services other than those inherent in their position, therefore accruing no supplementary remuneration.\n\nB.13. Explain any remuneration deriving from advance payments, loans or guarantees granted, indicating the interest rate, their key characteristics and the amounts eventually returned, as well as the obligations taken on by way of guarantee or collateral.\n\nThere are no remunerations arising from the provision of advances, credits and guarantees.\n\nB.14. Itemise the remuneration in kind accrued by the directors over the year, briefly explaining the nature of the different salary components.\n\nThere were no executive directors in 2023, the only ones for whom remuneration in kind can be provided.\n\nB.15. Explain the remuneration accrued by directors by virtue of payments settled by the listed company to a third company at which the director renders services when these payments seek to remunerate the director's services to the company.\n\nThere are no remunerations of this type.\n\nB.16. Explain and detail the amounts accrued in the year in relation to any other remuneration concept other than that set forth above, whatever its nature or the group entity that pays it, including all benefits in any form, such as when it is considered a related-party transaction or, especially, when it significantly affects the true image of the total remuneration accrued by the director. Explain the amount granted or pending payment, the nature of the consideration received and the reasons for those that would have been considered, if applicable, that do not constitute remuneration to the director or in consideration for the performance of their executive functions and whether or not has been considered appropriate to be included among the amounts accrued under the \"Other concepts\" heading in Section C.\n\nThere are no other remuneration items that meet the characteristics mentioned above of a related operation or which may affect the true image of the total remuneration accrued by the Directors.\n\n{370}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/370/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV).

BOARD OF ADMINISTRATION**\n\nLadies and gentlemen, shareholders:\n\nOnce again, I am pleased to inform you on the performance of Alba and its main investees over the past year and the first few months of 2024.\n\nAs an introduction, we could say that 2023 has been, to some extent, a transition year between the post-pandemic recovery and a new global geopolitical and macroeconomic scenario, which started in 2022 with the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the notable increase in inflation in the world´s main economies, with the consequent reaction of the Central Banks via very significant increases in interest rates.\n\nIf we delve deeper into the **geopolitical situation**, the uncertainty and the level of risk have increased, or perhaps simply become more tangible, as a result of the war in Ukraine and the renewed conflict in the Middle East, always in the context of the more or less hidden tensions between the United States and China.\n\nLeaving aside the terrible cost and suffering caused by the aforementioned conflicts, it should be noted that, at least so far, they have generally remained contained in their respective geographic areas, with relatively brief one-off economic impacts outside of these regions, such as the increase in gas prices in Europe during 2022.\n\nHowever, these conflicts are far from being resolved and have the potential to rapidly escalate with global effects, making geopolitical risk very material and a real threat.\n\nThis instability could also be contributed to by the massive electoral cycle in 2024, which will involve more than 70 countries and close to 50% of the world's population, including regions and countries as relevant as the European Union, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Indonesia and, of course, the United States at the beginning of November. Although the rise of populist and/or extremist electoral spectrum, both left and right, may increase instability in certain countries or the risk of local conflicts, there is no doubt that a radical change in US economic and foreign policy could have significant implications at global level, contributing to an increase in overall geopolitical risk.\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/8 description: The image contains the number 7 inside of a white rectangle with a black border.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom Alba's point of view, its strategy of investing for the long term in a relatively limited number of holdings of significant size makes it difficult to quickly change the composition of its portfolio in the face of geopolitical events. However, Alba tries to reduce the geopolitical risk of its portfolio as a whole. On the one hand, by focusing its investments on companies that operate in stable countries with a high level of legal certainty and a political, social and regulatory environment that respects the free market and, on the other hand, with adequate geographic diversification.\n\nIf we focus on the second mentioned aspect - the **macroeconomic situation – the**  last year was marked by the evolution of inflation and the monetary policies of the Central Banks, with two very differentiated parts: the first half of the year where interest rate hikes initiated in mid-2022 continued with the inflation rates already decreasing, but still very high, and the second half without new rate increases, awaiting the evolution of inflation towards the target levels of Central Banks.\n\nLogically, such substantial and rapid rises in both inflation and interest rates significantly increased uncertainty about the evolution of the world's main economies, raising the probability of a recession during the year. However, this possibility declined over the course of the year, with economies showing remarkable resilience in terms of growth and employment generation.\n\nIt is true that the effect of monetary policy on the economy always shows a certain time lag and that there were transitory factors in inflation originated in 2021 and 2022, such as the supply chain crisis in the post-Covid reopening or the impact of the Ukrainian war on energy costs. However, macroeconomic performance in 2023 was generally very satisfactory and clearly better than overall market expectations. In fact, the two largest economies that performed worst last year - Germany and China - were affected by very specific factors, such as, in one case, the war in Ukraine and its impact on energy costs and, in the other, a real estate crisis and a slowdown in domestic consumption.\n\nHowever, we must not forget that, despite the increase in interest rates, the effect liquidity excess liquidity from previous years is still dragging on and that this monetary restriction has been still accompanied in many cases by expansive fiscal policies. Although lower than in previous years, these fiscal policies have been largely financed by the positive effect of inflation on tax collection – having Spain as an example- and \n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\nalso thanks to the fact that the average cost of public debt is still low, since interest rate increases have only had an effect on new debt issues since mid-2022.\n\nIt is precisely at this point that some uncertainties arise with a view to 2024 and beyond, since it is to be expected that the positive impact of inflation on revenue collection will gradually dissipate and, although interest rates may fall, the average financing costs of the Countries will gradually increase in a context of greater pressure to reduce public deficits - due to high public indebtedness - which will lead to less expansionary fiscal policies. And, although in general, the private sector has a substantially lower level of indebtedness than before the Financial Crisis 15 years ago, the gradual increase in financial expenses, together with the impact of inflation on household disposable income, could contribute to a certain economic slowdown in the coming years. Although it is still to be confirmed, it is possible that, to some extent, the time lag of the changes in monetary policy has been underestimated and we could see in 2024 and 2025 the impacts that had been predicted for 2023.\n\nAlthough a more detailed reference in the matter later on, it is necessary to highlight that monetary policy and, more specifically, the calendar of possible interest rate reductions have marked the evolution of the markets during the second half of 2023 and the first months of 2024 and we believe this will be likely to continue until a stable level of interest rates in the long term is settled. Clearly, interest rates have a big impact on company valuations, especially in high-growth sectors such as technology, the big player over the past two to three years. But we think that markets may not be aware of key issues such as, for example, that the possible lowering of interest rates will only occur if inflation slows and, at the same time, if economies show clear signs of slowing. Thus, interest rates would stabilize at levels above those of the last 10-15 years, which are extraordinarily low from a historical perspective. In summary, investors should never forget that the key long-term variable in the markets is companies' earnings and cash flow generation potential, which is more closely linked to general macroeconomic developments in the medium and long term than to interest rate variations in the short term.\n\nIf we focus briefly on the macroeconomic evolution of **Spain**, the most relevant data is that real GDP grew by 2.5% in 2023, in line with the growth rates prior to the pandemic and higher than those of the main economies of the Euro zone. This growth is\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\nexplained by the good performance of both internal and external demand but presents a declining quarterly evolution and a fall in gross capital creation in the second half of the year, especially in the real estate sector.\n\nThis economic growth has translated into a good **employment** performance, with a considerable increase in the number of employees - reaching an all-time high of more than 21 million people by the end of 2023 - and a reduction in unemployment to levels slightly above 2.8 million people, the lowest since the third quarter of 2008. According to the Working Population Survey, the unemployment rate ended 2023 at 11.8%, the lowest level at the end of a fiscal year since 2007.\n\nThe **CPI** showed a substantial moderation of the inflation rate to 3.1% year-onyear at the end of 2023, compared to 5.7% in 2022 and 6.5% in 2021. Core inflation closed the year at a higher level - 3.5% - but far from the 7.5% year-on-year at the end of the previous year.\n\nAs for **public indebtedness**, it stood at 108% of GDP in Spain at the end of 2023, a level below the historical peak of 120% reached in 2020. As in 2021 and 2022, this percentage fell in 2023 thanks to GDP growth, but the gross amount of public debt continued to increase, although this increase (4.7%) was slightly lower than in previous years, due to a fall in the public deficit, which fell to 3.7% of GDP.\n\nHowever, this lower deficit was made possible by the increase in tax revenues due to economic growth, the higher tax burden and, to a large extent, the positive effect of inflation, but public spending continued to increase, even above GDP growth, which could turn into a weakness if economic activity were slow down.\n\nDue to all of the above, and despite this slight improvement in the deficit and debt ratio, the level of public debt continues to be very high, which is why we reiterate, once again, the need for structural reforms that favor economic growth and private initiative and make progress in the containment of public spending, the sustainability of pensions and the improvement and modernization of our educational system.\n\nAs of the **stock markets**, they performed extraordinarily positive in 2023 after the falls of the previous year, thanks to the momentum of technology, the remarkable resilience of economic growth, the moderation of energy costs (in Europe) and, as we have already mentioned, expectations of lower interest rates; and all this despite continued and growing geopolitical uncertainties.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn fact, all of the world's major indices showed increases in 2023, except for the major indices of the Chinese markets; for example, the Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell by -13.8% in the year.\n\nWithin the main world stock markets, it is worth highlighting the performance of the North American indexes, which once again beat the record highs reached at the end of 2021: the S&P 500 (+24.2%) and the Nasdaq 100 (+43.4%) presented some of the highest revaluations due to their strong exposure to technology companies, thanks to the development of Artificial Intelligence and expectations of lower interest rates. The Dow Jones, although also at record levels, showed more moderate gains (+13.7%). The performance was similar in many European markets, such as the French CAC 40 (+16.5%), the German DAX (+20.3%), the Dutch AEX (+14.2%) and the Italian Mibtel (+28.0%), while only the British FTSE and the Swiss SMI posted gains of less than 5.0% for the year.\n\nThe **Ibex-35** also performed very positively (+22.8%), thanks largely to the weight of the financial sector - one of the sectors that has benefited most from the normalization of interest rates - and the stock market performance of companies such as Inditex.\n\nThe Japanese Nikkei deserves special mention, which was one of the indices that appreciated the most during the year (+28.2%), and in February 2024 surpassed the level of 40,000 points, a new all-time high since December 1989. Although its origins lie in a local real estate, credit and macroeconomic crisis, this 35-year span is nonetheless a warning of the long-term impact that a stock market bubble can have on investors.\n\nWithin this positive market performance, it is necessary to highlight the high influence that technology has on the performance of some indexes, among which the S&P 500 stands out, where seven stocks together represent 30% of the index and account for most of the recent gains. This high concentration reduces the representativeness of the indices with respect to the market and the economy in general, increases market volatility and hinders diversification, all in a context of continued growth of passive management.\n\nThis positive trend has continued in the equity markets in the first months of 2024, with rises in all the main world indices up to 18th March (date of approval of the 2023 Annual Accounts by Alba's Board of Directors), with Japan once again standing out with\n\nImage /page/10/Picture/6 description: The image contains the number 11.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\na +16.0% increase and the North American indices, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both rising by nearly 8.0%. All of them at new all-time highs. Over the same period, the Eurostoxx 600 rose by 5.2% and the Ibex 35 by 4.9%.\n\nIn the current environment, at Alba we maintain a high level of prudence, as we believe that market valuations may not be adequately capturing the risks and factors mentioned above. In any case, at Alba we maintain our investment philosophy unchanged, focusing on the long term, with low debt, an appropriate balance between return and risk and giving priority to companies with solid balance sheets and management models. The key to investing in the equity markets over the medium and long term ultimately lies in the performance of companies' earnings and cash generation. We believe that Alba can find good investment opportunities, even in the current environment, thanks to its long-term vision, flexibility and zero debt.\n\nTurning now to **Alba'**s performance in 2023, Net Asset Value (NAV) increased by 9.6% during the year, to €5,797 million at year-end. NAV per share increased by 7.7%, ending the year at €96.12 per share. The difference in the annual evolution of NAV and NAV per share is explained by the capital increase carried out in the middle of the year as a result of the flexible dividend.\n\nIn contrast, in the first months of 2024, through March 18, NAV and NAV per share declined by 8.1% to €5,325 million and €88.31 per share, respectively.\n\nAlba's share price rose 11.2% in 2023 to €48.00 per share at year-end, outperforming the Eurostoxx 600 (+19.2%) and the Ibex-35 (+22.8%).\n\nIn the year to 18 March, Alba's share price fell by 1.4% to €47.35 per share, compared to increases of 4.9% for the Ibex-35 and 5.2% for the Eurostoxx 600.\n\n**Alba'**s consolidated net income in 2023 was €234.0 million after taxes, compared to €436.4 million of the previous year. This decline was mainly due to lower earnings contributed by some of our investees, a decline in the fair value of investment properties, lower capital gains on asset sales and an accounting impairment at one of our investees.\n\nAs a result, Alba reported net income of €3.88 per share for the year, compared to net income of €7.37 per share in 2022.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\nThis report provides a more detailed analysis of the various items comprising Alba's income statement and balance sheet, as well as information on the performance of our main investees in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, the volume of **investments amounted to** €209.3 million, compared with €268.8 million in the previous year. The main investments made in the year were as follows:\n\n~ The purchase of an additional 1.97% stake in Technoprobe for €82.5 million, to reach 5.23% at the end of the year.\n\n~ The acquisition of an additional 2.54% stake in Inmobiliaria Colonial, for €77.4 million, to reach 5.01% at the end of the year.\n\n~ The granting of a subordinated loan to our investee Profand in the amount of €28.6 million, for the acquisition of a productive asset in the United States.\n\n~ Other financial investments, for a total amount of €20.8 million.\n\n**In addition, divestments** totaling €34.0 million were made last year, compared with €168.0 million in 2022, including the sale of financial investments in the trading portfolio and the sale of the stake in Artá Partners to its management team. This sale, which took place in March 2023, means that the holdings in Nuadi, Facundo and Gesdocument will no longer be fully consolidated as of that date.\n\nAs a result of these asset purchases and sales, Alba's net cash decreased from €110.2 million at the end of 2022 to €16.4 million at the end of 2023. Despite this reduction, the cash position, combined with the dividend and income streams received from our portfolio and Alba's borrowing capacity, gives our Company significant financial capacity to undertake new investments. Faithfull to the philosophy of prudence and long-term vision, Alba continues to analyze new investment opportunities in listed and unlisted companies, both in Spain and abroad.\n\nWith regards to **good corporate governance standards and practices**, Alba has continued its efforts to incorporate into its internal regulations and practices the latest regulatory developments and recommendations on good corporate governance.\n\nRegarding internal regulation and policies, during 2023, the Board approved a new Sustainability Policy, to incorporate best practices in environmental, social and \n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\ncorporate governance matters, without radical changes to the principles, commitments and objectives of the Policy. For the same purpose, a review of the Investment Policy was also carried out, concluding that it was consistent with the approved Sustainability Policy and that, for the sole reason of its approval, it was not necessary to modify the Investment Policy. Likewise, the modification of the Board's Remuneration Policy was submitted to the General Shareholders' Meeting for approval, to bring the remuneration of the members of the Audit and Compliance and Appointments and Remuneration Committees in line with those of other comparable companies, and the maximum amount of the remuneration of the Board Members in their capacity as such was also approved. Finally, in January 2023, the Shareholder Remuneration Policy was approved to replace the Dividend Policy, still in effect until then, with the purpose of expressly including the possibility of applying \"flexible dividends\" and maintaining the objective of an annual recurring dividend - in cash or by means of a flexible dividend - of €58,240,000.\n\nIn addition, as part of its internal regulations, the Board approved a new Code of Ethics and Conduct, which incorporates certain provisions of Law 2/2023 of 20 February, which regulates the protection of people who report regulatory infringements and the fight against corruption, although it is not fully applicable as Alba does not have the required number of employees.\n\nIn the organizational area, it is worth mentioning the modification of the agreement regulating the Investment Committee, so that up to seven members of the Board may form part of it and that all independent Board Members may form part of this Committee during part of their term of office.\n\nAs regards to gender diversity in the composition of the Board, following Recommendation 15 of the Good Governance Code of Listed Companies, the Board set in 2020, as per the proposal of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, the target for representation of the underrepresented sex on the Board of Directors at 40% of the total number of Board members and the guidelines for meeting it, this target having been achieved on the occasion of the General Meeting held in June 2021 and the same percentage being maintained during 2023 and at the present time.\n\nIn relation to the evaluation of the Board, in accordance with recommendation 36 of the Good Governance Code of Listed Companies, the Board of Directors carried out the evaluation of its performance during 2023 internally due to the fact that the previous \n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\nyear it already had the collaboration of an external consultant for the evaluation of the Board's performance in 2022.\n\nAlso, in relation to the recommendations of the Good Governance Code for Listed Companies, it should be noted that in 2023 Alba complied almost in full with these recommendations. Specifically, out of a total of 64 recommendations, 54 were applicable, of which 53 were fully complied with and only one was partially complied with, relating to the compensation provided for in Alba's Remuneration Policy in the event of termination or cancellation of the contract of Executive Directors, but which is not actually applicable as there have been no such Directors since 2020.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the following reports and documents were approved: the Annual Corporate Governance Report, the Report on Directors' Remuneration, the Statement of Non-Financial Information, the Report on Related-Party Transactions and the Evaluation of the Board, as well as other additional reports issued by the Board Committees. The Internal Audit and Follow-up reports on Risk Control and Management, Regulatory Compliance and Crime Prevention have also been prepared and submitted to the corresponding bodies.\n\nIn connection with the **distribution of profit for the year**, in July 2023 a gross dividend of €0.961 per share was distributed as a flexible or *scrip dividend*, subject to the approval of Alba's shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. This dividend included the issuance of 1,060,012 new ordinary shares to shareholders who chose to receive the dividend in shares, and a cash payment of €6.0 million to the remaining shareholders.\n\nFor 2024, the Board of Directors has proposed to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders the distribution of a gross dividend of €0.96 per share in cash.\n\nFinally, in previous occasions, I would like to end this letter by expressing, on behalf of the entire Board of Directors, our gratitude to the employees of our Company and of all our investee companies for their professionalism, enthusiasm and dedication, and to all of you, our shareholders, for your trust and support.\n\nCordially yours,\n\n Carlos March Delgado Madrid, 18th March 2024\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **MOST SIGNIFICANT DATA**\n\n#### **ECONOMIC – FINANCIAL INFORMATION**\n\n<span id=\"page-15-0\"></span>\n\n| (In millions of euros, unless otherwise indicated) | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Share capital                                      | 60     | 59     | 58     | 58     |\n| Net equity                                         | 4,786  | 4,619  | 4,205  | 4,024  |\n| Shares outstanding (thousands)                     | 60,305 | 59,245 | 58,240 | 58,240 |\n| Net income                                         | 234    | 436    | 303    | (102)  |\n| Dividends (1)                                      | 57     | 87     | 58     | 58     |\n| Earnings in euros per share                        | 3.88   | 7.37   | 5.20   | (1.76) |\n| Dividend in euros per share (1)                    | 0.96   | 1.49   | 1.00   | 1.00   |\n\nNote 1: Includes both cash dividends and share-based disbursement.\n\n# **STOCK MARKET**\n\n|                                                    | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Closing price in euros per share                   |       |       |       |       |\n| Maximum                                            | 51.00 | 57.00 | 51.50 | 48.55 |\n| Minimal                                            | 43.15 | 42.50 | 37.85 | 30.85 |\n| Last                                               | 48.00 | 43.15 | 51.50 | 38.95 |\n| Market capitalization at 12/31 (millions of euros) | 2,895 | 2,556 | 2,999 | 2,268 |\n| Volume traded                                      |       |       |       |       |\n| Number of shares (thousands)                       | 3,168 | 4,489 | 3,668 | 6,706 |\n| Millions of euros                                  | 147   | 225   | 167   | 244   |\n| Daily average (millions of euros)                  | 0.6   | 0.9   | 0.7   | 0.9   |\n| Dividend yield (on last price)                     | 2.0%  | 3.5%  | 1.9%  | 2.6%  |\n\nAlba's share price increased by 11.2% in 2023, although this was lower than the Ibex-35, which rose by 22.8%, and in line with the growth of the Eurostoxx 600, which increased by 12.7% over the year.\n\n#### 16\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/16/Figure/0 description: The image is a line graph that shows the share price, Ibex 35 (base ALB), and Eurostoxx 600 (base ALB) from December 2022 to December 2023.

On the other hand, the change in the percentage of ownership in Atlantic Aviation is due to the reinvestment of the dividend received from the Company in the purchase of shares of this company. Finally, ERM has changed its percentage of ownership because of the incentive plan of the company's management team.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **SECTOR DIVERSIFICATION**\n\nAdding together the market value of holdings in listed and unlisted companies, and real estate properties, gives the following sectoral distribution of Alba's investments (in percentage terms):\n\nImage /page/23/Figure/2 description: The image is a stacked column chart comparing percentages across different categories from 2013 to 2023.

In contrast, in this period it fully divested from the Construction and Services sector (ACS, in 2017), the Financial sector (Bolsas y Mercados Españoles, in 2020) and the Telecommunications sector (Euskaltel, in 2021) sectors. Within the Security sector, the shareholdings in Prosegur were sold in 2013 and since \n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n2019 it has again been present in this sector with the investment in Verisure. In the Technology sector, Indra Sistemas was completely divested in 2022, but invested in Technoprobe in the same year. The \"Miscellaneous\" category mainly includes holdings in unlisted companies through the Deyá Capital IV vehicles and March PE Global, varying its weight according to the different investments and divestments made, as well as the financial shareholdings in other listed companies.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-25-0\"></span>**CONSOLIDATED ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION**\n\nThe consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS-EU).\n\nAs a result of the loss of control of the private equity management company Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., the Group has ceased to exercise control over Grupo Disfasa, S.L. (\"Facundo\"), Miralda Activos, S.L.U. (\"Nuadi\") and Gesdocument y Gestión, S.A. (\"Gesdocument\"), and therefore, from the second quarter of 2023, these subgroups have ceased to be fully consolidated and have been accounted for at fair value. Therefore, the consolidated income statement for 2023 includes the results for the first quarter results of Grupo Disfasa, S.L. (\"Facundo\"), Miralda Activos, S.L.U. (\"Nuadi\") and Gesdocument y Gestión, S.A.

As mentioned above, these companies were fully consolidated until the date of sale of the private equity management company Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., and are now accounted for at fair value from the second quarter of the year.\n\nThe *Real Estate Investments* account, which includes rental properties, decreased by €16 million in 2023 to €301 million, mainly due to a decrease in the fair value of these properties. This decrease was partially offset by the purchase of several garage spaces and by improvements made to the real estate portfolio. The valuation of the properties is carried out every six months by an independent expert, with the increase or decrease in value being recognized in the income statement under the heading *Change in the fair value of real estate investments*.\n\nThe changes in *Goodwill* and *Other intangible assets*, as well as the significant reduction in *Tangible fixed assets,* were due to the exclusion of Facundo, Gesdocument and Nuadi from the scope of consolidation.\n\n*Investments in associate companies,* increased by €65 million in 2023. This increase is mainly explained by the results contributed of the investees (€161 million), as well as by the changes in their consolidated equity (€15 million), among other elements. Partially offsetting the aforementioned increases, are the impairment recorded on the Ebro Foods shareholding (€45 million) and the dividends distributed by investees (€71 million).\n\n*Financial investments at fair value with changes in P&L,* increased from €1,364 million to €1,831 million in 2023. This change is mainly due to the acquisitions made during the year for a total amount of €222 million, the increase in the fair value of financial investments for €118 million and the classification under this heading of the short-term investment held by Alba in 2022 in Inmobiliaria Colonial (€80 million), as well as, the investments in Facundo, Gesdocument and Nuadi due to the aforementioned loss of control (€57 million). Among the financial investments made, we would highlight the increase in the shareholding in Inmobiliaria Colonial and Technoprobe, for €77 and €83 million, respectively. At this point, we consider it necessary to recall that, in 2023, this heading includes all the shareholdings in unlisted companies (except for Verisure, Parques Reunidos and Profand, which are included as \n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\ninvestments *in associates*) and the shareholdings in other long-term listed companies (Befesa, Technoprobe, Global Dominion and Inmobiliaria Colonial).\n\n*Other financial investments* increased by €20 million, mainly as a result of the subordinated loan arranged in June 2023 with Profand for the acquisition of a production asset in the United States (€29 million) and, to a lesser extent, the increase in the fair value of the put option held by the Group on its shareholding in the same company, which were partially offset by the collection of receivables from third parties.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, all the assets and liabilities of Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U. and Artá Partners, S.A., which were sold at the end of the first quarter of 2023, as mentioned above, were classified under *Non-current assets held for sale.* As of December 31, 2023, there were no *non-current assets held for sale*.\n\nThe balance of *Cash and cash equivalents* decreased from €572 million to €406 million in 2023, mainly due to investments made. As of December 31, 2023, Alba's net cash, calculated as the cash position less short- and long-term financial liabilities, was €16 million, compared with net cash of €110 million at the end of the previous year.\n\nFor its part, *Other current assets* decreased by €79 million, mainly due to the aforementioned changes in the scope of consolidation.\n\n*Retained earnings and others* increased by €244 million, mainly due to the net income for the year (€234 million) and, to a lesser extent, to positive changes in the equity of investee companies (€15 million). These increases were partially offset by the effect of the flexible dividend distributed by Corporación Financiera Alba in the year detailed below, with no interim *dividend* paid during 2023.\n\nIn this regard, in relation to the aforementioned flexible dividend, the Shareholders' Meeting of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A., held on June 19, 2023, approved a capital share increase in the Company to implement the flexible dividend. On July 5, 2023, the trading period for the free-of-charge allocation rights ended, through which the Company proceeded to purchase 6,244,550 free-of-charge allocation rights for an amount of €6 million; this option was accepted by 10.5% of the holders of these rights. The final number of new ordinary shares with a par value of €1 per unit issued in the capital increase was 1,060,012. As a result of the capital increase, the share capital of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. at December 31, 2023, amounted to 60,305,186 shares with a par value of €1 each. The new shares of the Company were admitted to trading on the stock exchange on July 19, 2023.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe *Minority shareholders* item decreased from €138 million to €60 million during the year, mainly because of the deconsolidation of Facundo, Gesdocument and Nuadi.\n\nAs a result of the above, *Net Equity*, including *Minority shareholders*, increased by 3.6% during the year to €4,786 million.\n\n*Non-current liabilities* include financial debt with a maturity of more than one year amounted of €70 million, which was reduced by €92 million during the year due to the deconsolidation of Facundo, Gesdocument and Nuadi (€82 million) and the transfer to short term of loans maturing in 2024 (€10 million). Other non-current liabilities decreased mainly due to changes in the scope of consolidation.\n\n*Current liabilities*, which include both bank loans with maturities of less than one year and other short-term debt, increased from €463 million at the end of 2022 to €478 million at the end of 2023. This change is mainly explained by the higher bank debt due to the investments made, which was partially offset, once again, by the exclusion of the liabilities of Facundo, Gesdocument and Nuadi from the scope of consolidation.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT(1)**\n\n|                                                                         | In Millions of euros |         |         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------|---------|\n|                                                                         | 2023                 | 2022    | 2021    |\n| Share of net results of associate companies.                            | 160.8                | 231.4   | 245.0   |\n| Revenue and other income.                                               | 53.1                 | 166.9   | 235.9   |\n| Changes in the fair value of real estate investments.                   | (19.4)               | 1.1     | (0.8)   |\n| Financial income.                                                       | 77.5                 | 21.5    | 17.6    |\n| Impairment of assets and change in fair value of financial instruments. | 82.9                 | 173.4   | 66.1    |\n| Result from asset sales.                                                | 2.5                  | 47.5    | 1.0     |\n| <b>Total</b> .                                                          | 357.4                | 641.8   | 564.8   |\n| Procurement.                                                            | (16.2)               | (61.9)  | (66.0)  |\n| Operating expenses.                                                     | (84.6)               | (110.3) | (138.0) |\n| Financial expenses.                                                     | (13.2)               | (6.3)   | (5.4)   |\n| Depreciation.                                                           | (4.2)                | (18.1)  | (29.2)  |\n| Corporate income tax.                                                   | (7.1)                | (0.6)   | (13.1)  |\n| Minority shareholders.                                                  | 1.9                  | (8.2)   | (10.4)  |\n| <b>Total</b> .                                                          | (123.4)              | (205.4) | (262.1) |\n| <b>NET INCOME</b> .                                                     | 234.0                | 436.4   | 302.7   |\n| Net income per share (euros).                                           | 3.88                 | 7.37    | 5.20    |\n\nNote 1: This Income Statement is presented grouped according to management criteria, which explains the differences between certain chapters and the data included in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **INCOME STATEMENT**\n\nAlba's *net income* amounted to €234 million in 2023, 46.4% lower than the previous year's result. *Net income per share* decreased from €7.37 in 2022 to €3.88 in 2023.\n\nIncome under *Share of net results of associate companies* decreased by 30.5%, from €231 million in the previous year to €161 million in 2023. This decrease is mainly due to the lower results contributed by Acerinox and Parques Reunidos, which were partially offset by the greater contribution to the result of the shareholdings in Naturgy and Ebro Foods.\n\n*Revenue and other income* decreased by €114 million to €53 million in the year, mainly due to changes in the scope of consolidation of fully consolidated shareholdings. As mentioned above, only three months of the sales of Gesdocument, Facundo and Nuadi were included in 2023, whereas in 2022, six months of the sales of Facundo and Gesdocument, three months of Preving and Satlink and the entire revenue of Nuadi were included. This item also includes income from Alba's real estate investments, which increased by 16.3% in 2023, to €15 million, because of the higher occupancy level of the properties and the increase in the average rent, with the leasable area remaining unchanged compared to 2022. In this sense, as of December 31 of both years, the gross leasable area amounted to 42,420 square meters, with an occupancy rate of 97.7% as of December 2023, compared to 88.4% at the end of 2022.\n\nAccording to the assessment report performed by an independent expert, the estimated value of the real estate assets decreased by €19 million in 2023, this amount being included in the item *Changes in the fair value of real estate investments.* As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of real estate investments amounted to €301 million.\n\n*Financial income* amounted to €78 million in 2023, compared with €22 million in the previous year, due to higher interest and dividends received.\n\nThe heading *Impairment of assets and changes in the fair value of financial instruments* showed a positive result of €83 million in the year, due to the increase in the valuation of *Financial investments at fair value with changes in P&L (*€120 million) and, to a much lesser extent, to other non-current assets included under the heading *Other financial investments* and the reversal of the impairment made in 2022 on the Profand shareholding.

Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, sales would have increased by 4.2% compared to 2022.\n\nBy activity, sales of the **Traditional Business** showed growth of 2.3% over the previous year, reaching €985 million due to the aforementioned factors. Revenues from the **New Businesses** division increased by 4.9% compared to 2022, to €152 million. Finally, revenues in the **Other Energy Revenues** segment were 4.8% lower than in the previous year, at €89 million, due to the normalization of electricity prices in the Spanish market following a 2022 that saw an exceptional increase in prices. \n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/47/Figure/0 description: The image contains two pie charts.

Excluding the impact of currency variations, EBITDA would have increased by 7.9% compared to 2022.\n\nNet income increased to €141 million, 1.1% higher than in 2022, thanks to EBITDA growth and lower tax expenses, which offset higher depreciation and amortization, higher financial expenses and the higher negative impact of exchange rates.\n\nNet bank debt, excluding IFRS 16 and other net financial liabilities, increased to €138 million in December 2023, compared with €101 million at the end of the previous year, reflecting the Company's investment effort, the increase in working capital requirements and the dividend payments made. Reported net financial debt, including IFRS 16, was €181 million at year-end (representing a leverage ratio of 0.7 times).\n\n#### **Alba's shareholding**\n\nDuring the year, Alba's stake in Viscofan's share capital remained unchanged, maintaining a 14.25% interest at 31 December 2023 and continuing to be the Company's largest shareholder.\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Stock market performance**\n\nViscofan's share price fell by 11.0% in 2023 to €53.60 per share, representing a market capitalization of €2,492 million at the end of the year.\n\nImage /page/48/Figure/2 description: This image shows a line graph of Viscolan's stock market performance in 2023.

Through an extensive network of subsidiaries and brands, it has a commercial or industrial presence in more than 70 countries in Europe, North America, Asia and Africa.\n\nAs of December 2023, Ebro Foods' main markets are the United States, France and the United Kingdom, while Spain accounts for 5.1% of total sales.\n\nIn recent years, the Company has maintained a policy of complementing its investment effort in organic growth with selective acquisitions that have allowed it to enter new markets and/or strengthen its presence in certain products and segments, while divesting non-strategic businesses or those with less development potential.\n\n#### **Company's main activity during 2023**\n\nIn 2023, Ebro Foods achieved record results (excluding the exceptional 2020 financial year) supported by the containment of cost inflation, successful management of sourcing and raw material inventories and growth in higher value products (convenience products, ready meals and *premium* segments). In an inflationary context, with greater pressure on consumers' disposable income, Ebro Foods has managed to maintain or increase its market share in 2023 in the main markets and categories in which it operates.\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Most significant data                                 |       |       | 2021(1) |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|---------|\n| (In millions of euros unless otherwise stated)        | 2023  | 2022  |         |\n|                                                       |       |       |         |\n| Sales……                                               | 3,084 | 2,968 | 2,427   |\n| EBITDA                                                | 387   | 335   | 302     |\n| EBIT                                                  | 284   | 234   | 207     |\n| Net income (loss) of continuing operations(2)<br>     | 205   | 122   | 145     |\n| Total assets                                          | 3,872 | 3,900 | 3,939   |\n| Net financial debt(3)<br>                             | 570   | 763   | 505     |\n| Net equity                                            | 2,222 | 2,198 | 2,133   |\n| Employees (31-dec.) ….……………………….……………                 | 6,135 | 6,141 | 6,515   |\n| Share price (closing 31-dec.)

Likewise, EBITDA and EBIT increased by 15.7% and 21.7%, respectively, to €387 million and €284 million, representing margins of 12.6% and 9.2%, significantly higher than in 2022 thanks to stabilizing raw material costs and lower transportation and energy costs. Net income attributable to the parent company totaled €187 million, an increase of 53.2% compared with 2022, a year whose result was affected by the losses on the sale of Roland Monterrat.\n\nBy business area, there was a positive performance in both Rice and Pasta, with solid EBITDA growth and a notable recovery in Pasta. Sales and EBITDA in the **Rice** division increased by 4.9% and 7.3%, to 2,444 and €311 million, respectively, supported by the increase in capacity in ready-to-eat products, thanks to the investments made and the aforementioned progressive migration to higher value-added products. On the other hand, sales in the **Pasta**  division remained in line with the previous year, being 0.1% higher at €652 million. However, the EBITDA of this division increased by 54.6% to €90 million, with a strong performance both in fresh pasta, especially in France, and significantly driven by the growth in gnocchi, and in \n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n*premium* dry pasta (Garofalo), highlighting the increase in volumes, in a highly competitive environment, and the improvement in profitability following the containment of energy costs and the consolidation of price increases.\n\nImage /page/51/Figure/1 description: The image contains two pie charts.

The net debt to EBITDA ratio was significantly reduced to 1.5x at the end of 2023 (2.3x at the end of 2022).\n\n#### **Alba's shareholding**\n\nDuring the year, Alba's interest in the share capital of Ebro Foods remained unchanged, maintaining a 14.52% stake and remaining the Company's second largest shareholder.\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Stock market performance**\n\nDuring 2023, the Ebro Foods share price increased by 5.9% to €15.52 per share, a lower increase than that of the Ibex-35, which increased by 22.8%.

EBITDA increased by 13.7% to €22 million, mainly due to lower energy costs and operational improvements in the business.\n\nFinally, sales in the **Salt Slags** division increased by 11.6% to €86 million, supported by higher production capacity utilization. On the other hand, EBITDA fell by 3.6% to €26 million, despite higher volumes (+12.0% vs. 2022) and lower energy costs, which could not offset the negative effect of the aforementioned drop in aluminum prices. \n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/63/Figure/0 description: The image contains two pie charts, one titled \"Sales by segment\" and the other titled \"EBITDA by segment\".

The total EBITDA for 2023 is €182 million.\n\nIn 2023, the Company's net financial debt increased by 10.0% to €604 million at December 31, mainly due to investments made (€105 million earmarked for the recovery of the Hanover plant, operational improvements in the U.S. and the start-up of the Henan plant in China), the dividend paid (€50 million) and the increase in working capital and finance charges.

In addition, Alba also considers the possibility of co-investing directly in companies owned or managed by these managers, which would bring these investments closer to its core strategy.\n\n#### **Main aspects of Private Equity investments in fiscal year 2023**\n\nIn March 2023, Alba sold its entire stake in Artá Capital to the managing partners. Following this sale, Alba continues to be a core investor in the funds managed by the latter, including a commitment to contribute to its third fund.\n\nIn its Fund I (2008), Artá Capital obtained fund commitments totaling €400 million, 75% of which corresponded to Alba. In-Store Media is the only company from this fund currently in the portfolio.\n\nIn Fund II (2016), commitments totaled €405 million, 47% of which corresponded to Alba. At the end of 2023, Artá Capital had divested a significant portion of the investments made, with the following investees in its portfolio: Vitaly, Nuadi, Alvic, Satlink, Facundo, Gesdocument, Food Delivery Brands and Monbake. In the case of the latter, an agreement was reached in March 2024 for the sale of the entire stake together with the other shareholders, which is expected to be completed during the year.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, Artá is currently in the process of obtaining commitments for its Fund III from various investors, including Alba with a commitment of €100 million. At the end of 2023, the fund had one investee, the Portuguese company Ferreira de Sá, acquired in June of the same year.\n\n#### **Main aspects in investments of the fund of funds in fiscal 2023**\n\nUnder this investment strategy, Alba currently participates in two vehicles managed by Banca March (March PE Global I and March PE Global II), in which it committed a total of €25 million in each. In 2023, Alba has disbursed close to €9 million between the two vehicles.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **REAL ESTATE ACTIVITY**\n\n<span id=\"page-72-0\"></span>The rental market for offices in Madrid in fiscal year 2023 was marked by the adjustment to the new post-COVID scenario, the boost in technology, the concern for sustainability and wellbeing, the preference for strategic locations, stable prices with an upward trend in *prime* areas and greater flexibility in terms of contracts and services.\n\nThe concern for environmental sustainability and employee well-being influenced office leasing decisions. Buildings certified with environmental standards, such as LEED or BREEAM, and those that incorporated wellness-focused designs, such as natural lighting and green spaces, were highly valued by companies.\n\nDespite the work from home flexibility patterns, strategic locations in Madrid, such as Paseo de la Castellana or Azca, maintained or increased their attractiveness. Thus, the demand for office spaces in central and well-connected locations remained strong. As a result, there was an upward trend in office rental prices in *prime* areas due to high demand and the limited availability of quality space in these locations.\n\nAlba's real estate investment strategy focuses on the acquisition of office properties in *prime* areas of Madrid, buildings as a whole only, preferably leased to companies of reputable solvency.\n\nThe leasable area at December 31, 2023 amounted to 42,420 sqm and 1,038 parking spaces, with no changes in the portfolio during the year. The occupancy rate stood at 97.7% at the end of the year, compared to 88.4% of the previous year.\n\nThe value of the properties is updated every six months by an independent expert, who, as of December 31, 2023, valued them at €301 million.\n\nIncome from property leases amounted to €15 million in 2023, 16.3% higher than in 2022, as a result of the higher occupancy level of the properties and the increase in the average rent of the leases.\n\nDuring the year, investments of €3 million were made to improve leasable spaces, strengthen the image of the properties that required it and modernize the facilities, achieving greater efficiency, better compliance with ESG standards and the generation of added value in them.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\nLastly, in the last quarter of the year, the drafting of the project for the integral refurbishment of a building located at Castellana, 44 Bis (Ottea Building) was completed, and which remodel began in 2024 and is expected to be completed in the last quarter of 2025.\n\nAt year-end 2023, Alba's portfolio included the following properties: Castellana Building, 89; Castellana Building, 42; Castellana Building, 44; Oasis Building and Castelló Building, 74.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-74-0\"></span>Image /page/74/Picture/0 description: The image shows the KPMG logo.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated annual accounts.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with prevailing legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated annual accounts, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/79/Picture/0 description: The image shows the KPMG logo.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated annual accounts or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated annual accounts, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated annual accounts represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a true and fair view.\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated annual accounts.

Its basic activities include the operation of buildings under lease agreements and the holding of interests in companies through venture capital activity. Alba and its subsidiaries make up the Alba Group (hereinafter, Alba or the Group).\n\nGiven Alba's activities, it does not have any environmental liabilities, expenses, assets, provisions or contingencies that could be material with respect to its equity, financial position or results.

All mandatory accounting principles and measurement criteria with a significant effect on the consolidated annual accounts have been applied.\n\nThe directors of the Parent consider that the consolidated annual accounts for 2023, authorised for issue on 18 March 2024, will be approved with no changes by the shareholders at their annual general meeting.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/89/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The logo is in a teal color and features the word \"ALBA\" in large, bold, white letters. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white letters.\n\n- c) Standards and interpretations published by the IASB but not yet approved by the European Union.\n\t- Amendment to IAS 1.

Amendments to disclosures in the financial statements regarding supplier agreements and their effects on liabilities, cash flows and liquidity risk.\n\nThe Group's directors do not expect significant future impacts from the application of such amendments.\n\n#### **2.2. Use of judgement and estimates in the preparation of the consolidated annual accounts**\n\nThe preparation of certain information included in these consolidated annual accounts has required the use of judgements and estimates based on assumptions that affect the application of accounting criteria and policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses and obligations. The most significant estimates used in preparing these consolidated annual accounts are as follows:\n\n- The estimate of the recoverable amount of interests in associates with indications of impairment.\n- The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of certain unlisted financial assets and investment property.\n- The determination of the fair values in business combinations and the assessment of possible impairment losses on certain assets.\n\nThe estimates and assumptions used are periodically reviewed. Any change in accounting estimates following such a review or due to future events is recognised in the consolidated income statement for that and successive periods, in accordance with IAS 8.\n\n#### **2.3. Subsidiaries**\n\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated. The Group obtains control when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with a subsidiary and it has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary. Specifically, the Group controls a subsidiary if and only if, the Group has:\n\n- Power over the subsidiary (existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the subsidiary).\n- Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary.\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/91/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, bold, white letters, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white letters. The entire logo is set against a teal background and is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n• The ability to use its power over the subsidiary to affect the amount of the returns.\n\nIt is generally assumed that a majority of voting rights amounts to control. In cases where the Group manages venture capital entities or holds investments therein, internal procedures and criteria that take into consideration IFRS 10 are applied to determine whether control exists and, therefore, whether or not the entity should be fully consolidated. These methods take into consideration, among other aspects, the scope of its decision-making authority, the rights held by other parties, the remuneration to which it is entitled in accordance with the remuneration agreement(s) or the decision-maker's exposure to variability of returns from other interests that it holds in the investee.\n\nThe assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are measured initially at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. a bargain purchase) the difference is recognised in profit or loss on the acquisition date.\n\nThird-party interests in the Group's equity and profit or loss for the year are recognised as non-controlling interests within total equity in the consolidated balance sheet and as profit or loss attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated income statement.\n\nIn accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, Group companies and business combinations are fully consolidated and all their assets, liabilities, income, expenses and cash flows are included in the consolidated annual accounts after making the adjustments and eliminations relating to intra-Group transactions.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/92/Picture/0 description: The image shows a logo for ALBA Grupo March.

Ltd.\n\n(2) At 31 December 2022 this subgroup was made up of Disfasa, S.A., Facundo Blancos, S.A.U., Los Girasoles, S.A.U., Incofasa, S.L.U. and PDV Gesfasa D. S.L.U.\n\n(1) (2) (3) Alba's interests are held through Deyá Capital IV, SCR, S.A.U.\n\nAdditionally, at 31 December 2022, 53.21% of Gesdocument, 42.57% of the Nuadi subgroup and 48.8% of the Facundo subgroup belonged to other companies /\nventure capital funds in which Alba did not hold an interest, but which were managed by Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., which exercised control over said vehicles and determined what investments to make. There were no restrictions regarding management and they were exposed to variable returns. As a result of the\nforegoing, Alba considered that it had control over these subgroups in 2022.\n\nThe main changes in the scope of consolidation in 2023 relating to subsidiaries were as follows:\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/93/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, and \"GRUPO MARCH\" is in a smaller, white, sans-serif font below it. The text is set against a teal background, and the entire logo is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n*(Free translation from the original in Spanish. In the event of discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.)* Sale of the entire stake in Artá Partners, S.A.\n\nIn March 2023, the Company sold all the shares it held in the subsidiary Artá Partners, S.A., the owner of 100% of the shares of Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U. The sale gave rise to a gain of Euros 2.5 million, recognised under proceeds from disposal of non-current assets. At 31 December 2023, Euros 4.5 million of long-term receivables are outstanding under other non-current receivables.\n\nAt 31 December 2022 the assets and liabilities of these two companies were classified as held for sale.\n\nAs a result of the loss of control of the venture capital management company Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., the Group has ceased to exercise control over the Nuadi, Facundo and Gesdocument subgroups. Therefore, since the date Artá Partners, S.A. was sold, these subgroups have ceased to be fully consolidated and have been recognised at fair value under investments at fair value through profit or loss (see note 11), generating a gain of Euros 7.3 million at 31 December 2023.\n\nWhen control over Nuadi, Facundo and Gesdocument was lost, Alba held direct interests of 37.43%, 31.92% and 46.53%, respectively, in each of the companies. In addition, there were stakes of 42.57% (Nuadi), 48.08% (Facundo) and 53.21% (Gesdocument) belonging to other companies / venture capital funds in which Alba did not hold an interest, but which were managed by Artá (a company in which Alba is the majority shareholder). This meant that the percentage managed before the loss of control was 80.00% in the cases of Nuadi and Facundo and 90.64% in the case of Gesdocument.\n\nSince the sale, Alba has ceased to participate in the management of these companies via Artá and has only held direct stakes of 37.43% (Nuadi), 31.92% (Facundo) and 46.53% (Gesdocument), therefore exerting no control over them.\n\nThe fair value of the Nuadi Group was calculated by Kroll Advisory, S.L., an independent expert, and the methodology used was the same as that described in note 11 for the measurement of investments at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe main assumptions used to calculate the fair value were as follows:\n\n- Growth rate in perpetuity (g): 2%\n- Weighted average cost of capital (WACC): 12.5%\n\nIn the case of Facundo and Gesdocument, the investments had been in Alba's portfolio for less than one year at the time of the loss of control of the holdings. They have therefore been valued at their purchase price plus the profit obtained since the acquisition of the holdings. This amount is consistent with their fair value, as there have been no events that would have changed the value of the investment in the short period of time between purchase and loss of control. Therefore, due to the proximity\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/94/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA Grupo March. The logo is in a teal rectangle. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font. Below \"ALBA\" is \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The words \"GRUPO MARCH\" are underlined by a teal line.\n\n*(Free translation from the original in Spanish. In the event of discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.)* of the dates between the acquisition and the loss of control of the holdings, the fair value and consolidated net assets of the two companies are the same.\n\nThe main changes in the scope of consolidation in 2022 relating to subsidiaries were as follows:\n\n#### Sale of the entire ownership interest in the Satlink subgroup\n\nOn 31 March 2022, the sale of the Group's entire ownership interest in the Satlink Group, which at the time of the sale amounted to 28.07%, was completed. The sale amounted to Euros 48.5 million, giving rise to a gain of Euros 36.4 million recognised at 31 December 2022 under proceeds from disposal of non-current assets.\n\n#### Loss of control of the Preving subgroup\n\nIn May 2022, the Preving Group acquired all the shares of Cualtis, S.L.U.; concurrent to the acquisition, a capital increase was carried out at Preving to allow new shareholders to join the subgroup. As a result of these transactions and the entry of new shareholders, the Alba Group's interest in Preving was diluted from 24.81% to 21.41%, and it lost control over the Preving Group as a result of the loss of control of the majority interest by the venture capital management company Artá Capital SGEIC, S.A.U. and the new shareholders' agreements between the parties.\n\nSince the Alba Group's loss of control, the Group's 21.41% ownership interest in Preving has been recognised at fair value under investments at fair value through profit or loss (see note 11), giving rise to a gain of Euros 16.1 million in 2022.\n\n#### Acquisition of 37.43% of the Facundo Group\n\nIn June 2022, through Deyá Capital IV, SCR, S.A., Alba acquired 37.43% of the share capital of Disfasa, S.A. (parent of the Facundo Group) for Euros 21.9 million. The Facundo Group has its registered office in Spain and its principal activity is the production and distribution of nuts, dried fruit and snacks. The main reason for control over this group was that the venture capital management company Artá Capital SGEIC, S.A.U. managed a majority ownership interest (see business combination in note 5). Subsequently, in December, the Group sold its 5.51% interest in the Facundo Group for Euros 3.3 million, giving rise to a gain of Euros 0.1 million in 2022. At 31 December 2022, Alba held 31.92% of the Facundo Group.\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/95/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The entire logo is set against a teal background and is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n*(Free translation from the original in Spanish. In the event of discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.)* Acquisition of 46.79% of Gesdocument y Gestión, S.A.\n\nIn June 2022, through Deyá Capital IV, SCR, S.A., Alba acquired 46.79% of the share capital of Gesdocument y Gestión, S.A. for Euros 8.2 million. Gesdocument y Gestión, S.A. has its registered office in Spain, and its principal activity is the provision of tax, economic, financial, administrative, employment and accounting advisory services. The main reason for control over this group was that the venture capital management company Artá Capital SGEIC, S.A.U. managed a majority ownership interest (see business combination in note 5).\n\nIn 2023 KPMG Auditores, S.L. was the auditor of all of the companies mentioned except for Alba Europe, S.à r.l. and Alba Investments, S.à r.l., which were audited by Audit Consell Services, S.à r.l., and Alba KKR Core International, S.C.A., which was audited by Deloitte, S.L.\n\nIn 2022 KPMG Auditores, S.L. was the auditor of all of the companies mentioned except for Alba Europe, S.à r.l. and Alba Investments, S.à.r.l., which were audited by Audit Consell Services, S.à r.l., Alba KKR Core International, S.C.A., the Preving subgroup, and the Facundo subgroup, which were audited by Deloitte, S.L., and the Nuadi subgroup, which was audited by Ernst&Young, S.L.\n\n#### **2.4. Associates**\n\nEntities over which Alba exercises significant influence even though its interest therein is less than 20% are considered associates. To determine whether significant influence exists, among other situations the Parent considers representation on the Board of Directors, involvement in establishing policies and the permanence of the interest.\n\nDetails for 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/96/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Alba sits on the Board of Directors of Rioja Acquisition, S.à.r.l., a subsidiary of Rioja Luxembourg, S.à.r.l. and direct shareholder of Naturgy.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/97/Picture/0 description: The image shows a logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, bold, white letters on a teal background. Below \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white letters.\n\nThere were no acquisitions or disposals of investments in associates in 2023. Alba has increased its stakes in Acerinox, S.A. and CIE Automotive, S.A. due to the redemption of own shares carried out by these companies. As a result of these transactions, Acerinox, S.A. reduced its share capital by 4% and, therefore, Alba's ownership interest increased by 0.77%. CIE Automotive, S.A. reduced its share capital by 2.2% and, consequently, Alba increased its stake by 0.31%.\n\nIn 2022 Alba saw its ownership interest in Acerinox, S.A. increase because of Acerinox's redemption of own shares. As a result of this transaction, Acerinox, S.A. reduced its share capital by 4% and, therefore, Alba's ownership interest increased by 0.74%. The ownership interests in CIE Automotive, S.A., Ebro Foods, S.A. and Viscofan, S.A. increased through new acquisitions in 2022.\n\n#### **3. Distribution of Profit**\n\nThe distribution of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A.'s profit for 2023 to be submitted by the Board of Directors for approval by the shareholders at their general meeting, and the distribution of profit for 2022 approved by the shareholders at their general meeting, are as follows (in millions of Euros):\n\n| Basis of allocation | 2023  | 2022 |\n|---------------------|-------|------|\n| Profit for the year | 194.1 | 41.2 |\n| Total               | 194.1 | 41.2 |\n| Distribution        |       |      |\n| Reserves            | 194.1 | 41.2 |\n| Total               | 194.1 | 41.2 |\n\nIn addition, Alba's Board of Directors plans to propose for approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2024 a scrip dividend of up to Euros 58,566,264.47 (equivalent to Euros 0.938 per share), whereby the Company's shareholders may choose between (i) receiving newly issued bonus shares; (ii) obtaining an equivalent amount in cash by transferring to the Company the free allotment rights they receive for the shares they hold; and/or (iii) obtaining the cash value by transferring such rights on the market.\n\nThe dividends paid by the Company in 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n\n|                               | No. of shares<br>with rights | Euros/Share | Millions<br>of Euros |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|\n| 2023                          |                              |             |                      |\n| Scrip dividend 2023 (note 15) | 6,244,550                    | 0.96        | 6.0                  |\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/98/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Significant Accounting Policies**\n\nThe main accounting policies used in preparing the accompanying consolidated annual accounts were as follows:\n\n#### **a) Business combinations and non-controlling interests (minority interests) (note 5)**\n\n#### **Business Combinations**\n\nAlba applies the acquisition method for business combinations. The acquisition date is the date on which Alba obtains control of the acquiree.\n\nThe consideration transferred in a business combination is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred or assumed, the equity instruments issued and any consideration contingent on future events or compliance with certain conditions in exchange for control of the acquiree.\n\nThe consideration transferred excludes any payment that does not form part of the exchange for the acquired business. Acquisition costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.\n\nThe Group recognises the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair value. Noncontrolling interests in the acquiree are recognised at the proportionate interest in the fair value of the net assets acquired. This criterion is only applicable for non-controlling interests which grant present access to economic benefits and entitlement to a proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets in the event of liquidation. Otherwise, non-controlling interests are measured at fair value or value based on market conditions. Liabilities assumed include any contingent liabilities that represent present obligations arising from past events for which the fair value can be reliably measured. The Group also recognises indemnification assets transferred by the seller at the same time and following the same measurement criteria as the item that is subject to indemnification from the acquiree, taking into consideration, where applicable, the insolvency risk and any contractual limitations on the indemnified amount.\n\nWith the exception of lease and insurance contracts, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are classified and designated for subsequent measurement based on contractual agreements, economic terms, accounting and operating policies and any other conditions existing at the acquisition date.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/99/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, and \"GRUPO MARCH\" is in a smaller, white, sans-serif font below it. The background is a teal color, and there is a thin white border around the entire logo.\n\nThe excess of the consideration given, plus the value assigned to non-controlling interests, over the net of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognised as goodwill. Any shortfall, after evaluating the consideration given, the value assigned to non-controlling interests and the identification and measurement of net assets acquired, is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nIf it has only been possible to determine a business combination provisionally at the end of the reporting period, the identifiable net assets are initially recognised at their provisional amounts and adjustments made during the measurement period are recognised as if they had been known at that date. Comparative figures for the previous year are restated where applicable. In any event, adjustments to provisional amounts only reflect information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date and, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognised at that date.\n\nThe potential benefit of the acquiree's income tax loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets, which are not recognised as they did not qualify for recognition at the acquisition date, is accounted for as income tax income provided that it does not arise from a measurement period adjustment.\n\nThe contingent consideration is classified in accordance with the underlying contractual terms as a financial asset or financial liability, equity instrument or provision. Subsequent changes in the fair value of a financial asset or financial liability are recognised in consolidated profit or loss or other comprehensive income, provided that they do not arise from a measurement period adjustment. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured, and subsequent settlement is accounted for in equity.\n\nContingent consideration classified as a provision is subsequently recognised in accordance with the relevant measurement standard.\n\nThe cost of the business combination includes contingent consideration, if this is probable at the acquisition date and can be reliably estimated. Subsequent recognition of or changes to contingent consideration are recognised as a prospective adjustment to the cost of the business combination.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/100/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, bold, white letters, and the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" are in smaller, white letters below \"ALBA\". The background is a teal color, and there is a teal border around the logo.\n\n#### **Non-controlling interests (minority interests)**\n\nNon-controlling interests in subsidiaries are recognised at the acquisition date in the amount of the proportionate share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries acquired prior to the date of first-time consolidation were recognised in the amount of the proportionate share of the equity of those subsidiaries at that date.\n\nThe consolidated profit for the year and changes in equity of the subsidiaries attributable to Alba and to noncontrolling interests after consolidation adjustments and eliminations is determined in accordance with the percentage ownership at year end, without considering the possible exercise or conversion of potential voting rights and after discounting the effect of dividends, agreed or not, on cumulative preference shares classified in equity accounts. However, Group and non-controlling interests are calculated taking into account the possible exercise of potential voting rights and other derivative financial instruments which, in substance, currently allow access to the economic benefits associated with the interests held, such as entitlement to a share in future dividends and changes in the value of subsidiaries.\n\nProfit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are allocated to equity attributable to shareholders of the Parent and to non-controlling interests in proportion to their investment, even if this results in a balance receivable from non-controlling interests. Agreements entered into between the Group and non-controlling interests are recognised as a separate transaction.\n\n#### **b) Investment property (note 6)**\n\nInvestment property and buildings used for rental purposes are initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value, determined by independent experts in accordance with the following definition: \"The price at which the building could be sold under private contract between a willing seller and an arm's length buyer on the date of valuation, it being assumed that the property is publicly exposed to the market, that market conditions permit orderly disposal and that a normal period, having regard to the nature of the property, is available for the negotiation of the sale\". Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement for the period in which they arise. These investments are not depreciated.\n\n#### **b.1) Leases**\n\nDetermination of whether a contract is, or contains, a lease is based on the economic substance of the agreement at the inception date thereof. The contract is analysed to determine whether its fulfilment depends on the use of an asset or specific assets or the agreement implies the right of use of an asset or assets, even though this right is not explicitly specified in the contract.\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/101/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, with each letter equally spaced. Below \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The entire logo is set against a teal background.\n\nLeases in which the Group maintains substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are classified as operating leases. Contingent rents are recognised as income in the year in which they are obtained.\n\n#### **c) Property, plant and equipment (note 7)**\n\nIn application of IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, buildings for own use were recognised on 1 January 2004 at fair value, determined by independent experts as defined in the previous note, considering this amount to be the cost of acquisition. This increase in value was credited to equity in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe remaining property, plant and equipment are valued at cost of acquisition; interest and exchange differences are not included. Costs of expansion, modernisation or improvements which increase the productivity, capacity or efficiency or extend the useful lives of assets are capitalised as an increase in the cost of those assets.\n\nDepreciation is provided on a straight-line basis, distributing the carrying amount of the assets over their estimated useful lives, in accordance with the following percentages:\n\n|                                  | Annual<br>depreciation<br>rates |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Buildings and constructions      | 2                               |\n| Technical installations          | 8                               |\n| Furniture and fixtures           | 10                              |\n| Information technology equipment | 25                              |\n\nIf the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and its carrying amount is immediately written down to its recoverable amount.\n\n#### **d) Intangible assets**\n\n#### **d.1) Goodwill**\n\nGoodwill is determined using the same criteria as for business combinations (see note 5).\n\nGoodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently where events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Goodwill on business combinations is allocated to the cashgenerating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs which are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination and the criteria described in note 8 are applied. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/102/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The text is set against a teal background.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the assets is the higher of their fair value less costs of disposal and their value in use.\n\nIf the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the difference is recognised under impairment losses in the consolidated income statement.\n\n#### **d.2) Customer portfolio**\n\nThe relationships with customers that Alba recognises under customer portfolios are separable and based on a contractual relationship, thus meeting the requirements set out in prevailing legislation for consideration as intangible assets separate from goodwill. In general, these are customer service contracts that have been recognised in the allocation of fair values in business combinations.\n\nThe fair value allocated to customer contract portfolios acquired from third parties is the acquisition price.\n\nThe income approach was used to determine the fair value of intangible assets allocated in business combinations in the form of customer relationships; discounting the cash flows generated by these relationships at the date of acquisition of the subsidiary. Cash flows are estimated based on the sales, operating investments and EBITDA margins projected in the Company's business plans.\n\nCustomer portfolios are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The useful life is estimated based on indicators such as average length of relationship with customers or the average annual customer churn rate. The useful lives allocated to these intangible assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. The useful life of customer portfolios is between 10 and 15 years.\n\nCustomer portfolios are allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) in accordance with their respective business segment and the country of operation.\n\n#### **d.3) Other intangible assets**\n\nThese are intangible assets that were recognised in business combinations.\n\nThey are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life, which is between 3 and 60 years.\n\nOther intangible assets are allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) in accordance with their respective business segment and the country of operation.\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/103/Picture/0 description: The image shows the word \"ALBA\" in white letters on a teal background. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller white letters.\n\nIf an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of assets subject to amortisation may not be recoverable, Alba determines whether impairment losses have been incurred. An impairment loss is recognised as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value of the asset less costs of disposal, and value in use. For impairment testing purposes, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which separate identifiable cash flows can be identified (cashgenerating unit, CGU). Impaired non-financial assets other than goodwill are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to assess whether the loss has been reversed.\n\n#### **e) Investments in associates (note 10)**\n\nInvestments in associates are accounted for using the equity method from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases. However, if on the acquisition date all or part of the investment qualifies for recognition as non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale, it is recognised at fair value less costs of disposal.\n\nInvestments in associates are initially recognised at cost of acquisition, including any cost directly attributable to the acquisition and any consideration receivable or payable contingent on future events or on compliance with certain conditions.\n\nThe excess of the cost of the investment over the Group's share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill, which is included in the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nThe Group's share of the profit or loss of associates is recognised as an increase or decrease in the value of the investments, with a credit or debit to share of the profit or loss for the year of associates. The Group's share of other comprehensive income of associates from the date of acquisition is recognised as an increase or decrease in the value of the investments in associates with a balancing entry in other comprehensive income based on the nature of the investment. The distribution of dividends is recognised as a decrease in the value of the investment. The Group's share of profit or loss, including impairment losses recognised by the associates, is calculated based on income and expenses arising from application of the acquisition method.\n\nThe Group's share of the profit or loss of an associate and of changes in equity is calculated without considering the possible exercise or conversion of potential voting rights.\n\nImpairment is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the net investment in the associate with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. Accordingly, value in use is calculated based on the Group's share in the present value of estimated cash flows from ordinary operations and the income generated on final disposal of the associate.\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/104/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, and the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" are in a smaller, white, sans-serif font below the word \"ALBA\". The background is a teal color, and there is a teal border around the logo.\n\nImpairment losses are not allocated to goodwill or other assets implicit in the investment in associates derived from application of the acquisition method. In subsequent years, reversals of impairment of investments are recognised in profit or loss to the extent of any increase in the recoverable amount. Impairment losses are presented separately from the Group's share of profit or loss of associates.\n\n#### **f) Investments at fair value through profit or loss (note 11)**\n\nInvestments held with the intention of not selling them in the short term and those held through venture capital companies are included in this line item pursuant to IAS 28.18.\n\nThey are recognised at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe fair value of investments in unlisted companies was determined using either the analysis of multiples of comparable companies or the discounted cash flow method, whichever was the most suitable method for each investment.\n\n#### **g) Non-current assets and liabilities held for sale (note 30)**\n\nAlba classifies non-current assets or disposal groups as non-current assets held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale, provided that they are available for sale in their present condition subject to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets and that the transaction is highly probable.\n\nAlba does not depreciate non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale, rather it measures them at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less the costs of disposal.\n\nImpairment losses on initial classification and subsequent remeasurement of assets classified as held for sale are recognised under profit or loss from continuing operations in the consolidated income statement, unless it is a discontinued operation. Impairment losses are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill and then to reduce pro rata the carrying amounts of other assets in the unit.\n\nAlba recognises gains arising from increases in the fair value less costs of disposal in profit or loss to the extent of the cumulative impairment previously recognised due to measurement at fair value less costs of disposal or to impairment of non-current assets.\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/105/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, with each letter being capitalized. Below \"ALBA\" is the text \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The entire logo is set against a teal background and is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n#### **h) Calculation of fair value (notes 6, 11 and 20)**\n\nAlba measures financial instruments and non-financial assets such as investment property at their fair value at the reporting date of the financial statements. Details of the fair value of financial assets measured at amortised cost are provided in note 20. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the transaction date. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n\n- In the principal market for the asset or liability; or\n- In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability\n\nThe principal or most advantageous market must be a market that is accessible for Alba.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is calculated using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\n\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\n\nAlba uses valuation techniques appropriate to the circumstances and for which sufficient information is available to calculate the fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nAll the assets and liabilities for which calculations or disclosures of their fair value are made in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy described below, based on the lowest level input necessary for the calculation of the fair value measurement in its entirety:\n\n- Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n- Level 2 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input used that is significant for the calculation is directly or indirectly observable.\n- Level 3 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input used that is significant for the calculation is unobservable.\n\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, at the end of each year Alba reviews their categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant for the calculation of fair value as a whole) to determine whether there have been any transfers between the different levels of the hierarchy.\n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/106/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif letters on a teal background. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white, sans-serif letters.\n\nAlba determines the policies and procedures for recurring fair value calculations, such as investment property and unlisted financial assets.\n\nFor the valuation of significant assets and liabilities, such as investment property, financial assets and contingent consideration, internal and external valuers are used.\n\nFor the purposes of the required disclosures of fair value, the Group has determined the different classes of assets and liabilities based on their nature, characteristics, risks and fair value hierarchy as explained previously.\n\n#### **i) Loans and receivables (notes 12, 13 and 14)**\n\nThe Group initially measures the financial assets included in this category (other financial assets and trade and other receivables) at fair value, which is the transaction price. In transactions with a due date within one year for which there is no contractual interest rate, dividends receivable and receivables on called-up equity instruments expected to be collected in the short term are measured at their nominal amount, as the effect of not discounting the cash flows is immaterial.\n\nSubsequently these financial assets are measured at amortised cost and the interest accrued is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method. At least once a year, and whenever there is objective evidence that a loan or receivable is impaired, Alba carries out impairment testing. Based on this analysis, Alba recognises the corresponding impairment losses where applicable.\n\nThe impairment loss on these financial assets is calculated as the difference between their carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.\n\nImpairment and reversals thereof are recognised as an expense or income, respectively, in the income statement. The loss can only be reversed up to the limit of the carrying amount of the receivable that would have been recorded at the reversal date had the impairment loss not been recognised.\n\n#### **j) Cash and cash equivalents (note 14)**\n\nThis line item of the balance sheet includes cash on hand, demand deposits and other current highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n#### **k) Financial liabilities (note 19)**\n\nFinancial liabilities generally include loans and borrowings that are initially recognised at the cash amount received, less transaction costs. In subsequent periods they are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/107/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, with each letter taking up a significant portion of the image. Below \"ALBA\" is the text \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, sans-serif font. The entire logo is set against a teal background.\n\n#### **l) Own shares (note 15)**\n\nOwn shares are recognised as a reduction in equity. No gain or loss is recognised for the purchase, sale, issue, redemption or cancellation of Alba's own equity instruments.\n\n#### **m) Provisions (note 17)**\n\nProvisions are recognised for present obligations arising from a past event when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. If the effect of the time value of money is significant, the provision is discounted using a pre-tax rate. When discounted, increases in the provision due to the passage of time are recognised as a finance cost.\n\n#### **n) Income tax (note 22)**\n\nThe income tax expense is calculated as the sum of current tax, calculated by applying the relevant tax rate to the taxable income or tax loss for the period, less any existing deductions and credits, plus any changes in recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period. The income tax expense is recognised in the income statement, except when it relates to transactions recognised directly in equity, in which case the associated tax is also recognised in equity, or as part of a business combination with a charge or credit to goodwill.\n\n#### **o) Alternative pension plan schemes**\n\nAlba has three plans – two defined benefit plans and one defined contribution plan – which are externalised to insurance companies and require that contributions be made to a separately managed fund.\n\nThe Group recognises the contributions payable to a defined contribution plan in exchange for a service when an employee has rendered service to the Group. The amount of the contributions accrued are recognised as personnel expenses. If the contribution already paid exceeds the accrued expense, the Group only recognises the corresponding asset to the extent that the prepayments will lead to a reduction in future payments or a cash refund.\n\nWhen contributions to a defined contribution plan are not expected to be paid in full within the 12 months after the end of the year in which the employees render the related service, they are discounted using the market yield on high quality corporate bonds.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/108/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif font on a teal background. Below \"ALBA\" is \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font.\n\nThe projected unit credit method was used to measure the obligation derived from pension commitments. With this method the benefits are financed as and when they are generated, based on the employee's years of service at the Company, so that the commitment is fully funded by the end of the employee's working life when they reach retirement age.\n\nPast service cost is recognised in the consolidated income statement at the earlier of the following dates:\n\n- When the plan amendment or curtailment occurs; and\n- When the Group recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.\n\nThe discount rate of obligations and of assets intended to settle the commitments was determined considering the return on high quality corporate bonds with a similar maturity to the commitments measured, using German public debt as a benchmark.\n\nThe main assumptions used in 2023 and 2022 to measure defined benefit obligations were as follows:\n\n|                                                                                     | 2023                   | 2022                   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Mortality tables                                                                    | PERM 2020_Col_1st_rank | PERM 2020_Col_1st_rank |\n| Technical interest agreed in the policies                                           | 2.5%                   | 2.5%                   |\n| CPI growth                                                                          | 2.0%                   | 2.0%                   |\n| Pay rises                                                                           | 2.5%                   | 2.5%                   |\n| Changes in Social Security base                                                     | CPI + 1.20%            | 2.0%                   |\n| Discount rate of obligations and<br>of assets intended to settle the<br>commitments | 3.0%                   | 3.7%                   |\n| Retirement age                                                                      | 65                     | 65                     |\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/109/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Revenue is recognised when it can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. It is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.\n\nRevenue is recognised when the customer obtains control of the goods or services sold, i.e. when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain benefits from the goods or services. Depending on the commercial terms of sale, the transfer of control and risk relating to the goods may occur when the materials are dispatched from the Group's facilities or delivered to the customer. The Group takes these terms of sale into account in determining the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when control over the goods is transferred to the customer. Revenues associated with the rendering of services are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the service at the reporting date; this occurs when revenues can be estimated reliably, it is probable that the benefits of the transaction will flow to the company and the stage of completion and the costs already incurred can be measured reliably.\n\nPurchases, consumables used and changes in merchandise and raw materials, as well as work carried out by other companies, are included under supplies.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/111/Picture/0 description: The image shows the word \"ALBA\" in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The text is set against a teal background, and the entire image is contained within a teal rectangle.\n\nThe Group has not made any significant judgements in determining the recognition of the revenue of any of the aforementioned subgroups.\n\nThe Group uses the five-step model to determine when revenue should be recognised and how much revenue should be recognised.\n\n- 1. Identify the contract with the customer.\n- 2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract.\n- 3. Determine the transaction price.\n- 4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations.\n- 5. Recognise revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.\n\nRevenue associated with the rendering of services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period, provided the outcome of the transaction can be estimated reliably.\n\nLease income from investment property is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\nInterest income is recognised applying financial criteria, based on the outstanding portion of the principal, the time to maturity and the applicable effective interest rate.\n\nDividend income from investments is recognised when the right to receive it is recognised.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, in addition to the income from the lease of Alba's properties, the amount recorded under revenue includes the income contributed by the Nuadi, Facundo and Gesdocument subgroups during the first three months of the year. At 31 December 2022, the revenue of the Nuadi, Facundo, Gesdocument, Preving and Satlink subgroups was included.\n\nThe nature of the revenue of each of these subgroups in 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\n\n- Satlink subgroup: Revenues are generated primarily from the sale of buoys for fishing activities and the provision of communications services.\n- Nuadi subgroup: Revenues are generated primarily from the sale of stamped metal components, plates, electrical wiring and other brake accessories in the automotive sector.\n- Preving subgroup: Revenues are generated primarily from the provision of occupational risk prevention services.\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/112/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, and the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" are in a smaller, white, sans-serif font below the word \"ALBA\". The background is a teal rectangle.\n\n- Facundo subgroup: Revenues are generated primarily from the sale of nuts, dried fruit and snacks.\n- Gesdocument: Revenues are generated primarily from the provision of legal, employment and financial advisory services.\n\n#### **r) Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities**\n\nAssets are recognised under right-of-use assets and are classified based on the nature of the underlying asset. At the commencement date they are measured at the amortised cost of the contract, and subsequently they are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.\n\nThe lease liability reflects the fixed instalments agreed and the initial or future payments that are considered highly probable (direct costs related to start-up or penalties, among others), excluding from this calculation variable rent tied to the future measurement of a parameter. The liability is measured at amortised cost using the interest rate implicit in the lease agreement or, if this rate cannot be easily determined, the incremental interest rate payable by the Group for such an agreement.\n\nThe liability is discounted using the effective interest method and decreased by the payments made.\n\nThe Group remeasures the lease liability by discounting the lease payments at a revised discount rate, if there has been a change in the lease term or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.\n\nThe Group accounts for a lease modification as a separate lease if the modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more underlying assets; and the consideration for the lease increases by an amount commensurate with the stand-alone price for the increase in scope and any appropriate adjustments to that stand-alone price to reflect the circumstances of the particular contract.\n\n#### **5. Business combinations**\n\n#### **Goodwill generated in 2023**\n\nThe Group did not carry out any business combinations in 2023.\n\n#### **Goodwill generated in 2022**\n\n#### Acquisition of 37.43% of the Facundo Group\n\nIn June 2022, through Deyá Capital IV, SCR, S.A., Alba acquired 37.43% of the share capital of Disfasa, S.A. (parent of the Facundo Group) for Euros 21.9 million. The Facundo Group has its registered office in Spain and its principal activity is the production and distribution of nuts, dried fruit and snacks. The main reason for this business combination was that the venture capital management company, Arta Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., controlled a majority interest.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/113/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA Grupo March.

Had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2022, the Group's revenue and consolidated profit for the year ended 31 December 2022 would have amounted to Euros 29.8 million and Euros 7.8 million, respectively.\n\nThe fair value of this business combination was estimated by an independent third party. The recognition of this business combination was considered as definitive at 31 December 2022, since at the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated annual accounts the valuation had been finalised. Therefore, Group management did not modify the fair value of the assets acquired in 2023.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/114/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The MEEM estimates the value as the present value of the earnings anticipated from ownership of the intangible asset in excess of the returns required on the investment in the contributory assets necessary to realise those earnings. It is based on the theory that all operating assets contribute to a company's profitability. Accordingly, if the estimated earnings associated with a company's specific asset are dependent on the use of the company's other assets, then the estimated excess earnings of the asset should include charges for the use of these contributory assets. This method was applied for the valuation of the customer portfolio, using a discount rate of 11.50%.\n\nAs a result of the loss of control of the venture capital management company Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., the Group no longer exercises control over the Facundo Group, which is therefore no longer fully consolidated and is now carried at fair value (see note 2.3).\n\n#### Acquisition of 46.79% of Gesdocument y Gestión, S.A.\n\nIn June 2022, through Deyá Capital IV, SCR, S.A., Alba acquired 46.79% of the share capital of Gesdocument y Gestión, S.A. for Euros 8 million. Gesdocument y Gestión, S.A. has its registered office in Spain, and its principal activity is the provision of tax, economic, financial, administrative, employment and accounting advisory services. The main reason for this business combination was that the venture capital management company, Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., controlled the entire ownership interest in this company.\n\nDetails of the consideration given, the fair value of the net assets acquired and goodwill are as follows:\n\n| Cash paid                         | 8.2 |\n|-----------------------------------|-----|\n| Fair value of net assets acquired | 2.1 |\n| Goodwill                          | 6.1 |\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/115/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2022, the Group's revenue and consolidated profit for the year ended 31 December 2022 would have amounted to Euros 13.8 million and Euros 0.2 million, respectively.\n\nThe estimate of the fair value of this business combination was calculated internally by Company management, considering that there are no differences between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The recognition of this business combination in the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2022 was considered provisional, and any adjustments are to be made within one year from the date of acquisition. In 2023 Company management did not modify the fair value of the assets acquired, on considering such values definitive.\n\nAs a result of the loss of control of the venture capital management company Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., the Group no longer exercises control over Gesdocument, which is therefore no longer fully consolidated and is now carried at fair value (see note 2.3).\n\n#### **6. Investment Property**\n\nThis line item comprises buildings leased out. CBRE Valuation Advisory, S.A., a specialist in appraisals of this type of investments, valued these properties at 31 December 2023 and 2022. The valuation was performed according to the Property Appraisal and Valuation Standards and Observations Guide published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in the United Kingdom, and is based on the discounted cash flow and comparables method.\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/116/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, with each letter in a separate box. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The background of the logo is a teal color.\n\nThe methodology used to calculate the market value consists of preparing 10 years' worth of income and expense projections for each asset, which will subsequently be updated at the reporting date using a market discount rate. The residual amount at the end of year 10 is calculated applying a rate of return (\"exit yield\" or \"cap rate\") to the net income projections for year 11. The market values thus obtained are analysed by calculating and analysing the yield capitalisation implicit in these values. The projections are aimed at reflecting the best estimate of future income and expenses of the real estate assets. Both the rate of return and the discount rate are defined in accordance with the domestic market and considering the conditions prevailing in the institutional market.\n\nThe valuation method used considers each property on an individual basis, without contemplating any adjustments in respect of the asset belonging to a large portfolio of properties. For each property a rent capitalisation rate considered to be a market rate has been assumed, which was subsequently adjusted based on the following parameters:\n\n- The duration of the lease contract and the solvency of the tenant.\n- The location of the premises within the municipality (centre, metropolitan area or periphery).\n- The immediate surroundings of the property.\n- The state of conservation of the property (external and internal).\n- The distribution of the property's surface area between below ground and above ground.\n- The facade looks onto one or more streets (corner, chamfer).\n- The rental situation compared to market rent.\n\nAll of the Group's investment property is located in Madrid. Movement in this item is as follows:\n\n| Balance at 1-1-22    | 334.8  |\n|----------------------|--------|\n| Increases            | 2.0    |\n| Decreases            | (20.4) |\n| Change in fair value | 1.1    |\n| Balance at 31-12-22  | 317.5  |\n| Increases            | 3.1    |\n| Change in fair value | (19.4) |\n| Balance at 31-12-23  | 301.2  |\n\nThe increases in 2023 and 2022 mainly related to improvements to the properties and the acquisition of several parking spaces amounting to Euros 0.4 million and Euros 0.2 million, respectively. In 2022 the Group sold a building in Madrid for Euros 22 million; this sale gave rise to a gain of Euros 1.6 million.\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/117/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Goodwill**\n\nMovement in goodwill is as follows:\n\n| Balance at 1/1/2022                                                      | 79.6   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Acquisition of Gesdocument y Gestión, S.A. (note 5)                      | 6.1    |\n| Acquisition of Facundo Group (note 5)                                    | 43.0   |\n| Loss of control of Preving subgroup (note 2.3)                           | (54.5) |\n| Entry of Nuadi Group CGU                                                 | 1.1    |\n| Balance at 31/12/2022                                                    | 75.3   |\n| Loss of control of Nuadi, Facundo y Gesdocument and subgroups (note 2.3) | (75.3) |\n| Balance at 31/12/2023                                                    | -      |\n\nAs a result of the loss of control of the venture capital management company Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., the Group has ceased to exercise control over the Nuadi, Facundo and Gesdocument subgroups (see note 2.3) and, therefore, in 2023 all the goodwill that the Group held in relation to past acquisitions of these subgroups was derecognised.\n\nGoodwill arising from new acquisitions in 2022 was allocated to new cash-generating units (CGUs) arising as a result of these acquisitions.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to CGUs for impairment testing purposes. Goodwill is allocated to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination from which the goodwill arose.\n\nThe Group tests goodwill for impairment at the end of each reporting period, or earlier if there are indications of impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy described in note 4.d.1. At 31 December 2023 it was not necessary to perform an impairment analysis as the goodwill had been fully derecognised. No impairment losses were recognised on goodwill in 2022.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the various CGUs was determined on the basis of fair value calculations, based on the valuation report prepared by the independent external appraiser, Kroll Advisory, S.L. The method used to determine the recoverable amount was based on the discounted future cash flow method.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/120/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, and the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" are in a smaller, white, sans-serif font below the word \"ALBA\". The background is a teal rectangle.\n\nFinancial projections (sales, EBITDA, investments, etc.) are based on the budgets (if any are available) and business plans of the companies themselves (which are the same as the CGUs), approved by their respective boards of directors. These projections are not published and were presented to the Group at board meetings. In any case, the reasonableness of the projections prepared by the companies is contrasted with different market comparables and the Group's own opinion based on its past experience. Financial projections are made for a fiveyear period.\n\nThe key valuation variables are as follows: Discount rate (WACC) and perpetual growth rate (g):\n\n- The WACC is calculated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) generally accepted by the financial community, and on the basis of market variables obtained through Bloomberg, such as the rate of return on the 10-year bond or levered beta with respect to the benchmark stock market index. In addition, various internal estimates are used, such as: the spread for the Company's noncurrent debt in respect of the 10-year bond, the tax rate (same as for the cash flows used in the terminal value calculation) and the target capital structure.\n- The perpetual growth rate is calculated based on each company and the market in which it operates.\n\n#### **9. Other Intangible Assets**\n\nAs a result of the loss of control of the venture capital management company Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., the Group has ceased to exercise control over the Nuadi, Facundo and Gesdocument subgroups (see note 2.3) and, therefore, in 2023 all the intangible assets that the Group held in relation to these subgroups were derecognised.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, all intangible assets comprised other intangible assets in the amount of Euros 0.1 million, of which Euros 0.4 million corresponds to cost and Euros 0.3 million to accumulated amortisation.\n\nThe amortisation expense for 2023, up to the loss of control, amounted to Euros 2.4 million.\n\nDetails of the cost and accumulated amortisation of each class of intangible asset at 31 December 2022 were as follows:\n\n|                          | Trademarks | Customer portfolio | Other intangible assets | Total  |\n|--------------------------|------------|--------------------|-------------------------|--------|\n| Cost                     | 18.5       | 101.5              | 19.9                    | 139.9  |\n| Accumulated amortisation | -          | (14.7)             | (1.5)                   | (16.2) |\n|                          | 18.5       | 86.8               | 18.4                    | 123.7  |\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/121/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The word \"ALBA\" is in large, bold, white letters. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white letters. The background is a teal color.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, Alba recognised an impairment loss of Euros 45.2 million on the ownership interest in Ebro Foods, S.A. Alba also reversed in full the impairment of the interest in Profand Fishing Holding, S.L. of Euros 3.1 million recognised in 2022.\n\nProfand Fishing Holding, S.L. was valued by Kroll Advisory, S.L., an independent expert, which has issued its corresponding report. The method used by the independent expert to determine the recoverable amount of this investment is based on discounted future cash flows.\n\nFinancial projections (sales, EBITDA, investments, etc.) are based on the budgets and business plans of the company itself, approved by its Board of Directors. These projections are not published and are presented to Alba at board meetings. The financial projections used in the valuation were for five years. In addition, the reasonableness of the Company's projections has been tested against various market comparables.\n\nKey valuation variables: discount rate (WACC) and perpetual growth rate (g).\n\n- The WACC rate has been calculated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) adjusted by an additional risk premium. The discount rate was calculated after tax.\n- The perpetual growth rate has been calculated on the basis of a normalised cash flow based on the explicit projection of the last year (2028).\n\nThe most significant assumptions used in the valuation of Profand Fishing Holding, S.L. in 2023 were as follows:\n\n|                        | Profand Fishing Holding, S.L. |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Perpetual growth rate  | 2.0%                          |\n| Discount rate (WACC)   | 9.0%                          |\n| Capital structure:     |                               |\n| Capital                | 72.0%                         |\n| Debt                   | 28.0%                         |\n| Equity ratio           | 10.4%                         |\n| Cost of debt after tax | 4.7%                          |\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/125/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

In these cases Alba's Investment Department calculates the value in use of each investment, which was reviewed by the Finance Department without involving any independent experts. The discounted cash flow method is used, subsequently subtracting the amount of net debt and non-controlling interests. The assumptions used in 2023 were as follows:\n\n|                                  | Acerinox, S.A. | Ebro Foods, S.A. |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|------------------|\n| Perpetual growth rate            | 1.8%           | 1.5%             |\n| Discount rate (WACC)             | 9.4%           | 7.2%             |\n| Capital structure:               |                |                  |\n| Capital                          | 80%            | 80%              |\n| Debt                             | 20%            | 20%              |\n| Equity ratio                     | 10.7%          | 8.0%             |\n| Cost of debt after tax           | 4.4%           | 3.9%             |\n| Estimated value in use (€/share) | 13.34          | 16.60            |\n\nFinancial projections (sales, EBITDA, investments, etc.) are based, where available, on the annual budgets and business plans of the investees themselves approved by their respective boards of directors. In the event of any subsequent updates or reviews of these business plans by the companies themselves, the latest available version is used. In most cases the budgets and business plans of the investees are internal and have not been announced to the market. In any case, the reasonableness of the projections is contrasted with and supplemented by consensus estimates available through platforms such as Bloomberg and Factset, historical data and the opinion of Alba's own team based on its past experience.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/126/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The entire logo is contained within a teal rectangle.\n\nIn theory, no adjustments are made to the projections prepared by the companies or to consensus estimates. However, it may be necessary to use internal estimates prepared by Alba in certain situations:\n\n- When the existing projections, either those prepared by the companies themselves or consensus estimates, do not cover the minimum projected period required, established as at least five years, and it is necessary to extend the estimate to this minimum period.\n- When the analysts' consensus sample is considered to be insufficiently representative because it consists of too few estimates. In general, the number of analysts that contribute to consensus estimates declines as the period gets longer, and the consensus ceases to be representative in the final years of the explicit period.\n- Moreover, consensus estimates tend to be significant for sales and EBITDA, but less so for other relevant cash flow variables such as investments, the tax rate or the change in working capital. For these variables, own estimates are prepared based on a representative sample of analysts' estimates, the company's history, and the knowledge acquired by Alba through its presence on the respective boards of directors and its past experience in the company or similar companies.\n- All internal estimates are contrasted with the Company's historical data and analysts' reports, where appropriate.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 financial estimates with a time horizon of five years (2024-2028) were used for all the associates analysed, subsequently calculating a terminal value on the basis of this explicit five-year period.\n\nA summary of the main assumptions applied in the financial projections used in the explicit valuation period (2024-2028) for Acerinox, S.A. and Ebro Foods, S.A. is as follows:\n\n- Revenue growth: Ebro Foods, S.A. shows moderate growth in the projected period. The expected cumulative annual growth rate for revenues in the explicit period is in line with the perpetual growth rate used. Conversely, Acerinox, S.A. reflects the dynamics of the cyclical sector in which it operates and, after the record results posted in 2022, revenues are expected to fall steadily until they return to normal levels.\n- EBITDA margins: after the decline suffered in 2022, Ebro Foods, S.A. returned to profitability in 2023 thanks to more stable raw materials prices and lower transport and energy costs. A slight fall is foreseen in 2024 and 2025 before a return to normal levels. In Acerinox, S.A., the margin is expected to contract sharply in the 2023-2026 period until it reaches a normalised level in line with the historical average, and remain stable in the following years.\n\nThe deviations between the revenue and EBITDA margin growth projections for Acerinox, S.A. and Ebro Foods, S.A. estimated for 2023 in the 2022 financial valuation and the results actually obtained by both associates in 2023 are shown below:\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/127/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, and the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" are in a smaller, white, sans-serif font below the word \"ALBA\". The background is a teal color, and there is a teal border around the logo.\n\n|                         | Ebro Foods, S.A. | Acerinox, S.A. |\n|-------------------------|------------------|----------------|\n| Growth in sales         | +4.7%            | +3.7%          |\n| Change in EBITDA margin | -1.0 p.p.        | -0.3 p.p.      |\n\nIn the case of Ebro Foods, in the valuation exercise carried out based on analysts' consensuses in December 2022, the amount of revenues estimated for 2023 was 4.7% lower than those reported. On the other hand, the EBITDA margin estimated for 2023 at December 2022 was 1.0 p.p. higher than that reported in 2023.\n\nIn the case of Acerinox, the amount of 2023 revenues estimated in the December 2022 valuation exercise, based on analysts' consensuses, was 3.7% lower than those reported at the end of 2023. On the other hand, the EBITDA margin estimated for 2023 at December 2022 was 0.3 p.p. higher than that reported in 2022.\n\nThe differences between the estimated and the actual results of Acerinox, S.A. and Ebro Foods, S.A. in 2023 have different causes. In the case of Acerinox, S.A., the cyclical, volatile nature of the international stainless steel market generally makes it difficult for both the company and analysts to draw up entirely accurate financial projections. In the case of Ebro Foods, S.A., the figures for 2023 were undermined by expectations of higher demand than that which materialised during the year, a difficult factor to foresee when the projections were drawn up.\n\n- Investments (expressed as a percentage of sales): these are projected to remain stable in the explicit period in both companies, in line with the historical average. Historical averages do not include acquisitions and, likewise, the financial projections do not take into consideration acquisitions or sales of businesses.\n- The tax rate applied ranges from 27.0% to 27.5%, as both companies have activities in jurisdictions where tax rates are higher than those in Spain (25.0%).\n- The change in working capital assumes convergence with the historical data.\n\nThe WACC discount rate is calculated on the basis of the CAPM generally accepted by the financial community and based on the calculation of the following parameters:\n\n• The CAPM —a method generally accepted by the investment community to calculate the expected return on an investment in an asset based on the risk assumed— is used to calculate the equity ratio. The variables necessary to calculate the return on equity were determined as follows:\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/128/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The text is set against a teal background, and the entire logo is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n- Risk-free rate: since the companies under analysis are of Spanish origin (Acerinox, S.A. and Ebro Foods, S.A.), the yield on the Spanish 10-year bond at the time of valuation is taken as the benchmark.\n- Beta: calculated as the average of the betas of each of the companies with respect to the benchmark index (Ibex 35). The average of the betas calculated for different periods (one, three and five years) and different time frames (daily, weekly or monthly correlation) are used for the calculation.\n- Market risk premium: historically calculated as a spread of 500 basis points over the risk-free rate used.\n- Specific risk premium: an additional risk premium is added to the equity ratio in order to capture the higher risk of low liquidity of shares, for example. This additional risk premium is strictly based on Alba's internal estimates and contributes to raising the cost of equity to levels higher than would have resulted from the direct application of the WACC formula which, in Alba's view, would result in discount rates that are too low in an environment of rising interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty. This risk premium has a similar effect to using an average historical return versus present value in the risk-free rate.\n- The variables necessary to calculate the cost of debt after tax were calculated as follows:\n\t- Risk-free rate: the greater of the yield of the Spanish 10-year bond or the Euribor 10-year swap is conservatively used to calculate the cost of debt. Both figures are obtained from public market sources (Bloomberg and/or Factset) when performing the valuations.\n\t- Long-term credit spread: Drawing on its experience, Alba uses a different spread for each company based on its level of risk. This spread ranges between 200 and 350 basis points depending on the company. In addition, the resulting cost of debt is compared with the actual data of the investees (always lower than Alba's estimates) and with the available analysts' consensus.\n\t- Tax rate: To calculate the cost of debt after tax, the same tax rate is used as the rate used to calculate the free cash flows for the terminal value of discounted cash flows. This rate is normally the general corporate income tax rate applicable to each company in Spain, adjusted in some cases for the estimated weight of activities in different jurisdictions.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/129/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The entire logo is set against a teal background, and the text is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n• Based on the calculation of the equity ratio and the cost of debt after tax, the WACC is calculated by assuming a weighting of debt and equity following a target capital structure for each company.\n\nIn the valuations carried out at 31 December 2023, the cost of equity varies by company, between 8.0% (Ebro Foods, S.A.) and 10.7% (Acerinox, S.A.), while the WACC rate ranges from 7.2% (Ebro Foods, S.A.) to 9.4% (Acerinox, S.A.). These discount rates are in line with those used in previous years' valuations for these companies and have first been contrasted with the available analyst estimates and, more generally, with the historical information and experience of Alba.\n\nA comparison of the equity ratio and 10-year bond yield with those in the prior year for investees with indications of impairment in 2023 is shown below:\n\n| Acerinox, S.A.     | 2023  | 2022  |\n|--------------------|-------|-------|\n| Cost of equity     | 10.7% | 10.6% |\n| 10-year bond yield | 3.0%  | 3.3%  |\n| Ebro Foods, S.A.   | 2023  | 2022  |\n| Cost of equity     | 8.0%  | 7.8%  |\n| 10-year bond yield | 3.0%  | 3.3%  |\n\nAfter a significant increase in interest rates from mid-2022 and during 2023, the lower yield on the 10-year bond as of December 2023 reflects the expectation of a fall in rates in 2024. The beta coefficients and market risk premiums of associates remained virtually unchanged. However, the equity ratio of Acerinox, S.A. and Ebro Foods, S.A. rose with respect to the previous year's valuation due to the changes made to the specific risk premium, which showed the following progression compared to the previous year:\n\n|                  | 2023 | 2022 |\n|------------------|------|------|\n| Acerinox, S.A.   | 2.9% | 2.5% |\n| Ebro Foods, S.A. | 1.5% | 1.0% |\n\nIn 2023, an increase commensurate with the fall in the Spanish 10-year bond yield was applied due to the expectation that interest rates would drop in 2024.\n\nAs indicated, applying this specific risk premium raises the cost of equity, thereby increasing the discount rate (WACC). To confirm the reasonableness of the resulting discount rates, Alba contrasts them with those used by analysts for each of the companies.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/130/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The logo is in a teal color and features the word \"ALBA\" in large, bold, sans-serif font. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, sans-serif font. The entire logo is enclosed in a teal border.\n\nIn order to calculate the terminal value, a normalised cash flow is used based on the explicit projection for the last year. This normalisation focuses exclusively on the long-term sustainable EBITDA margin assumption, since the other variables either do not have an impact (for example, it is always assumed that investments and depreciation are equal in the terminal value), they do not vary with respect to the explicit projections (for example, the tax rate remains constant throughout the explicit period) or they have a limited impact given that there are no significant variations between both.\n\nThe long-term sustainable EBITDA margin is estimated internally based on the projections used in the explicit period, the historical information available (for comparison) and the experience of Alba's team. The margin used in estimating cash flows for the terminal value is lower or, at most, stable with respect to the explicit period. If the estimated margin used to calculate long-term sustainable EBITDA were substantially higher than that of the last explicit year, it would indicate that the Company has not reached a sufficient level of maturity or stability and would lead us to reconsider our estimate of the terminal EBITDA margin or to extend the explicit projection period until that level were reached.\n\nAs in all the projections made for these valuations, the estimation and justification of these variables is contrasted with historical information and with a significant sample of recent analyst reports.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the perpetual growth rate ranged from 1.5% to 1.8% per annum, in line with the most recent valuations of these same companies in the past. This variable was also contrasted with a significant sample of recent analyst reports and, as previously commented, there were no significant variations compared to previous valuations.\n\nIn 2023, the following sensitivity analysis was performed:\n\n|                                                          | Acerinox, S.A. | Ebro Foods, S.A. |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------------|\n| Discount rate (WACC)                                     |                |                  |\n| Rate used in 2023                                        | 9.4%           | 7.2%             |\n| Rate to equal the carrying amounts                       | 9.7%           | 7.2%             |\n| Perpetual growth                                         |                |                  |\n| Rate used in 2023                                        | 1.8%           | 1.5%             |\n| Rate to equal the carrying amounts                       | 1.2%           | 1.5%             |\n| EBITDA margin used to calculate terminal value           |                |                  |\n| Rate used in 2023                                        | 8.8%           | 12.0%            |\n| Margin to equalize the carrying amounts                  | 8.5%           | 12.0%            |\n| Variation in total sales to equal the carrying amounts   | -6.3%          | -                |\n| Variation in EBITDA margin to equal the carrying amounts | -0.2%          | -                |\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/131/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The text is set against a teal background.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, Alba recognised an impairment loss of Euros 3.1 million on the ownership interest in Profand Fishing Holding, S.L.\n\nProfand Fishing Holding, S.L. was valued by Kroll Advisory, S.L., an independent expert, which issued its corresponding report. The method used by the independent expert to determine the recoverable amount of this investment was based on discounted future cash flows.\n\nFinancial projections (sales, EBITDA, investments, etc.) were based on the budgets and business plans of the company itself, approved by its Board of Directors. These projections are not published and are presented to Alba at board meetings. The financial projections used in the valuation were for five years. In addition, the reasonableness of the Company's projections was tested against various market comparables.\n\nKey valuation variables: discount rate (WACC) and perpetual growth rate (g).\n\n- The WACC rate was calculated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) adjusted by an additional risk premium.

The assumptions used in 2022 were as follows:\n\n|                                  | Acerinox, S.A. | CIE Automotive, S.A. | Ebro Foods, S.A. |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|\n| Perpetual growth rate            | 2.0%           | 2.0%                 | 1.5%             |\n| Discount rate (WACC)             | 9.4%           | 8.6%                 | 7.1%             |\n| Capital structure:               |                |                      |                  |\n| Capital                          | 80.0%          | 80.0%                | 80.0%            |\n| Debt                             | 20.0%          | 20.0%                | 20.0%            |\n| Equity ratio                     | 10.6%          | 9.6%                 | 7.8%             |\n| Cost of debt after tax           | 4.6%           | 4.8%                 | 4.1%             |\n| Estimated value in use (€/share) | 15.54          | 33.17                | 18.64            |\n\nThe method used to calculate value in use in 2022 was the same as that used in 2023 described above in note 10 (a), \"Investments in associates in 2023\".\n\nA summary of the main assumptions applied in the financial projections used in the explicit valuation period (2023-2027) for Acerinox, S.A., CIE Automotive, and Ebro Foods, S.A. is as follows: S.A.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/135/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" which are in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The text is set against a teal background, and the entire logo is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n• Revenue growth: CIE Automotive, S.A. and Ebro Foods, S.A. show moderate growth in the projected period. Their expected cumulative annual revenue growth in the explicit period is slightly higher than the perpetual growth rate used in each case; growth is higher at the start of the period and converges with the perpetual growth rate in subsequent years. The higher initial growth at CIE Automotive, S.A. is due to the expected recovery in global car production, while at Ebro Foods, S.A. it is due to the strength of particularly resilient demand in periods of macroeconomic uncertainty, as well as the expected rise in prices in the first few years in an inflationary environment.\n\nConversely, Acerinox, operating in a cyclical sector and having reached its all-time sales record last year, expects a steady fall in revenues until normal levels are reached.\n\n• EBITDA margins: at Ebro Foods, S.A., after the drop in profitability recorded in 2022 in an environment of high raw material prices and other costs (energy, transport, etc.), slight growth is projected to reach a normalised level in line with the historical period (2015–2021) and at CIE Automotive, S.A., as it is currently at historical average profitability, margins are projected to remain stable. At Acerinox, S.A., the margin is expected to contract sharply in 2023 to a normalised level and remain stable in the following years.\n\nThe deviations between the 2022 revenue and EBITDA margin growth projections for Acerinox, S.A. and Ebro Foods, S.A. estimated in the 2021 financial valuation and the results actually obtained by both associates in 2022 are shown below:\n\n|                         | Ebro Foods, S.A. | Acerinox, S.A. |\n|-------------------------|------------------|----------------|\n| Growth in sales         | +17.6%           | +18.3%         |\n| Change in EBITDA margin | -1.4 p.p.        | -0.4 p.p.      |\n\nIn the case of Ebro Foods, the 2022 revenues estimated in the December 2021 valuation exercise, based on the analysts' consensuses, was 17.6% lower than those reported at the end of 2022. On the other hand, the 2022 EBITDA margin estimated at December 2021 was 1.4 p.p. higher than that reported in 2022.\n\nIn the case of Acerinox, the 2022 revenues estimated in the December 2021 valuation exercise, based on the analysts' consensuses, was 18.3% lower than those reported at the end of 2022. On the other hand, the 2022 EBITDA margin estimated at December 2021 was 0.4 p.p. higher than that reported in 2022.\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/136/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA Grupo March. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif letters on a teal background. Below \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white letters.\n\nThe differences between the estimated and actual financial figures recorded by Acerinox, S.A. and Ebro Foods, S.A. had different causes. In the case of Acerinox, the cyclical, volatile nature of the international stainless steel market generally made it difficult for both the company and analysts to draw up entirely accurate financial projections. The figures for Ebro Foods in 2022 were mainly affected by price increases during the year to pass on high cost and raw material inflation to the end customer, a positive exchange rate trend and a corporate transaction, all of which were difficult to foresee at the start of the year, when the projections were made.\n\n- Investments (expressed as a percentage of sales): these are projected to remain stable in the explicit period in the three companies, in line with the historical average. Historical averages do not include acquisitions and, likewise, the financial projections do not take into consideration acquisitions or sales of businesses.\n- The tax rate applied ranges from the general Spanish income tax rate of 25.0% to 27.5% for companies operating in jurisdictions with higher tax rates.\n- The variation in working capital generally has little impact on these projections, and in any case remains in line with historical data.\n\nIn the valuations carried out at 31 December 2022, the cost of equity varies by company, ranging from 7.8% (Ebro Foods, S.A.) to 10.6% (Acerinox, S.A.), while the WACC rate ranges from 7.1% (Ebro Foods, S.A.) to 9.4% (Acerinox, S.A.). In the case of CIE Automotive, S.A., both figures were within the indicated ranges, with a cost of equity of 9.6% and a WACC of 8.6%. These discount rates were in line with those used in previous years' valuations for these companies and were contrasted first with the available analyst estimates and, more generally, with the historical information and experience of Alba.\n\nThe 10-year bond yield and the equity ratio for investees with indications of impairment in each of the periods are shown below:\n\n|                      | 2022  | 2021  |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|\n| Acerinox, S.A.       |       |       |\n| Cost of equity       | 10.6% | 10.0% |\n| 10-year bond yield   | 3.3%  | 0.7%  |\n| Ebro Foods, S.A.     |       |       |\n| Cost of equity       | 7.8%  | 7.5%  |\n| 10-year bond yield   | 3.3%  | 0.7%  |\n| CIE Automotive, S.A. |       |       |\n| Cost of equity       | 9.6%  | n/a   |\n| 10-year bond yield   | 3.3%  | 0.7%  |\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The logo is in a teal rectangle. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font. Below \"ALBA\" is the text \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font.\n\nThe equity ratios of Acerinox and Ebro (CIE Automotive was not valued in 2021 as it did not show indications of impairment) increased compared to the valuation performed in 2021, mainly due to the increase in interest rates reflected in the higher yield on the Spanish 10-year bond, as both the betas and the market risk premiums of the associates remained virtually unchanged.\n\nHowever, the rise in equity was less than the rise in the Spanish 10-year bond yield due to changes made to the specific risk premium, the details of which are shown below:\n\n|                      | 2022 | 2021 |\n|----------------------|------|------|\n| Acerinox, S.A.       | 2.5% | 4.5% |\n| Ebro Foods, S.A.     | 1.0% | 3.5% |\n| CIE Automotive, S.A. | 2.5% | n/a  |\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the perpetual growth rate ranged from 1.5% to 2.0% per annum, with no variations compared to the most recent valuations of these same companies in the past. This variable was also contrasted with a significant sample of recent analyst reports and, as previously commented, there were no significant variations compared to previous valuations.\n\nIn 2022, the following sensitivity analysis was performed:\n\n|                                                     | Acerinox, S.A. | CIE Automotive, S.A. | Ebro Foods, S.A. |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|\n| Discount rate (WACC)                                |                |                      |                  |\n| Rate used in 2022                                   | 9.4%           | 8.6%                 | 7.1%             |\n| Rate to equal the carrying amounts                  | 10.9%          | 10.2%                | 7.1%             |\n| Perpetual growth                                    |                |                      |                  |\n| Rate used in 2022                                   | 2.0%           | 2.0%                 | 1.5%             |\n| Rate to equal the carrying amounts                  | -1.0%          | 0.0%                 | 1.4%             |\n| EBITDA margin used to calculate terminal value      |                |                      |                  |\n| Rate used in 2022                                   | 9.0%           | 16.5%                | 13.0%            |\n| Margin to equalize the carrying amounts             | 7.5%           | 13.8%                | 12.9%            |\n| Variation in total sales to equal carrying amount   | -14.1%         | -15.9%               | -0.5%            |\n| Variation in EBITDA margin to equal carrying amount | -1.0%          | -2.0%                | -0.1%            |\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/138/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The text is set against a teal background, and the entire logo is enclosed in a teal rectangle.\n\nMovement during 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\n\n| Balance at 01/01/22                                    | 973.3   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Additions                                              | 210.3   |\n| Changes in fair value                                  | 164.5   |\n| Other movements                                        | 16.1    |\n| Balance at 31/12/2022                                  | 1,364.2 |\n| Additions                                              | 222.1   |\n| Changes in fair value                                  | 118.4   |\n| Reclassification from “other current financial assets” | 79.8    |\n| Reclassification to “other current financial assets”   | (10.7)  |\n| Other movements                                        | 57.2    |\n| Balance at 31/12/2023                                  | 1,831.0 |\n\nIn 2023, additions mainly reflect acquisitions of holdings in Technoprobe Spa (Euros 82.5 million), Inmobiliaria Colonial, SOCIMI,S.A. (Euros 77.4 million) and Artá Capital Fund III F.C.R. (Euros 8.7 million). The Group also reinvested the dividend received from Atlantic Aviation FBO Inc. amounting to Euros 44 million in the company itself.\n\nOther movements include the recognition under this heading of the ownership interest in the Nuadi, Facundo and Gesdocument subgroups following the loss of control over them (see note 2.3).\n\nThe main increases in fair value in 2023 were in the ownership interests in Technoprobe Spa, Atlantic Aviation Holding Corporation and Inmobiliaria Colonial, SOCIMI, S.A. Conversely, the main decrease was in the interest in Befesa Holding, S.à.r.l. In 2022, the main increases were in the ownership interests in Atlantic Aviation Holding Corporation and Nature Topco UK Limited, partially offset by the decrease in value of the interests in Befesa Holding, S.à.r.l. and Global Dominion Access, S.A.\n\nIn 2023, the Group did not dispose of any investments held at 31 December 2022. However, it has classified its short-term investment in Inmobiliaria Colonial, SOCIMI, S.A. amounting to Euros 79.8 million under this heading.\n\nIn 2022, the additions related mainly to the acquisitions of shares in Technoprobe Spa and Befesa Holding, S.à.r.l. for Euros 115.2 million and Euros 57.5 million, respectively. Other movements included the recognition of the ownership interest in the Preving subgroup as a result of the loss of control over it (see note 2.3).\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/141/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, and \"GRUPO MARCH\" is in a smaller, white, sans-serif font below it. The text is set against a teal background.\n\nAlso, during the first half of 2022 the Group sold its entire 3.21% equity investment in Indra Sistemas, S.A. Up to the sale date, the change in the fair value of this equity investment amounted to Euros 3.5 million, and the sale generated a gain of Euros 4.8 million, which was recognised under proceeds from disposal of and income from assets at 31 December 2022.\n\nAlso, in relation to the other investments held by the Group through Deya Capital IV, SCR, S.A.U. and which are also managed by Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., in 2023 and 2022 the valuations were carried out by Kroll Advisory, S.L., an independent expert, which issued the related report. One exception is the valuation of InStore Media Group, S.A., which is drawn up by personnel of Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U. in charge of this. At 31 December 2022, the investment in Topco Satlink, S.L., which was acquired in 2022, was valued at its acquisition value, which coincides with its fair value.\n\nThe method used by the independent expert to determine the recoverable amount of these investments was based on discounted future cash flows.\n\nFinancial projections (sales, EBITDA, investments, etc.) are based on the budgets and business plans of the companies themselves approved by their respective Board of Directors. These projections are not published and are presented to Artá Capital at board meetings. In any case, the reasonableness of the projections prepared by the companies is contrasted with different market comparables and Artá Capital's own opinion based on its past experience. The financial projections have a five-year time frame for all the valuations performed.\n\nKey valuation variables: discount rate (WACC) and perpetual growth rate (g).\n\n• The WACC is calculated using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) generally accepted by the financial community, and on the basis of market variables obtained through Bloomberg, such as the rate of return on the 10-year bond or levered beta with respect to the benchmark stock market index.\n\nIn addition, various internal estimates are used, such as: the spread between the non-current debt of the Company and the 10-year bond, the tax rate (same as for the cash flows used in the terminal value calculation) or the target capital structure.\n\n• The perpetual growth rate is calculated based on each company and the market in which they operate.\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/142/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The main assumptions used in the valuation at 2022 year-end were a volatility of 40% and an unlevered beta coefficient of 0.77. At 31 December 2023 this investment was fully impaired.\n\nThe valuations held by the Group through Alba-KKR Core I., S.C.A. have been performed by the global valuation committee of KKR, supported by Kroll Advisory, which provides assistance in the valuation process. KKR's global valuation committee is the body responsible for coordinating and implementing the process for the valuation of KKR investees worldwide.\n\nValuations are prepared and furnished, on a quarterly basis, to all investors in the various funds and vehicles invested in the two companies.\n\nMoreover, these valuations are the same as those used by KKR itself in its financial statements, given that it invests part of its own balance sheet in the KKR Core Fund, a direct shareholder in both Atlantic Aviation and ERM. These accounts are audited by Deloitte, which reviews the valuations of the investees as part of the regular audit process. As a US listed entity, KKR is under the supervision of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe methods used to determine the fair value of each investment were the discounted cash flows method and the market multiple approach.\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/145/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif font. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font.

The final repayment date of this loan is May 2030 and it accrues interest at market rates.\n\nIn 2021 the Group acquired 23.71% of Profand Fishing Holding, S.L.'s capital. As a result of this transaction, Alba and the other shareholder of Profand Fishing Holding, S.L., formerly the holder of Alba's current ownership interest, entered into a shareholders' agreement (which was amended in the first half of 2023) setting out a number of binding covenants and conditions relating to their rights and obligations, the terms on which Profand would be managed and governed and the arrangement to transfer the shares. In relation to the latter, among other agreements, Alba was granted a put option on all of its shares in Profand Fishing Holding, S.L., such that Alba holds a unilateral put option on this interest vis-à-vis the other shareholder for an amount agreed in advance. This put option will remain in force from 2025 until 28 October 2031. This option was valued at 31 December 2023 and 2022 by an independent expert, Kroll Advisory, S.L., and is recorded under other non-current financial assets in the consolidated balance sheet amounting to Euros 39.1 million (Euros 33.9 million at 31 December 2022), which generated an impact on the consolidated income statement for 2023 of Euros 5.2 million, recognised under change in fair value of financial instruments.\n\n#### **13.

Risk Management Objectives and Policies**\n\nThe Board of Directors of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. has drawn up the following Risk Management and Control Policy:\n\n#### **1.- Types of risk faced by the Company**\n\nRisk is inherent in all business activity and is defined as uncertainty concerning the occurrence of an event or action that could adversely affect the Company's ability to maximise its value for stakeholders and to achieve its goals; it also refers to the possibility of threats materialising and opportunities not being taken.\n\nCorporación Financiera Alba engages in two principal activities:\n\n(i) investment in the capital of listed and unlisted companies, and\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/155/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA Grupo March. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif letters on a teal background. Below \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white, sans-serif letters.\n\n(ii) investment in buildings leased as office space.\n\nAs a result of its activities, the markets and sectors in which it operates and its environment, the Company is exposed to the following categories of risks:\n\n• Strategic risks related to the mission and vision of the Company, achievement of business goals and the creation and preservation of value for shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nThese include risks related to the corporate governance of the Company, its reputation and responsibility, investment and divestment strategies, and market dynamics.\n\n• Operational risks involving potential direct or indirect economic losses related to external events: uncertainty in the Company's own business activities; or internal events: failures or inadequacies in the processes, systems or resources of the Company.\n\nThese include risks related, mainly, to revenue, investments and divestments and monitoring thereof, the acquisition of goods and services, physical assets, human resources, information technologies, and natural disasters, terrorism and other criminal acts.\n\n• Financial risks resulting, broadly speaking, from any financing operation which the Company must carry out in order to perform its activities, as well as the reliability of financial information reported by the Company.\n\nThese include liquidity and credit risks, market, tax, accounting and reporting risks.\n\n• Regulatory compliance risks arising from a potential failure to comply with laws, regulations, internal standards and codes of conduct, as well as greater exposure to such risks.\n\nThese include legal risks, regulatory risks and risks involving codes of ethics and conduct.\n\n• Technological, environmental and social risks, including risks associated with information technology, cybersecurity and technological obsolescence, climate change and employee health and safety.\n\n#### **2.- Integrated Risk Management System**\n\nAware of the importance and advantages of adequately and efficiently managing its risks, Corporación Financiera Alba has established an Integrated Risk Management System mainly focused on:\n\n• Enabling the identification and proactive and efficient assessment of Company risks, as well as monitoring and continually tracking these risks.\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/156/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif font. Below \"ALBA\" is \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The text is set against a teal background, and the entire logo is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n- Integrating, coordinating and directing the various risk management actions performed by the Company.\n- Achieving responsible risk acceptance and reinforcing the responsibility of the Company's employees.\n- Ensuring that control systems are aligned with the actual risks of the Company.\n- Facilitating and streamlining the application of corrective measures.\n\nThe Integrated Risk Management System unites three key components:\n\n- (i) The continuous risk management process, understood as the activities performed by all individuals in the Company under the supervision of the Audit and Compliance Committee that are focused on identifying potential risk events, managing the risks identified and providing reasonable assurance that the Company will achieve its goals.\n- (ii) An organisational focus, with clearly defined and communicated roles and responsibilities. Integrated risk management affects all Company personnel; therefore it is vital to establish an organisational focus on risk management tailored to the organisational structure and corporate culture of the Company.\n\nAlthough the Integrated Risk Management System affects and involves all Company personnel, the main participants are as follows: risk managers, the Risk Control and Management Department, the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\n(iii) A monitoring model, which identifies and provides the timely information needed so that all those involved in the risk management process can make informed decisions concerning the risks.\n\n#### **2.1. The continuous risk management process**\n\nBy way of a summary, the continuous risk management process involves performing the following activities:\n\n• Identifying and assessing the risks that could affect the Company.\n\nDetermining the main strategic, operational, financial and regulatory compliance risks affecting the Company's strategy and goals, assessing the probability of occurrence and potential impact and prioritising risks based on these factors.\n\n• Setting the level of risk that is considered acceptable.\n\nDefining key risk indicators (KRIs) for each critical risk and establishing tolerance levels for these risks.\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/157/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked on top of the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" which are in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The text is set against a teal background.\n\n#### • Identifying controls.\n\nSpecifying existing controls (or those to be implemented) in the Company to mitigate the aforementioned risks.\n\n• Identifying the processes in which these risks and controls arise.\n\nDetermining the existing relationship between the Company's key risks – and its controls – and the Company's processes, identifying and analysing the processes that are critical for risk management.\n\n• Assessing controls.\n\nAssessing the effectiveness of the controls in mitigating the risks identified.\n\n• Designing and implementing action plans in response to the risks.\n\nDetermining action plans to be carried out to lower residual risk to an acceptable risk level, bearing in mind the costs and benefits of such efforts. As a direct result of this reduction in the level of risk, a reassessment and prioritisation of the risks will be necessary and appropriate, as part of a continuous risk management process.\n\nIn this regard, Corporación Financiera Alba has prepared the Company's Risk Map, which shows, based on their impact and probability, the key risks in the categories listed above. In order for this map to be effectively used as a management tool that allows the Company to make informed decisions, the map is reviewed and updated periodically to adjust it to the Company's current circumstances.\n\nLikewise, the Company has prepared Risk Indices for the most critical risks, identifying the key risk indicators with their corresponding tolerance levels, the associated controls and, where applicable, the action plans to be implemented. These Indices allow the Company to periodically assess and monitor its risks and to determine the most appropriate response to these risks.\n\n#### **2.2. Organisational model of roles and responsibilities**\n\nAlthough the Integrated Risk Management System affects and involves all Company personnel, the main players are as follows:\n\n(i) Risk managers:\n\nThese managers are responsible for monitoring the risks assigned to them and for reporting to the Risk Control and Management Department any relevant information concerning the risks.\n\n(ii) Risk Control and Management Department:\n\nThe Risk Control and Management Department is expressly tasked with the following duties:\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/158/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The logo is in a teal box with white text. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, bold letters, and the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" are in smaller letters below.\n\n- Ensuring the smooth running of the risk control and management systems and, specifically, that all the important risks affecting the Company are identified, managed and quantified correctly.\n- Actively participating in preparing the risk strategy and important decisions concerning risk management.\n- Ensuring that the risk control and management systems adequately mitigate risks, as part of the policy established by the Board of Directors.\n- (iii) Audit and Compliance Committee:\n\nThis body supervises, pursuant to the Regulations of the Company's Board of Directors, the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls and risk management systems, among other aspects.\n\nLikewise, it discusses with the auditor any significant weaknesses in the internal control system detected during the audit.\n\n(iv) Board of Directors:\n\nAs indicated previously, the Board of Directors has the power to determine the risk control and management policy, including for tax risks, and is tasked with supervising the internal reporting and internal control systems.\n\nWith regard to the risk management processes, it is noteworthy that, in addition to the aforementioned Risk Control and Management Department, Corporación Financiera Alba has Regulatory Compliance processes which are performed by the various operational and support departments, as well as an Internal Audit Service (SAI), defined as an advisory and control body serving the Audit and Compliance Committee, that is independent within the organisation as regards its actions, aimed at assessing the various areas and functional activities of the Company.\n\nThe duties of the Internal Audit Service include the analysis and proposal of recommendations to improve the risk management processes. The Internal Audit Service also performs independent assessments of the efficiency and effectiveness of internal controls, although this is always in coordination with the Risk Control and Management Department, in order to avoid duplicating tasks and/or areas existing without adequate coverage.\n\n#### **2.3. Monitoring and Reporting Model**\n\nThe last component of the Integrated Risk Management System is a monitoring and reporting model capable of providing relevant information, in a timely and appropriate manner, to all players involved in the risk control and management process, both upwards and downwards in the hierarchy.\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/159/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, with each letter on a teal background. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font, also on a teal background.\n\nThis cross-departmental monitoring model allows the System to behave dynamically and, above all, to anticipate risks, rendering risk management and control, within the limits set by the Company, possible.\n\nSpecifically, the Integrated Risk Management System established by Corporación Financiera Alba is a management, communication, monitoring and support mechanism for all activities related to risk control and management. It is vital for responding to individual risks and risks that are specific to each activity, while it provides the framework needed for coordinated management by the Company.\n\nAs mentioned in the Policy, the Group's activities are exposed to various financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk, and cash flow interest rate risk. The Group's Risk Management and Control Policy establishes the basic principles, guidelines and general framework for actions to control and manage the various types of risk (financial and non-financial) faced. The Group does not use derivatives to mitigate certain risks.\n\n#### Market risk\n\nGiven the Group's activities, the exposure to market risk depends on the performance of the investees, whether listed or not.\n\n• Currency risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to currency risk through its investments in foreign currencies.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 and 2022 the Group has direct investments in companies whose currency is not the Euro.\n\n• Price risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to price risk relating to equity instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss. To manage price risk derived from investments in equity instruments the Group diversifies its portfolio.\n\n• Cash flow and fair value interest rate risks\n\nThe Group's interest rate risk arises from non-current borrowings. Borrowings at variable interest rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risks. Fixed interest loans expose the Group to fair value interest rate risks.\n\nThe Group holds almost 100% of borrowings at variable interest rates.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 and 2022 the Group had not arranged any interest rate swaps.\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/160/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA Grupo March. The logo is set on a teal background and features the word \"ALBA\" in large, white, sans-serif font. Below \"ALBA\" is the text \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The entire logo is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n#### Liquidity risk\n\nThe Group applies a prudent policy to cover its liquidity risks, based on having sufficient cash to settle all payments derived from its activity and to assure its objectives are met, underpinned by providing its subsidiaries with sufficient economic resources to carry out their activities.\n\nThe Group has a significant amount of cash and cash equivalents, as well as high positive working capital.\n\nIts liquidity management is based on forecasting and analysing cash inflows and outflows.\n\nAt 31 December 2023 the Group's cash position amounted to Euros 337.9 million, of which Euros 85.1 million comprised cash in hand and at banks, and Euros 252.8 million reflected current deposits and investments that are readily convertible into cash and not subject to a risk of change in value.\n\nThe most significant cash outflows of the Group not related to expenses and investments are distributions of dividends to shareholders.\n\nThe Group's exposure to liquidity risk at 31 December 2023 and 2022 is shown in the debt maturity table in note 19.\n\n#### Credit risk\n\nThe Group does not have significant concentrations of credit risk as its principal activity consists of investing in the capital of different companies. Credit risk arises from potential losses derived from customers or counterparties failing to meet, in part or in full, their financial obligations with the Group.\n\nDetails of credit risk exposure at 31 December 2023 and 2022, by type of asset and maturity, are as follows (in millions of Euros):\n\n|                                    |        | 2023      |        | 2022      |  |\n|------------------------------------|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|--|\n|                                    | Amount | Maturity  | Amount | Maturity  |  |\n| Trade receivables                  | 0.3    | 2024      | 23.9   | 2023      |  |\n| Other non-current financial assets | 92.9   | 2024-2031 | 72.3   | 2023-2029 |  |\n| Other payables                     | 26.1   | 2024      | 21.3   | 2023      |  |\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/161/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Specifically, they relate to the activities carried out by companies in which the Group has a direct ownership interest and which belong to vehicles managed by Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U., which exercises control over said vehicle and determines what investments are made, whether there are no restrictions on management and whether they have exposure to variable returns. In 2023, this segment includes only the results contributed by the Nuadi, Facundo and Gesdocument subgroups in the first three months of the year (see note 2.3).\n\nNo transactions are carried out between the different segments.\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/164/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

This calculation will be performed excluding own shares and without taking into account taxes resulting from the theoretical settlement.\n\nThere is also an annual variable remuneration component based on a number of parameters that enable an assessment of performance and the degree of fulfilment, as well as deferral of half of the accrued remuneration, which will be payable, together with the revaluation and dividends, in no less than five years as of the accrual date and no later than eight years after that date, whichever the beneficiary chooses.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of articles 227, 228, 229 and 231 of the Spanish Companies Act (\"LSC\"), as per the wording of Law 31/2014 of 3 December 2014, which amended the LSC in order to improve corporate governance, the Directors of Alba have informed Alba that, during the years ended 31 December 2023 and 2022 they had no conflicts of interest with Alba and, to the best of their knowledge and based on the information which they have been able to obtain with the utmost due diligence, nor did any parties related to them.\n\n#### **28. Audit Fees**\n\nIn 2023, KPMG Auditores, S.L., the auditor of the Group's annual accounts, accrued fees totalling Euros 121.7 thousand, of which Euros 80.2 thousand were for audit services and Euros 41.5 thousand for assurance services on the Non-financial Information Statement, the limited review of the half-yearly consolidated financial statements, the agreed-upon procedures report on the ICOFR description, and translations of annual accounts previously authorised for issue by the Board of Directors and for which an audit opinion had already been issued.\n\n#### **29. Statement of Cash Flows**\n\nThis statement has been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 7.\n\nThe statement comprises three types of cash flow:\n\n- Net cash flows from operating activities: operating cash flows of all the businesses managed by the Group.\n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/171/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale**\n\nAt 31 December 2023 the Group does not own any non-current assets and liabilities held for sale.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the Group classified all the assets and liabilities of Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U. and Artá Partners, S.A. as non-current assets and liabilities held for sale. Although the sale took place in the first quarter of 2023, the decision was taken earlier. The disposal group consisted of assets of Euros 3.6 million (of which Euros 2.9 million was in cash and Euros 0.7 million in trade and other receivables) and liabilities of Euros 1.4 million (entirely composed of trade and other payables). In 2022 the Group did not recognise any impairment losses due to the carrying amounts being lower than fair value less costs to sell.\n\n#### **31.

Business performance and position of the Company**\n\nThe consolidated annual accounts at 31 December 2023 give a true and fair view of the Group's equity, financial position, results of operations, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and have been authorised for issue by the Company's directors.\n\nThe non-financial information statement is attached as an appendix to this directors' report, of which it forms an integral part, and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Law 11/2018 of 28 December 2018, amending the Spanish Code of Commerce, the Revised Spanish Companies Act approved by Royal Legislative Decree 1/2010 of 2 July 2010 and Audit Law 22/2015 of 20 July 2015, on non-financial and diversity information.\n\nDuring 2023, the Alba Group's activities comprised the following:\n\n- ∗ Management of a number of controlling and influential interests in a series of companies operating in different sectors of the economy.\n- ∗ Promotion and holding of interests in companies.\n- ∗ Operation of buildings through lease or sale.\n\nAlba recognised consolidated net profit of Euros 235 million in 2023, compared to Euros 436 million in the previous year. This decline is mainly due to the weaker performance of certain of our investees, the decrease in the fair value of investment property, lower capital gains on the sale of assets and the impairment loss posted by one of our investees. In addition, as a result of the sale of the stake in the venture capital management company Artá Capital, Nuadi, Facundo Group and Gesdocument ceased to be fully consolidated as of the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNet asset value (NAV) rose by 9.6% in the year to Euros 5,797 million at 31 December 2023, equivalent to Euros 96.12 per share. Alba's share price ended the year at Euros 48.00 per share, after climbing 11.2%.\n\nDuring this period, Alba invested Euros 209 million and sold assets totalling Euros 34 million, reducing its net cash position to Euros 16 million at 31 December 2023.\n\nA released share capital increase was approved in June to implement a flexible dividend for a total of Euros 57 million, the result of which was as follows: (i) Alba acquired a total of 6,244,550 free allotment rights for Euros 6 million, representing 10.5% of the total; (ii) a capital increase of Euros 51 million was carried out through the issue of 1,060,012 new ordinary shares with a par value of Euros 1 each (option chosen\n\n{176}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/176/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

As a result, Alba's share capital was represented by 60,305,186 shares of Euros 1 par value each at 31 December 2023.\n\n## **2. Most significant transactions**\n\nAlba made the following investments:\n\n- Acquisition of an additional 2.0% stake in Technoprobe for Euros 83 million.

Outlook for the Company**\n\nAlba's foremost objective is to ensure that its investees achieve maximum profitability, improving their competitiveness and enhancing their human, financial and technological potential. Furthermore, the Company's financial structure, size and flexibility will enable it to take advantage of investment opportunities that may arise.\n\nPerformance of the main investees:\n\n- Acerinox posted sales of Euros 6,608 million, 23.9% down on 2022 due to the considerable sector-wide decline in inventories, primarily stainless steel, commencing at the end of the previous year. Meanwhile, the high performance alloys sector performed adequately (up 13.9% on 2022). In comparison with 2022, steel production fell by 11.3% to 1.9 million tonnes, while cold rolling was down by 15.0% to 1.2 million tonnes. Annual EBITDA dropped to Euros 703 million, 45.0% down on the prior year due primarily to the aforementioned fall in revenues suffered by the Stainless Steel division. The performance of the Special Alloys division (VDM) remained solid, with EBITDA hitting an all-time high. Net profit totalled Euros 228 million (59.0% down on 2022), affected by the impairment loss of Euros 156 million recognised at Bahru Stainless. Lastly, net financial debt at 31 December 2023 was down to Euros 341 million (0.5 times EBITDA for the year). On 5 February 2024, Acerinox announced an agreement to acquire 100% of US special alloys producer Haynes International for USD 798 million. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the third quarter of this year.\n- CIE Automotive's revenue amounted to Euros 3,959 million in 2023, representing a 3.1% increase on 2022, bolstered by the pick-up in demand, enabling the business to perform well in all locations except for Asia. EBITDA rose to Euros 713 million (12.6% higher than in 2022) and the margin was expanded to 18.0% (+1,5 p.p. vs. 2022). Despite the rise in finance costs, net profit grew by 6.7% to Euros 320 million. Net financial debt at 31 December 2023 amounted to Euros 1,135 million, 1.6 times EBITDA for the year.\n- Ebro Foods posted sales of Euros 3,084 million in 2023, up 3.9% on the prior year, driven by growth in the Rice (+4.9%) and Pasta (+0.1%) divisions, the latter in line with the previous year's performance. EBITDA increased to Euros 387 million, up 15.7% on 2022, with a considerable increase in margin (up 1.2 p.p. vs. 2021), thanks to more stable raw materials prices and lower transport and energy costs. Meanwhile, net profit amounted to Euros 187 million, reflecting an increase of 53.2% on 2022, when profit was affected by the loss incurred on the sale of Roland Monterrat. Net financial debt had fallen to Euros 570 million (1.5 times EBITDA for the year) at 31 December 2023, thanks to a sound operating performance and reduced working capital requirements.\n\n{178}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/178/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font on a teal background. Below \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The entire logo is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n- Naturgy achieved sales of Euros 22,617 million in 2023, down 33.4% on 2022, as energy prices returned to normal levels following the unprecedented increase in 2022 as a result of the conflict in Ukraine. EBITDA in 2023 amounted to Euros 5,475 million, up 10.5% on the prior year, driven by the strong performance of both liberalised and regulated international activities. Net profit amounted to Euros 1,986 million in 2023, up 20.4% on 2022 thanks to the sound EBITDA performance mentioned above and the positive trend observed in respect of net finance income, due to the reduction in average debt in the period, despite the rise in interest rates. Net financial debt at 31 December 2023 amounted to Euros 12,090 million (2.2 times EBITDA for the year).\n- Verisure, a company that also operates under the \"Securitas Direct\" trademark, achieved revenues of Euros 3,090 million in 2023, up 9.3% on 2022, driven by growth in the customer portfolio and a rise in the ARPU (up 1.8% vs. 2022). Adjusted EBITDA of the customer portfolio amounted to Euros 1,885 million, up 11.3% vis-à-vis 2022. Total adjusted EBITDA reached Euros 1,340 million, which is 16.4% higher than in the previous year. Net profit totalled Euros 29 million, down 31.7% on 2022. Net financial debt at 31 December 2023 amounted to Euros 7,408 million (5.3 times adjusted EBITDA for the annualised last two quarters).\n- Viscofan sales grew by 2.1% to Euros 1,226 million compared to the previous year, due mainly to the improved selling price mix. EBITDA stood at Euros 268 million, representing a slight increase on 2022 (+0.5%), driven by the performance of revenues and cost control, which offset the lower profits from cogeneration activities and the negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations against the Euro. Net profit totalled Euros 141 million, up 1.1% on the prior year. At 31 December 2023, Viscofan recognised net bank debt of Euros 138 million (0.5 times EBITDA for the year), compared to Euros 101 million at the end of 2022, in light of the increase in working capital and payment of dividends.\n\n{179}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/179/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Risk management and control policy**\n\nThe Board of Directors of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. has drawn up the following Risk Management and Control Policy:\n\n#### **1.- Types of risk faced by the Company**\n\nRisk is inherent in all business activity and is defined as uncertainty concerning the occurrence of an event or action that could adversely affect the Company's ability to maximise its value for stakeholders and to achieve its goals; it also refers to the possibility of threats materialising and opportunities not being taken.\n\nCorporación Financiera Alba engages in two principal activities:\n\n- (i) investment in the capital of listed and unlisted companies, and\n- (ii) investment in buildings leased as office space.\n\nAs a result of its activities, the markets and sectors in which it operates and its environment, the Company is exposed to the following categories of risks:\n\n• Strategic risks related to the mission and vision of the Company, achievement of business goals and the creation and preservation of value for shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\n{183}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/183/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" which are in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The background is a teal color, and the logo is surrounded by a thin, teal border.\n\nThese include risks related to the corporate governance of the Company, its reputation and responsibility, investment and divestment strategies, and market dynamics.\n\n• Operational risks involving potential direct or indirect economic losses related to external events: uncertainty in the Company's own business activities; or internal events: failures or inadequacies in the processes, systems or resources of the Company.\n\nThese include risks related primarily to revenue, investments and divestments and monitoring thereof, the acquisition of goods and services, physical assets, human resources, information technologies, and natural disasters, terrorism and other criminal acts.\n\n• Financial risks resulting, broadly speaking, from any financing operation which the Company must carry out in order to perform its activities, as well as the reliability of financial information reported by the Company.\n\nThese include liquidity and credit risks, market, tax, accounting and reporting risks.\n\n• Regulatory compliance risks arising from a potential failure to comply with laws, regulations, internal standards and codes of conduct, as well as greater exposure to such risks.\n\nThese include legal risks, regulatory risks and risks involving codes of ethics and conduct.\n\n• Technological, environmental and social risks, including risks associated with information technology, cybersecurity and technological obsolescence, climate change and employee health and safety.\n\n#### **2.- Integrated Risk Management System**\n\nAware of the importance and advantages of adequately and efficiently managing its risks, Corporación Financiera Alba has established an Integrated Risk Management System mainly focused on:\n\n- Enabling the identification and proactive and efficient assessment of Company risks, as well as monitoring and continually tracking these risks.\n- Integrating, coordinating and directing the various risk management actions performed by the Company.\n- Achieving responsible risk acceptance and reinforcing the responsibility of the Company's employees.\n- Ensuring that control systems are aligned with the actual risks of the Company.\n\n{184}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/184/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, with each letter connected to the others by a thin white line. Below \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The entire logo is set against a teal background.\n\n• Facilitating and streamlining the application of corrective measures.\n\nThe Integrated Risk Management System unites three key components:\n\n- (i) The continuous risk management process, understood as the activities performed by all individuals in the Company under the supervision of the Audit and Compliance Committee that are focused on identifying potential risk events, managing the risks identified and providing reasonable assurance that the Company will achieve its goals.\n- (ii) An organisational focus, with clearly defined and communicated roles and responsibilities. Integrated risk management affects all Company personnel; therefore it is vital to establish an organisational focus on risk management tailored to the organisational structure and corporate culture of the Company.\n\nAlthough the Integrated Risk Management System affects and involves all Company personnel, the main participants are as follows: risk managers, the Risk Control and Management Department, the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\n(iii) A monitoring model, which identifies and provides the timely information needed so that all those involved in the risk management process can make informed decisions concerning the risks.\n\n#### **2.1. The continuous risk management process**\n\nBy way of a summary, the continuous risk management process involves performing the following activities:\n\n• Identifying and assessing the risks that could affect the Company.\n\nDetermining the main strategic, operational, financial and regulatory compliance risks affecting the Company's strategy and goals, assessing the probability of occurrence and potential impact and prioritising risks based on these factors.\n\n• Setting the level of risk that is considered acceptable.\n\nDefining key risk indicators (KRIs) for each critical risk and establishing tolerance levels for these risks.\n\n• Identifying controls.\n\nSpecifying existing controls (or those to be implemented) in the Company to mitigate the aforementioned risks.\n\n• Identifying the processes in which these risks and controls arise.\n\nDetermining the existing relationship between the Company's key risks – and its controls – and the Company's processes, identifying and analysing the processes that are critical for risk management.\n\n{185}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/185/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" which are in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The text is set against a teal background, and the entire logo is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n• Assessing controls.\n\nAssessing the effectiveness of the controls in mitigating the risks identified.\n\n• Designing and implementing action plans in response to the risks.\n\nDetermining action plans to be carried out to lower residual risk to an acceptable risk level, bearing in mind the costs and benefits of such efforts. As a direct result of this reduction in the level of risk, a reassessment and prioritisation of the risks will be necessary and appropriate, as part of a continuous risk management process.\n\nIn this regard, Corporación Financiera Alba has prepared the Company's Risk Map, which shows, based on their impact and probability, the key risks in the categories listed above. In order for this map to be effectively used as a management tool that allows the Company to make informed decisions, the map is reviewed and updated periodically to adjust it to the Company's current circumstances.\n\nLikewise, the Company has prepared Risk Indices for the most critical risks, identifying the key risk indicators with their corresponding tolerance levels, the associated controls and, where applicable, the action plans to be implemented. These Indices allow the Company to periodically assess and monitor its risks and to determine the most appropriate response to these risks.\n\n#### **2.2. Organisational model of roles and responsibilities**\n\nAlthough the Integrated Risk Management System affects and involves all Company personnel, the main players are as follows:\n\n(i) Risk managers:\n\nThese managers are responsible for monitoring the risks assigned to them and for reporting to the Risk Control and Management Department any relevant information concerning the risks.\n\n(ii) Risk Control and Management Department:\n\nThe Risk Control and Management Department is expressly tasked with the following duties:\n\n- Ensuring the smooth running of the risk control and management systems and, specifically, that all the important risks affecting the Company are identified, managed and quantified correctly.\n- Actively participating in preparing the risk strategy and important decisions concerning risk management.\n- Ensuring that the risk control and management systems adequately mitigate risks, as part of the policy established by the Board of Directors.\n\n{186}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/186/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" which are in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The text is set against a teal background, and the entire logo is enclosed in a teal border.\n\n(iii) Audit and Compliance Committee:\n\nPursuant to the Regulations of the Company's Board of Directors, this body supervises the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls and risk management systems, among other aspects.\n\nLikewise, it discusses with the auditor any significant weaknesses in the internal control system detected during the audit.\n\n(iv) Board of Directors:\n\nAs indicated previously, the Board of Directors has the power to determine the risk control and management policy, including for tax risks, and is tasked with supervising the internal reporting and internal control systems.\n\nWith regard to the risk management processes, in addition to the aforementioned Risk Control and Management Department, Corporación Financiera Alba has Regulatory Compliance processes which are performed by the various operational and support departments. It also has an Internal Audit Service (SAI), defined as an advisory and control body serving the Audit and Compliance Committee, that is independent within the organisation as regards its actions, aimed at assessing the various areas and functional activities of the Company.\n\nThe duties of the Internal Audit Service include the analysis and proposal of recommendations to improve the risk management processes. The Internal Audit Service also performs independent assessments of the efficiency and effectiveness of internal controls, although this is always in coordination with the Risk Control and Management Department, in order to avoid duplicating tasks and/or areas existing without adequate coverage.\n\n#### **2.3 Monitoring and Reporting Model**\n\nThe last component of the Integrated Risk Management System is a monitoring and reporting model capable of providing relevant information, in a timely and appropriate manner, to all players involved in the risk control and management process, both upwards and downwards in the hierarchy.\n\nThis cross-departmental monitoring model allows the System to behave dynamically and, above all, to anticipate risks, rendering risk management and control possible, within the limits set by the Company.\n\nSpecifically, the Integrated Risk Management System established by Corporación Financiera Alba is a management, communication, monitoring and support mechanism for all activities related to risk control and management. It is vital for responding to individual risks and risks that are specific to each activity, while it provides the framework needed for coordinated management by the Company.\n\n{187}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/187/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif letters on a teal background. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white, sans-serif letters.\n\nAs mentioned in the Policy, the Group's activities are exposed to various financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk, and cash flow interest rate risk. The Group's Risk Management and Control Policy establishes the basic principles, guidelines and general framework for actions to control and manage the various types of financial and non-financial risks faced. The Group does not use derivatives to mitigate certain risks.\n\n## **13.

The definitions and calculation methods used are as follows:\n\n**NAV (Net Asset Value):** the value of the company calculated as the fair value of the Group's assets less its liabilities, before tax. The Group discloses five categories for the calculation: (i) listed securities, (ii) unlisted securities, (iii) properties, (iv) other assets and liabilities, and (v) net cash.\n\n**Net cash**: the value of the Group's cash and cash equivalents (including bonds and promissory notes) less financial debt, both current and non-current.\n\nThe components of each of the NAV categories are as follows:\n\n- (i) Listed securities: the stock market value of the following investments:\n\t- a) Investments in listed associates recognised on the balance sheet (Acerinox, S.A., CIE Automotive, S.A., Ebro Foods, S.A., Viscofan, S.A. and Rioja Luxembourg, S.à.r.l. (value of the interest in Naturgy, net of Rioja debt).\n\t- b) Listed investments recognised on the balance sheet under \"Investments at fair value through profit or loss\" (Global Dominion Access, S.A., Technoprobe, Spa, Befesa Holding, S.á.r.l. and Inmobiliaria Colonial, SOCIMI, S.A).\n\t- c) Listed investments recognised on the balance sheet under \"Other current financial assets\" (trading portfolio).\n- (ii) Unlisted securities: the fair value of the following investments:\n\t- a) Investments in UNLISTED associates recognised on the balance sheet (Aegis Lux 2. S.à.r.l., Piolin II, S.á.r.l. and Profand Fishing Holding, S.L.).\n\t- b) UNLISTED investments recognised on the balance sheet under \"Investments at fair value through profit or loss\".\n- (iii) Properties: fair value of investment property and real estate recognised on the balance sheet.\n- (iv) Other assets and liabilities: at carrying amount.\n- (v) Net cash: includes the following:\n\n{189}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/189/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Among its objectives and principles for the selection of candidates, the Policy contemplates that the selection of Directors must be based on the analysis of the Company carried out by the Board of Directors with the advice of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee. Likewise, the candidates must be selected considering that his/her appointment shall promote diversity of skills, knowledge, experience, gender and age within the Board. It is also stated that in the selection of candidates, care should be taken to ensure that an appropriate balance is achieved on the Board as a whole, which enriches decision-making and brings a plurality of viewpoints to the discussion of matters within its competence.\n\nIn addition to this Policy, the Appointments and Remunerations Committee has approved the requirements that candidates must meet for the various classifications of Board Members of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A.:\n\n1. Executive Board Members will be selected bearing in mind their knowledge of the activities of the Company, their professional background and experience, which will be suited to performing executive duties therein.\n\n2. In order to elect proprietary Board Members, who are appointed on the proposal of a significant shareholder, gender diversity must be respected, avoiding gender discrimination and candidates must also have a suitable professional background and experience for his office of Director.\n\n3. In the case of independent Board Members, the professional background and experience of the candidate must be taken into account. Gender diversity and nationality or habitual residence shall be considered, if relevant to provide the Board with a different point of view.\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/210/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV). The logo is set against a red background. The letters \"CNMV\" are stacked on top of the words \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\".\n\nIn 2020, the Board of Directors considered that the target for representing the least represented gender should reach 40% of all members of the Board of Directors. Since the General Shareholders' Meeting held on 21 June 2021, 40% of the positions on the Board are held by female Directors.\n\nDuring 2023 the Appointments and Remuneration Committee has made the corresponding follow-up of the Selection of Candidates for Director Policy, which has been applied in the re-election of the Board Members Ms. María Luisa Guibert Ucín, Ms. Ana María Plaza Arregui, Mr. Antón Pradera Jáuregui and Mr. Juan March Juan.\n\nC.1.6 Describe the measures, if any, agreed upon by the nomination committee to ensure that selection procedures do not contain hidden biases which impede the selection of female directors and that the company deliberately seeks and includes women who meet the target professional profile among potential candidates, making it possible to achieve a balance between men and women. Also indicate whether these measures include encouraging the company to have a significant number of female senior executives:\n\nExplanation of measures\n\n- Including female candidates in all Board Member selection processes.\n- Including, to the extent possible, a comparable number of candidates of each gender in the selection process.\n\n- When the quality of the candidates is the same, in terms of training and experience, provided the representation target has not been met, the selection of female candidates will be prioritised.\n\nThese guidelines were ratified by the Appointments and Remuneration Committee in 2020, which, in accordance with the amendments to the Good Governance Code of Listed Companies approved by the CNMV on 26 June 2020, considered that the target for representing the least represented gender should comprise reaching 40% of the total number of members of the Board of Directors.

Explain the scope of the company's financial and non-financial risk management and control system, including tax risk.\n\nThe Company, which includes Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. and its Group companies, has defined an Integrated Risk Management System aimed mainly at:\n\n• Enabling the identification and proactive and efficient assessment of Company risks, as well as monitoring and continually tracking these risks.\n\n- Integrating, coordinating and directing the various efforts which, in terms of risk management, the company is performing.\n- Achieving reasonable risk acceptance and reinforcing the responsibility of employees of the Company.\n- Ensuring the control systems are aligned with the real risks of the Company.\n- Facilitate and streamline the application of the corrective measures that mitigate the exposure to such risks.\n\nThis Integrated Risk Management System has been implemented at corporate level to mitigate the risks, both financial and non-financial, to which the Company is exposed, given the nature and degree of complexity of its operations and the environment in which it operates. This System unites three key components:\n\n(i) Continued Risk Management process, understood as those activities performed by all individuals in the Company under the supervision of the Audit and Compliance Committee that are focused on identifying those potential risk events that could affect it, managing the risks identified and ensuring reasonable security in achieving the Company's objectives.\n\nBy way of a summary, the continued risk management process involves performing the following activities:\n\n- Identifying and assessing the risks that could affect the Company.\n- Prioritizing the critical risks to which the Company is exposed.\n- Determining the level of risk that is can be tolerated, by defining key risk indicators (KRIs) for each critical risk and establishing tolerance levels for these risks.\n- Identifying the processes in which these risks occur.\n- Identifying the mitigating controls of the risks.\n- Assessing the effectiveness of the checks in mitigating the risks identified.\n- Designing and implementing action plans as a response to the risks, when deemed necessary.\n\nIn this regard, the Company has prepared the company's Risk Map, which shows the company's key risks based on their impact and probability. In order for this map to effectively become a management tool that allows the Company to make informed decisions, the map is reviewed and updated periodically to adjust it to the Company's current circumstances.\n\nThe Company has likewise defined the Risk Datasheets for the most critical risks, identifying the key risk indicators (with their corresponding tolerances), the associate controls and, where applicable, the action plans to be implemented.\n\nThese Indexes allow the Company to periodically assess and monitor its risks and to determine the most appropriate response to these risks.\n\nThe most recent update of the Alba Risk Map took place in 2022, along with the corresponding Risk Sheets. In 2023, the Audit Committee reviewed the Risk Map again and did not consider it necessary to update it again in that year. A further review of the Risk Map is planned for 2024.\n\n(ii) An organisational focus, with clearly defined and communicated roles and responsibilities. Full risk management affects all staff of the Company, as a result, it is vital to establish an organisational focus on risk management that is suited to the organisational structure and the Company's corporate culture.\n\nThough the Integrated Risk Management System affects and involves all Company staff, the main participants, as are described in the next section (E.2), are as follows: risk managers, the Risk Control and Management Department, the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\n(iii) A tracking model, which identifies and provides the crucial information needed so that all those involved in the risk management process can make informed decisions concerning the risks. This tracking model is cross-sectional as it allows the System to behave dynamically and, above all, to anticipate risks, rendering risk management and control, within the limits set by the Company, possible.\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/235/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV). The logo is set against a red background. The letters \"CNMV\" are stacked on top of each other in white, with the words \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\" written below in a smaller font size, also in white.\n\nThese elements constitute a model that provides for an adequate management of the risks and mitigating controls over such a corporate level, which is applied to all risks indicated in section E.3, which includes fiscal risks.\n\nE.2. Identify the bodies within the company responsible for preparing and executing the financial and non-financial risk management and control system, including tax risk.\n\nThe Company's Integrated Risk Management System involves all the Company's staff, though the main parties responsible for the System are as follows:\n\na) Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors has reserved the right to determine the risk control and management policy, including for tax risks, and to supervise the internal reporting and control systems.\n\nIn this regard, the Board of Directors is the main body responsible for the risk management system, since it develops the mechanisms needed so that all the relevant risks involved in the activities and business dealings are adequately identified, managed and controlled within the limits established.\n\nb) Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe Audit and Compliance Committee, which has been entrusted, among other duties, with supervising the effectiveness of the Company's internal checks, internal audits and risk management systems. It assesses whether or not there is sufficient organisation, staff, policies and processes needed to identify and control its main risks.\n\nc) Risk Control and Management Department.\n\nThe Risk Control and Management Department is under the direct supervision of the Audit and Compliance Committee and has been expressly given the following duties, which are included in its Articles of Association, and which have been approved by the Board of Directors:\n\n• Ensuring the smooth running of the risk control and management systems and, specifically, that all the important risks affecting the company are identified, managed and appropriately quantified.\n\n• Actively participating in preparing the risk strategy and important decisions concerning its management.\n\n• Ensuring that the risk control and management systems appropriately mitigate risks, as part of the policy identified by the Board of Directors.\n\nd) Risk Managers.\n\nThey are responsible for monitoring the risks assigned to them and for reporting any relevant information in this regard to the Risk Management and Control Unit.\n\nAs regards the risk management processes, it should be noted that in addition to the previously mentioned Risk Management and Control Unit, the Company has in place a Regulatory Compliance model, which establishes the regulatory requirements that must be followed by the different operational and support areas, as well as an Internal Audit Service, which is defined as an advisory and control body that reports to the independent Audit and Compliance Committee within the organisation concerning its activities, focusing on the assessment of the different functional areas and activities of the Company, as indicated in the Internal Audit Service Regulations.\n\nThe analysis and proposal of recommendations for improving the risk management processes, as well as performing independent assessments concerning the effectiveness and efficiency of internal checks are included among the duties entrusted to the Internal Audit Service, which works in partnership with the Risk Control and Management Department in order to avoid duplicating tasks and/or areas without sufficient coverage.\n\nWith regard to crime prevention, the Company has an Organisational and Management Model in place to prevent the commission of offences, along with the Crime Prevention Manual, which was updated in 2022 to include the identification of the new offences incorporated by Law 10/2022 of 6 September, which reforms the Criminal Code. In 2023, the Audit and Compliance Committee carried out the corresponding monitoring of the effectiveness of the Crime Prevention Model, without having detected any favourable or unfavourable controls with recommendations. A review of the Organisation and Management Model to prevent the commission of crimes is planned for 2024.\n\n{236}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/236/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV). The logo is set against a red background. The acronym \"CNMV\" is prominently displayed in white, stacked above the full name of the organization, which is also in white and arranged in a stacked format.\n\nE.3. Indicate the main financial and non-financial risks, including tax risks, as well as those deriving from corruption (with the scope of these risks as set out in Royal Decree Law 18/2017), to the extent that these are significant and may affect the achievement of business objectives.\n\nThe Group is subject to various risks inherent to the different sectors and markets in which it or its associated companies or companies in which it has holdings operate, and which could prevent it from achieving its targets and successfully executing its strategies.\n\nAs indicated above, the Company has a Risk Map, which is a tool that makes it possible to put the risks that could affect corporate targets into context, in addition to identifying and prioritising the most relevant and critical risks, making it possible to make decisions concerning steps to take to mitigate these risks.\n\nThe Company has a risk tracking and updating system which makes it possible to identify and incorporate any new risk identified during the financial year in the Company's Risk Map. Likewise, the system ensures that all key risks are reviewed at least twice per year. As a result of this review and analysis process, the current Risks Map, updated in 2022, has a total of eleven risks.\n\nAs a result, in the process of identifying and assessing risks, both financial and non-financial, affecting the Group, the following risk factors were considered to be the most inherently relevant (in other words, before applying the checks established):\n\n- · Macro-economic and socio-political factors\n- · Performance of investee companies\n- · Investment and divestment processes\n- · Catastrophic events\n- · Technological security\n- · Corporate reputation\n- · Corporate responsibility and sustainability (ESG)\n- · Measurement and monitoring of investments\n- · Tax management\n- · Culture\n- · Regulatory non-compliance\n\nThe Crime Prevention Manual, by identifying the criminal risks likely to affect the Company, highlights the crimes of corruption in business dealings, among other offences. Based on the risk tracking reports, there do not appear to be any significant corruption risks that affect the Company. The Code of Ethics and Conduct formally expresses the Company's condemnation of any form of corruption.\n\nE.4. Indicate whether the entity has risk tolerance levels, including for tax risk.\n\nThe Company's risk assessment and management model categorises risks, including tax, into four classifications, based on the impact of the risk and the probability of occurrence, as well as the perceived degree of internal control mitigating these risks.\n\nBased on these parameters, the risks are classified as:\n\n• Minor risks: Risks whose inherent criticality is medium-low and whose perceived degree of internal control is medium-high. These risks are managed with a view to rationalising the efforts made to mitigate these risks, without this causing appreciable damage to the perceived degree of internal control.\n\n• Average risks: Risks whose inherent criticality is medium-low and whose perceived degree of internal control is medium-low. These risks are tracked with a view to confirming that they maintain a medium-low level of inherent criticality, otherwise, the corresponding corrective measures will be taken.\n\n• High risks: Risks whose inherent criticality is medium-high and whose perceived degree of internal control is medium-high. For this type of risk, the associated checks are assessed in order to confirm the effectiveness of their design and method, and to confirm that the checks adequately mitigate the risks.\n\n• Critical risks: Risks whose inherent criticality is medium-high and whose perceived degree of internal control is medium-low. These risks are continually monitored by the of the Company's Management and action plans will be established to increase their degree of internal control, where necessary.\n\nThe Company has identified Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) for all risks categorised as high and critical and has established tolerance levels for\n\n{237}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/237/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV). The logo is set against a red background. The letters \"CNMV\" are stacked on top of each other in white, bold font. Below the letters, the words \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\" are stacked in smaller, white font.\n\neach of the risks. The results are periodically assessed and reported within Alba's Integrated Risk Management System tracking model (see detailed explanation in section E.6).\n\nE.5. Indicate which risks, including tax risks, have materialised during the year:\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, the most relevant risks for the Group, both financial and non-financial, including fiscal risks, did not materialise.\n\nE.6. Explain the response and oversight plans for the company's main risks, including tax risks, as well as the procedures followed by the company in order to ensure that the Board of Directors responds to any new challenges that arise.\n\nAs stated in the previous sections, the Company has appointed a Risk Manager for each risk assessed as being critical or high. The Risk Manager is responsible for monitoring each risk assessed and for informing the Risk Control and Management Department of relevant information concerning such risks, basically:\n\n- Changes in the perception of the risk level.\n- Effective operation of the checks identified for mitigation of these risks (and, where applicable, the potential effects).\n- Values collected using the indicators and comparison with established tolerance levels.\n- Status of the actions plans underway (if there is an action plan for this risk) and, where applicable, proposal of new action plans.\n\nThe effective operation of this key process of the Integrated Risk Management System is based on the existence of a Tracking Model (as indicated in section E.1) which is a cross-sectional component that allows the System to have dynamic behaviour and, above all, to anticipate risks, allowing for risk management and control within the limits set by the Company. With this as a basis, the persons in charge of risk management periodically provide relevant information to the Risk Unit, which conducts an independent and informed assessment of the Risk Unit and prepares the relevant risk report for the Audit and Compliance Committee, which is assigned to, among others, the role of monitoring the effectiveness of internal control of the Company, internal audit and risk management systems.\n\nThe Integrated Risk Management System, alongside of Alba's policies and management and control systems, have made it possible to identify risks and new threats sufficiently in advance, which are the focus of the tracking report that is submitted for inspection to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Regulatory Compliance function coordinates, systematizes and monitors the various actions and efforts in this regard with the Board of Directors approving the compliance model established and its tracking. In 2023, tracking reports were drawn up and submitted to the Audit and Compliance Committee and to the Board of Directors, which have approved them.\n\nLikewise, in relation to crime prevention, the corresponding monitoring reports were submitted to the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Board of Directors in 2023 and approved.\n\nThe Integrated Risk Management System (described in section E.1), together with the Risk Management Policy, the Risk Management and Control Function Charter, and the remaining elements of that System, such as the ongoing risk management process, the main participants (section E.2) allow the Board of Directors to identify and respond to issues arising in relation to the risks that may affect the Company.\n\n{238}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/238/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV).

(hereinafter, \"Alba\" or the \"Group\"), the purpose of which is to ensure reasonable security over the reliability of the financial information that Alba, as a listed company, distributes to the stock markets.\n\nThe bodies of Alba responsible for the existence and maintenance of an appropriate and effective SCIIF, as well as its duties, are as follows:\n\n(i) The Board of Directors, which has ultimate responsibility in this regard, according to the provisions of article 5 section 2.2.b) of the Regulation of the Board of Directors.\n\n(ii) The Audit and Compliance Committee, for its part, is responsible for supervising the effectiveness of the company's internal checks and audit services, as well as supervising the process of preparing and presenting regulated financial information and the company's internal control systems in this regard. Following Recommendation number 19 of the Technical Guide of the CNMV 3/2017, on Audit Committees of Public Interest Entities, the Board of Directors, at its meeting held in 2017, approved the Audit and Compliance Committee Regulation, which was amended on 26 October 2020 and 13 May 2021.\n\nAccording to this Regulation, the Audit and Compliance Committee is responsible for:\n\n- Periodically reviewing the internal control and risk management systems, so that the main risks are identified, managed and suitably reported.\n\n- Reviewing the process for preparing the Company's financial information, in order to establish its integrity, technological quality and internal check quality, compliance with regulatory requirements, proper delimitation of the consolidation perimeter, proper application of generally accepted accounting principles and standards, which are duly documented in an Accounts Plan, and compliance with remaining legal requirements concerning this information.\n\n- Ensuring the independence of the department assuming internal audit duties.\n\n- Reviewing updates to financial information on the Company's website.\n\n(iii) The Audit and Compliance Committee is supported by the Internal Audit Service which is responsible for, among other matters, the preparation and execution of an annual action plan; ensuring compliance with established standards and instructions; assessing the sufficiency and application of internal checks; informing the Audit and Compliance Committee of irregularities detected and tracking accepted recommendations. These responsibilities are formalised in the Charter of the Internal Audit Service, which were updated by the Board of Directors in 2017.\n\nIn relation to the audit plans on the review of the SCIIF, in 2023, the Audit and Compliance Committee examined the internal audit on the review of the SCIIF carried out in 2022, which indicated that the Company complied with the standards defined within the regulatory framework in the principles proposed by the CNMV and making some proposals to improve its wording. Furthermore, the review of the SCIIF was included in the Internal Audit Plan of Activities for 2023, without any irregularities being detected. The review of the SCIIF was included among the audits of the Plan of Activities for 2024.\n\n(iv) Finally, Financial Management is responsible for designing, establishing and operating the SCIIF, as well as identifying and assessing risks and determining the checks to be established.\n\n- F.1.2 Indicate whether the following exist, especially in relation to the drawing up of financial information:\n- · Departments and/or mechanisms in charge of: (i) the design and review of the organisational structure; (ii) clear definition of lines of responsibility and authority with an appropriate distribution of tasks and functions; and (iii) ensuring that adequate\n\n{239}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/239/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV).

This obligation applies for the first time for the 2023 fiscal year, in addition to the information related to eligible and aligned activities required in 2022 associated with the climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation objectives. Consequently, no comparative information on eligibility has been included in the accompanying NFIS in relation to the other environmental objectives listed above or to the new activities included in the 15 climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation objectives. Furthermore, inasmuch as the information relating to 2022 was not required to be as detailed as in 2023, the disclosures included in the accompanying NFIS are not strictly comparable.

Introduction**\n\nThis non-financial information statement, which forms part of the consolidated directors' report of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. and subsidiaries, is published in compliance with Law 11/2018 of 28 December 2018, amending the Commercial Code, the Revised Spanish Companies Act approved by Royal Legislative Decree 1/2010 of 2 July 2010 and Spanish Audit Law 22/2015 of 20 July 2015, on non-financial and diversity information (Non-Financial Information and Diversity Law).\n\nCorporación Financiera Alba, S.A. is an investment firm which holds significant interests in various listed and unlisted companies operating in different sectors of the economy and owns real estate assets. Stakes in companies are also acquired through venture capital activities. The group, whose parent is Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A., includes Deyá Capital IV, SCR, S.A., Alba Europe, S.à.r.l., Alba Investments, S.à.r.l., Alba Patrimonio Inmobiliario, S.A.U., Alba KKR Core International, SCA and Alba KKR Core International Blocker, S.à.r.l. (hereinafter, Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A., and collectively, **Alba** or the **Company**).\n\nIn relation to the scope of this non-financial information statement for 2023, in March 2023 Alba sold its entire interest in the subsidiary Artá Partners, S.A., which owns 100% of the shares of the venture capital management company Artá Capital, SGEIC, S.A.U.\n\nAs a result of the loss of control over this company, Alba no longer exercises control over Nuadi, Facundo and Gesdocument (the **Subsidiaries**), and therefore, from the date of the sale, these subgroups are no longer considered Alba companies.\n\nThus, the information contained in this non-financial information statement in relation to the Subsidiaries is limited to the first quarter of 2023.\n\nHereinafter, Alba and its Subsidiaries shall be referred to collectively as the **Companies.**\n\nThis report also includes the EU Taxonomy report.\n\n# <span id=\"page-276-1\"></span>**1.1. About the non-financial information statement and its progress**\n\nThis non-financial information statement includes information on 2023 and is the fifth report prepared by Alba in accordance with the aforementioned regulations, having previously prepared four sustainability reports, from 2015 to 2018.\n\nDue to the loss of control of the three Alba Subsidiaries mentioned in the previous section, the quantitative information reflected in the previous non-financial information statement (2022) is not comparable with most of the quantitative information included in this nonfinancial information statement for 2023, due to the change in the perimeter reported. As information on the three Alba Subsidiaries is only shown for the first quarter of 2023, and to facilitate comparison of quantitative information in future non-financial information statements, quantitative data has been broken down by company for the purposes of simplification. Thus, the information on Alba covers\n\n{277}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/277/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The background is a solid teal color.\n\n2023 (1 January to 31 December), while the information on Gesdocument, Nuadi and Facundo spans the first quarter of 2023 (1 January to 31 March).\n\nThe non-financial information statement has been prepared on the basis of the reporting requirements of the Non-Financial Reporting and Diversity Law, which in turn requires the adoption of a national, European or international framework. A selection of indicators from the Global Reporting Initiative Standards, included in the Table of Contents of the nonfinancial information statement, have been taken into account, so reference would be made to selected GRI Standards.\n\nIn order to gradually adapt to Directive 2022/2464 of 14 December 2022 on Corporate Sustainability Reporting (CSRD), which came into force in January 2024 (though it will not apply to Alba until 2025), the content of this non-financial information statement has been prepared in accordance with the principles of stakeholder engagement, taking into account the principle of double materiality (proposed by the CSRD), transparency and integrity. In addition, balance, accuracy, timeliness, comparability, clarity and reliability of the data presented have been sought.\n\nLastly, it should be noted that this report has been subject to an independent, external assurance process, in accordance with the terms of the Non-Financial Information and Diversity Law.\n\n# <span id=\"page-277-0\"></span>**2.

Moreover, Alba has increased its interests in Acerinox, S.A. and CIE Automotive, S.A. by 0.77% and 0.31%, respectively, as a result of the redemption of own shares carried out by both companies.\n\nThis non-financial information statement has been prepared taking into account the companies that make up Alba, as well as information on the Subsidiaries that formed part of Alba during the first three months of the year only.\n\n# <span id=\"page-278-0\"></span>**2.1.2. Main activities and services carried out**\n\n**Alba's** principal activity is the acquisition of long-term holdings in listed and unlisted companies operating in various sectors of the economy, which are industry leaders, with solid management teams and profitable and sustainable growth models. In addition, Alba channels investments into smaller unlisted companies in Spain and Portugal in the form of venture capital. Alba also leases office and commercial properties.\n\nThe main activities and services carried out by Alba's Subsidiaries until the first quarter of 2023 were as follows:\n\n• **Nuadi** was first incorporated in Spain in 1958 as \"ADI\". Its principal activity is the manufacture and marketing of disc brake pad components for different applications: motorbikes, automobiles, road freight transport, public works and railways. Its main customers are brake pad and brake system manufacturers. For the past 60 years, Nuadi has been a major supplier of brake technologies and components to the after sales and original equipment markets, as well as an innovative driver of future technologies.\n\n{279}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/279/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The background is a dark teal color.\n\nIn 2021 Nuadi added Sadeca Automotive, founded in 1983, to its group and whose core business is the production of high quality electrical wiring harnesses and metal components for automotive, medical, household appliance and electronic applications.\n\n- **Gesdocument** has been providing tax, economic, financial, administrative, labour and accounting advisory services to individuals and legal entities since 1989, as well as recruitment services for third parties. It is a leading consultancy firm in its field with a nationwide presence.\n- **Facundo** is a business group incorporated in Palencia in 1944. Its principal activity is the production and distribution of nuts and snacks, with its main product being a variety of sunflower seeds. Other lines include mixed nuts, peanuts, pistachios, almonds, original corn ring snacks (Chaskis) and different flavours of potato crisps. Facundo's activity involves carefully selecting quality raw materials, and manufacturing and distributing its wide range of products.\n\n# <span id=\"page-279-0\"></span>**2.1.3. Main markets in which the Companies operate**\n\nIn terms of geography, **Alba** invests in both the domestic and international markets in order to diversify risk. It thus has investments in listed foreign companies such as Befesa, S.A., Technoprobe S.p.A. and unlisted companies such as Atlantic Aviation Holdings Corporation, Verisure Group and ERM International Group Limited.\n\nInternational investment is carried out preferably through local partners and in companies that are characterised by their stability, reliability and security, many of which are leaders in their sector.\n\nThrough its investments, Alba moves in the following main sectors: energy, food, security and industrial. The Company's stakes in entities and other assets are representative of its weight in the corporate structure and the responsibility, dedication and commitment to its investees.\n\nIn addition, Alba channels investments into smaller unlisted companies in Spain and Portugal through venture capital.\n\nAlba's real estate activity involves the leasing of high-level office and commercial properties, all of which are located in prime central or peripheral areas of Madrid.\n\nThe activities of Alba's Subsidiaries until the first quarter of 2023 were carried out in the following markets:\n\n• **Nuadi**, based in Spain, is also active internationally. It has group companies in Spain (Pamplona and Sentmenat), Morocco (Tangiers), China (Shanghai) and Mexico (Querétaro), the latter under construction in the first quarter of 2023. The subgroup has two divisions involved in the manufacture of components for the automotive sector. Its industrial activity is located in Sentmenat (Barcelona, Spain), from where it centralises its logistical operations and operational services such as engineering, quality and sales, and in Tangiers (Morocco), where its main factory is located.\n\n{280}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/280/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif letters. Below \"ALBA\" is the text \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white, sans-serif letters. The text is set against a teal background.\n\n- **Gesdocument** has five offices strategically located in Spain to offer nationwide coverage. It operates in the domestic (93.9%), European (4.6%) and international (1.5%) markets. Its main objective and strategy is to be the leading consultancy firm in Spain and Portugal through organic and inorganic transactions (integration of consultancy firms).\n- **Facundo**, with headquarters in Palencia (Spain), has two production facilities very close to each other from which it distributes its products throughout Spain. The first factory was built in Villada (Palencia) in 1968 and, in 1992, a new plant was built in Villamuriel de Cerrato (near Palencia), which manufactures potato crisps, snacks and appetizers. Los Girasoles, a group company, was in charge of its own distribution network in Palencia, Valladolid and Burgos until 1999, when Facundo commenced retail sales nationally. The Facundo brand is clearly positioned in terms of quality and has a very relevant share in the northwest quadrant of Spain.\n\n# <span id=\"page-280-0\"></span>**3. Identification and engagement of Alba's stakeholders**\n\nA basic principle of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is the proper management of stakeholder expectations. An organisation is considered to be socially responsible when it responds satisfactorily to its stakeholders' expectations and needs as regards how it functions.\n\nFrom a strategic and CSR perspective, stakeholders are important because of the possibility of intervening in the organisation's activity and results. When relations with them are well managed, existing risks are minimised and the possibility of generating competitive advantages is enhanced, improving the climate and reputation of the organisation or promoting learning and innovation.\n\n**Alba** deems it essential to know the expectations and needs of its stakeholders in order to manage them better and forge relationships of trust between the parties. Alba's strategy also focuses on maximising value by creating close and lasting relationships with all of them. It therefore works to improve active communication, with effective dialogue through different channels such as intranet, regular meetings, surveys, website, email, post, videoconferencing and the presentation of reports.\n\nIn order to identify the main stakeholders, special attention has been paid to the two stakeholder groups indicated in the CSRD that can affect or be affected by a company's decisions and actions. Some, but not all, stakeholders may belong to both groups:\n\n- Affected stakeholders: individuals or groups who have interests that are or may be affected - positively or negatively - by the company's activities and through its upstream and downstream value chain.\n- Users of sustainability information: individuals or groups who are users of information about the company.\n\nThe six main stakeholder groups are as follows:\n\n{281}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/281/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, serif font. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The entire logo is set against a teal background.\n\nImage /page/281/Figure/2 description: The image contains two diagrams illustrating stakeholders. The diagram on the left is a circular chart with the title \"STAKEHOLDERS ALBA GRUPO MARCH\" in the center. Surrounding the center are six circles connected by a blue-green line. Each circle represents a different stakeholder group: \"PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION\", \"DIRECTORS\", \"SHAREHOLDERS\", \"SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT\", \"EMPLOYEES\", and \"SUPPLIERS\". The diagram on the right is a flow chart with the title \"Affected stakeholders\" at the top. The chart shows two arrows pointing in opposite directions. The top arrow points to the right and includes the stakeholder groups \"SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT\", \"PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION\", \"SUPPLIERS\", and \"EMPLOYEES\". The bottom arrow points to the left and includes the stakeholder groups \"SHAREHOLDERS\", \"DIRECTORS\", and \"PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION\". Below the bottom arrow is the text \"Users of the information\".\n\n# <span id=\"page-281-0\"></span>**3.1. Stakeholder engagement channels**\n\n**Alba** is aware of the importance of knowing its stakeholders' expectations as regards its activities and their possible impact on the environment, both at an environmental and social level. For this reason, it fosters a fluid and transparent relationship with its stakeholders across all its businesses.\n\nBoth employees and other stakeholders have access to the Whistleblowing Channel on the corporate website. This channel can be used to safely report any acts or conduct that may be contrary to applicable regulations or Alba's Code of Ethics and Conduct. Suggestions, queries or proposals related to this Code of Ethics and Conduct may also be submitted.\n\nIn order to improve communication with its stakeholders, Alba made changes to the Whistleblowing Channel in 2023 to incorporate certain provisions of Law 2/2023 of 20 February 2023, which regulates the protection of informants who report regulatory infringements and corruption (the Whistleblower Law), though this law does not apply to Alba.\n\nFurthermore, Alba has a Communication Policy which sets out the principles and guidelines relating to the Company's communication of financial, non-financial and corporate information through the media, social networks and other communication channels, within a framework that guarantees respect for and transparency of information.\n\nThe most important stakeholder relations channels, both face-to-face and online, and the main global issues detected, both across the board and specific to each stakeholder, are indicated below:\n\n• **Shareholders and investors**: the Annual General Meeting is the primary conduit for shareholders to participate in Alba's governance. Informed and responsible shareholder participation is encouraged through\n\n{282}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/282/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif font. Below \"ALBA\" is the text \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The background is a teal color.\n\nmeasures such as an electronic shareholders' forum, accessible on the corporate website. An e-mail address is also available for enquiries and information requests.\n\nThe Company's management team is available for briefings with shareholders, institutional investors and analysts to present information of interest to these groups. Through its Investment Department, Alba communicates with the media and manages relations with investors and analysts.\n\n- **Managers and employees:** Alba's managers and employees have access to information and resources on the intranet on issues related to their work and Alba's activities.\n- **Suppliers:** communications with suppliers are carried out through face-to-face or telematic meetings, by telephone, e-mail and, when necessary, through reliable means of communication.\n- **Social environment:** Alba uses communication tools that can be accessed by any entity, organisation or interested person from the social, public-administrative or corporate domain. The CNMV website is the Company's official information channel for its shareholders, investors and the market as a whole. Alba's corporate website also provides relevant information and financial, non-financial and corporate information, as well as other information that may be of interest to shareholders, investors, institutions, proxy advisors and stakeholders related to the Company, including press releases. Whenever possible, content is uploaded to this corporate website simultaneously in Spanish and English to facilitate consultation from other countries. In addition, the Company can be contacted via a contact form on its website, at a postal address and by e-mail.\n\n# **4. Alba's dual materiality analysis**\n\nAlba has identified the financial, economic, social and environmental issues that are a priority for its stakeholders and its business, with a view to determining the information that may be of most interest and focussing its objectives and resources on managing and reporting them.\n\nUnder the framework of this commitment, and to meet the expectations of its stakeholders, in 2023 Alba updated its materiality analysis by applying a new approach to the dual materiality required by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), based on the EFRAG (European Commission Technical Advisory Group) guide and the cross-cutting ESRSs (European Sustainability Reporting Standards), published in July 2023, which establish guidelines on how to develop this type of analysis in organisations.\n\nThis methodology takes into consideration both the impact of the organisation's activities on its surroundings and the environment (impact materiality) and the impact of its surroundings on the value of the business (financial materiality).\n\nThe methodology applied to perform the dual materiality analysis, which enabled Alba to determine those areas of greatest relevance to its stakeholders, and which comprises four main phases, is detailed below:\n\n{283}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/283/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked on top of the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" which are written in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The background is a teal color.\n\n# Stage 1. Analysis of Alba's context and establishment of consultation mechanisms with stakeholders\n\nAlba has established the following consultation mechanisms as the most appropriate for understanding the sustainability expectations of its most relevant stakeholders, and for cooperating jointly in identifying the impacts, risks and opportunities (commonly known as \"IROs\") associated with the material issues, as well as their assessment:\n\n- Interviews with managers on the possible IROs arising from Alba's activity in its surroundings, as well as the impact of external factors on the Company's value and the surroundings, resulting from the profound changes arising from climate change.\n- *Focus group* with employees from different areas of Alba to identify and assess potential ESG IROs that are caused by the Company and affect the social or environmental surroundings.\n- Supplier questionnaire with a view to finding out their views on possible IROs generated by Alba on its surroundings, and their expectations in this connection.\n- Significant shareholder questionnaire on the financial materiality and the implications of sustainability-related risks, as well as their impact on the Company's interests, to identify and assess potential ESG IROs affecting Alba's business.\n\nGlobal and sector trends were also analysed, such as the Sustainability Accounting Standard Board (SASB) sector standard and a benchmarking of the sector, relating to possible risks, impacts and opportunities that should be taken into account for the materiality analysis, in order to have a global vision of Alba's surroundings.\n\n# Stage 2. Identification of positive and negative, potential and actual impacts\n\nTo identify and define the relevant ESG issues affecting Alba, an exhaustive internal and external analysis has been carried out, based on the topics and sub-topics proposed by the CSRD's ESRS standard. This analysis also includes an analysis of Alba and its sector in the press and a study of its internal policies, its previous sustainability reports, in order to align its approach, and also focuses on the due diligence procedures implemented at Alba to prevent, manage and mitigate the risks that most affect it. Thus, the IROs related to each potentially relevant issue were identified.\n\nOnce the potentially relevant issues have been identified, fluid communication with Alba's staff and management team has been maintained to determine and classify the positive and negative, real and potential impacts arising from these issues and affecting the Company, as well as to determine those impacts caused by its activities that affect its surroundings, with the aim of defining a definitive list of the relevant issues that have been assessed by stakeholders.\n\n# Stage 3. Impact assessment and identification of material issues\n\nThe definitive list of material issues was presented to the stakeholders through the consultation mechanisms mentioned in Phase 1, for them to assess the list of IROs relating to the relevant issues. The stakeholders assessed the\n\n{284}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/284/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif letters on a teal background. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white letters.\n\nseverity or magnitude of the impacts and their likelihood of occurrence, as well as the timeframe (short, medium or long) in which the impacts are expected to materialise.\n\nThe information obtained from the surveys and questionnaires was included as part of the internal sources of the dual materiality analysis. To identify the material issues from the relevant issues, the corresponding study groups from internal and external sources were ranked and weighted in both the impact materiality and financial materiality assessments.\n\n# Stage 4. Consolidation of information and reporting\n\nBased on the information obtained, the 17 main issues identified were set out in a double materiality matrix, in which the aspects considered relevant by stakeholders were prioritised based on a double analysis of information sources, and were consolidated, aligning them with the reporting areas established in the Non-Financial Reporting and Diversity Law:\n\n- *Impact materiality analysis:* materiality of issues from an inside-out view of the sustainability impacts - positive and negative - that the Company's activities generate or may generate.\n- *Financial materiality analysis:* materiality of issues from an outside-in view with a potential impact on the Company's value.\n\nTo estimate materiality, we have taken into account both the severity of the impact and the likelihood of these aspects occurring for stakeholders, as well as Alba's level of exposure thereto in terms of the magnitude of the financial effects and their likelihood of occurrence.\n\nThus, the following graph and table shows the prioritisation of the aspects considered in the dual materiality analysis, with those considered to be of medium and high priority - both for impact and financial materiality - on which the information reported in this Non-Financial Information Statement has been mainly focused:\n\n{285}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/285/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif font on a teal background. Below \"ALBA\" is the text \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font.\n\nAlba also has the following internal non-financial regulations, approved by the Board of Directors of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A., which cover the matters subject to reporting under Law 11/2018:\n\n1. Code of Ethics and Conduct: The Code of Ethics and Conduct, which includes regulation of the Whistleblowing Channel, is the formal manifestation of the values and principles that should govern the conduct of Alba employees, with the aim of achieving business ethics. This Code was updated in 2023, as mentioned in section 3.1 of this report.\n\n2. Anti-Corruption and Bribery Regulation: Alba includes the prevention of corruption in its policies and takes the necessary steps to ensure compliance with its oversight duties with a view to preventing the commission of offences referred to in its criminal prevention model. It has a Crime and Fraud Prevention Policy (2015) and a Crime Prevention Model (CPM) (latest version issued in 2020).\n\n3. Occupational Health and Safety Regulation: Alba's Code of Ethics and Conduct includes specific health and safety objectives, as well as manuals and procedures aimed at defining the guidelines and criteria to be followed with regard to occupational health and safety, with a view to ensuring that employees can carry out their duties in complete safety and in compliance with appropriate health and hygiene conditions.\n\n4.

This regulation provides for nondiscrimination and the prevention of harassment, as well as the total rejection of any behaviour that may violate the dignity of individuals. Alba is committed to the right to fair and respectful treatment by superiors, subordinates and peers and does not tolerate discrimination or harassment on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, gender, disability, age, language, opinion, ethnic origin, economic status, sexual orientation, trade union membership or any other personal or social condition or circumstance.

The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif letters. Below \"ALBA\" is the text \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white, sans-serif letters. The text is set against a teal background.\n\n- **Nuadi**: Code of Ethics; Equality Plan; Health, Safety, Environment and Quality Policy; Employee Welcome Plan, and Occupational Health and Safety Management System.\n- **Gesdocument**: Code of Ethics; Harassment Prevention Policy; Human Rights Policy; Anti-Corruption Policy; Manual on the Prevention of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism; Equality Plan; Harassment Prevention Code; Corporate Governance Policy; Human Rights Policy; and Sustainable Efficiency Plan (SOC).\n- **Facundo**: Protocol to combat sexual and gender-based harassment; Risk Management Policy; Equality Plan; Environmental Policy; and Quality and Food Safety Policy.\n\n# <span id=\"page-288-0\"></span>**6. Information on social and employee-related issues**\n\n**Alba**, both directly and through its investees, promotes and fosters corporate values and ethics to form accomplished, competent teams that strive to achieve greater business sustainability. Alba's commitment to equal opportunities ensures that selection, recruitment, employment and career development processes are governed exclusively by merit and skill requirements, thus avoiding any form of discrimination, and the cultivation of a working environment that encourages dignity and respect.\n\nAs far as social and employee-related issues are concerned, Alba's priority objectives are the following:\n\n- Promote a management model in the organisation based on non-discrimination, equal opportunities, diversity and health and safety in the workplace.\n- Work to improve the work-life balance and employee conditions, directing our efforts towards equal rights, obligations and opportunities.\n- Create stable jobs and nurture professional development aimed at potentiating human capital and retaining talent.\n\nInformation on the Subsidiaries in this non-financial information statement is limited to the first quarter of 2023:\n\n- **Nuadi** does not have a policy on recruitment, remuneration, training, etc., but does have an HR procedure covering training, jobs, performance management and staff motivation. Nuadi's first Equality Plan for the period 2022-2025 is currently in force.\n- **Gesdocument** has internal human resources policies and procedures: selection, recruitment, onboarding, training and termination procedures; remuneration policy; variable remuneration policy; holiday policy; and a flexible remuneration plan.\n- **Facundo** has a general holiday policy covering all its group companies. The company that manages the factories also has the following policies in place: a worklife balance policy, a salary policy, a training policy and a general recruitment policy to capture and retain talent.\n\n## <span id=\"page-288-1\"></span>**6.1. Information on employees**\n\nAware of the value of human capital, **Alba** strives to maintain favourable employment policies in line with the needs of its employees and the specific operational needs of the Company.

For this reason, average figures are not reflected in this report, as the difference does not significantly affect the interpretation of the data.\n\nAlthough the perimeter changes in the companies between 2023 and 2022, mentioned in section 1, distort the comparability of year-on-year data, the main aspects related to social and employee-related issues are described below.\n\nThe number of employees at Alba has fallen by 22% from 2022 to 2023, as the latter year does not include those of Artá Capital SGEIC, S.A., which in 2023 ceased to form part of Alba due to the sale of the shares of Artá Partners, S.A., as described in section 1 of this report.\n\n# <span id=\"page-289-0\"></span>**6.1.1.

Average employee remuneration**\n\n**Alba** reaffirms its commitment to maintaining a remuneration model for its employees that ensures effective application of the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. In addition, it is committed to ensuring that there are no gender-based or other discriminatory pay differentials, with remuneration based strictly on merit. Remuneration is based on salary bands adjusted to the level of responsibility, type of work and alignment with market remuneration for positions with equivalent conditions. This approach takes into account the financial sustainability of the Company in this area.\n\nIn relation to Alba, average salaries have increased from 2022 to 2023 in terms of gender, age and professional category. However, this data is not comparable, as these salary differences are exclusively due to the fact that the average remuneration of the employees of Artá Capital SGEIC, S.A. is not included in this last financial year. This situation also affects the results of the pay gap (section 6.2.3.).\n\n{295}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/295/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Average remuneration by professional category**\n\n# <span id=\"page-295-0\"></span>**6.2.2. Average remuneration of the Board of Directors**\n\nCorporación Financiera Alba, S.A. has a Board Remuneration Policy, the latest update of which was approved at the General Meeting on 19 June 2023.\n\nThis Policy stipulates that directors' remuneration should be in reasonable proportion to the importance of the Company, its economic situation at any given time and the market standards of comparable companies, and should be geared to promoting the long-term profitability and sustainability of the Company, incorporating the necessary safeguards to avoid excessive risk-taking and the rewarding of poor results.\n\n{296}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/296/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif font. Below the word \"ALBA\" is the phrase \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The background is a teal color.\n\nThe remuneration paid to directors in their capacity as such, as well as for sitting on Board Committees, is set at moderate amounts, especially when compared to those established for other listed companies.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. is composed of 10 members, 4 women and 6 men. The remuneration of the Board of Directors in 2023, by virtue of sitting on the Board and its Committees, and including the multi-year variable remuneration paid in the year, totalled\n\nEuros 6,080,500, with the average remuneration for men being Euros 916,333 and Euros 145,625 for women. This difference in average remuneration between male and female directors is due to the following: (i) the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen receive additional remuneration for the positions they hold on the Board, which is not received by the other directors; and, (ii) a bonus is included as a result of a variable remuneration plan for executive directors, agreed in 2020, and provided for in Alba's Remuneration Policy. Therefore, these differences are not the result of any gender bias since, in their capacity as directors, all members of the Board of Directors receive the same remuneration and a plus for sitting on different committees. The average remuneration of the members of the Board, excluding the aforementioned circumstances, is Euros 134,167 for male directors and Euros 145,625 for female directors.\n\nAs in the previous year, there are no commitments at 31 December 2023 in respect of pension supplements, guarantees or sureties granted to the Board of Directors.\n\n# <span id=\"page-296-0\"></span>**6.2.3. Pay gap**\n\nBoth **Alba** and its Subsidiaries are committed to a remuneration model for their employees that guarantees effective application of the principle of equal pay for work of equal value.\n\nThere are no discriminatory criteria, nor are any guidelines or criteria encouraged or maintained that could lead to a gender pay gap for similar categories, and the principle of equality is a key element of Alba's organisational culture.\n\nThe pay gap is measured as the difference between the average pay received by men and the average pay received by women, expressed as a percentage of the average pay of men. Alba has conducted this exercise including the data of its subsidiaries in Spain until the first quarter of 2023, but excluding the average remuneration of employees abroad, as these are not comparable with employees in Spain due to the different salary bands in each of these countries and the different currencies in which they are paid, the conversion of which into euros would significantly distort the data. For this reason, data on employees abroad and their average remuneration have been included in a separate section (see section 6.4.).\n\nIn 2023 there was a change of perimeter at Alba, as indicated above, with movement in the number of employees compared to 2022, so it is not possible to strictly monitor and compare the gross pay gap figure for the Companies, which in 2023 was 63% compared to 42% in 2022.\n\n{297}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/297/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font. The background is a dark teal color.\n\nIn addition, this aggregate gross pay gap figure does not adequately represent the situation in this area, given that the salaries of each professional category are very different in each company, and in some professional categories the presence of women is residual.\n\nIn order to provide more representative data, the pay gap data by professional category in each of the Companies referred to in this report is broken down below, with no comparison between 2023 and 2022 for the reasons indicated above.\n\n|             | 2023       |                      |                                             | 2022       |                      |                                             |\n|-------------|------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| COMPANY     | MANAGEMENT | MIDDLE<br>MANAGEMENT | OPERATORS<br>AND<br>ADMINISTRATIVE<br>STAFF | MANAGEMENT | MIDDLE<br>MANAGEMENT | OPERATORS<br>AND<br>ADMINISTRATIVE<br>STAFF |\n| ALBA        | n/a        | -12.20%              | 1.50%                                       | n/a        | 55.00%               | -16.00%                                     |\n| NAUDI       | 27.52%     | 66.56%               | 21.91%                                      | 22%        | n/a                  | 18.00%                                      |\n| GESDOCUMENT | 25.44%     | 3.33%                | 5.73%                                       | 3.00%      | 8.00%                | 8.00%                                       |\n| FACUNDO     | n/a        | 36.30%               | 9.10%                                       | n/a        | 36.00%               | 9.00%                                       |\n\n**Figure 16.

Organisation of work3**\n\n**Alba**'s Code of Ethics and Conduct includes the Company's respect for the personal and family lives of its professionals, and implements measures aimed at facilitating the enjoyment of flexibility and a work-life balance that promote this necessary balance for employees, such as the possibility of remote working. Special days are established at different times of the year: Easter and Christmas, and certain bank holiday weekends. The working day in July and August is reduced. No meetings are held outside of office hours, to encourage digital disconnection.\n\nIn 2023, Alba did not have to adopt any furlough schemes (ERTEs).\n\nThe actions carried out in this connection in the Subsidiaries, which were controlled by Alba only in the first quarter of 2023, are the following:\n\n• **Nuadi** already established shift flexibility measures in 2021, which have remained in place since then. The administrative department has flexible start and finish times and lunchbreaks, as well as the option to leave earlier on Fridays. The other operational departments have rotating shifts to spread the workload.\n\nAt Sadeca there are also different work shifts, which help to improve organisation, efficiency and the work-life balance.\n\n- **Gesdocument** has implemented policies and measures to disconnect from work. In its \"flexi-work\" policy, the ability to remote work has been improved. This subsidiary also offers flexible start and finish times and lunchbreaks. It has a holiday policy that is better than the applicable collective bargaining agreement.\n- **Facundo** has work-life balance measures in place. In the centres that are not factories, no meetings are held and, except in urgent situations or force majeure circumstances, no calls are made or mails are sent, outside of working hours. A reminder of the right to disconnect from work is included in the electronic equipment delivery forms. With the exception of the Villamuriel de Cerrato factory, which has work shifts in place, the rest of the centres do not work on Friday afternoons, and there are flexible start and finish times. An Equality Plan has been agreed with factory personnel to encourage the use of new information technologies (conference calls, telephone calls, etc.) as a means of achieving a balance between employees' personal lives and work lives, reducing, whenever possible, travel, as well as holding, whenever possible, internal meetings and training sessions during working hours.\n\n# <span id=\"page-299-1\"></span>**6.5.1.

Health and safety4**\n\nAlba and its Subsidiaries have measures in place to monitor and promote health and safety in the workplace. Initiatives include carrying out training activities in this connection for employees, health monitoring programmes and external audits to verify that the procedures established in this field are being applied correctly.\n\n**Alba** has specific health and safety commitments that are set out in its Code of Ethics and Conduct and in the procedures and manuals established for this purpose. All employees have the option of undergoing an annual medical check-up. In 2023, a course on first aid, basic life support and semi-automatic defibrillation was given, and an occupational health and safety assessment was carried out.\n\nAlba's subsidiaries had in place the following measures in the first quarter of 2023:\n\n• To comply with its health and safety policy, **Nuadi** has an occupational health and safety management system, integrating preventive activities in all aspects of management and at all hierarchical levels. It has an occupational health and safety plan, approved by management, adopted by all its organisational structure, and known by all its workers, and its essential instruments include risk assessments and the planning of preventive activities. Furthermore, periodic surveillance of workers' state of health is carried out, bearing in mind the risks inherent in their work.

Social relations5**\n\nAlba and its Subsidiaries strive for effective and meticulous management of its labour relations with employees, with a view to ensuring compliance with the labour rights of all employees. Furthermore, social dialogue is based on the different collective bargaining agreements in force, which guarantees respect for and adherence to the principles set out in each agreement.\n\nThe collective bargaining agreements that apply are listed below:\n\n- For **Alba**, the Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Offices and Firms Sector of the Madrid region.\n- For **Nuadi**, the Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Iron and Steel Sector of Navarra. Relations in China are governed by a State workers' agreement, and in Morocco, there is no concept of an agreement, but they do have rules based on a \"Workers' Statute\" with a workers' committee.\n- For **Gesdocument**, the Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Offices and Firms Sector of Catalonia, Bilbao, the Madrid region, the Valencia region and Zaragoza.\n- For the **Facundo** subgroup, the Food Trade Agreement of Valladolid, the Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Offices and Firms sector of Palencia, the General Trade Agreement of Palencia, the Food Trade Agreement and a Collective Company Agreement in one of the group companies.\n\nAll employees of Alba and its Subsidiaries in Spain are covered by collective bargaining agreements.\n\nIn those companies where it is applicable, there are also workers' committees and/or union representatives who ensure compliance with the principles established in the applicable agreements and the establishment of fluid means of communication between all workers and the relevant bodies of the company.\n\n# <span id=\"page-302-1\"></span>**6.8. Training6**\n\n**Alba** has training procedures adapted to the needs of its employees, which take into account the characteristics of the duties they perform, their careers and their professional development, so that resources are focused on the requirements of each job position and the current market. Alba offers the training it considers useful for its employees, who can also request the training they consider necessary for the correct performance of their duties.\n\nIn 2023, employees were able to access the online and face-to-face training they needed. Worthy of note is the ESG training that has been provided to all employees and to the board of directors.\n\nTraining in the Subsidiaries is organised as follows:\n\n• **Nuadi** has an employee welcome plan with the necessary information packages for new employees. In addition, Nuadi detects the training needs of its employees mainly from the performance evaluations of its\n\n<sup>5</sup> GRI 3-3 and GRI 2-30\n\n<sup>6</sup> GRI 3-3 and GRI 404-1\n\n{303}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/303/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The heads of each functional area are responsible for determining the training needs of their employees, which are set out in the training proposal sent annually to the human resources department.\n\n- **Gesdocument** has several training policies for its employees: internal training provided by its specialists; external training for all employees if it is required for the job position, with a view to them improving professionally or developing skills; and a foreign language training policy, which is partially funded by the company and the rest is paid by means of a flexible remuneration. Career plans are also offered to all employees, from junior team members (interns and assistants) to seniors team members and team leaders. In addition, this subsidiary collaborates in creating jobs by working with different universities to offer internships to students to facilitate the start of their professional development and the possibility of them becoming part of the group's workforce.\n- **Facundo** has a training policy for one of its companies. In the rest of its group companies, when an employee or the company detects a need for training, the need is assessed. Fundae training credits are used.\n\nThe training hours for employees of Alba and its Subsidiaries for 2023 are detailed below, taking into account that only the first quarter of 2023 is provided for the latter, thus not allowing for a sufficient comparison with 2022:\n\n|                      | 2023       |                      |                                             |       |\n|----------------------|------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------|\n| COMPANY              | MANAGEMENT | MIDDLE<br>MANAGEMENT | OPERATORS<br>AND<br>ADMINISTRATIVE<br>STAFF | TOTAL |\n| ALBA                 | 101        | 262                  | 1,642                                       | 2,005 |\n| NUADI                | 93         | 35                   | 276                                         | 404   |\n| GESDOCUMENT          | 9          | 318                  | 453                                         | 780   |\n| FACUNDO              | 0          | 0                    | 0                                           | 0     |\n| TOTAL COMPANIES 2023 | 203        | 615                  | 2,370                                       | 3,189 |\n| TOTAL COMPANIES 2022 | 444        | 1,754                | 2,533                                       | 4,731 |\n\n**Figure 25.

The background is a teal color.\n\nThe premises in which the general meetings are held are universally accessible for people with special needs.\n\nAll buildings owned by Alba have measures in place to ensure universal accessibility for people with disabilities, in compliance with all applicable regulations. In addition, although not compulsory, accessible toilets have been installed on all floors.\n\nAlba's subsidiaries had the following measures in place in the first quarter of 2023:\n\n- **Nuadi** has signed a collaboration agreement with Areté Activa covering the 2023 to 2025 period, for the implementation and roll out of actions linked to the measures agreed in the 1st Nuadi Equality Plan, signed in 2021. The non-discrimination and prevention of harassment principles set out in the Code of Ethics and Conduct also apply.\n- **Gesdocument** has an equality plan, which is the basis for the mandatory training on gender equality provided for all employees: \"Fostering equality in Gesdocument\". This training is also included in the initial training plan for new hires. This subsidiary also has a harassment prevention code and a confidential internal ethics channel available to all employees. Moreover, its offices comply with the measures required to facilitate access for people with disabilities.\n- **Facundo** has an equality plan, which describes the measures for its implementation and development. Furthermore, in the event that in a selection process there are two or more finalists that equally meet the requirements and fit in the role for the position offered, preference is given to the candidate who belongs to an under-represented group. This subsidiary also has a policy of bringing the workplace closer to employees' homes for the care of children under 12 years of age or dependent family members with a disability rating of over 65%. In addition, factory visits are universally accessible.\n\n# <span id=\"page-304-1\"></span><span id=\"page-304-0\"></span>**7. Information on environmental matters**\n\n# **7.1. Policies8**\n\nAs part of Alba's commitment to its stakeholders, the Board of Directors of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. has approved various internal policies and regulations, such as the Sustainability and Investment Policies and the Code of Ethics and Conduct, which sets out the guidelines for action on environmental issues. Alba's Code of Ethics and Conduct sets out its commitment to the environment, both in terms of its direct activity and in the environmentally responsible behaviour of the companies in which it invests.\n\nAlba's Sustainability Policy reflects its unwavering commitment to preserving the natural environment, reducing the negative impact of its activities and highlighting the fight against climate change. Based on the definitions of these\n\n8 GRI 3-2 and GRI 3-3\n\n{305}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/305/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The background is a teal color.\n\ncommitments, Alba focuses on pollution prevention and the responsible and sustainable use of resources, as well as appropriate waste management. Furthermore, since 2017 its Investment Policy has included criteria for assessing responsible investments, ensuring that it invests in companies with sound environmental practices.\n\nIn addition, as a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, Alba is actively committed to environmental conservation, abiding by legal requirements and carrying out its activities while endeavouring to minimise potential environmental impacts. The environmental Principles of the Global Compact use, as their baseline framework, three principles enshrined in the earlier Rio Declaration on the Environment and Development, whereby companies should adopt a precautionary approach that favours the environment, foster initiatives that promote greater environmental responsibility and promote the development and spread of environmentally-friendly technologies.\n\nIn view of the activities carried out by Alba, the details of which are set out under section 2.1.2 of this report, no significant environmental impact has been identified either at present or potentially in the future.\n\nEnvironmental topics are not among the most salient matters for its stakeholders. The most significant issues, as can be observed in the materiality analysis in section 4, are the topics related to sustainable resource use and the circular economy, and those related to energy and energy efficiency measures.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, Alba's Subsidiaries have the following environmental regulations and measures in place:\n\n• Nuadi has a certified Environmental Management System that meets the stipulations of ISO 14001:2015. This system contains an Environmental Policy that completely respects the environment where it operates. It also has an Environmental Management Department that involves the entire organisation in these issues. It has taken out public liability insurance for all types of environmental incident, although no such incidents have taken place. Implementation of its Waste Reduction Plan began in 2020.\n\nSadeca's environmental targets are included in the company's overall objectives. Simulations are carried out and environmental incidents are monitored as KPIs.\n\n- **Gesdocument** applies environmental criteria across its activity and has somebody in charge of executing the procedures for the prevention and management of environmental and health and safety impacts, despite the fact that its activity has little impact on the environment.\n- **Facundo** has an Environmental Policy, the main principles of which are as follows: (i) to ensure compliance with the environmental legislation and regulations applicable to its facilities and operations; (ii) to apply the necessary measures to prevent pollution, minimise waste generation and make responsible use of material and energy resources; and (iii) to promote environmental training and awareness among all employees. The environmental control function is carried out by its quality department, the activity of which is geared towards preventing environmental risks and promoting ways to achieve a sustainable organisation.\n\n{306}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/306/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif font on a teal background. Below \"ALBA\" is the text \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font.\n\n# <span id=\"page-306-1\"></span><span id=\"page-306-0\"></span>**7.2. Environmental management and performance**\n\n# **7.2.1. Energy and climate change9**\n\nOne of Alba's commitments, as set out in its Sustainability Policy, revolves around mitigating climate change and minimising the impact that its activities may have in this regard. Given the nature of its activity, the impacts are monitored using indicators that measure energy consumption and the generation of the associated emissions. Furthermore, for the purposes of this Non-Financial Information Statement, the indicators have been calculated in accordance with the EU Taxonomy of Sustainable Finance Regulation 2020/852. These indicators help Alba to ascertain and optimise the impact of its activities on climate change and the natural environment, encouraging the consideration of sustainable and environmentally-friendly business models.\n\nAlba will continue to work on identifying, assessing and managing climate change risks and opportunities, as well as evaluating the financial impacts that these could have on its activity.\n\nAt **Alba**, energy consumption is mainly from the use of lighting, air conditioning and IT equipment at its owned offices and buildings (Castellana 42, Castellana 44, Castellana 89 and the Oasis buildings). With a view to reducing this consumption, various energy efficiency measures have been implemented, such as the replacement of traditional light bulbs with LEDs, building renovations to increase energy efficiency and external energy efficiency controls and audits, all of which helps Alba to reduce its environmental impact.\n\nIn addition, the Castellana 89 building has held the LEED Gold Seal awarded by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) since 2021, which guarantees the eco-efficiency of the building. In addition, an agreement was signed in 2023 to ensure the supply of energy from 100% renewable sources. A process got underway in 2022 to remove gas boilers and replace chillers with heat pumps to further improve energy efficiency and reduce Alba's carbon footprint. The above-mentioned renovations were completed in 2023. New aerothermal chillers with heat pumps were installed and three of the four existing boilers were removed, reducing natural gas consumption to instances of extreme necessity only. In addition, a study has gotten underway to install photovoltaic panels for self-supply on the building's roof.\n\nA photovoltaic plant has been in operation at the Oasis building since January 2021, providing part of the energy needed for the building's installations and services, with a consequent reduction in electricity consumption. Production during the year totalled 194,979 kWh, up 62% on the previous year. This avoided the equivalent of 34,364 kg of CO2e being released into the atmosphere (CNMC emission factor). In addition, the potable water system has been replaced to limit leakage and consumption meters have also been installed.\n\nAt the end of the 2022 financial year, work began on the ESG improvement study for the Castellana 42 building. In addition to the foregoing, work was also carried out in 2023 to improve the building's energy efficiency and ensure optimum working conditions, as well as the health and\n\n<sup>9</sup> GRI 3-3, GRI 302-1, GRI 302-2, GRI 302-4 and GRI 305-1\n\n{307}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/307/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Key improvements include the replacement of light fittings with LED panels, which reduce energy consumption and optimise the use of lighting through motion sensors and smart programming; the enhanced insulation of façades and roofs, which improves the thermal insulation of the building and helps to reduce heat loss in winter and heat input in summer. This reduces the need for heating and cooling, respectively, and contributes to greater thermal comfort for occupants; the installation of low consumption timed taps, which reduces wasteful consumption of drinking water in the building; the installation of individual water consumption meters; air ionisation with monitored air quality, which contributes to improving indoor air quality by reducing the presence of pollutants and pathogens and promotes a healthier environment for building occupants. The continuous monitoring of air quality is essential to ensure its effectiveness and to maintain optimal levels of comfort and health. A roof terrace with vegetation has also been created for tenants' use and enjoyment. This building has a 100% renewable electricity supply contract and is currently undergoing a pre-assessment process for LEED certification.\n\nThe Castellana 89 and Castellana 42 buildings have vinyl solar filters on their façades that reduce solar radiation and, therefore, the energy needed for air conditioning.\n\nWork continued in 2023 to prepare the Castellana 44 building for its comprehensive refurbishment. This includes the replacement of its façades and new, more efficient installations, all with the aim of increasing its energy efficiency and sustainability and achieving better levels of comfort and maintenance. These works will also enable it to secure sustainable building certification.\n\nLikewise, six electric vehicle charging points were installed at the Castellana 42 building in 2023. The Oasis and Castellana 89 buildings have had electric vehicle charging points since 2021, which can be used by their users after arranging the service with the electricity supplier.\n\nThe Castellana 42 and Oasis buildings have bicycle parking facilities to promote cycling, which is an alternative to other more polluting modes of travel.\n\nThe environmental performance of Alba's Subsidiaries during the first quarter of 2023 is detailed below:\n\n- **Nuadi** has installed LED lighting throughout its plant in Spain as a measure to reduce energy consumption.\n- As part of its efforts to respect the environment and optimise resource use, **Gesdocument** has installed LED lights, fostered the elimination of paper, arranged cleaner energy supply agreements, and contributed to the progressive reduction of its carbon footprint by eliminating unnecessary travel and using, wherever possible, trains instead of planes.\n- **Facundo** is committed to improving the energy performance of both its facilities and equipment, taking into consideration opportunities to improve the design and procurement of energy-efficient products and services. It has continued to replace conventional light fittings with LEDs and has forged ahead with the installation of stepper motors,\n\n{308}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/308/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Greenhouse gas emissions**\n\n*Note: the 2023 data for Subsidiaries refers to Nuadi and Facundo's activities for Scope 1 emissions.*\n\nAlba's electricity consumption stems from the operation of its buildings. Alba's electricity consumption fell by 11% with respect to 2022, thanks to energy efficiency improvements, in particular the above-mentioned improvement at the Castellana 89 and Castellana 42 buildings. Energy self-supply at the Oasis building in 2023 came in at 125,877 kWh, up 34% on 2022. Energy efficiency certifications were renewed in 2023 at the Castellana 89, Castellana 42 and Oasis buildings,\n\n{309}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/309/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The background is a teal color.\n\nsecuring better ratings and a reduction in CO₂ emissions.\n\nNatural gas consumption was down by a considerable 64% with respect to 2022, due to the removal of three natural gas boilers at the Castellana 89 building.\n\nWith regard to GHG emissions, as indicated in other sections of this Report, the change in the scope of consolidation in 2023 prevents a comparison and strict monitoring of that year's data with previous years. However, Alba's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint are reflected in the share of energy consumed from renewable sources, rising from 17.48% in 2022 to 50.43% in 2023. Across Alba's buildings, 54.14% of total energy consumed is from renewable sources, of which 6.18% is from its own clean self-supply. As of the first quarter of 2023, the Castellana 89 building terminated its conventional energy contract and entered into an agreement for the supply of energy from certified renewable sources, which avoided the release of 347,006 kg CO₂e into the atmosphere in 2023. Alba also offset 100% of its transport emissions with Cabify. In this regard it offset the kilometres travelled using this service, which amounted to 11 kg of CO₂.\n\n# <span id=\"page-309-0\"></span>**7.2.2. Sustainable resource use and circular economy10**\n\n**Alba** has adopted a raft of measures which, as mentioned above, aim to improve efficiency and foster the sustainable and responsible use of resources. Given that the main material used in its activities is paper, to order to minimise consumption, Alba has a digital archive in place for all departments, through which files can be consulted, downloaded and shared. In addition, all paper used is certified with the FSC environmental stamp.\n\nThe environmental performance of Alba's Subsidiaries during the first quarter of 2023, in terms of the sustainable use of resources, is detailed below:\n\n• The main raw material input in **Nuadi**'s production process are steel coils of various sizes. After the manufacturing process, surplus material is sent to a waste metal management company. The reduced size of the waste shavings make them highly suitable for use in automatic dosing systems at foundries or steel mills to control the composition of the molten mix. The waste management company sends the vast majority of surplus material to a steel mill located some\n\n40 kilometres away, where they are converted into engine blocks and cylinder heads for reuse in the automotive manufacturing sector. As for water, this will feature in future phases of its Waste Reduction Plan.\n\nWith regard to Sadeca, this company's water consumption is only for human and sanitary purposes and is not used in the industrial process. The company uses recycled raw materials such as polyamide or PVC injection pellets, harnessing the injection waste of both for subsequent sale as a by-product for the manufacture of recycled material. The waste that is recycled and recovered includes paper and cardboard, film, wood from pallets, leftover stainless steel parts, cable and nonhazardous waste.\n\n• For **Gesdocument**, the water consumption at its various branches remains insignificant and has been assumed by the lessors of the properties. Although there is no formal waste management, Gesdocument\n\n10 GRI 3-3, GRI 301-1 and GRI 303-3\n\n{310}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/310/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The background is a solid teal color.\n\ncontinues to promote digitalisation as opposed to the use of paper.\n\n• In its manufacturing processes, **Facundo** has always sought to optimise the use of natural resources and remains steadfast in its commitment to carry out its activity in a sustainable manner, using the most advanced techniques available and adopting the necessary measures to reduce its environmental impact. It has therefore paid particular attention to improving its production equipment, so that there are no breakdowns or leaks leading to raw material losses. The same can be said of water supply networks to avoid uncontrolled water leakage.\n\nIn view of market quality requirements and to prevent food waste, it has continued to improve conveyor elements, such as belts and vibration equipment to minimise waste. Moreover, all manufactured products are stored at room temperature, which has a favourable environmental impact, and the vehicles used to transport products comply with current regulations. The primary suppliers of maize and potato submitted the relevant agricultural records that show the traceability of the treatments carried out. The \"dry\" organic waste is used as animal feed.\n\nThe following figure shows the consumption of materials by Alba and its Subsidiaries up until 31 March 2023:\n\n| COMPANY                 | 2023                      |                           |                          |                              |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                         | WATER<br>CONSUMED<br>(m³) | PAPER<br>CONSUMED<br>(kg) | OTHER MATERIALS          |                              |\n|                         |                           |                           | FILM<br>CONSUMED<br>(kg) | STEEL<br>CONSUMED<br>(tonne) |\n| ALBA                    | 32,678                    | 1,068                     | n.a.                     | n.a.                         |\n| TOTAL ALBA 2023         | 32,678                    | 1,068                     | n.a.                     | n.a.                         |\n| TOTAL ALBA 2022         | 29,896                    | 930                       | n.a.                     | n.a.                         |\n| NUADI                   | 1,302                     | 268                       | n.a.                     | 6,480                        |\n| GESDOCUMENT             | n.a.                      | 140                       | n.a.                     | n.a.                         |\n| FACUNDO                 | 3,065                     | 122,355                   | 35,079                   | n.a.                         |\n| TOTAL SUBSIDIARIES 2023 | 4,367                     | 122,763                   | 35,079                   | 6,480                        |\n| TOTAL SUBSIDIARIES 2022 | 9,987                     | 5,764                     | 141,000                  | n.a.                         |\n| TOTAL COMPANIES 2023    | 37,045                    | 123,831                   | 35,079                   | 6,480                        |\n| TOTAL COMPANIES 2022    | 39,883                    | 6,694                     | 141,000                  | n.a.                         |\n\n# **Raw materials used**\n\n#### **Figure 28. Raw materials used**\n\n*Note: 2023 includes the Nuadi data for all applicable countries. Nuadi's steel consumption excludes data from Morocco due to the difficulty in obtaining data from that unit.*\n\nGiven the diversity of Alba's Subsidiaries, the consumption of materials is likewise heterogenous and does not affect all the Subsidiaries to the same extent. This is the case of Facundo's film consumption, for example, which amounted to 141,000 kg during the first quarter of 2023. As mentioned earlier, the change in the scope of consolidation prevents a comparison and strict monitoring of this year's data with that of previous years.\n\n{311}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/311/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The background is a solid teal color.\n\nAt **Alba**, on the other hand, the consumption of natural resources has increased slightly compared to 2022. Water consumption increased by 9% as the buildings reached almost full occupancy in 2023. Paper consumption has increased by 15%.\n\nAlba continues to channel efforts into reducing its consumption and adopting specific measures to cut down waste generation and ensure its correct treatment and handling. Water fountains are installed at Alba's offices and all employee have been given their own glass bottle and personalised mug to avoid using disposable cups. Improvements continue to be made in terms of waste management, such as coffee capsules, batteries and other office waste, as well as in the recycling of polluting waste such as printer toner cartridges.\n\nAt the buildings operated by Alba, taps fitted with timers have continued to be installed to reduce the consumption of drinking water, as well as dual flush cisterns and individual water consumption meters, which result in better water use. The water leakage prevention measures mentioned earlier have been implemented at the Oasis building to avoid water wastage.\n\nThe data below shows the waste generated by Alba and its Subsidiaries up until 31 March 2023:\n\n| COMPANY                 | 2023<br>WASTE GENERATED (tonne) |               |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------|\n|                         | HAZARDOUS                       | NON-HAZARDOUS |\n| ALBA                    | 0                               | 163           |\n| TOTAL ALBA 2023         | 0                               | 163           |\n| TOTAL ALBA 2022         | n.a.                            | n.a.          |\n| NUADI                   | 114                             | 65            |\n| GESDOCUMENT             | n.a.                            | n.a.          |\n| FACUNDO                 | 5                               | 27            |\n| TOTAL SUBSIDIARIES 2023 | 119                             | 91            |\n| TOTAL SUBSIDIARIES 2022 | 429                             | 19,272        |\n| TOTAL COMPANIES 2023    | 119                             | 254           |\n| TOTAL COMPANIES 2022    | 429                             | 19,272        |\n\n# **Waste generated**\n\n#### **Figure 29.

This Code affects all persons who, in the discharge of their duties and conduct of their employment, commercial and professional relationships, have dealings with the Company. The following such values are particularly noteworthy:\n\n- Respect for human rights and commitment to the Global Compact, of which it is a Signatory Partner.\n- Ethical and lawful conduct.\n- Fair and respectful treatment, based on equal opportunities and non-discrimination.\n- Respect for the environment.\n- Respect for the interests of other persons related to the Company.\n- Prudence in the pursuit of the Company's activities, risk-taking and dealings with customers.\n- Information processing based on rigour, integrity and transparency.\n\nThe above Code lays down mandatory rules of conduct for Alba's governing bodies, executives and employees, as well as for third parties that have dealings with Alba.\n\nAlso, given the importance of internal whistleblowing channels, there is a procedure for reporting -confidentially and in certain cases anonymously- any acts or conduct occurring within the Company or in dealings with third parties that may be contrary to the applicable regulations or to Alba's Code of Ethics and Conduct, or that may be detrimental to Alba. The Whistleblowing Channel may be used by all persons inside and outside the Company, the latter including Alba's customers, suppliers, contractors and partners. As noted in section 3.1 of this report, the Whistleblowing Channel was adapted to certain provisions of the Whistleblowing Law in 2023.\n\nAlba provides its employees with a reminder of the Code of Ethics and Conduct each year. The reminder circulated in 2023 reiterated the general rules of conduct to be followed, the functions of the Monitoring Committee and the procedure for monitoring compliance with the Code and the Whistleblowing Channel, which guarantees whistleblower confidentiality and establishes the scenarios in which anonymous communications are accepted.\n\nNo complaints or Code of Ethics and Conduct-related suggestions or queries were received in 2023.\n\nAlba's subsidiaries also had measures of this kind in place in the first quarter of 2023:\n\n<sup>11</sup> GRI 3-3, GRI 3-2, GRI 2-23, GRI 2-26 and GRI 406-1\n\n{313}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/313/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Employees can access the training course material at any time from the GD Avanza internal training platform.\n\nIt is worth noting that no complaints were received via the company's whistleblowing channel between 1 January and 31 March 2023.\n\n• **Facundo** does not have a code of ethics in place and applies the provisions of the applicable collective bargaining agreements.\n\nThere were no complaints relating to human rights violations in the first quarter of 2023.\n\n# <span id=\"page-313-0\"></span>**8.2. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery management12**\n\n**Alba** takes the necessary steps to ensure compliance with its oversight duties with a view to preventing the commission of the offences referred to in its crime prevention model. Ethical values and responsible conduct permeate the everyday lives of everyone who forms part of Alba. To safeguard these values and, in particular, combat all forms of corruption, the Board of Directors of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. approved the Crime and Fraud Prevention Policy in 2015.\n\nOn the back of this Policy, a Crime Prevention Manual was established, the latest update of which was approved in 2020 by the Audit and Compliance Committee. This Manual constitutes the reference framework of the Crime Prevention Model. The Manual sets out a series of effective measures aimed at preventing, detecting and reacting to criminal conduct. It applies to directors, executives and employees, and enables situations involving the potential commission of wrongdoings to be monitored. The principles upon which it is based, namely, coordination and participation of all professionals, transparency and communication, effective action, training, etc., ensure the proper implementation, monitoring and improvement of the Model.\n\nContracts with third parties also contain clauses requiring such third parties to monitor situations involving a risk of crimes, infringements or serious irregularities, and to reject corruption and fraud, including extortion, bribery and kickbacks.\n\nMoreover, Alba's general rules of conduct in the Code of Ethics and Conduct specifically mention bribes, commissions, gifts and presents, and Alba is\n\n12 GRI 3-3, GRI 3-2, GRI 2-23 and GRI 2-26\n\n{314}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/314/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

It likewise forbids other individuals or entities from doing so with their employees. Hospitality and business courtesies in favour of public officials in tenders in which Alba participates, facilitation payments and donations to trade unions, political parties and donations or sponsorships to obtain favourable treatment for Alba are prohibited. Only gifts of negligible financial value may be accepted.\n\nAlba's Code of Ethics and Conduct also refers to compliance with the provisions on the prevention of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.\n\nAlba's subsidiaries also had measures of this kind in place up to 31 March 2023.\n\n- **Nuadi** has several documents over and above the aforementioned Code of Ethics, which regulate and control any such conflicts of interest as may arise in the conduct of the business and cases relating to intellectual property and the confidentiality of the information handled by the company, which are applicable both in Spain and in China. These documents are the \"Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Agreement Non Solicitation Agreement - NUADI Europe\" and the \"Code of Ethics and Business Conduct - NUADI Europe v.2\".\n- **Gesdocument** has several internal codes in place in respect of the fight against corruption within the company, such as the 2018 Harassment Prevention Code, the 2020 Money Laundering Prevention Manual, the 2020 Corporate Report and a 2018 Anti-Corruption Policy.\n- **Facundo** does not have a policy in place in this area, as the nature of its business means that the risk of corruption and money laundering is low. An analysis of these risks has revealed the risk of the misappropriation of small amounts of cash during distribution to stores. To ensure control, the money is deposited and checked by different people. Although the risk associated with bribery practices is also very low, efforts are made to maintain good business practices.\n\n## <span id=\"page-314-1\"></span><span id=\"page-314-0\"></span>**9.

Alba's commitments to sustainable development13**\n\n**Alba'**s Sustainability Policy establishes the principles for, and scope of, its contribution to improving personal well-being and fostering the economic and social development of the communities in which it operates, while creating value for its various internal and external stakeholders. Alba's primary responsibility as regards sustainability is to ensure the utmost diligence and integrity throughout the investment process. To this end, its investments are based on three principles:\n\n- A long-term vision.\n- Responsible management, selecting the assets over which it has the greatest capacity for influence and transformation.\n\n<sup>13</sup> GRI 3-3, GRI 3-2, GRI 2-6, GRI 2-28 and GRI 2-29\n\n{315}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/315/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, serif font. Below it, \"GRUPO MARCH\" is written in a smaller, sans-serif font. The entire logo is enclosed in a teal box.\n\n• Mitigation of non-financial risks, including social, environmental and governancerelated risks.\n\nAlong with these principles, others such as the pursuit of excellence, the fostering of transparency, integrity and business ethics, the adoption of best corporate governance practices and the promotion of human rights are also noteworthy.\n\nIn addition, Alba is committed to seeking a balance between financial profitability and sustainable development, in terms of its impact on its surrounding community and society as a whole, respecting both the environment and the interests of shareholders, employees and other groups and individuals with which it interacts.\n\nAlba is stakeholder-focussed and has in place the communication channels necessary to be able to respond to all of its stakeholders' needs and expectations.\n\nIt also strives to extend these guidelines and responsible principles to its subsidiaries and investees through its representatives. Alba demonstrates its commitment to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals through its investments, its own activities and the activities of its investees. As part of its commitment to the Global Compact initiative in Spain, Alba participates in the training activities organised by its training platform and submits progress reports to the organisation. In 2023, it attended four training sessions organised by the Global Compact initiative, on issues related to sustainable development.\n\nAlba makes financial contributions to a number of foundations and organisations that carry out a range of initiatives to promote sustainable development, with the aim of exchanging knowledge and concerns related to its activity. In 2023, Alba made contributions totalling Euros 364,500 to Fundación Juan March, Fundación Tengo Hogar, Fundación de Estudios de Economía Aplicada (FEDEA), Fundación Parques Reunidos and Emisores Españoles.\n\nIt also implemented the following actions in 2023 as part of its commitment to sustainable development:\n\n- Social and cultural commitment: Alba seeks to implement its social actions at a local level, building bridges between neighbouring communities and the entities that make a difference locally thanks to our donations. Alba's strong social and cultural commitment is borne out by its contribution to Fundación Juan March. The Foundation's mission is to promote culture in Spain and its activities in this area include exhibitions, concerts and conferences held at its headquarters in Madrid. In addition, as part of its social commitment to reducing the vulnerability of certain populations to disasters, for the second year, Alba has made a contribution to Fundación Tengo Hogar, which supports Ukrainian refugee families in Spain, offering them housing solutions and assisting them with their integration into society and the workplace.\n- Commitment to social and environmental sustainability: Alba contributes to social and environmental action through its contribution to Fundación Parques Reunidos, whose mission is to contribute to a more caring and sustainable world through its childhood and health, social inclusion, education and awareness, biodiversity conservation and research programmes.\n- Commitment to innovation: Alba assists companies on the journey towards sustainable development by means of an annual contribution to FEDEA.

These Principles include support for the elimination of discriminatory employment practices, the fight against corruption in all of its forms, a precautionary approach to environmental challenges, and the encouragement of initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. Since its creation in 2009, Alba has also been a member of Emisores Españoles, an association whose aims include improving communication between companies and their shareholders, developing high levels of good corporate governance and enhancing legal certainty in relation to the issuance, trading, settlement and registration of listed securities. All this, based on a relationship of ongoing dialogue and close cooperation with the public administrations, particularly the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV).\n\nSince 2020, Alba has adhered to the State Tax Agency's Code of Good Tax Practices, promoted by the Large Companies Forum.\n\nFinally, Alba's commitment to sustainability is reflected in its listing in October 2023 on the IBEX ESG, one of the Bolsas y Mercados Españoles (BME) sustainability indexes. Alba and six of its investees are among the 47 companies listed on this index. The six Alba investees that are included on BME's Ibex ESG are Acerinox, S.A. and Inmobiliaria Colonial Socimi, S.A. (both IBEX 35 companies), and Cie Automotive, S.A., Ebro Foods,\n\nS.A., Global Dominion Access, S.A., and Viscofan, S.A.\n\nThe sustainable development commitments of Alba's subsidiaries up to 31 March 2023 were as follows:\n\n- During the first quarter of 2023, **Nuadi** made no contributions to industry associations, other not-for-profit associations or NGOs, nor has it engaged in any sponsorships.\n- **Gesdocument** promotes a close relationship with the community and promotes continuous improvement with and for its customers in the solutions and services that it offers.\n\nIn 2023 Gesdocument was a sponsor of and jury member in the last edition of the AECA Awards for Business Transparency.

It made no contributions to non-profit associations in the first quarter of 2023.\n\n• Despite its location in the sparsely populated towns of Villada and Villamuriel de Cerrato, in Palencia, **Facundo** has achieved significant growth and has become a benchmark in its sector. It collaborates with the local authorities continuously, at no charge or by means of financial contributions, in a variety of activities. Its deeprooted commitment to local development is reflected in its factories in the above towns, which provide employment for\n\n{317}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/317/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The company strives to respond to all local requests for collaboration, be it from public institutions, sports clubs, schools, or others. It made no contributions to industry or non-profit associations, and engaged in no sponsorships in the first quarter of 2023.\n\n# <span id=\"page-317-0\"></span>**9.2. Subcontractors and suppliers14**\n\nAlba extends the principles and values set out in its Code of Ethics and Conduct to its entire value chain, including contractors, suppliers and collaborators who have a business relationship with the company. Thus, in their contracts and collaboration agreements, they must undertake to observe and comply with the principles of respect for human rights, the environment, the law and ethical principles, in accordance with Alba's Code of Ethics and Conduct.\n\nAlba has a Whistleblowing Channel, referred to in other sections of this report, which is accessible to third parties with which Alba does business.\n\nThis Whistleblowing Channel is a confidential and, in certain cases, anonymous channel for reporting acts or conduct known to have taken place, or of which there is reasonable evidence, that may be in breach of the applicable regulations or the Code itself. If the reported act or conduct meets the relevant requirements, the pertinent procedure is followed, concluding with the relevant corrective, preventive and organisational actions and measures. If processing of the complaint reveals that there is sufficient evidence of the perpetration of a criminal offence or of conduct in breach of the securities market regulations, the competent authorities are notified.\n\nAlba's subsidiaries had in place the following measures in the first quarter of 2023:\n\n• **Nuadi** has established an internal purchasing procedure applicable to its suppliers, which covers both products and processes.\n\nSuppliers are not required to have policies in place, but Nuadi places great value on them taking a proactive attitude to identifying environmental aspects in order to evaluate their impact and implement improvements within their companies.\n\nIt also has a system of annual supplier audits, according to VDA benchmarks, based on the level of performance and risk of each supplier.\n\nSadeca does not have a purchasing policy in place. However, it makes its Code of Ethics available to its suppliers and, in accordance with the Suppliers' Manual provided to them, on entering into contracts with them it applies environmental criteria such as certification, proximity, optimisation of packaging and transport, etc., as well as legal and regulatory compliance criteria. If the supplier does not hold ISO14001 certification, it is asked to complete an environmental questionnaire. It also has an annual supplier audit plan, whereby suppliers are selected on the basis of criteria such as strategic importance,\n\n14 GRI 3-3, GRI 308-1 and GRI 414-3\n\n{318}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/318/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

In addition, it has a whistleblowing channel available to all of its professionals, customers, suppliers and business partners, to enable them to raise any doubts they may have regarding the Code of Ethics or report any reasonable indication or suspicion of acts in breach of the standards established in the Code of Ethics. In the event of detection of conduct infringing its Code of Ethics, the relevant business relationship may be terminated immediately. Compliance with the Harassment Prevention Code and related policies is also mandatory.\n- **Facundo** does not have a written purchasing policy document, but it applies the same business principles as the company to both national and international suppliers. In addition, its supplier in China holds the Business Registration Certificate (BRC) attesting to its compliance with specific requirements guaranteeing the safety, quality and legality of suppliers' products. The company is in regular contact with its suppliers by phone and by email. For international suppliers, intermediaries are used to purchase raw materials, thereby guaranteeing quality standards and best practices. The purchasing manager occasionally visits supplier premises to assess the quality of products on site.\n\n# <span id=\"page-318-0\"></span>**9.3. Consumers15**\n\nThe companies apply appropriate consumer health and safety procedures, making suitable communication, complaints and claims mechanisms available to their consumers in each case, adapted to the type of activity pursued by each one.\n\nIn its real estate activities, **Alba** implements all health and safety measures provided for in the applicable legislation.\n\nIt also provides all necessary means for the coordination of business activities in the buildings it owns via a document platform on which all tenants and other users may access the general documentation relating to the building.\n\nContracts with tenants and internal building regulations set out the procedures necessary to manage the various needs that may arise.\n\nBuildings are equipped with a variety of security measures, such as a 24-hour surveillance service every day of the year, CCTV systems and alarms alerting to the opening of emergency exits. All buildings are also up to date with the inspection schedules for the different installations. Alba also has in place mandatory civil liability insurance for the buildings.\n\n15 GRI 3-3 and GRI 207-4\n\n{319}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/319/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH. The word \"ALBA\" is written in large, white, sans-serif letters on a teal background. Below \"ALBA\" is the text \"GRUPO MARCH\" in smaller, white letters.\n\nA number of measures have been implemented to protect the health of the users of the buildings it operates: the Castellana 42 building has interior green areas that improve air quality and, in 2023, a roof garden was installed for use by tenants; the Castellana 42 and Castellana 89 buildings have ambient air ionisation systems to eliminate pathogens and detect CO2, and air quality is monitored.\n\nNo complaints or claims were received in relation to the buildings in 2023.\n\nAlba keeps records of personal data processing activities in relation to its customers, suppliers, building access control and video surveillance.\n\nThese records of personal data are also kept in relation to employees, shareholders, the electronic forum for shareholders, affected parties in relation to the securities market and the Whistleblowing Channel referred to in the Code of Ethics and Conduct.\n\nTo safeguard stored data, its IT systems have different cybersecurity protection measures for each layer or service: firewalls, AV systems, anti-phishing software for e-mails, etc. All customer PCs and servers have EDR systems installed with the services of a SOC (Security Operations Center) for continuous monitoring. As part of the contingency plan and business continuity plan, there are two data centres to maintain the infrastructures necessary to support the business from a technological viewpoint and an information replication system. Backups and replicas are created and stored as needed (on a daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, etc. basis). Strong password security policies are in place for local identity management, with different permissions depending on roles, etc. and there is two-factor authentication process for identity management in the case of critical IT roles.\n\nIn 2023, Alba provided 80 hours of in-company training for IT security planning and also provides employee cybersecurity training in the form of bite-sized learning emails on the subject. These learning bites are permanently available on Alba's intranet, enabling employees to access the information and review it again at any time. This practice helps to increase employee awareness on the importance of cybersecurity and how they can contribute to keeping the company's information secret. A total of 11 cybersecurity learning bites were sent out in 2023.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, Alba's subsidiaries had in place and implemented the following consumer-related measures and actions:\n\n• **Nuadi** has a cybersecurity system in place to protect its customers' data with a firewall, a system for monitoring and logging access to control unauthorised connections, and equipment and servers equipped with antivirus software. Vulnerability checks are performed regularly along with updates to the latest versions of software and firmware. As part of its contingency plan, it uses daily and weekly backup and replica solutions. It has security policies and a password complexity factor in place for services hosted on internal servers. Users are assigned access to information according to their defined roles. Access for roles identified as critical is subject to two-factor authentication. It also has in place a customer-oriented complaints management system, certified according to the IATF standard. Customer complaints management and monitoring processes\n\n{320}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/320/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

At 31 March 2023, nine customer complaints had been received, complaint being defined as any action taken by a customer as a result of any dispute in the dealings between the two organisations. Customer complaints can be received by various means: telephone, fax, letter, e-mail, in person, or via an employee reporting to Quality.\n\nSadeca also has a complaints system, essentially implemented via the customer satisfaction index (CSI), which analyses aspects such as punctuality of deliveries, urgent transport, quality complaints and stoppages in the production chain, among others.\n\n- **Gesdocument** has a technology department that ensures security in terms of IT services. This department and a number of security partners ensure that IT services are provided correctly. It also has cybersecurity insurance. In 2023, it began implementing a system to measure customer satisfaction by means of quality surveys that will be logged by customer, service and the team/professional assigned to each customer. It records customer \"cases\", customer and professional complaints and incidents in its CRM, and the steps taken to resolve them are then monitored. One complaint was received in the first quarter of 2023.\n- Guaranteeing its consumers' health and safety is of **paramount** importance to Facundo. For this reason, it has renewed its IFS (International Food Standard) certification, one of the strictest regulations in relation to food safety, installation quality and process optimisation in product preparation. It also has in place a Food Safety and Quality Policy. It has implemented a mandatory Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system, in line with the European Union's Regulation EC 852/2004. These policies and procedures ensure the food safety of its products and the health and safety of its consumers, customers and users.\n\nIn its quest to offer excellent customer service and safeguard the health of its consumers, it has an allergens table for all of its products on its website and provides a contact telephone number.\n\nConsumers and other interested third parties can send complaints, comments and suggestions to the company's customer service department via its corporate website, by e-mail or telephone. The customer service department then forwards the communications to Management and the Quality Department. No distinction is drawn between different complaints and grievances. They are all treated in the same way. Facundo received a total of 56 complaints in the first quarter of 2023. All claims are assessed and receive a reply, and the data collected is used to improve internal processes.\n\nIn addition, it organises visits to its factory, giving consumers the opportunity to see how the factory works and how its products are made, thereby strengthening the relationship between the brand and its customers.\n\n{321}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/321/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy**\n\nThe EU Taxonomy reporting carried out by Alba and its Subsidiaries is driven by Regulation (EU) 2020/852, published by the European Parliament on 22 June 2020. This Regulation seeks to contribute to the decarbonisation of the European economic system by providing a reference framework for identifying environmentally sustainable economic activities. Substantial contribution to the six environmental objectives set out in article 9 of the Regulation will also be determined.\n\nJuly 2021 saw the publication of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139, which set out to supplement Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and specify the Technical Selection Criteria (TSC) for the first two environmental objectives, namely climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation.\n\nAdditionally, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 of 27 June 2023 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 further specifies the disclosures to be made in respect of the substantial contribution of activities to the sustainability objectives by establishing the TSC for determining the conditions under which an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, to the transition to a circular economy, to pollution prevention and control, or to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems and for determining whether that economic activity causes no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives.\n\nFurthermore, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214, amending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 as regards economic activities in certain energy sectors and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 as regards specific public disclosures for those economic activities, was published on 9 March 2022.\n\nUndertakings that are subject to the obligation to disclose non-financial information under Law 11/2018 of 28 December 2018, which transposed Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, are required to disclose the extent to which their activities are in line with the Taxonomy.\n\nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 of 6 July 2021, supplementing Regulation 2020/852, specifies the content and presentation of information to be disclosed by undertakings subject to the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD).\n\nIn this connection, the aforementioned requirements laid down in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 are fulfilled in this section, based on the activity data for 2023. To continue with the taxonomy exercise carried out in the previous year, which concluded with the publication of the eligible financial indicators according to the activities referred to in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139, the activities identified as eligible according to the mitigation and adaptation criteria established in the Regulation have been reviewed. With regard to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486, the economic activity eligibility analysis has been performed in relation to the four sustainability objectives that are relevant for the purposes of this report.\n\n{322}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/322/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Below \"ALBA\" is \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller, white, sans-serif font.\n\n# <span id=\"page-322-0\"></span>**10.1. Compliance with the EU Taxonomy**\n\nAlba is an investment company the purpose of which is to acquire long-term holdings in listed and unlisted companies operating in various economic sectors. Alba is majority owned by the shareholders of the March Group, one of Spain's leading private family-owned financial groups. Alba currently focuses its investments on listed and unlisted companies and real estate assets.\n\nIn accordance with the applicable regulations on the disclosure of non-financial information, the Company must disclose the proportion of eligible and non-eligible and aligned and nonaligned activities according to the EU Taxonomy, in addition to the KPIs associated with Revenues, CapEx and OpEx.\n\nEligible activities are those listed in Annexes I and II to Regulation 2021/2139 and in Annexes I, II, III and IV to Delegated Regulation 2023/2486, which will potentially contribute to the defined objectives by meeting the technical criteria established for the climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives. Non-eligible activities would therefore be those which do not comply with the relevant provisions and/or are not included in the list of Taxonomy-eligible activities defined in the legislation.\n\nAligned activities are those which are considered eligible and meet the criteria of substantial contribution (SCC) to one of the set objectives (mitigation or adaptation), which ensure that they do no significant harm to the other objectives (DNSH) and which are carried out in accordance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (Minimum Social Safeguards). Non-aligned eligible activities are thus those which do not meet any of the requirements of the aforementioned alignment analysis phases (SCC, DNSH and Safeguards).\n\n# <span id=\"page-322-1\"></span>**10.2. Analysis and calculation procedure**\n\nIn order to calculate the indicators required by the EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy, an eligibility analysis was conducted on the activities pursued by Alba in 2023 and by its Subsidiaries up to the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe analysis was based on a description of the various activities carried out by the companies. Furthermore, in order to avoid double counting, the percentages allocated to just one activity were accounted for. The different indicators required by the relevant regulations were determined for each of them, including the calculation of the numerator and denominator for Alba's Revenue, CapEx and OpEx figures at the end of 2023, and those of its Subsidiaries at the 31 March 2023 close.\n\n- Revenues: the proportion of turnover referred to in article 8(2)(a) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 was calculated as the proportion of net turnover derived from products or services, including intangibles, associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities (numerator), divided by net turnover (denominator) as defined in article 2(5) of Directive 2013/34/EU.\n- CapEx: this includes the calculation of the CapEx figure associated with activities classed as eligible following the analysis performed on Alba and its\n\n{323}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/323/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

The numerator shall include the part of the capital expenditure included in the denominator that:\n\n- a) is related to assets or processes that are associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities;\n- b) is part of a plan to expand Taxonomy-aligned economic activities or to allow Taxonomy-eligible economic activities to become Taxonomy-aligned (\"CapEx plan\") under the conditions specified in the second subparagraph of this point 1.1.2.2 (relating to the \"CapEx plan\");\n- c) is related to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and individual measures enabling the target activities to become low-carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas reductions, notably activities listed in sections 7.3 to 7.6 of Annex I to the CDA, as well as other economic activities listed in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to articles 10(3), 11(3), 12(2), 13(2), 14(2) and 15(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and provided that such measures are implemented and operational within 18 months.\n\nThe denominator of the CapEx indicator shall cover additions to tangible and intangible assets during the financial year considered before depreciation, amortisation and any re-measurements, including those resulting from revaluations and impairments, for 2023 in the case of Alba and the first quarter of 2023 in the case of its Subsidiaries, excluding fair value changes.\n\n- OpEx: this includes the calculation of the Taxonomy-eligible OpEx figure associated with the activities deemed eligible in the analysis. It is equal to the part of the operating expenditure included in the denominator that:\n\t- a) is related to assets or processes that are associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities;\n\t- b) is part of the CapEx plan to expand Taxonomy-aligned economic activities or allow Taxonomy-eligible economic activities to become Taxonomy-aligned as set out in the second paragraph of this point 1.1.2.2; and\n\t- c) is related to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-aligned economic activities and individual measures enabling the target activities to become low-carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas reductions, notably activities listed in sections 7.3 to 7.6 of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act, as well as other economic activities listed in the delegated acts adopted pursuant to articles 10(3), 11(3), 12(2), 13(2), 14(2) and 15(2) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and provided that such measures are implemented and operational within 18 months.\n\n{324}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/324/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

Since the information systems of Alba and its Subsidiaries (up to 31 March 2023) do not currently allow the specific data corresponding to the type of expenditure referred to in the regulations to be obtained, and in view of the nature of the activities carried out by these companies, this indicator was prepared on the basis of the \"Other Operating Expenses\" heading of the Consolidated Annual Accounts of Alba and its Subsidiaries.\n\n# Eligibility analysis\n\nFor the climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives, the eligible activities resulting from the eligible activities analysis study previously carried out by an independent third party for both Alba and the Subsidiaries covered in this report -the activities of which remained unchanged in 2023- were selected.\n\nAn eligibility study was carried out in respect of the other objectives set out in Regulation 2023/2486 for the preparation of this report. To determine the eligibility of the economic activities of Alba in 2023, and those of its Subsidiaries up to 31 March 2023, account was taken of whether they are described in the relevant Regulations. The NACE codes stated in the descriptions also served as a guideline without being a prerequisite.\n\nNeither Alba nor its Subsidiaries (in the first quarter of 2023) carried out any eligible activities per the descriptions of the objectives provided for in Regulation 2023/2486.\n\nEligible activity alignment analysis\n\nOn identifying the eligible activities, the criteria set out in Annexes I and II to the Climate Delegated Regulation were then reviewed and analysed.\n\nThe technical interpretation of the activities identified as eligible, on which the alignment analysis was carried out, is detailed below:\n\n• Activities that contribute to climate change mitigation:\n\n**Activity 7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings:** The acquisition of real estate and exercise of the ownership rights over such assets carried out by Alba Patrimonio Inmobiliario, S.A. in respect of five buildings located in Madrid are considered here. All of these buildings were constructed prior to 31 December 2020. Thus, according to the TSC, in order to contribute substantially to the climate change mitigation objective, they should at least have a class A energy performance certificate or, alternatively, be among the 15% most energy efficient buildings in the national or regional building stock in terms of primary energy demand. Also, as large non-residential buildings, they need to be managed efficiently through energy efficiency monitoring and assessment.\n\n{325}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/325/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA Grupo March. The letters \"ALBA\" are in large, white, sans-serif font, stacked above the words \"GRUPO MARCH\" in a smaller font. The background is a teal color, and the entire logo is enclosed in a teal border.\n\nThe analysis performed at the 2023 close suggests that there is no energy performance certificate such as the one referred to in the TSC; nor are there any plans to control or assess the energy efficiency of the buildings considered. It is thus concluded that this activity could not be classed as aligned as it does not comply with the TSC. Likewise, for the purposes of complying with the DNSH criteria and, specifically, the climate change adaptation objective, no analysis has been conducted on physical climate risks or specific plans for adaptation to climate change in these buildings; although Alba has implemented a number of the mechanisms required by the Minimum Social Safeguards provided for in the Regulation, at corporate level.\n\nIn future years, work will be done to analyse the steps required in order to adapt to these criteria with a view to aligning the Company's business model with the requirements laid down in the Regulation, thus supporting the transition towards a more sustainable economy.\n\n# <span id=\"page-325-0\"></span>**10.3. Results in 2023**\n\nThe analysis shows that the Subsidiaries had no eligible activities during the first quarter of 2023, while 22.48% of Alba's Revenues, 32.92% of its CapEx and 23.51% of its OpEx were Taxonomy-eligible. However, the analysis did not reveal any activities that were actually aligned with the Taxonomy.\n\nThe information contained in this report considers the methodology applied by Alba and its Subsidiaries, as well as the results obtained in the second exercise performed to comply with Sustainable Finance Taxonomy Regulation 2020/852. Nonetheless, changes in sectoral interpretations and positions, the development of new implementing guidelines and the publication of the remaining four environmental objectives could lead to amendments to, or the restatement of, the information set out in this analysis.\n\nMoreover, the activities of Alba and its Subsidiaries are unrelated to nuclear energy and fossil gas for the purposes of Regulation 2022/1214.\n\nThe results of the analysis are detailed below:\n\n{326}------------------------------------------------\n\n| 2023                                                                                                        |          | 2023          |                              | Substantial contribution criteria |                           |                       |                  |            |              | Do no significant harm criteria (DNSH) |                           |                            |                  |           |              |                    |                                                                                                                            |                              |                                  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|-----------|--------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Economic activities (net revenues)                                                                          | Code     | Turnover      | Proportion of turnover, 2023 | Climate change mitigation         | Climate change adaptation | Groundwater resources | Circular economy | Pollution  | Biodiversity | Climate change mitigation              | Climate change adaptation | Water and marine resources | Circular economy | Pollution | Biodiversity | Minimum safeguards | Proportion of turnover that complies with the Taxonomy (A.1) or is from eligible activities under the Taxonomy (A.2), 2022 | Category (enabling activity) | Category (transitional activity) |\n|                                                                                                             | CCM      | €             | %                            | Y; N; N/EL                        | Y; N; N/EL                | Y; N; N/EL            | Y; N; N/EL       | Y; N; N/EL | Y; N; N/EL   | Y / N                                  | Y / N                     | Y / N                      | Y / N            | Y / N     | Y / N        | Y / N              | %                                                                                                                          | E                            | T                                |\n| A.

In 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company approved, with the favourable report of the Audit and Compliance Committee, the **Statute of the Regulatory Compliance Function**, entrusting the Secretary of the Board of Directors with the Management of the Regulatory Compliance Unit, which reports to the Audit and Compliance Committee and currently has the external collaboration of Deloitte Advisory, S.L.\n\nThe objective of this function is to provide reasonable assurance that Alba complies with its key legal and regulatory requirements, to which end: (i) the main legislative and regulatory obligations with which the Company must comply have been identified; (ii) a compliance model has been designed (with activities and tasks to be performed, dates and persons responsible); and (iii) a model has been established for monitoring and tracking compliance activities, with early warnings and half-yearly reviews, in order to avoid potential non-compliance.\n\n▪ During 2023, the **Regulatory Compliance monitoring reports** were prepared in relation with the second half of the year and the full year 2022, and for the first half of 2023, in which the requirements identified are\n\n{353}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/353/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for ALBA GRUPO MARCH.

REMUNERATION POLICY OF THE COMPANY FOR THE CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR**\n\nA.1.1 Explain the current director remuneration policy applicable to the year in progress. To the extent that it is relevant, certain information may be included in relation to the remuneration policy approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting, provided that these references are clear, specific and concrete.\n\nSuch specific determinations for the current year as the board may have made in accordance with the contracts signed with the executive directors and with the remuneration policy approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting must be described, as regards directors' remuneration both in their capacity as such and for executive functions carried out.\n\nIn any case, the following aspects must be reported, as a minimum:\n\na) Description of the procedures and company bodies involved in determining, approving and applying the remuneration policy and its terms and conditions.\n\nb) Indicate and, where applicable, explain whether comparable companies have been taken into account in order to establish the company's remuneration policy.\n\nc) Information on whether any external advisors took part in this process and, if so, their identity.\n\nd) Procedures set forth in the current remuneration policy for directors in order to apply temporary exceptions to the policy, conditions under which those exceptions can be used and components that may be subject to exceptions according to the policy.\n\nThe current Remuneration Policy was approved by the General Meeting of 20 June 2022, and the General Meeting of 19 June 2023 approved to update the remuneration of the members of the Audit and Compliance Committee and Appointments and Remuneration Committee, taking into consideration comparable companies.\n\nIn accordance with that outlined in articles 529r and concordant provisions of the Corporate Enterprises Act, for the calculation and approval of the Remuneration Policy of the Board of Directors of the Company, the Appointments and Remuneration Committee approves the corresponding report on the Remuneration Policy and submits the Proposed Remuneration Policy to the Board of Directors, which is submitted for approval to the General Shareholders' Meeting. It is the responsibility of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, as provided for in its Rules and Regulations, to verify the compliance with the Remuneration Policy.\n\nIn relation to the members of the Board of Directors in their position of such, the Remuneration Policy calculates their remuneration within the system put forth by statutory regulations and includes the maximum amount of annual remuneration to satisfy the group of them in their capacity of Directors.\n\nThere are currently no Directors who perform executive functions (Executive Directors). The Remuneration Policy establishes the amount of annual fixed remuneration, the parameters for setting the variable components and the main terms and conditions of their contracts, if they are appointed. Any remuneration received by the Directors for the exercise or termination of their position and for the performance of executive functions must be consistent with the applicable Remuneration Policy at each time, except for remunerations expressly approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe principles underpinning the Remuneration Policy are:\n\n- Balance and moderation.\n- Alignment with best market practice.\n- Generally monitoring the recommendations on good corporate governance relating to the remuneration of the Directors.\n- Compatibility with (i) adequate and effective risk management, not providing incentives to take risks that are based on the level of risk tolerated, and (ii) the Group's long-term business strategy, goals, values and interests, avoiding potential conflicts of interest.\n- Being subject to the decisions taken by the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n- Non-discrimination, recognising equal pay for services of equal value.\n\nThe Remunerations Policy distinguishes the remuneration of the Directors in their capacity as such and the remuneration of the Directors for their performance of executive functions.\n\n{358}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/358/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV). The logo is set against a red background. The letters \"CNMV\" are in white and are stacked on top of the words \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\", which are also in white but in a smaller font size.\n\n#### **ANNUAL REPORT ON DIRECTOR REMUNERATION OF LISTED COMPANIES**\n\nThe remuneration of Directors as such is based on the following principles:\n\n- Sufficiency to compensate for their dedication, skill and responsibility, but without this being so high as to compromise their independence.\n\n- Relationship with the effective dedication.\n\n- Connection with the responsibility and the development of their functions by the various Directors.\n\n- Absence of variable components.\n\n- Incentive by nature, but in measures that do not affect their independence.\n\n- To take into account, as reference, market criteria, focusing on the remuneration foreseen for Directors of listed companies with which a comparison can be established.\n\nThe remuneration of executive directors, if appointed, it is based on the following principles:\n\n- To reward the performance of their functions with a comprehensive offer of cash and non-cash elements that meet the variety of needs and expectations in a professional environment, and that serve as a tool for the communication of organizational and business objectives. - To align performance with the objectives of the group at different timelines, encouraging the sustainability of results.\n\n- To recognise the capacity for creating value, as well as personal abilities and characteristics.\n\n- To promote a culture of commitment of the group's objectives, taking into account that it is essential to have the contribution of both the individual and the team.\n\n- To evaluate professional development and the results of activities using standardised criteria.\n\n- To provide equitable and competitive remuneration, bearing in mind the responsibilities of the position and a flexible approach to the market, in order to attract and retain the best professionals.\n\n-Variable remuneration may comprise two components: one with an annual vesting period and one with a multi-year vesting period.\n\n- To review the systems and remuneration updates so that, the necessary adjustments can be introduced, where appropriate, addressing the results and the capacity for motivation.\n\nIn 2023, no external advisor assisted in the updating of the Remuneration Policy, but a comparison was made with remunerations of directors of other listed companies, leading to the updating of the remuneration indicated above.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy provides for the possibility of the Board approving temporary exceptions to applying the Policy for executive Directors, subject to a report from the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, which may be assisted by an external expert. Temporary exceptions to the Remuneration Policy are limited to exceptional situations where the non-application of the Remuneration Policy is necessary to serve the long-term interests and sustainability of the Company as a whole, or to ensure its viability. The remuneration components that may be exempted are those foreseen for Executive Directors. The maximum period of application will be 24 months. There are no Executive Directors and therefore no temporary exceptions are foreseen in 2024.\n\nA.1.2 Relative importance of variable remuneration items vis-à-vis fixed remuneration (remuneration mix) and the criteria and objectives taken into consideration in their determination and to ensure an appropriate balance between the fixed and variable components of the remuneration. In particular, indicate the actions taken by the company in relation to the remuneration system to reduce exposure to excessive risks and to align it with the long-term objectives, values and interests of the company, which will include, as the case may be, mention of the measures taken to ensure that the long-term results of the company are taken into account in the remuneration policy, the measures adopted in relation to those categories of personnel whose professional activities have a material impact on the risk profile of the company and measures in place to avoid conflicts of interest.\n\nFurthermore, indicate whether the company has established any period for the accrual or vesting of certain variable remuneration items, in cash, shares or other financial instruments, any deferral period in the payment of amounts or delivery of accrued and vested financial instruments, or whether any clause has been agreed reducing the deferred remuneration not yet vested or obliging the director to return remuneration received, when such remuneration has been based on figures that have since been clearly shown to be inaccurate.\n\nIn 2023 there were no Executive Directors, the only ones for whom variable remuneration is provided for, so there is no information that can be provided regarding the relative importance of variable remuneration compared to fixed remuneration.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy anticipates that the remuneration of the Directors must save a reasonable proportion with the importance of the Company, the financial position it has at any time and the comparable business market standards, to be driven by promoting the longterm profitability and sustainability of the company, incorporating the necessary precautions to prevent excessive risk taking and unfavourable results.\n\nFees for Directors in their capacity as such, as well as those established for their participation in the committees of the Board, are established in moderate amounts, especially if compared with those established for other listed companies.\n\nExecutive Directors, if appointed during the term of the current Remuneration Policy, may be beneficiaries of annual and multi-year variable remuneration plans, through the award of share options and/or delivery of shares. Once these plans have been approved by the\n\n{359}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/359/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV). The logo is set against a red background. The letters \"CNMV\" are displayed in white at the top, followed by the words \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\" in smaller white letters below.\n\n#### **ANNUAL REPORT ON DIRECTOR REMUNERATION OF LISTED COMPANIES**\n\nGeneral Meeting, the Board of Directors shall, at the recommendation of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, establish the criteria for the award of variable remuneration, indicating the financial and non-financial performance criteria, the methods to be applied to determine to what extent the criteria will have been met and how the variable remuneration contributes to the corporate strategy and to the long-term interests and sustainability of the company.\n\nTo reduce exposure to excessive risks, the Board of Directors has agreed that investment and divestiture decisions are taken collectively, by the Board of Directors itself, if they exceed the two hundred million euros, or by the Investment Committee, when operations exceed the limits set by the Managing directors, who will make these decisions jointly only for amounts under twenty-five or ten million euros, depending on the investment concerned.\n\nThus, no Executive Director can take decisions that may involve a risk to the Company. There are no plans for there to be any Executive Board Members in 2024.\n\nIn order to address the company's long-term performance, the annual variable remuneration system follows an annual accrual basis, with remuneration paid in two tranches, a first payment at the beginning of the year following the year in which targets are measured, and a second payment over a period of between five and eight years. The deferred portion is linked to the performance of the Company's net asset value per share during the deferral period.\n\nIn the case of multi-year variable remuneration, the agreement establishing the multi-year variable remuneration plan shall set out the specific duration of the plan.\n\nThe current Remuneration Policy establishes a clawback clause for variable remuneration paid within the three years following the date on which the Company paid the variable remuneration, in the event of exceptional circumstances occurring that could affect the Company's results or derive from inappropriate conduct. Exceptional circumstances are considered to be, and the Company shall be entitled to claim the return of the corresponding components of the variable remuneration from the Director, by way of example, (i) that the variable remuneration is paid on the basis of data whose inaccuracy is accredited after the time it is paid (for example, on the basis of any qualifications included in the external auditor's report that reduce the results), (ii) that the Director has acted fraudulently, or (iii) that the Director has caused serious harm to the Company through fault or gross negligence.\n\nA.1.3 Amount and nature of fixed components that are due to be accrued during the year by directors in their capacity as such.\n\nAccording to the Remuneration Policy in force, the remuneration of the Directors acting as such is as follows:\n\n- The remuneration of all members of members of the Board of Directors in their capacity as such is 100,000 euros per year. Similarly, the following additional remuneration is established.\n\nFor the Chairman, 550,000 euros per year.\n\nFor the Vice-Chairpersons, 450,000 euros per year.\n\nFor the members of the Audit and Compliance Committee, 30,000 euros per year and for its Chairman, 40,000 euros per year.\n\nFor the members of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, 20,000 euros per year and for its Chairman, 30,000 euros per year. For the members of the Investment Committee, 30,000 euros per year and for its Chairman, 50,000 euros per year.\n\nThere is an additional remuneration of 15,000 euros per year with the same accrual system as the annual remuneration, for the participation in any Committee other than those mentioned above, that may be established.\n\nThe amounts indicated are fixed, not depending on the number of meetings held throughout the year. In the event that any membership of the Board of Directors does not extend throughout the year, the amounts will be prorated by quarters.\n\nThe annual amount of the fixed remuneration expected to be accrued for the Directors in their capacity as such for 2024 is 2,870,000 euros.\n\nA.1.4 Amount and nature of fixed components that are due to be accrued during the year for the performance of senior management functions of executive directors.\n\nDuring this financial year, there are no executive Board Members sat on the Board of Directors, nor is it expected to appoint any during the year, therefore, no amounts will be paid under this heading.\n\nA.1.5 Amount and nature of any component of remuneration in kind that will accrue during the year, including, but not limited to, insurance premiums paid in favour of the director.\n\n{360}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/360/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV). The logo consists of the letters \"CNMV\" in white, stacked on top of the words \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\", also in white. All of this is set against a red background.\n\nDuring this financial year, there are no executive Board Members sat on the Board of Directors, nor is it expected to appoint any during the year, therefore, no remuneration in kind will be accrued given that the Remuneration Policy only provides such for Executive Board Members.\n\n#### A.1.6 Amount and nature of variable components, differentiating between those established in the short and long terms.\n\nFinancial and non-financial, including social, environmental and climate change parameters selected to determine variable remuneration for the current year, explaining the extent to which these parameters are related to performance, both of the director and of the company, and to its risk profile, and the methodology, necessary period and techniques envisaged to be able to determine the effective degree of compliance, at the end of the year, with the parameters used in the design of the variable remuneration, explaining the criteria and factors applied in regard to the time required and methods of verifying that the performance or any other conditions linked to the accrual and vesting of each component of variable remuneration have effectively been met.\n\nIndicate the range, in monetary terms, of the different variable components according to the degree of fulfilment of the objectives and parameters established, and whether any maximum monetary amounts exist in absolute terms.\n\nIn the current financial year, the Company does not have any executive directors on its Board, and there are no plans to appoint any during the year.\n\nHowever, the Remuneration Policy does provide that in the event that executive Directors are appointed, they may be beneficiaries of two types of variable remuneration at the Company's discretion:\n\n#### 1) Annual variable remuneration.\n\nThis is a variable remuneration which will take into account parameters linked to the performance of the net asset value, total shareholder return and/or value creation (which could include, by way of example, the execution of the international strategy, the monitoring of existing investments, the analysis and execution of investments and divestments, and corporate governance). The annual variable remuneration for each executive Director will represent a maximum of up to 100% of their annual fixed remuneration, and will depend on the degree of the executive Director's contribution to the achievement of the objectives.\n\nIn accordance with the Remuneration Policy of the Board, the maximum amount of the Variable Remuneration for all the Directors discharging executive functions is 3,000,000 euros. If the number of executive directors exceeds three, the limit would be increased proportionally.\n\nThere are no plans to appoint executive directors in 2024 and therefore there will be no annual variable remuneration for executive directors.\n\nNon-financial parameters are taken into account in the annual variable remuneration, considering that corporate governance, environmental and social issues are set out in Alba's Corporate Governance, Sustainability and Investment Policies, and in the Code of Ethics and Conduct, as guiding principles for its activities.\n\nGiven the characteristics of the annual variable remuneration, and the manner in which investment and divestment decisions are taken in the Company, as detailed in section A.1.2 above, it cannot be said that an executive Director has a certain risk profile or generates a particular risk.\n\n#### 2) Multi-year variable remuneration.\n\nThe multi-year variable remuneration shall refer to the difference between the \"initial\" (\"initial NAV\") and \"final\" (\"final NAV\") net asset value per share of the Company, where: the \"initial NAV\" of each share shall be the average net asset value per share of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. during a number of trading sessions prior to the \"initial day\" of the plan, which shall be the day that is fixed in the plan implementation agreement; and the \"final NAV\" shall be the average net asset value per share of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. during a number of trading sessions prior to the \"final day\" of the plan, which shall be the day on which the number of years established in the plan elapses since the \"initial day\" of the plan. Such plans may be realised, if the Company so chooses, by way of cash payments, the granting of stock options and/or shares.\n\nAt present, the multi-year variable remuneration plan in force that affect Directors (2021, adopted in accordance with the Remuneration Policy prior to the one currently in force) are expected to be settled in cash, although, at the Company's discretion, they may be settled by payment in shares valued at the closing price on the day prior to the day on which they are transferred to the Directors. The mentioned plan is the only one in force applicable to Directors.\n\nThe multi-year variable remuneration does not take into account non-financial parameters.\n\nGiven the characteristics of the multi-year variable remuneration systems, and how investment and divestment decisions at the Company\n\n{361}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/361/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV). The logo is set against a red background. The letters \"CNMV\" are stacked vertically above the words \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\".\n\nare made, it cannot be said that Executive Directors have a certain risk profile or that they generate a particular risk.\n\nIn the multi-year variable remuneration plan referred to in detail in Section B.7 of this Report, the monetary range for the 2021 Plan will be between 0 and 2,010,500 euros\n\nTaking into account the evolution of the Company's NAV, as at the date of this report, it is forecast that in 2024 there will be an accrual of the multi-year variable remuneration corresponding to the 2021 plan, described in Section B.7.\n\nVariable remuneration clawback agreement. The Board's Remuneration Policy provides for the possible recovery of variable remuneration paid in the event of exceptional circumstances that could affect the Company's performance or arising from inappropriate behaviour.\n\nThe following are considered exceptional circumstances, for example: (i) if the variable remuneration is paid on the basis of information that is proven to be inaccurate after the variable remuneration has been paid, (ii) if the Director has acted fraudulently, or (iii) if the Director has caused serious harm to the Company through fault or gross negligence. In these cases, the Company will have the right to reclaim the reimbursement of the relevant components of the variable remuneration from the Director discharging executive functions (the claim may be presented within a period of three years counted from the moment that the Company paid the variable remuneration object of the claim).\n\nA.1.7 Main characteristics of long-term savings schemes. Among other information, indicate the contingencies covered by the scheme, whether it is a defined contribution or a defined benefit scheme, the annual contribution that has to be made to defined contribution schemes, the benefits to which directors are entitled in the case of defined benefit schemes, the vesting conditions of the economic rights of directors and their compatibility with any other type of payment or indemnification for early termination or dismissal, or deriving from the termination of the contractual relationship, in the terms provided, between the company and the director.\n\nIndicate whether the accrual or vesting of any of the long-term savings plans is linked to the attainment of certain objectives or parameters relating to the director's short- or long-term performance.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy provides that in the event that executive directors are appointed, an alternative defined contribution pension scheme will be established, the terms of which have not yet been determined.\n\nIn the current financial year, there are no Executive Board Members sitting on the Board of Directors who may be granted a pension scheme.\n\nThe maximum amount of contributions by the Company to the alternative defined contribution pension scheme to be defined would be 1,500,000 euros per annum. If the number of executive directors exceeds three, the limit would be increased proportionally.\n\nAccrual or receipt of benefits is not linked to the achievement of certain short or long-term objectives or parameters by the Director. As there are no Executive Board Members during the current financial year, no contributions will be paid out by the Company.\n\nA.1.8 Any type of payment or indemnification for early termination or dismissal, or deriving from the termination of the contractual relationship, in the terms provided, between the company and the director, whether at the company's or the director's initiative, as well as any type of agreement reached, such as exclusivity, post-contractual non- competition, minimum contract term or loyalty, that entitles the director to any kind of remuneration.\n\nWith respect to the basic conditions of the contracts of Directors who, where applicable, perform executive functions in the Company, the Remuneration Policy establishes the following clauses relating to indemnities or golden parachutes in the event of early termination or termination of the contractual relationship between the Company and the Director:\n\n- If, upon ceasing to perform the executive functions assigned under contract, the Director takes on other functions that are also executive ones, the remuneration agreed upon in his contract shall be maintained, unless some other arrangement is mutually agreed on.\n\n- If, upon termination of the Director's executive duties, there is no prior employment relationship that would resume, the Director shall be entitled to indemnification equal to the amount of one year's Fixed Remuneration, increased by one twelfth of such yearly amount for each year of service with the Group, up to a limit of two years' total annual remuneration, less the amount of the fund set up as pension supplement, which shall correspond to him in full in any case.\n\n- If, upon the Director's termination of his executive duties, a previous employment relationship resumes and it is also decided to terminate such employment relationship, the indemnification payable in the event of termination of the relationship by the Company shall be in\n\n{362}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/362/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV).

In the event that the exercise of other activities is authorised and these are paid, the amount of such remuneration may be deducted from the Director's remuneration, if the Company so decides when granting authorisation.\n\nPost-contractual non-competition and permanence agreements may be entered into, the amount of which, together with severance pay and accrued pension rights, may not exceed two years' total annual remuneration. This limit shall not apply in the event of early termination, at the discretion of the Company, of the employment relationship between the Company and the Director who has resigned from his executive duties, in respect of the part of the severance payment that complies with the provisions of labour legislation.\n\nAs there are no Executive Board Members during the current financial year, and their appointment is not foreseen, the above provisions will not be applied.\n\nA.1.9 Indicate the conditions that contracts of executive directors performing senior management functions must contain. Among other things, provide information about the duration, the limits on amounts of compensation, the permanence clauses, periods of notice, as well as the payment as a substitute for the said period of notice, and any other provisions relating to contracting premiums, as well as compensation or protective payments for early termination or cancellation of the contractual relationship between the company and the executive director. Include, among other things, the pacts or agreements of non-concurrence, exclusivity, permanence or loyalty and post-contractual non-competition, unless they have been stated in the previous section.\n\nThe basic terms and conditions of the contracts of directors who, where applicable, perform executive functions at Corporación Financiera Alba are as follows:\n\n- Contract duration: indefinite.\n- Notice periods: fifteen days.\n- Remuneration:\n\n•Fixed remuneration: This consists of a fixed annual monetary remuneration. Amounts received from the Company as a director in their capacity as such or for any position or function in other companies or subsidiary, investee or related entities shall also be counted as fixed remuneration, the amount of which shall be reduced by the amount paid directly by the Company.\n\n•Variable remuneration: Annual and multi-year variable remuneration plans approved by the General Meeting may be established, and for which the Board of Directors, at the proposal of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, shall establish the criteria for their award. Both systems make reference to section A.1.6 above.\n\n•Remuneration in kind: The following coverage may be established for executive directors: life, accident and disability insurance; health insurance with coverage for the director, their spouse and children; and the use of a leased vehicle.\n\n- Indemnification for early termination or termination of the contractual relationship between the company and the executive director: as explained in section A.1.8 of this report.\n\n- Clawback agreement: as explained in section A.1.6 above.\n- Benefits system applicable to Directors: as described in section A.1.7 of this report.\n\nIn the current financial year, the Board has no Executive Directors, nor are there any plans to appoint any, and therefore no remuneration will be paid in this respect.\n\nA1.10. The nature and estimated amount of any other supplementary remuneration that will be accrued by directors in the current year in consideration for services rendered other than those inherent in their position.\n\n{363}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/363/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV).

The nature and estimated amount of any other planned supplementary remuneration to be accrued by directors in the current year that is not included in the foregoing sections, whether paid by the company or by another group company.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy provides that the Board of Directors, subject to a report from the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, may establish, for extraordinary reasons, a supplement for one or more of these Directors that may be paid on a one-time basis and may not exceed a total aggregate sum of 1,000,000 euros per annum.\n\nThis complement, which is intended to be a reward for the efforts and special dedication made by the executive Directors, may be established for the extraordinary achievements that have contributed to the Company's results, provided that an added value is generated for the shareholders or that a significant economic benefit or increase in equity is generated that reinforces the sustainability and longterm growth of the Company.\n\nIn the current financial year, the Board has no executive directors and therefore no remuneration will be accrued in this respect.\n\n- A.2. Explain any significant change in the remuneration policy applicable in the current year resulting from:\n\t- a) A new policy or an amendment to the policy already approved by the General Meeting.\n\t- b) Significant changes in the specific determinations established by the board for the current year regarding the remuneration policy in force with respect to those applied in the previous year.\n\t- c) Proposals that the Board of Directors has agreed to submit to the general shareholders' meeting to which this annual report will be submitted and for which it is proposed that they be applicable to the current year.\n\nGiven that the Board of Directors of the Company does not have any Directors assigned executive functions during this financial year, the updates to the fixed remuneration for this class of Director provided for in the current Remuneration Policy have not been applied.\n\nThe Board of Directors intends to submit the following proposals for remuneration before the General Shareholders' Meeting: (i) proposed approval of the Remuneration Report for 2023; (ii) proposed multi-year variable remuneration approval system referenced to the net asset value (NAV) for the year 2024 (similar to that agreed in previous years) for executives.\n\nA.3.

Below the letters, the full name of the organization, \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\", is written in smaller, white font.\n\n#### **B. OVERALL SUMMARY OF HOW REMUNERATION POLICY WAS APPLIED DURING THE YEAR LAST ENDED**\n\nB.1.1 Explain the process followed to apply the remuneration policy and determine the individual remuneration contained in Section C of this report. This information will include the role played by the Remuneration Committee, the decisions taken by the Board of Directors and, as the case may be, the identity and the role of the external advisors whose services have been used in the process to apply the remuneration policy in the year ended.\n\nThe Articles of Association refer to the remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors in their article 39.\n\nIn 2023, the Remuneration Policy approved at 2022 was updated regarding to the remuneration of the members of the Audit and Compliance Committee and Appointments and Remuneration Committee, taking into consideration comparable companies.\n\nThe Appointments and Remuneration Committee submitted the proposal to update the Remuneration Policy of the Board of Directors of Corporación Financiera Alba and issued the corresponding report on this proposal, which it submitted to the Board of Directors, which, in turn, submitted it to the General Meeting, which approved the update on 19 June 2023.\n\nFurthermore, the Appointments and Remuneration Committee considered that the remuneration policy established by the Company in relation to the Board of Directors has been observed during the financial year 2023.\n\nDuring financial year 2023 there were no executive directors, so the mainly remuneration paid to directors was for the directors in their capacity as such, consisting of the remuneration referred to in section A.1.3. of this report.\n\nThe Board of Directors submitted the proposal for the multi-year variable remuneration plan for executives, which was approved by the General Meeting of 19 June 2023, and implemented by the Board of Directors before the end of the 2023 financial year, as reported by the Appointments and Remuneration Committee. The Variable Remuneration Plans for 2021 and 2022 were also favourably reported on and, after approval by the General Shareholders' Meetings for these years, were implemented by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Appointments and Remuneration Committee has approved this ARR for the 2023 financial year, which contains in its section C the remuneration actually received by the Directors in said financial year, which has been submitted to and approved by the Board, which will in turn submit it to the consultative vote of the General Meeting.\n\nIn 2023, the Company did not have external advisors for matters related to the application of the Remuneration Policy of the Board of Directors.\n\nB.1.2 Explain any deviation from the procedure established for the application of the remuneration policy that has occurred during the year.\n\nIn 2023, there were no deviations from the procedure for the application of the Remuneration Policy during the financial year.\n\nB.1.3 Indicate whether any temporary exception has been applied to the remuneration policy and, if so, explain the exceptional circumstances that have led to the application of these exceptions, the specific components of the remuneration policy affected and the reasons why the entity believes that these exceptions have been necessary to serve the long-term interests and sustainability of the society as a whole or ensure its viability. Similarly, quantify the impact that the application of these exceptions has had on the remuneration of each director over the year.\n\nIn 2023 no temporary exceptions to the Remuneration Policy have been applied.\n\nB.2. Explain the different actions taken by the company in relation to the remuneration system and how they have contributed to reducing exposure to excessive risks, aligning it with the long-term objectives, values and interests of the company, including a reference to the measures adopted to ensure that the long-term results of the company have been taken into consideration in the remuneration accrued. Ensure that an appropriate balance has been attained between the fixed and variable components of the remuneration, the measures adopted in relation to those categories of personnel whose professional activities have a material effect on the company's risk profile and the measures in place to avoid any possible conflicts of interest.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the Company followed the principles of the Remuneration Policy, which have been set out in section A.1.1 of this Report.\n\n{365}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/365/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV). The logo consists of the letters \"CNMV\" in white, stacked on top of the words \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\" in white. The background is a solid dark red color.\n\nThe remuneration paid to the Directors in their capacity as such, both for membership of the Board and the various Committees, if compared to those of comparable companies, must be of moderate quality.\n\nThe multi-year variable remuneration agreed in previous years has been granted on the basis of the net asset value of the Company's shares, meaning that it has only been received if there has been a positive performance. The 2020 Plan that matured in 2023 had a positive result of €32.43/unit.\n\nIn addition, in connection with multi-year variable remuneration, this is not paid until three years have elapsed from the date the Board of Directors agrees to implement the variable remuneration system approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting, thereby verifying compliance at all times with the established conditions.\n\nAll stated circumstances ensure that the remuneration accrued are based on long-term results, which includes the Company's right to reclaim from a Director any variable remuneration received (clawback) based on the assumptions and during the period referred to in section A.1.2 of this report.\n\nAs indicated in the sections A.1.2 and A.1.6, of this report, the method of application of investment and divestiture decisions does not permit individuals whose activity could individually impact the Company's risk profile.\n\nB.3. Explain how the remuneration accrued and consolidated over the financial year complies with the provisions of the current remuneration policy and, in particular, how it contributes to the company's long-term and sustainable performance.\n\nFurthermore, report on the relationship between the remuneration obtained by the directors and the results or other performance measures of the company in the short and long term, explaining, as the case may be, how the variations in the performance of the company have influenced changes in the remuneration of directors, including those accrued whose payment would have been deferred, and how the latter contribute to the short and long-term results of the company.\n\nThe remuneration accrued by the Directors in the 2023 financial year fully complies with the Company's Remuneration Policy, having applied the items provided for therein and no others.\n\nFurthermore, the remuneration follows the principles of the Remuneration Policy referred to in section A.1.1 of this Report, which contributes to the sustainable and long-term performance of the Company.\n\nThe breakdown of the individual remuneration set out in section C below includes the amounts of the items mentioned in the corresponding points of section A above.\n\nThe performance of the entity's results does not affect the fixed remuneration of the Directors as such, the only ones who receive it, as there were no executive Directors in 2023.\n\nThe annual variable remuneration depends on the parameters described in section A.1.6 of this report and on the performance of each recipient of such remuneration, although it did not accrue in 2023, as there were no executive directors in that year.\n\nThe multi-year variable remuneration paid in 2023, corresponding to the 2020 Plan, was dependent not so much on the Company's performance as on the performance of its net asset value (NAV).\n\nB.4. Report on the result of the consultative vote at the General Shareholders' Meeting on remuneration in the previous year, indicating the number of votes in favour, votes against, abstentions and blank ballots:\n\n|                 | Number     | % of total      |\n|-----------------|------------|-----------------|\n| Votes cast      | 57,319,607 | 96.74           |\n|                 | Number     | % of votes cast |\n| Votes against   | 31,134     | 0.05            |\n| Votes in favour | 57,288,473 | 99.92           |\n\n{366}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/366/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV). The logo consists of the letters \"CNMV\" in white, stacked above the words \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\", also in white. The background is a solid dark red color.\n\n|               | Number | % of votes cast |\n|---------------|--------|-----------------|\n| Blank ballots |        | 0.00            |\n| Abstentions   |        | 0.00            |\n\n|  | B.5. Explain how the fixed components accrued and vested during the year by the directors in their capacity as such were determined, their |\n|--|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n\nrelative proportion with regard to each director and how they changed with respect to the previous year.\n\nObservations\n\nIn order to determine the fixed components accrued during the 2023 financial year by the Directors in their capacity as such, the Remuneration Policy approved in 2022, and updated on 19 June 2023, has been taken into account. There are amounts and nature are indicated in section A.1.3 of this report. With respect to the remuneration of the previous year, the remuneration of the members of the Audit and Compliance and Appointments and Remunerations Committees has changed, as the remuneration of the members and chairmen of these Committees has been increased in the Remuneration Policy, taking into account the remuneration of comparable companies.\n\nEach Director receives their remuneration in accordance with the position held both on the Board of Directors and the Committees on which they sit.\n\nB.6. Explain how the salaries accrued and vested by each of the executive directors over the past financial year for the performance of management duties were determined, and how they changed with respect to the previous year.\n\nIn 2023 there were no Executive Directors and therefore no accruals were made for the items indicated above.\n\nB.7. Explain the nature and the main characteristics of the variable components of the remuneration systems accrued and vested in the year last ended.\n\nIn particular:\n\n- a) Identify each of the remuneration plans that determined the different types of variable remuneration accrued by each of the directors in the year last ended, including information on their scope, date of approval, date of implementation, any vesting conditions that apply, periods of accrual and validity, criteria used to evaluate performance and how this affected the establishment of the variable amount accrued, as well as the measurement criteria used and the time needed to be able to adequately measure all the conditions and criteria stipulated, explaining the criteria and factors applied in regard to the time required and the methods of verifying that the performance or any other kind of conditions linked to the accrual and vesting of each component of variable remuneration have effectively been met.\n- b) In the case of share options and other financial instruments, the general characteristics of each plan will include information on both the conditions to acquire unconditional ownership (consolidation) and to exercise these options or financial instruments, including the price and term to exercise them.\n\n{367}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/367/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV). The logo consists of the letters \"CNMV\" in white, stacked above the words \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\" in white, all set against a red rectangular background.\n\n- c) Each director that is a beneficiary of remunerations systems or plans that include variable remuneration, and his or her category (executive director, external proprietary director, external independent director or other external director).\n- d) Information is to be provided on any periods for accrual, vesting or deferment of payment of vested amounts applied and/or the periods for retention/unavailability of shares or other financial instruments, if any.\n\nExplain the short-term variable components of the remuneration systems:\n\nA- Annual variable remuneration\n\nDuring 2023, there were no Executive Directors, only the Directors for whom the Board of Directors is expected to approve the annual variable remuneration, on the recommendation of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee.\n\nB- Remuneration in respect of participation in benefits or premiums. There is no provision for remuneration in the form of profit-sharing.\n\nC– Classes of directors who are beneficiaries of the annual variable remuneration. Variable remuneration is only foreseen to be approved for Executive Directors. In 2023 there were no Executive Directors.\n\nExplain the long-term variable components of the remuneration systems\n\nA- Multi-year variable remuneration plans of which the Directors are beneficiaries.\n\n#### A.1. Plan 2020\n\nThe 2020 Plan matured on 30/6/2023, which had been approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on 08/6/2020, and which consisted of a variable remuneration system linked to the performance of the Net Asset value (NAV) of the Company, in which each beneficiary would have been allocated a determined number of units, which in the case of Executive directors totalled 100,000 units. The multi-year variable remuneration took into account the difference between the \"final NAV\" and the \"initial NAV\" of Alba. In order to establish the initial NAV and the final NAV of Alba, the valuation of the Company's assets shall be in accordance with the following criteria:\n\n- The scope of consolidation will comprise Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. and the companies in which it has a state of more than 50%.\n\n- Listed companies: the closing share price on the day of the calculation\n\n- Non-listed companies: the value determined in the report as at 30 June carried out by the independent expert.\n\n- Real estate: the appraisal value as at 30 June determined by the independent expert.\n\n-Other assets and liabilities: at book value, less the provision for the multi-year variable remuneration recognised in the company's accounts, and those of a tax nature relating to Corporation Tax.\n\nThe calculation of the initial NAV of each share will take into account the mean net asset value per share of Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. during the ten stock exchange trading sessions prior to the \"initial date\" of the Plan. The calculation of the final NAV will take into account the mean net asset value per share of Alba during the ten stock market sessions prior to the \"final date\" of the Plan.\n\nThe characteristics detailed in the 2020 Plan can be found in Relevant Fact no. 2.860, communicated to the CNMV and published on 18 June 2020. The Directors benefiting from this Plan were allocated the following \"Units\": Mr Juan March de la Lastra, 30,000 units; Mr Juan March Juan, 20,000 units; and Mr Santos Martínez-Conde Gutiérrez-Barquín, 50,000 units.\n\nThe \"initial\" NAV of 2020 Plan was 64.97 euro/share, and the \"final\" NAV was 97.40 euro/share for which reason a multi-year variable remuneration corresponding to the 2020 Plan of 32.43 euros/unit has accrued in the financial year 2023.\n\n#### A2. Plan 2021\n\nThe system was approved by the General Assembly held on 21-06-2021 and was implemented by agreement of the Board on the same date. Its characteristics are:\n\n- The plan consists of a variable remuneration system linked to the performance of the Net Asset value (NAV) of the Company.\n\n- The Beneficiaries of the Plan are the Executive Directors and Directors that represent Alba on the Board of Directors of subsidiaries, investees or associated companies and any directors or personnel as determined by the Board. Each beneficiary is assigned a certain number of units, totalling 50,000 units for all the Directors.\n\n- Value of the units. Each unit will grant the right to receive the difference between the \"final NAV\" and the \"initial NAV\" of Alba. The calculation of these is the same as that foreseen for the 2020 Plan, referred to in the previous point. Therefore, the \"initial\" NAV is 80.42 euros, equivalent to the mean net value of the assets of Alba during the ten trading sessions prior to the \"initial day\" of the Plan (01/07/2021) and the \"final\" NAV will be the mean net asset value per share of Alba during the ten stock market sessions prior to the\n\n{368}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/368/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo of the \"Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores\" (CNMV). The logo consists of the letters \"CNMV\" in large, bold, white font stacked on top of each other. Below the letters, there are three lines of text in a smaller, white font that read \"COMISIÓN NACIONAL DEL MERCADO DE VALORES\". The background of the logo is a solid dark red color.\n\n#### **ANNUAL REPORT ON DIRECTOR REMUNERATION OF LISTED COMPANIES**\n\n\"final date\" of the Plan, which will be the date on which the number of years established in the plan counted from the \"initial date\" have elapsed (30/06/2024).\n\nThe maximum difference between the \"final\" NAV and the \"initial\" NAV may not be more than 50% of the \"initial\" NAV.\n\n- In the event of a dilution effect caused by a capital increase, the \"initial NAV\" shall be adjusted downward by the theoretical value of the preferential subscription right. A similar adjustment will occur in the event that a resolution is passed to distribute any extraordinary dividend or any other circumstance having a similar economic effect.\n\n- Plan maturity. The Plan will mature after three years counted from 1/7/2021, which is the \"initial date\" agreed by the Board of Directors. On the \"final date\", the Company will perform the corresponding calculation and pay the remuneration along with the corresponding salary. This notwithstanding, the Company may also choose to settle the Plan through payment in shares valued at the quoted price at the close of the day before the date when they are transferred to the beneficiaries of the 2021 Plan.\n\n- The rights arising from the application of the Plan are not transferable, except when due to death.\n\n- It is a basic condition of the Plan that the beneficiary is still on the workforce or on the Board of Alba or its subsidiaries at the time the Plan matures.\n\n- The amounts resulting from the application are considered to be \"gross\" and the fiscal regime currently in force shall apply to them, with the beneficiaries paying the corresponding amounts due.\n\n- In the event that (i) the variable remuneration is paid based on data whose inaccuracies are demonstrated after it has been paid (e.g., based on any reservations in the external auditor's report that undermine the results), (ii) a fraudulent action is committed by the Director, or (iii) the Director causes serious harm to the Company due to fault or gross negligence, the Company shall have the right to claim the reimbursement of the relevant components of the variable remuneration from the Director. This claim may be executed within a period of three years of the moment when the Company made payment of the variable remuneration claimed.\n\nThe characteristics detailed in the 2021 Plan can be found in Relevant Fact no. 10115, communicated to the CNMV and published on 21 June 2021. The Directors benefiting from this Plan were allocated the following \"Units\": Mr Juan March de la Lastra, 30,000 units; and Mr Juan March Juan, 20,000 units.\n\nB- Remuneration in respect of participation in benefits or premiums.\n\nRemuneration consisting of profit sharing is not established, but there is a multi-year variable remuneration for the Directors as established in letter A above.\n\nC - Classes of directors who are beneficiaries of remuneration systems that include a variable remuneration. Multi-year variable remunerations will apply only to Executive Directors.\n\nD – Basis of the systems of variable remuneration, criteria for evaluation of performance, methods of evaluation and estimation of the absolute amount of the variable remunerations according to the current remunerations plan.\n\nVariable remuneration is based on the management carried out by the management team and the results obtained with it and the value created for the shareholders will be taken into consideration when quantified.\n\nAt this time it is not possible to estimate the absolute amount of Directors' variable remuneration under the Plan mentioned in letter A.2 of this section.\n\nE- Periods of deferral of payment or retention of shares.\n\nThe multi-year variable remuneration system provided for in letter A.2. of this section implies a three-year deferral in its receipt.\n\nF- Share option plans.\n\nShare option plans are not approved.\n\n#### G- Accounting.\n\nThe amount accrued in accounting terms by the Directors receiving multi-year variable remuneration in 2023 represented 3,243,000 euros, which are recognised in the Financial Statements under \"Staff costs\".\n\nThe amounts effectively received in 2023 in accordance with the multi-year variable remunerations are detailed in the tables in Section C.1.a.i.\n\nB.8. Indicate whether certain variable components have been reduced or clawed back when, in the former case, payment of non-vested amounts has been deferred or, in the latter case, they have vested and been paid, on the basis of data that have subsequently been clearly shown to be inaccurate. Describe the amounts reduced or clawed back through the application of the \"malus\" (reduction) or clawback clauses, why they were implemented and the years to which they refer.\n\nNo assumptions have occurred during the year 2023 which would have resulted in the reduction or claim referred, although in the Remuneration Policy and in the Contracts of the Directors the corresponding reduction or return clauses are foreseen.\n\nB.9. Explain the main characteristics of the long-term savings systems where the amount or equivalent annual cost appears in the tables in\n\n{369}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/369/Picture/0 description: The image contains the logo for the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV).

Explain, where appropriate, the severance pay or any other type of payment deriving from early dismissal or early resignation, or from the termination of the contract in the terms provided for therein, accrued and/or received by directors during the year ended.\n\nThere were no removals of Directors during the financial year 2023.\n\nB.11.

Itemise the remuneration in kind accrued by the directors over the year, briefly explaining the nature of the different salary components.\n\nThere were no executive directors in 2023, the only ones for whom remuneration in kind can be provided.\n\nB.15. Explain the remuneration accrued by directors by virtue of payments settled by the listed company to a third company at which the director renders services when these payments seek to remunerate the director's services to the company.\n\nThere are no remunerations of this type.\n\nB.16. Explain and detail the amounts accrued in the year in relation to any other remuneration concept other than that set forth above, whatever its nature or the group entity that pays it, including all benefits in any form, such as when it is considered a related-party transaction or, especially, when it significantly affects the true image of the total remuneration accrued by the director. Explain the amount granted or pending payment, the nature of the consideration received and the reasons for those that would have been considered, if applicable, that do not constitute remuneration to the director or in consideration for the performance of their executive functions and whether or not has been considered appropriate to be included among the amounts accrued under the \"Other concepts\" heading in Section C.\n\nThere are no other remuneration items that meet the characteristics mentioned above of a related operation or which may affect the true image of the total remuneration accrued by the Directors.\n\n{370}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/370/Picture/0 description: The image shows the logo for the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV).
