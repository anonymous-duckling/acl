(UCP).\n\nShould revenue develop as expected, the operating results of the subsidiaries of Jungheinrich AG will be on a par with the previous year in 2024. As a result, the total income from affiliates and Jungheinrich AG's net income for the year should also be on a par with the previous year in 2024.\n\nThe explanations above are partially forward-looking statements that are based on the company management's current expectations, assumptions and assessments for future developments. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainty that are largely beyond the company's control. This includes changes in the overall economic situation, such as impacts from geopolitical conflicts, natural catastrophes, pandemics and similar force majeure events, debt issues, within the intralogistics sector, in materials supply, the availability and price development of energy and raw materials, demand in important markets, developments in competition and regulatory frameworks and regulations, exchange and interest rates and the outcome of pending or future legal proceedings. Should these or other uncertainties or unknown factors apply or the assumptions on which these statements are based prove false, actual results may deviate significantly from the results stated or implied. No responsibility is therefore taken for forward-looking statements. Without prejudice to existing capital market obligations, there is no intention to accept any obligation to update forward-looking statements.\n\nHamburg, 12 March 2024\n\n#### Jungheinrich Aktiengesellschaft The Board of Management\n\nDr Lars Brzoska Christian Erlach\n\nDr Volker Hues Sabine Neuß\n\n===\n\neport\n\ngheinrich AG (HGB)\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-55-0\"></span>Non-financial report\n\n| Sustainability strategy and organisation                         | 55 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|----|\n| Sustainability strategy                                          | 55 |\n| Sustainability organisation                                      | 61 |\n| Environment                                                      | 62 |\n| Climate neutrality initiative                                    | 62 |\n| Eco efficiency and circular economy initiative                   | 66 |\n| Society                                                          | 70 |\n| Employee initiative                                              | 70 |\n| Social initiative                                                | 73 |\n| Governance                                                       | 74 |\n| Governance initiative                                            | 74 |\n| Sustainable business models, products<br>and services initiative | 77 |\n| EU Taxonomy Regulation                                           | 79 |\n| Background and objectives                                        | 79 |\n| Implementation of regulatory requirements                        | 79 |\n| GRI index                                                        | 93 |\n| Independent auditor's report                                     | 96 |\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\nNon-financial report\n\n# <span id=\"page-56-0\"></span>Sustainability strategy and organisation\n\n#### ABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nIn this chapter, Jungheinrich is publishing the nonfinancial information required by law for the 2023 financial year (1 January to 31 December) in accordance with the CSR 1 Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG). Pursuant to Sections 289b, Paragraph 3 and 315b, Paragraph 3 of the German Commercial Code (HGB), this is the combined separate non-financial report for the Jungheinrich Group and Jungheinrich AG. Jungheinrich AG does not have any separate concepts and is managed by the Group. Jungheinrich uses the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) management approaches as its framework in line with Section 289d of the German Commercial Code (HGB).\n\nIn publishing this report, Jungheinrich is also meeting the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable capital expenditure, and regarding the amendment of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereafter EU Taxonomy Regulation) [ [page 79](#page-80-0) ].\n\nAll fully consolidated companies of the Jungheinrich Group according to the consolidated financial statements (as of 31 December 2023) are included. Deviations are indicated in the document. The companies Storage Solutions and Magazino, acquired in the reporting year, have not yet been fully integrated into the management approaches.\n\nThe report is published annually and is based on the 2022 non-financial report, which was published as part of the annual report on 31 March 2023. This combined separate non-financial report was subject to a limited audit in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised) by independent auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers, Cologne, (PwC), and was issued with an unqualified assurance opinion [ [page 96](#page-97-0) ].\n\n#### SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY\n\nSustainability is part Jungheinrich's identity. As a familyowned listed business, uniting economic, environmental and social responsibility is the focus of all business activities. One focus of the sustainability strategy is on creating sustainable value for all stakeholders – that is for customers, employees, shareholders, business partners and also for society as a whole. Another focal point for Jungheinrich is minimising the negative impacts its activities have on people and the environment while building on the positive contributions it makes. Jungheinrich contributes towards the sustainable transformation of intralogistics with its products and services and thus sees itself as a sustainability enabler. This is why sustainability is one of the six fields of action and an integral part of the corporate Strategy 2025+.\n\n#### Integrated business model and customer structure\n\nWith a comprehensive portfolio of material handling equipment, automated systems and services, Jungheinrich is able to offer customers solutions to the challenges posed by Industry 4.0. The integrated business model encompasses the development, production and sale of material handling equipment and the planning and realisation of automated systems, the short-term rental of new and used material handling equipment, the refurbishment and sale of used forklifts, and after-sales services. Jungheinrich's product range also includes stacker cranes and load handling equipment.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\nCustomers can therefore receive their entire factory and office equipment from a single source. Since 13 March 2023, all of our trucks manufactured have been battery-powered. In addition to electric motors and drive controls, Jungheinrich also manufactures suitable lithium-ion batteries and battery chargers. Digital products, such as the Jungheinrich warehouse management system and the fleet management system, which is based on the latest generation of the Jungheinrich Internet of Things platform in the cloud, complement the portfolio. A comprehensive range of financial services is also available to customers. Jungheinrich is active in around 120 countries both with its own direct sales and service networks, and through partner companies.\n\n#### Customers by sector 2023¹\n\n1\n\nImage /page/57/Figure/9 description: This image is a pie chart showing the distribution of different sectors. 42% is Retail and wholesale (including foodstuffs), 18% is Other sectors, 15% is Logistics, 12% is Machine/vehicle construction and electrical engineering, 9% is Food industry (production), and 4% is Chemical industry.\n\n#### Sustainable development highlights in 2023\n\nAs part of its corporate Strategy 2025+, Jungheinrich set measurable sustainability targets covering greenhouse gas emissions<sup>2</sup>, waste management and occupational health and safety. This supports the company's long-term goal of becoming a sustainability enabler. The following are some of the measures put in place in 2023 as part of the sustainability strategy:\n\n- Manufacture of battery-powered trucks only.\n- Expansion of the CO2e-neutral3 after-sales service4 to five countries.\n- Reorientation of the sustainability organisation toward the ESG5 structure in order to push through a more efficient implementation of the sustainability strategy.\n- Introduction of a global, internal communication platform for sustainability that enables employees to get involved with the sustainable transformation.\n- Use of electricity from renewable sources in 28 countries.\n- Introduction of Jellow Way, the mission statement outlining behaviours that support Jungheinrich's ongoing success.\n- Formalisation of the Group-wide human rights management system and publication of Jungheinrich's first policy statement on respecting human rights.\n- Expansion of the sustainable procurement management system to include preventative and remedial action, and integration of the subsidiaries MIAS and Profishop.\n- Performance of an external quality control audit by an external auditor on the compliance management system, and implementation of certain measures in 2022 and 2023.\n- Expansion of commitment to sustainability initiatives such as the United Nations (UN) Global Compact and the sustainability network ecosense – Forum Nachhaltige Entwicklung der Deutschen Wirtschaft e.V.\n\n- 2 There are a number of greenhouse gases that have various impacts on the climate; these include CO2 , CH4, N2 O, FKW, PFC, SF6 and NF3 . In order for these gases to be compared, they are indexed as CO2 equivalents (CO2 e).\n- 3 For reasons of clarity, Jungheinrich uses the adjective CO2 e-neutral in certain contexts interchangeably with net zero greenhouse gas emissions. This formulation is used in connection with specific products and projects in order to point out that they exhibit net zero emissions.\n- 4 Jungheinrich will achieve neutrality by reducing emissions in after-sales service processes and through capital expenditure in certified compensation projects to offset CO2 e emissions.

Based on communication with stakeholders and internal analysis, Jungheinrich has selected strategically relevant ESG ratings in order to develop the externally evaluated sustainability performance. Their relevance to active processing is regularly examined. The relevant ratings in Jungheinrich's view are EcoVadis, CDP, ISS ESG and MSCI ESG.\n\n#### Platinum EcoVadis rating\n\nEcoVadis, the world's biggest provider of sustainability ratings with more than 100,000 companies analysed, awarded Jungheinrich with a platinum rating (top 1 per cent) for the third consecutive time, making it one of the world's leading companies in the fields of environment, ethics, labour and human rights as well as sustainable procurement.\n\n#### CDP rating B\n\nCDP is a global non-governmental organisation that rates companies with regard to their environmental management in the categories of climate, forests and water security. Jungheinrich again received a rating of B (in a scale from A to F) for its transparency and commitment to climate protection.\n\n#### ISS ESG rating B-\n\nISS ESG Corporate Rating offers comprehensive ESG data and ratings. Jungheinrich again received the industry status Prime and improved its rating to B- (12-step scale from A+ to D-). This places Jungheinrich among the leading companies in its industry.\n\n#### MSCI ESG rating A\n\nMSCI ESG ratings measure a company's resilience with regard to long-term ESG risks. Jungheinrich again achieved an above-average rating of A (seven-step industry-specific scale from AAA to CCC).\n\n#### INITIATIVES AND MEMBERSHIPS IN 2023\n\nJungheinrich is active in various sustainability initiatives and networks with the aim of achieving international sustainability goals and cooperating across industries on relevant sustainability topics:\n\n- Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)\n- The Climate Pledge\n- UN Global Compact\n- Sustainability & Climate Leaders\n- econsense Forum Nachhaltige Entwicklung der Deutschen Wirtschaft e. V.\n- Bundesdeutscher Arbeitskreis für Umweltbewusstes Management (B.A.U.M.) e.V.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-59-0\"></span>Stakeholder dialogue\n\n#### Internal and external stakeholders of relevance for Jungheinrich\n\nAs part of the sustainability strategy development process at Jungheinrich, the material internal and external stakeholders were identified and prioritised by a team of experts from the Corporate Sustainability, Health & Safety, Marketing and Corporate Communications divisions. Stakeholders are weighted according to their importance for Jungheinrich, including direct contact with products, impacts on Jungheinrich plants and other connections to the company. The following stakeholder groups for Jungheinrich were identified in the analysis:\n\n- Employees\n- Management and executives\n- Customers\n- Job applicants\n- Suppliers\n- Investors and analysts\n\nThe dialogue with stakeholders takes a variety of different forms, such as direct conversations, exchanges over online platforms, and surveys.\n\n#### Engagement on sustainability through the new communication platform\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, Jungheinrich introduced a global communication platform on sustainability in order to actively include its workforce of more than 21,000 employees in the company's sustainability transformation. The platform promotes global networking among employees, self-sufficiency in terms of sustainability in a corporate context, and enables knowledge transfer. Best practice examples, guidelines and practical tips help with the implementation of the sustainability strategy. Thanks to interactive formats, the platform makes it possible to exchange information and get actively involved. By contributing their own ideas and through the intrinsically motivated implementation of measures, the resulting community represents a transformation from within.\n\n#### Six sustainability strategy initiatives\n\nThe aim of the corporate Strategy 2025+ is to create sustainable value. It contains six fields of action 1 . One field of action is sustainability, which has a decisive impact on corporate targets. The sustainability strategy in turn is divided into six strategic initiatives that apply to all of the company's divisions:\n\nThe sustainability strategy was based on the results derived from dialogue with relevant internal and external stakeholders, the analysis of existing business processes and management systems, and the existing materiality analysis. The materiality analysis identified topics that are highly relevant for Jungheinrich with regards to sustainability. These topics were evaluated by important stakeholders and internal experts and approved by the Board of Management. Of the 33 topics originally identified, 17 were classed as particularly relevant. The materiality analysis was examined in 2023 and it was confirmed that it is up to date. During preparation of the combined separate non-financial report in accordance with CSR-RUG, the material topics of the analysis were checked and prioritised with regard to both their relevance to the business and their degree of impact, in line with the principle of double materiality pursuant to Section 289c, Paragraph 3 of the German Commercial Code.\n\nThe following table shows the sustainability strategy's six initiatives, assigns them to material topics and shows the aims of the initiatives.\n\nImage /page/59/Figure/23 description: The image shows a list of six items. The first item is \"Climate neutrality²\", the second item is \"Eco efficiency and circular economy\", the third item is \"Employees and societies\", the fourth item is \"Governance\", the fifth item is \"Sustainable business models, products and services\", and the sixth item is \"Sustainability in the brand\".\n\n- 1 The fields of action are: automation, digitalisation, energy systems, efficiency, global footprint and sustainability. Further information on the corporate Strategy 2025+ can be found in the combined management report [ [page 23](#page-24-0) ].\n- 2 The term climate neutrality describes a state in which human activities have no net impact on the climate system. In addition to greenhouse gas emissions, such man-made impacts also include biogeophysical aspects, for example the contamination of soil and water, the consumption of raw materials or the loss of biodiversity. Jungheinrich pursues climate neutrality as its vision. The focus here is currently on achieving the target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions along the entire value chain.\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span

operations pursuant to Section 289c, Paragraph 3, Items 3 and 4 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) are reviewed and evaluated as part of the regular risk management. The detailed risk and opportunity report [ [page](#page-39-0) 38 ] can be found in the combined management report. Pursuant to Section 289c, Paragraph 3, Items 3 and 4 of the German Commercial Code, no material risks with highly likely serious negative impacts in the aspects outlined in CSR-RUG were identified for business operations, business relationships, products or services. No reportable correlations with the figures in the consolidated financial statements were discovered.\n\n#### Contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)\n\nThe SDG are a framework for social development from the UN that applies globally. As such, they enable companies to show how they contribute to sustainable development within their core business. Jungheinrich is committed to contributing to the achievement of the 17 SDG. With the focal points of its sustainability strategy, and as a sustainability enabler in intralogistics, Jungheinrich believes it can have a particular impact on the following SDG:\n\n| SDG                                                     | Definition                                                                                                 | Areas where Jungheinrich can make an impact                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Image: Good health and well-being SDG logo              | Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.                                           | Solutions and assistance systems to contain potential hazards and prevent accidents in warehouses (360-degree protection).

In order to keep making improvements in this regard, the company adopted a new sustainability organisation in the 2023 financial year, which came into force on 1 January 2024.\n\n#### Sustainability Team\n\nThe Sustainability Team coordinates the integration of the sustainability strategy in the company and reports directly to the Board of Management. In the reporting year, it was divided into the Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) and Sustainability Management & Performance departments. Since 2024, the Sustainability Team is composed of EHS and three new departments: Environmental Sustainability, Social Sustainability and Sustainability Governance. The EHS Coordinators will be responsible for EHS-related topics in the companies and will serve as multipliers for further sustainability topics. The EHS-related topics will be pooled in the local EHS teams and established in the Group organigram by 2025. The plan is to further standardise the global structural and procedural organisation and areas of responsibility.\n\nThese new departments will strengthen sustainability at Jungheinrich. The aim of this new organisation is a more focussed implementation of the sustainability strategy, which is based on the ESG structure.\n\n#### Sustainability organisation at Jungheinrich\n\nImage /page/62/Figure/15 description: The image shows an organizational chart for sustainability within a company. At the top is the \"Board of Management.\" Below and to the left is the \"Sustainability Team (coordination and consultation)\" which includes \"Corporate Sustainability, Health & Safety (Vice President Corporate Sustainability, Health & Safety)\", \"Business Continuity Manager\", \"Environment, Health & Safety (Head of Environment, Health & Safety)\", \"Environmental Sustainability (Head of Environmental Sustainability)\", \"Social Sustainability (Head of Social Sustainability)\", and \"Sustainability Governance (Head of Sustainability Governance)\". Below the \"Environment, Health & Safety\" block are \"EHS Coordinator Technics\" and \"EHS Coordinator Sales\". To the right of the \"Sustainability Team\" is the \"Sustainability Committee (strategy and implementation)\" which includes \"Chairmanship (Vice President Corporate Sustainability, Health & Safety)\", \"Representatives of (Central Group divisions, Regional companies, Sustainability Team)\", and \"Committees (Human Rights Council, Climate Council)\".\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\nSustainability strategy and organisation Environment\n\n#### <span id=\"page-63-0\"></span>Sustainability Committee\n\nThe Sustainability Committee was established in the 2022 financial year, and it meets every quarter. It consists of representatives from the central Group divisions, regional companies and the Sustainability Team. Major decisions are made by the Board of Management and confirmed by the Supervisory Board. The Committee plays a key role in passing sustainability decisions and directives throughout the organisation and is the platform for monitoring and managing project progress. The new Human Rights Council, a sub-committee of the Committee, plays a central role in implementing ethical goals. Its purpose is to help shape Jungheinrich's approach to respecting human rights. In addition, the Sustainability Committee along with the Climate Council, which was established in the reporting year, manages the implementation of the Group-wide measures to reduce GHG emissions.\n\n# Environment\n\n#### CLIMATE NEUTRALITY INITIATIVE\n\nThe term climate neutrality describes a state in which human activities have no net impact on the climate system. In addition to greenhouse gas emissions, such man-made impacts also include aspects like the contamination of soil and water, the consumption of raw materials or the loss of biodiversity. Jungheinrich contributes to climate neutrality by pursuing its net zero greenhouse gas emissions target<sup>1</sup>. Adapting to climate change is vital for Jungheinrich, too, in order to prepare for existing and future climate changes. For this purpose, Jungheinrich analyses potential climate risks and opportunities and derives the necessary measures.\n\n#### Jungheinrich's net zero targets\n\nIn the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, 195 nations committed to restrict the man-made global increase in temperatures2 to 1.5 degrees Celsius in comparison with pre-industrial levels. In turn, Jungheinrich committed itself to SBTi to support this target and as a company plans to achieve net zero Scope 1 to 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This target was\n\nofficially validated by SBTi in December 2023. Achieving the final target by 2050 will be accompanied by interim targets set for 2030 and 2040:\n\n| Target                                                                                               | Base year | Target year | Objective           |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|\n| 42-per-cent reduction in absolute Scope 1 emissions                                                  | 2021      | 2030        | SBTi                |\n| Increase in procurement of renewable electricity from 70 per cent to 100 per cent per year (Scope 2) | 2021      | 2030        | SBTi                |\n| 25-per-cent reduction in absolute Scope 3 emissions                                                  | 2021      | 2030        | SBTi                |\n| Net zero emissions in Scopes 1 and 2, including the neutralisation of emissions                      | 2021      | 2030        | Internal target     |\n| Net zero emissions in Scopes 1, 2 and 3, including the neutralisation of emissions                   | 2021      | 2040        | The Climate Pledge3 |\n| 90-per-cent reduction in absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions                                         | 2021      | 2050        | SBTi                |\n| Net zero emissions in Scopes 1, 2 and 3, including the neutralisation of residual emissions          | 2021      | 2050        | SBTi                |\n\n1 Jungheinrich understands net zero greenhouse gas emissions to mean balancing out emissions of the greenhouse gases CO₂, CH₄, N₂O, SF₆, HFCs, PFCs and NF₃, which are listed in the Kyoto Protocol. Jungheinrich will achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions initially by reducing directly and indirectly responsible emissions in Scopes 1, 2 and/or 3 through appropriate measures. The remaining unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions will then be balanced out in terms of volume through capital expenditure on carefully selected climate mitigation projects.\n\n2 cf. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2021): Sixth IPCC Assessment Report Working Group I Contribution: The Physical Science Basis.\n\n3 In contrast to SBTi, The Climate Pledge does not set any targets regarding the proportional composition of reduction and compensation measures in reaching the published target.\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Greenhouse gas management: Achieving net zero in four steps\n\nJungheinrich is pursuing a four-step management approach to achieve its net zero targets.\n\nThe basic prerequisite for achieving net zero is knowing the Group-wide greenhouse gas emissions, which Jungheinrich calculates annually using the (1) corporate carbon footprint. The ongoing creation of (2) product life cycle assessments [ [page](#page-68-0) 67 ] completes this data. The (3) Road to Zero Emissions is based on the data generated and continually updated. It contains important milestones and all central measures for systematically reducing Jungheinrich's emissions. In future, remaining emissions will be compensated for in the final step (4) to achieve net zero.\n\nGreenhouse gas management activity is coordinated centrally at Jungheinrich, and implemented in close cooperation with all relevant departments and Group companies. The majority of the greenhouse gas emissions are created in the value chain. In order to influence these greenhouse gas emissions, which are only indirectly caused by the Group, Jungheinrich remains in close contact with customers, suppliers and other partners.\n\n#### Corporate carbon footprint\n\nJungheinrich records its corporate carbon footprint in accordance with the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP). The control approach is used for this purpose. Scope 1 to 3 emissions are calculated separately and in detail for all companies in which Jungheinrich holds a voting and capital share of more than 50 per cent. All other companies are included in the statistics as investments (pursuant to Scope 3.15 GHGP). Scope 1 consists of all of Jungheinrich's direct emissions. Scope 2 contains emissions caused indirectly through the purchase of energy. Scope 3 covers all indirect emissions along the value chain.\n\n#### Structure of climate management at Jungheinrich\n\nImage /page/64/Figure/15 description: The image shows a diagram of four steps in a process, labeled 1 through 4. The first step is \"Corporate Carbon Footprint\", the second is \"Life Cycle Assessments\", the third is \"Road to Zero Emissions\", and the fourth is \"Voluntary Offsets of Residuals\". An arrow points from the top of the diagram, labeled \"Annual Update\", to the first step. Arrows connect each step to the next in the sequence.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-65-0\"></span>A schematic diagram illustrates the emission scopes according to GHGP that apply at Jungheinrich. Jungheinrich's corporate carbon footprint amounted to 2,733 thousand tonnes of CO2e in 2023. Of this figure, 1.9 per cent were\n\nScope 1 emissions, 0.3 per cent Scope 21 (market-based) and 97.8 per cent Scope 3. Based on Jungheinrich's Group revenue, the intensity of the greenhouse gas emissions was 0.49 thousand tonnes of CO2 e/€ million (2022: 0.62).\n\n#### Greenhouse gas emissions in the Jungheinrich Group according to the GHGP\n\nImage /page/65/Figure/10 description: The image shows a diagram of the different scopes of carbon emissions. At the top of the diagram, there is a cloud with the following gases: CO2, CH4, N2O, CO2e, PFCs, HFCs, SF6, and NF3. The diagram is divided into three sections: Scope 1 Direct, Scope 2 Indirect, and Scope 3 Indirect. Scope 3 Indirect is further divided into Upstream activities and Downstream activities. The Upstream activities include: Purchased goods and services (1), Capital goods (2), Fuel- and energy-related emissions (3), Transportation and distribution (4), Waste generated in operations (5), Business travel (6), Employee commuting (7), and Leased assets (8). Scope 1 Direct includes: Company facilities, Company vehicles, and Transportation and distribution (9). Scope 2 Indirect includes: Purchased energy for electricity and heat. The Downstream activities include: Transportation and distribution, Use of sold products (11), End of life treatment of sold products (12), Leased assets (13), and Investments (15).\n\n#### Greenhouse gas emissions\n\n| in thousand tonnes of CO2<br>e 2                         | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Scope 1                                                  | 51.3    | 51.2    | 55.7    |\n| Scope 2 market-based                                     | 7.7     | 7.8     | 9.3     |\n| Scope 2 location-based                                   | 26.7    | 26.7    | 24.6    |\n| Scope 3 total                                            | 2,674.2 | 2,886.8 | 2,555.9 |\n| Scope 3 upstream                                         | 1,127.1 | 1,215.7 | 1,209.9 |\n| Scope 3 downstream                                       | 1,547.1 | 1,671.1 | 1,346.0 |\n| Intensity of greenhouse gas<br>emissions (Scopes 1 to 3) | 0.49    | 0.62    | 0.62    |\n\nTotal greenhouse gas emissions declined by 7.2 per cent in 2023 against the previous year. Scope 1 CO2e emissions fell 7.9 per cent in comparison with 2021 and remained virtually on a par with the previous year with an increase of 0.2 per cent. While a more efficient use of fossil fuels helped to reduce emissions, the slight increase in comparison with the previous year is due partly to the acquisition of companies and the expansion of production capacities. A constant reduction in Scope 2 (market-based) greenhouse gas emissions can be seen in comparison with the previous years. The reason for this is the gradual, global switch of electricity supplies to renewable energy sources at the company's locations. Upstream and downstream CO2e emissions in\n\n1 Scope 2 emissions can be calculated using two methods: location-based and market-based. In the location-based method, energy consumption is calculated using average national emissions factors. In the market-based method, the CO2 e emissions are calculated using the individual emissions factors of the company's own energy provider. This method is therefore more specific, and thus more relevant to Jungheinrich.\n\n<sup>2</sup> The emissions factors used correspond to the usual sources (for example, International Energy Agency [IEA], Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [DEFRA], Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]). The key figures are partially based on commonly-used extrapolation logic. For example, some key figures were calculated pro rata using comparable companies or types of companies. Depending on the situation, information regarding full-time equivalents (FTE), revenue and /or surface area was used for this purpose.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-66-0\"></span>About Jungheinrich\n\nScope 3 decreased by 7.4 per cent against 2022, despite the positive business performance. This decline is also due to the improvement in emissions factors.\n\n#### Road to Zero Emissions\n\nJungheinrich takes systematic action to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions based on the findings of the corporate carbon footprint and the product life cycle assessments.\n\nWith regards to Scope 1 emissions, switching the vehicle fleet, both company cars and after-sales vehicles, to electric power is an important milestone on the road to achieving net zero. The transition of the after-sales fleet to fully electric vehicles began at the end of the 2023 financial year. The proportion of electric vehicles, including company cars, is constantly being expanded. Charging infrastructure is also being expanded step-by-step at company locations, and there are now more than 50 new charging points at the Group headquarters in Hamburg.\n\nAn important milestone for Scope 2 is the transition at all company locations to electricity that comes entirely from renewable energy sources. The German locations completed this transition back in the 2021 financial year. International locations are scheduled to transition by 2030 at the latest. The transition was completed in 28 countries by the end of the 2023 financial year. The Norderstedt plant has also been using CO2 e-neutral district heating since 2021, as has the Finnish marketing and sales office since 2023. In addition, Jungheinrich has been installing photovoltaic equipment at appropriate locations worldwide since 2022. Eight locations in Germany alone have photovoltaics equipment fitted to generate their own electricity or are in the process of having it fitted. In 2023, for instance, the roof of the car park at the Group headquarters in Hamburg was covered with 630 photovoltaic modules over the 1,100 square-metre surface.\n\nJungheinrich is also striving to reduce Scope 3 emissions. In the 2023 financial year, systematic measures were identified to reduce emissions from purchased products and services (Scopes 3.1/3.2), opportunities were developed to optimise the sustainability of packaging (Scopes 3.1/3.12), and awareness for the use of electricity from renewable sources was raised among initial important partners when using products (Scope 3.11) 1 . Jungheinrich has been manufacturing exclusively battery-powered trucks since March 2023. In comparison with forklift trucks with an internal combustion engine, emissions from battery-powered trucks are lower during product use (Scope 3.11). In addition, the aim is to continuously increase the efficiency of material handling equipment (Scope 3.11) and to ensure that these products are designed with ease of disassembly in mind from the outset (Scopes 3.1/3.12). By refining its requirements for eco design, Jungheinrich is also planning to advance the viability of circular economy or climate friendly alternative materials [ [page](#page-67-0) 66 ]. Further measures along the entire value chain are continually being evaluated and systematically implemented.\n\n#### Voluntary compensation and neutralisation of remaining GHG emissions\n\nIn order to reach the net zero targets from 2030, Jungheinrich has decided to compensate remaining CO2e emissions through voluntary capital expenditure in climate change mitigation projects. A comprehensive catalogue of criteria was developed to enable the identification of such climate change mitigation projects that fulfil recognised quality standards and Jungheinrich's own high standards when it comes to compensation. This catalogue was updated in 2023 due to the specific requirements of STBi regarding the neutralisation of greenhouse gas emissions. The quality and effectiveness of the projects and their regional connection to Jungheinrich are the characteristics looked for when choosing compensation projects.\n\n#### Adapting to climate change\n\nCompanies are subject to potential negative impacts from climate change, whereby it is differentiated between physical and transitory climate risks and opportunities. Physical climate risks include potential damage to buildings due to storms or heavy rainfall. Transitory climate risks can impact companies in the form of changes in demand for loweremission technology. In meeting the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation [ [page](#page-80-0) 79 ], Jungheinrich's first step was to analyse the physical climate risks at selected locations in a structured manner and examine existing solutions as well as potential solutions for adaptation. The focus was on plants where material handling equipment or lithiumion batteries are produced, the spare parts centre in Kaltenkirchen and the Group headquarters in Hamburg. In total, the analysis covered 14 locations in Germany, one in China and one in Czechia.\n\nThe guideline provided by the German Federal Environment Agency that substantiates the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation was used for the climate risk analysis. Software was deployed for the analysis at Jungheinrich that processes and prepares the climate risk data from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports. If a climate threat is relevant for a particular location, a risk analysis is performed for the actual threat based on historical data and for the future development of the climate threat based on optimistic and pessimistic IPCC climate scenarios2 up to 2050. The climate risks identified and evaluated by the software are validated according to their economic relevance together with employees at the location from the Production, Environment, Health & Safety and Facility Management divisions. The climate risks are then\n\n<sup>1</sup> Due to a lack of definitions in the GHGP, no separate figure for Scope 3.11 is presented in accordance with the market-based approach.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) lay out certain greenhouse gas concentration scenarios. Jungheinrich uses RCP 2.6 as the optimistic scenario and RCP 8.5 for the pessimistic scenario for its climate risk analysis.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-67-0\"></span>assigned to the qualitative categories of high, medium and low, without a financial assessment. High risks for some locations are storms, floods, heavy rainfall and drought/water stress. The same risks are classed as medium for other locations. Heatwaves and cold snaps are also medium risks. Then an evaluation is performed for all locations to see whether any adaptation measures are already in place for high and medium risks in order to reduce potential impacts. This has shown that all of the locations examined already fully protect themselves against current and future climate threats. Adaptation measures implemented against the threat of heatwaves include full air conditioning in office buildings with comprehensive insulation or targeted cooling of temperature-sensitive equipment. The threat of heavy rainfall or floods is countered through seepage reservoirs or mobile protection systems (for example, sand sacks). Adaptation plans are made if there are no or insufficient adaptation solutions for high climate risks. Adaptation plans must be designed in such a way that adaptation solutions that can significantly reduce high climate risks are implemented within five years. For medium risks, a list of adaptation solutions is created that must be taken into account for future projects at the site.\n\nThe Group intends to expand the physical climate risk analysis to more locations in 2024. In addition, there are plans to analyse the transitory climate risks and opportunities for Jungheinrich. The financial and strategic implications of the climate risks and opportunities will also be evaluated.\n\n#### ECO EFFICIENCY AND CIRCULAR ECONOMY INITIATIVE\n\nJungheinrich is aware of the environmental impact and the limited resources in light of the climbing global demand for resources. That is why the company has decided to further break its growth away from resource consumption. The targeted improvement of the products' ecological efficiency and promoting circular economies are therefore of vital importance to Jungheinrich. Considering the increasing scarcity of resources, a circular economy in which every single end product of a consumption or production process is the basis for further processes is gaining in importance. Ideally, this should result in no waste or emissions. The use and preservation of resources in a circular economy and the development of resource- and energy-efficient products also support the path to climate neutrality.\n\n#### Eco design and product life cycle assessments\n\n#### Eco design\n\nProduct design has an economic and ecological role to play as early as the development phase at Jungheinrich, as the largest share of the environmental impact of the product's life cycle is determined in this phase. Jungheinrich therefore integrates the principles of circular economies and the environmental efficiency of new trucks from the beginning using predetermined criteria for eco design.\n\nUsing product environmental compatibility assessments, Jungheinrich explores the potential to achieve energy and resource efficiency from the beginning. Defined milestones in the product development process ensure that the various eco design criteria are recorded, evaluated and implemented. Aspects of both resource efficiency and performance are taken into account. The Group plans to expand the existing eco design requirements to include the aspects illustrated in the image in close cooperation with the departments.\n\n#### Eco design criteria in product development\n\nImage /page/67/Figure/16 description: The image shows a diagram about eco design criteria. On the left, there is a green arrow pointing to the right. The top part of the arrow is yellow and labeled \"New products\". The bottom part of the arrow is gray and labeled \"Product improvements\". On the right, there is a table with two columns. The left column is titled \"Natural resources\" and lists the following criteria: Resource consumption/emissions, Energy consumption/efficiency, Material/raw material selection, Recycled material, Recyclable material, Hazardous and critical ingredients, and Packaging. The right column is titled \"Performance\" and lists the following criteria: Lifetime/durability, Recyclability/recoverability, Disassembly and assembly capability, Service capability/service efficiency, Procurement (global vs. local), and Design for refurbishment.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-68-0\"></span>About Jungheinrich\n\nThe design of new products is increasingly dependent on requirements relating to critical ingredients. Jungheinrich ensures material compliance by taking the following criteria into consideration:\n\n- Jungheinrich meets the legal requirements for regulated hazardous ingredients such as the REACH Regulation 1 (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) requirements or the RoHS Directive 2 (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) for relevant products.\n- Jungheinrich goes beyond the legal requirements and strives to exclude materials in its products that are controversial from a social or ecological point of view, even if they are not yet legally regulated.\n- Jungheinrich demands comprehensive material declarations from suppliers.\n\nIn a multi-stage material compliance project, launched in the financial year 2020, Jungheinrich created a central approach to take into account legal and internal requirements in the product development process for trucks, batteries and battery chargers. The intention is to safeguard the procurement, availability and evaluation of relevant information. Transparency regarding regulated substances is created by including the relevant suppliers of materials directly used in the production of the previously mentioned product groups. With this in mind, Jungheinrich developed a centralised IT system to document the material compliance status of these suppliers. The relevant requirements are provided in the Supplier Manual in order to include suppliers in the development process at an early stage. As a result, prohibited materials are not used in the supply chains and the procurement of restricted or hazardous materials is avoided. The recognition of material compliance requirements is systematically established for new suppliers in the supplier qualification.\n\n#### Product life cycle assessments\n\nJungheinrich has been working consistently on improving its products' ecological efficiency, and especially that of trucks. The company prepares life cycle assessments to evaluate and monitor the sustainability performance of its products, which are developed in accordance with its eco design requirements. These assessments help Jungheinrich to meet regulatory and customer requirements. As part of a software expansion, Jungheinrich plans to systematically create life cycle assessments for new developments and calculate CO2e emissions for all phases of the life cycle. This will enable the detection of emission reduction potential early on in the development process.\n\nComprehensive life cycle assessments have already been created for the following products: a forklift truck (ETV 216i), two batteries for material handling equipment (lithium-ion and lead-acid) and a stacker crane. These assessments were also performed and certified in accordance with the principles of DIN EN ISO 14040/14044. Other environmental factors besides CO2e emissions were included in the assessments and the product life cycle phases analysed more closely. The detailed analysis of all components and phases from raw material extraction to the end of the product life cycle has created transparency in the value chain and supplied important findings for future product development. The product life cycle assessments performed by Jungheinrich have shown that the majority of CO2e emissions for material handling equipment occur in the use phase, and that they are highly dependent on the energy requirements of the battery used as the drive technology. Jungheinrich has compared lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries using product life cycle assessments. 3 The lithium-ion battery caused around 20 per cent less CO2e emissions in total across its life cycle, and 15 per cent less\n\nImage /page/68/Figure/15 description: The image shows a diagram of the life cycle phases of trucks. The diagram is a circle with seven phases, numbered 1 through 7. Phase 1 is \"Raw materials\", phase 2 is \"Processing\", phase 3 is \"Production/refurbishment\", phase 4 is \"Transport and delivery\", phase 5 is \"Use\", phase 6 is \"Service\", and phase 7 is \"End of life\". From phase 7, there are two arrows pointing to \"Waste\" and \"Recycling\".\n\nemissions were caused during its use. This result confirms Jungheinrich's target of ensuring that 50 per cent of material handling equipment is equipped with lithium-ion batteries by 2025. Jungheinrich's POWERLiNE series, equipped with integrated lithium-ion batteries, makes an important contribution to achieving this target.\n\n3 The functional unit for this assessment was based on the average lifespan of the lithium-ion battery used in the ETV 216i truck (15,000 operating hours). Based on this functional unit, the comparable battery systems are defined as follows: a functional battery system with a lithium-ion battery and a functional battery system with 2.3 lead-acid batteries.\n\n<sup>1</sup> REACH Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 is an EU chemicals regulation that came into force on 1 June 2007.\n\n<sup>2</sup> The RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU relates to restrictions on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-69-0\"></span>About Jungheinrich\n\nDuring preparations to meet the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, Jungheinrich calculated the CO2e emissions of 19 reference trucks in the 2023 financial year from the highest revenue-generating models. The CO2e emissions saved over the entire life cycle of the trucks analysed were also calculated. Significantly reduced emissions were the result, particularly where lithium-ion batteries were used instead of lead-acid batteries as the drive technology.\n\nThe result of the product life cycle assessment comparison showed that an average reduction in CO2e emissions of 23 per cent was achieved with lithium-ion battery-powered trucks. The CO2e emissions were calculated using the ISO 14067 method and the result audited by an external auditor.\n\n#### Establishing a circular economy\n\nJungheinrich launched a process in the 2023 reporting year to develop a holistic strategy to advance the circular economy. Starting with the identification and definition of material circular economy terms, the relevant fields of action for Jungheinrich are determined and measures for expanding the circular economy in the relevant fields created. Companyand product-related programmes to support the breakaway from resources have also been implemented:\n\n- Truck rental models: Jungheinrich offers material handling equipment rental models that save resources and also keep ownership rights for raw materials and materials with the company. This enables Jungheinrich to ensure recyclability in the long term.\n- Used trucks: Jungheinrich has been refurbishing its own material handling equipment at the refurbishment plant in Dresden since 2006. The demand for reconditioned forklifts led to the opening of a plant in Ploiești, Romania,\n\nin 2022. In 2023, Jungheinrich industrially refurbished 7,491 trucks (2022: 5,588) with a reuse ratio of around 92.0 per cent (2022: 93.0 per cent). The proportion of older trucks in for refurbishing rose in comparison with the previous year, which required more parts to be changed. The reuse ratio decreased slightly for this reason. At the same time, customer requirements regarding the functional equipment of the used trucks impacted the refurbishment process. This resulted in a rise in the replaced and recyclable components to 7.3 per cent (2022: 6.1 per cent). A total of 99.3 per cent (2022: 99.1 per cent) of a truck's materials were returned to the loop in 2023. Through refurbishment, which saves raw materials and energy, Jungheinrich can extend the life cycle of material handling equipment and minimise the use of new parts.\n\n Optimised battery life cycles: Jungheinrich is aiming to extend battery life cycle phases. Lithium-ion batteries that have previously been used in new trucks are refurbished for use in a used truck. Battery cells with insufficient capacity for material handling equipment are used in stationary energy storage systems before they are recycled.\n\n#### Definition of environmental standards in environmental and energy programmes\n\nJungheinrich has made a collection of measures for environmentally friendly conduct available on the internal sustainability platform. These contain best practice examples and suggestions for sustainable transformation at the Jungheinrich locations. 17 companies had ISO 14001-certified environmental management systems in place in the 2023 financial year, and seven had ISO 50001-certified energy management systems.\n\nThe principles of energy efficiency and the sparing use of natural resources are implemented based on Jungheinrich's internal environmental standards, which go beyond the legal requirements in some cases. These environmental standards include but are not limited to the following principles:\n\n- improving energy efficiency\n- increasing the recyclability of resources\n- efficient water and effluent management\n- preserving and promoting biodiversity\n- active hazardous substance management\n\nThe key figures for 2021 presented in this report do not include all fully consolidated companies and therefore are only comparable with the figures for 2022 and 2023 to a limited extent. The key figures are partially based on commonly-used extrapolation logic. For example, some values have been extrapolated for the whole of the year under review based on actual figures available for part of the year. Additionally, some key figures have been calculated pro rata using comparable companies or types of companies.\n\n#### Energy management\n\nThe integration of sustainable energy solutions remains an important building block for future energy management. Energy management includes increasing security of supply, improving the energy efficiency of equipment, and reducing dependence on price fluctuations and supply bottlenecks through the use of a decentralised energy supply. Jungheinrich consistently focusses on the use of electricity from renewable sources and its own decentralised energy generation.\n\nEnergy consumption is optimised through targeted energysaving measures and the use of efficient technology. The continual improvement of energy management is reviewed in internal and external audits and ensured through measures derived from the audits.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-70-0\"></span>Measured against Group revenue, Jungheinrich's energy consumption of 295,113 MWh 1 (2022: 292,221 MWh) corresponded to an energy intensity of 53.3 MWh/€ million (2022: 61.3 MWh/€ million) in the reporting year. Consumption of electricity generated by the Group from renewable sources was recorded for the first time in 2023 and came to 488 MWh.\n\n#### The following table shows energy consumption in the Jungheinrich Group:\n\n|                                                                                       | 2023       | 2022       | 2021       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Natural gas in kWh2                                                                   | 51,407,555 | 52,099,655 | 50,393,583 |\n| Heating oil in kWh                                                                    | 1,288,111  | 1,346,004  | 1,514,197  |\n| Diesel in l                                                                           | 12,996,470 | 13,366,426 | 10,094,990 |\n| Petrol in l                                                                           | 3,900,233  | 2,815,367  | 450,141    |\n| Ethanol in l                                                                          | 68,416     | 75,457     | 48,365     |\n| LPG in kg                                                                             | 50,449     | 43,934     | –          |\n| Public electricity in kWh                                                             | 66,243,009 | 68,503,026 | 56,333,950 |\n| Consumption of electricity<br>generated by the Group from<br>renewable sources in kWh | 488,002    | –          | –          |\n| District heating in kWh                                                               | 12,519,820 | 12,784,725 | 11,563,197 |\n\n#### Waste and recycling management\n\nJungheinrich aims to continually increase its ability to recycle resources, and is guided by the principle of prevention before recycling, recycling before disposal. The targets in this context are:\n\n- no landfill waste at German plants by 2025\n- reducing the global landfill waste by a third by 2025 (base year: 2019)\n\n no landfill waste created by internal work processes at locations in countries with established recycling systems by 2030\n\nThe project team for introducing central waste management achieved the following in the reporting year:\n\n- transparency on waste streams at the plants\n- uniform internal waste statistics\n- comparison of recycle/disposal procedures\n- measures to optimise disposal channels\n\nThe waste statistics show that the majority of waste is recycled. Total waste in 2023 rose partially due to the expansion of production capacities and an increase in the volume of old batteries disposed.\n\n#### Total amount of waste\n\n| in tonnes                 | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total hazardous waste     | 10,704 | 7,696  | 5,239  |\n| Recycling of materials    | 8,876  | 6,087  | 3,791  |\n| Thermal recovery          | 735    | 812    | 353    |\n| Disposal                  | 1,093  | 797    | 1,095  |\n| Total non-hazardous waste | 13,310 | 13,473 | 11,036 |\n| Recycling of materials    | 11,463 | 11,527 | 8801   |\n| Thermal recovery          | 1,036  | 1,119  | 1,057  |\n| Disposal                  | 811    | 827    | 1,178  |\n\n#### Water and effluent management\n\nThe Group's environmental management system views water and effluent management as an important environmental aspect that it has a direct influence on. Jungheinrich is committed to handling water efficiently in order to reduce water consumption and the volume of effluent produced on an ongoing basis. Circular economy solutions are vital in this regard. A production water treatment facility is in operation at one production location with the aim of creating internal water cycles. An effluent pretreatment facility at another plant also allows for production effluent to be fed back into the sewage systems; this means effluent does not have to be picked up by a specialist disposal company. Ways of treating and feeding water back into the sewage system is also being examined for other plants. One action taken to reduce water consumption was the substitution of a wet chemical pretreatment process in a powder coating facility, meaning that this process will no longer require water in the future.\n\nThe Group withdraws a total of 293 megalitres of water (2022: 315 megalitres), of which 165 megalitres is groundwater and 128 megalitres water from third parties, such as municipal water companies. The remaining water withdrawal comes from surface water, seawater and own water sources. Groundwater is primarily withdrawn for the Moosburg and Degernpoint production plants' cooling systems, where the water is used in closed loops and returned.\n\n<sup>1</sup> The key figure provided is based on commonly-used conversion factors.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Including natural gas consumption for the production of electricity through the cogeneration unit at the Degernpoint plant.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-79-0\"></span>About Jungheinrich\n\n- The POWERLiNE truck series, launched in 2022, consists of CO2e-neutral 1 lithium-ion trucks manufactured with renewable electricity and that consume around 20 per cent less energy during daily operation in comparison with lead-acid trucks.\n- A CO2 e-neutral after-sales 2 service had been introduced in five countries by the end of 2023, with plans to expand to more countries.\n- Jungheinrich operates two refurbishment plants and other refurbishment facilities for used trucks, and offers customers truck rental models. These actions support a circular economy.\n- The company enables improvements in energy efficiency and warehouse and material flow optimisation with its digitalisation and automation solutions and targeted customer consulting.\n- Jungheinrich's 360-degree protection programme also offers solutions and assistance systems that focus on customer safety.\n\nJungheinrich is also applying its energy skills to new application areas outside of warehouse logistics. For instance, Jungheinrich offers customised consulting and drive train components under the name Powertrain Solutions, from the engine to the control units and including lithium-ion batteries and battery chargers, for the agricultural and machine construction sectors.\n\n#### Product quality and customer safety\n\nJungheinrich has established ISO 9001 quality management systems in the majority of its plants in Germany and abroad in order to guarantee the quality of its products and customer safety. The Group's central quality organisation standardises processes and establishes uniform standards for suppliers. This guarantees that the product materials procured meet the highest quality standards. Active participation in standardisation processes and associations is important to Jungheinrich, as standards promote innovation through sustainable product optimisation and create the foundation for increasing the products' safety and reliability further. Standards also promote legal certainty, facilitate export and create competitive equality. Taking these aspects into consideration, Jungheinrich actively participates in these processes by sending experts to the standardisation and association process committees. These include DIN standardisation committees (German Institute for Standardisation), European standardisation bodies (CEN/CENELEC), and bodies of the globally active International Organization of Standardization (ISO), VDI working groups (Verein Deutscher Ingenieure), Verband Deutscher Maschinen- und Anlagenbau (VDMA) committees, and European Materials Handling Federation (FEM) committees. Jungheinrich also particularly observes competition law regulations when participating in standardisation processes and associations.\n\nJungheinrich's tight service network plays a decisive role when it comes to customer safety. It enables direct consultation on site and a fast response to product disruptions. The majority of the service reports prepared by after-sales service technicians is analysed with system support. Based on this data, measures are derived to improve safety and reduce product downtimes. In the event of product incidents, appropriate processes including direct contact are initiated.\n\n<sup>1</sup> This is achieved by reducing emissions during the manufacturing processes and investing in certified compensation projects to offset CO2 e emissions. The greenhouse gas emissions for the trucks up until the point of delivery is calculated using recurring life cycle assessments based on DIN EN ISO 14040 specifications.

In order to achieve these targets, the EU Commission created an action plan to redirect capital flows to a more sustainable economy. One material component of this action plan is the EU Taxonomy Regulation, which provides a classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities. For this purpose, economic activities are evaluated according to their contribution to one of the six environmental objectives.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements (see Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and Article 8 and Article 10 of the Delegated Act on reporting obligations under Article 8), the following section contains the required disclosures according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Here, amongst other figures, Jungheinrich presents the taxonomy-aligned, taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-non-eligible shares of Group turnover (turnover), as well as capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx) for the first and second environmental objectives of the Climate Delegated Act for the 2023 financial year.\n\n#### Environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy Regulation\n\nImage /page/80/Figure/13 description: The image is a circular diagram illustrating a cycle of environmental actions. The cycle is numbered from 1 to 6, with each number representing a different action. 1 is Climate Change Mitigation, 2 is Climate Change Adaptation, 3 is Sustainable Use and Protection of Water and Marine Resources, 4 is Transition to a Circular Economy, 5 is Pollution Prevention and Control, and 6 is Protection and Restoration of Biodiversity and Eco-systems. The cycle is connected by a yellow arrow, indicating the flow of actions.\n\nFor the third to sixth environmental objectives of the Environment Delegated Act, disclosures relate to the taxonomyeligible and taxonomy-non-eligible shares of Group turnover (turnover), as well as CapEx and OpEx. The key figures are differentiated according to the relevant economic activities.\n\n#### IMPLEMENTATION OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\nJungheinrich's business model as a solutions provider for intralogistics is relevant to the environmental objectives \"Climate Change Mitigation\" and \"Transition to a Circular Economy\". The manufacture of electric material handling equipment can contribute to climate change mitigation. Their repair and refurbishment as well as the rental and lease business can support the transition to a circular economy. The substantial contribution made to climate change mitigation can be proven for several lithium-ion battery-powered trucks.\n\nIn order to report on the taxonomy-aligned and taxonomyeligible economic activities in the 2023 financial year, Jungheinrich has taken the following steps:\n\n- established a project team, including experts from Corporate Controlling, Corporate Sustainability and Health & Safety, to implement the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, support the units to the fullest extent possible, and consolidate and verify the reported data\n- reviewed business activities and identified taxonomyeligible economic activities\n- evaluated taxonomy alignment of taxonomy-eligible economic activities and the associated turnover, CapEx and OpEx at central and decentral levels\n- performed a test run for the first half of 2023 to optimise the Group-wide implementation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and to try out the initial application of the Environment Delegated Act\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Assessment of taxonomy-eligible economic activities\n\nEconomic activities that are described in the Climate Delegated Act or Environment Delegated Act are taxonomyeligible. Jungheinrich examined relevant, taxonomy-eligible economic activities for machine and plant construction and discovered that the Group can make substantial contributions in particular to climate change mitigation and a circular economy. The taxonomy-eligible activities identified by Jungheinrich for environmental objective 1 are also taxonomy-eligible for environmental objective 2 due to the description of the activity. However, as no turnover from enabling activities and no separate CapEx or OpEx exist that specifically contribute to adapting to climate change, Jungheinrich has assigned the corresponding taxonomyeligible economic activities to the \"Climate Change Mitigation\" environmental objective. Economic activity 7.2. from environmental objective 1 is also taxonomy-eligible for environmental objective 4. This is assigned to the \"Climate Change Mitigation\" environmental objective as it does not contribute to a circular economy. Beyond this, Jungheinrich did not identify any taxonomy-eligible economic activities for the other environmental objectives.\n\n#### Taxonomy-eligible economic activities \"Climate Change Mitigation\"

In line with its assessment of relevance, Jungheinrich defines a data centre as an IT room from which more than a third of users in the Jungheinrich Group are provided with IT services.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Taxonomy-eligible economic activities \"Transition to a Circular Economy\" environmental objective\n\n| Number | Name                                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 5.1.   | Repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing                                          | ■ Repair and maintenance of products by the Jungheinrich<br>after-sales services<br>■ Refurbishment of used material handling equipment at plants |\n| 5.4.   | Sale of second-hand goods                                                          | ■ Sale of used material handling equipment                                                                                                        |\n| 5.5.   | Product-as-a-service and other circular use-<br>and result-oriented service models | ■ Leasing and rental of new and used material handling equipment                                                                                  |\n\nIn the \"Climate Change Mitigation\" environmental objective, economic activity 3.6. is particularly relevant for Jungheinrich in terms of value. The description of this activity in the Climate Delegated Act contains no clear definition of the term low carbon technologies and is therefore open to interpretation. Jungheinrich pools machine construction technologies in this economic activity, among other things, that aim to substantially lower direct greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 emissions) in other economic sectors:\n\n- Jungheinrich's electric material handling equipment makes a contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in logistics, retail and wholesale, among other sectors. This also encompasses mobile robots. Mobile robots include automated guided vehicles and autonomous mobile robots that are battery-powered.\n- Jungheinrich provides electric power train technology for the manufacture of zero-emission vehicles, particularly in the agricultural and machine construction industries. The use of electrified trucks results in lower greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWith the introduction of the Environment Delegated Act, Jungheinrich's activities in the field of circular economy became [ [page](#page-69-0) 68 ] taxonomy-eligible for the first time. These relate to the after-sales service, which extends the useful life of the products sold through repair and maintenance. The industrial refurbishment of used material handling equipment and the subsequent sale also lead to a longer service life and an increase in the use of recycled components. The truck rental models ensure that ownership rights to resources and materials remain with Jungheinrich and thus the rest of the material handling equipment's life cycle can be monitored and managed. Due to the new regulatory requirements, Jungheinrich will report the sale of used trucks under economic activity 5.4. and the rental and lease business under 5.5. of environmental objective 4 from the financial year 2023. These activities had previously been reported under economic activity 3.6. in environmental objective 1. From the reporting year, the acquisition and operation of after-sales service vehicles, which are necessary for performing repair services, will be reported under economic activity 5.1. of environmental objective 4. This was previously reported under economic activity 6.5. in environmental objective 1.\n\n#### Assessment of taxonomy-aligned economic activities\n\nFollowing the identification of taxonomy-eligible economic activities, it was examined whether they fulfilled the requirements pursuant to Article 3 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. In accordance with the requirements for the 2023 financial year, the review related to the \"Climate Change Mitigation\" environmental objective. An economic activity is considered taxonomy-aligned if\n\n- 1. it complies with the technical screening criteria for a substantial contribution to the \"Climate Change Mitigation\" environmental objective,\n- 2. it complies with the technical screening criteria for preventing substantial harm to the other environmental objectives (also known as Do No Significant Harm [DNSH] criteria), 3. guarantees the minimum safeguards.\n\nAs all of the criteria mentioned in Article 3 must be met pursuant to the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the examination is over as soon as one criterion is not met. The compliance with minimum safeguards was reviewed centrally. The DNSH criteria outlined in Annex A, B and D of the Climate Delegated Act were evaluated at the level of the locations relevant to the economic activity. The review of the substantial contribution, the specific DNSH criteria and the DNSH criteria in Annex C was performed at product level.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Compliance with minimum safeguards\n\nJungheinrich must ensure that minimum safeguards are adhered to in order to achieve taxonomy alignment. This requires processes to be implemented both within the company and in the value chain that ensure compliance with due diligence obligations that relate to the following issues: human rights, including labour and consumer rights, (anti-) corruption and bribery, taxation as well as fair competition. As part of the analysis of compliance with minimum safeguards, the criteria for each topic were analysed together with the parties responsible in the various areas.\n\nIn the [Policy Statement to Respect the Human Rights](https://media-live2.prod.scw.jungheinrichcloud.com/resource/blob/1405304/8b92c94f0ec750ed80787d0c4cde0326/policy-statement-to-respect-the-human-rights-data.pdf) Jungheinrich acknowledges the minimum safeguard standards set out in Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UNGP, the OECP Guidelines for Multinational Business and the ILO core labour standards. The processes for complying with human rights due diligence obligations are described in the Declaration of Principle on Respecting Human Rights.\n\nComplying with compliance regulations is important to the company and its committees. Jungheinrich has a CMS that ensures that legal provisions and corporate guidelines are complied with. This system undergoes continual development [ [page](#page-75-0) 74 ]. The development focusses on the prevention and discovery of corruption and compliance with applicable competition as well as tax laws and regulations. Corruption, antitrust, tax and other risks are integrated into the Group risk management system. Jungheinrich trains employees and managers according to target groups on anti-corruption, antitrust and tax law.\n\nThe analysis shows that Jungheinrich has implemented appropriate processes for complying with minimum safeguards on human rights, (anti-)corruption and bribery, taxation as well as fair competition, and that there have been no serious violations that suggest deficient procedures. Jungheinrich therefore meets the minimum safeguards requirements pursuant to Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\n#### Compliance with technical screening criteria\n\nCompliance with the technical screening criteria for a substantial contribution to the \"Climate Change Mitigation\" environmental objective and the avoidance of significant harm to other environmental objectives is based on the Climate Delegated Act.\n\nThe first step involves reviewing the alignment of the economic activity related to the development and manufacture of taxonomy-eligible products. In this context, the production of lithium-ion batteries (economic activity 3.4.) and electric material handling equipment (economic activity 3.6.) is relevant for Jungheinrich.\n\nJungheinrich fulfils the substantial contribution to economic activity 3.4. The lithium-ion batteries manufactured, which partly consist of secondary raw materials, are used in material handling equipment and lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions in intralogistics.\n\nTo attain the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation in economic activity 3.6., the Climate Delegated Act requires the following: Low carbon technologies must be proven to substantially reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions in other economic sectors. This must be in comparison with best performing alternative technologies available on the market. The reduction is considered substantial by Jungheinrich if greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by at least 5 per cent. Lead-acid batteries are a common means of electrochemical energy storage and are considered a mature technology. Lithium-ion batteries in contrast are gaining in importance and are primarily used in electric vehicles. They have a very high energy density and a longer service life than lead-acid batteries. Jungheinrich therefore views lead-acid batteries as the best performing alternative technology available on the market to lithium-ion batteries. A comparison of both battery systems performed internally using product life cycle assessments showed that the lithium-ion batteries are a low carbon alternative to lead-acid batteries as they emit less carbon during the use phase. All battery-powered material handling equipment fitted with a lithium-ion battery therefore aims to substantially reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions. In order to prove the savings, Jungheinrich prepared product carbon footprints for 19 truck series in accordance with ISO 14067 and had the assessments audited externally [ [page](#page-68-0) 67 ]. The analyses compare the life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of lithium-ion trucks with lead-acid trucks. The results show that lithium-ion trucks emit 15 per cent less greenhouse gases during their life cycle. The products in the series analysed therefore make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout Jungheinrich\n\nThe next step will be examining the DNSH criteria for economic activities 3.4. and 3.6. To prevent significant harm to environmental objective 2, \"Climate Change Adaptation\", a climate risk and vulnerability assessment is required for all taxonomy-eligible activities in the Climate Delegated Act. These assessments were performed for all relevant locations to identify which economic activities could be affected by physical climate risks [ [page 65](#page-66-0) ]. The climate hazards defined in the Climate Delegated Act are taken into account. If a climate hazard is relevant for a particular location, a risk analysis is performed for the actual hazard based on historical data as well as for the future development. These are based on an optimistic and pessimistic IPCC scenario to 2050. An assessment of the regional natural hazards is performed for key suppliers. The analyses are performed with prepared climate risk data based on IPCC reports from an external software and data provider. Adaptation solutions for minimising risks are derived and implemented if necessary based on the findings of the risk analysis. Jungheinrich thus fulfils the DNSH criteria of environmental objective 2 for certain products for economic activities 3.4. and 3.6.\n\nThe DNSH criteria for environmental objective 3 define requirements for the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources. The requirements in Annex B of the Climate Delegated Act must be complied with for economic activities 3.4. and 3.6. Environmental management systems in line with ISO 14001 have been established at the relevant plants, and a Group-wide guideline outlines operating water and effluent management. Environmental impacts on water are regularly evaluated and remedial action is taken if necessary. Jungheinrich also strives to continually reduce water consumption. The analysis shows that Jungheinrich fulfils the DNSH criteria of environmental objective 3 for economic activities 3.4. and 3.6.\n\nThe review of DNSH criteria for environmental objective 4 \"Transition to a Circular Economy\" is performed at the level of economic activities 3.4. and 3.6. Measures to promote a circular economy are required, if applicable. Internally predetermined criteria relating to high durability, recyclability and easy disassembly apply for the development of lithium-ion batteries and electric material handling equipment. The products are also manufactured from secondary raw materials. The other criteria do not apply to the products. In line with internal guidelines, the Group strives to recycle waste to the fullest extent possible in the production process. Critical materials, defined by Jungheinrich in this context as substances of especially high concern pursuant to REACH Regulation, can be traced back over the product life cycle via a program. Jungheinrich implements the applicable measures for promoting a circular economy for economic activities 3.4. and 3.6. and thus fulfils the DNSH criteria for environmental objective 4.\n\nThe review of DNSH criteria for environmental objective 5 \"Pollution Prevention and Control\" pursuant to Annex C of the Climate Delegated Act is performed at the level of economic activities 3.4. and 3.6. The requirements relate to compliance with European chemical regulations and guidelines. Jungheinrich fulfils the legal requirements and takes into account prohibitions, restrictions, and declaration obligations for regulated hazardous substances through established processes for material compliance [ [page 67](#page-68-0) ]. In the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries, Jungheinrich adheres to the applicable European sustainability rules for bringing batteries onto the market. Group-wide hazardous substance management also applies to hazardous substances that are not prohibited according to the applicable legislation. Jungheinrich documents the use of such substances and follows rules regarding approval for hazardous substances and substitution checks. According to internal assessments, no considerable exposure risk for the user or environment results from the use of the substances mentioned. Overall, Jungheinrich fulfils the requirements to prevent significant harm to the fifth environmental objective for economic activities 3.4. and 3.6.\n\nThe criteria for preventing significant harm to environmental objective 6 \"Protection and Restoration of Biodiversity and Ecosystems\" are laid out in Annex D to the Climate Delegated Act. It remains to be examined whether economic activities 3.4. and 3.6. harbour considerable risk to sensitive biodiverse areas. For this purpose, areas around the plants are identified and potential impacts from the economic activities are defined. The likelihood of a significant impact on biodiversity was then qualitatively assessed, and no material risks were identified. Jungheinrich also performs environmental impact assessments or comparable assessments, if necessary. The analysis shows that Jungheinrich does no significant harm to environmental objective 6 and thus fulfils the corresponding DNSH criteria for economic activities 3.4. and 3.6.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout Jungheinrich\n\nThe taxonomy alignment assessment for the other economic activities, not directly associated with the development and manufacture of taxonomy-eligible products, was done separately.\n\nJungheinrich leased and used company cars in the 2023 financial year (economic activity 6.5.). The company classes this activity as a purchase of a taxonomy-eligible product from a third party. The alignment assessment must therefore be carried out by the third party. The supplier was either not able to provide proof of the taxonomy alignment of this activity or the vehicles are not taxonomy-aligned. This means that economic activity 6.5. is not taxonomy-aligned in the 2023 financial year.\n\nIn the reporting year, Jungheinrich opened a solar park on the Group headquarter's car park with 630 photovoltaic modules (economic activity 7.6.) and 52 e-charging points (economic activity 7.4.). In addition, photovoltaic facilities and e-charging points have been installed at further locations. To achieve taxonomy alignment, the DNSH criteria of environmental objective 2 must be met. A climate risk and vulnerability assessment was performed for the Group headquarters and the other locations which resulted in no high climate risks being discovered for either location [ [page](#page-66-0) 65 ]. Thus, significant harm to environmental objective 2 was prevented and the activities were taxonomy-aligned, taking into account the minimum safeguards analysis in the 2023 financial year.\n\nJungheinrich leases and operates buildings (economic activity 7.7.). The majority of the buildings do not fulfil overall energy efficiency requirements or there is insufficient evidence to check the technical screening criteria. One building occupied by the Swedish sales unit does fulfil the criteria for a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. In order to prevent significant harm to environmental objective 2, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment was performed. No high climate risks were discovered for the location. The building is thus taxonomyaligned, taking into account the minimum safeguards analysis in 2023.\n\nJungheinrich rents space in a computing centre for data processing purposes (economic activity 8.1.). There is currently no evidence that the landlord implements the processes required by the Climate Delegated Act. Accordingly, the technical screening criteria cannot be considered fulfilled, and economic activity 8.1 is reported as not taxonomy-aligned in the 2023 financial year.\n\nOther economic activities were not checked for taxonomy alignment, due to the cost-benefit aspects.\n\n#### Key performance indicators pursuant to EU Taxonomy Regulation\n\nThe key performance indicators (KPI) for the 2023 financial year include turnover, CapEx and OpEx. The definition of the KPI is in line with Annex 1 of the Delegated Act to the Reporting Obligations pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. The share of turnover generated from products or services associated with environmentally sustainable (taxonomy-aligned) economic activities must be provided for the economic activities of the Climate Delegated Act's objectives. The share of CapEx and OpEx in connection with assets or processes that are linked to environmentally sustainable economic activities must also be reported. The share of turnover, CapEx and OpEx that is taxonomy-eligible is reported among the economic activities of the Environmental Delegated Act's objectives. This is a new requirement in comparison with the previous reporting period and Jungheinrich is reporting it for the first time. The individual turnover, CapEx and OpEx sums are each assigned to a specific environmental objective in order to exclude duplication. Furthermore, double counting of turnover, CapEx and OpEx is prevented between the defined economic activities by applying appropriate demarcation logic when the data is recorded at the level of the units.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Key performance indicators for the 2023 financial year\n\nThe share of taxonomy-aligned turnover amounted to 9 per cent. Jungheinrich is reporting taxonomy-aligned turnover for the first time because the technical screening criteria and the minimum safeguards for products in economic activities 3.4. and 3.6. of environmental objective 1 were adhered to in the reporting year. At €483,713 thousand, the majority of the taxonomy-aligned turnover came from electric trucks with lithium-ion batteries (economic activity 3.6.) in the new business of the \"Intralogistics\" segment. Determining whether turnover from these activities is taxonomy-aligned was for a small number of companies based on incoming orders for trucks with lithium-ion batteries. The share of taxonomy-eligible turnover was 72 per cent (2022: 47 per cent). The increase is due to the application of the environmental objective \"Transition to a Circular Economy\". Due to Jungheinrich's business model, the repair and refurbishment of products (economic activity 5.1.), the sale of used products (economic activity 5.4.) and the rental and lease business (economic activity 5.5.) are relevant. The denominator of the turnover KPI is based on consolidated net turnover pursuant to IAS 1.82(a). Further details can be found in the consolidated statement of profit or loss [ [pages](#page-100-0) 99, [104](#page-105-0) and [122](#page-123-0) ].\n\nThe share of taxonomy-aligned CapEx amounted to 2 per cent. The first-time reporting of taxonomy-aligned CapEx is due to capital expenditure related to taxonomy-aligned economic activities of the \"Climate Change Mitigation\" objective. Of the €3,687 thousand of taxonomy-aligned CapEx in connection with the manufacture and development of trucks with lithium-ion batteries (economic activity 3.6.), €1,680 thousand is attributable to property, plant and equipment and €1,960 thousand to capitalised development costs. The remainder is attributable to licences. €5,645 thousand of CapEx was related to the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries (economic activity 3.4.). €757 thousand was attributable to property, plant and equipment and €4,888 thousand to capitalised development costs. The calculation of taxonomy-aligned CapEx for economic activity 3.6. was based on the proportion of the manufacture of material handling equipment with lithium-ion batteries at one plant. For the economic activities 7.4., 7.6. and 7.7. the taxonomy-aligned CapEx of €723 thousand, €1,689 thousand and €270 thousand were each attributable to additions to property, plant and equipment. The share of taxonomyeligible CapEx amounted to 22 per cent (2022: 13 per cent). The increase can be partially explained by improvements in the data collected for acquired buildings (economic activity 7.7.). The CapEx KPI denominator represents the sum of the additions to intangible assets [ [page](#page-129-0) 128 ] and property, plant and equipment [ [page](#page-133-0) 132 ] as presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe share of taxonomy-aligned OpEx amounted to 3 per cent. The taxonomy-aligned OpEx, reported for the first time, in the amount of €5,916 thousand, included €1,720 thousand related to research and development costs for taxonomy-aligned products in the economic activities 3.4. and 3.6., and €4,196 thousand to maintenance costs for their manufacture. The calculation of taxonomy-aligned OpEx for economic activity 3.6. was based on the proportion of the manufacture of material handling equipment with lithium-ion batteries at one plant. The share of taxonomy-eligible OpEx amounts to 66 per cent (2022: 49 per cent). This increase is due to the \"Transition to a Circular Economy\" environmental objective being taken into account and the detailed recording of data related to the maintenance of buildings (economic activity 7.7.). The OpEx KPI denominator consists of direct, non-capitalised expenses related to research and development as presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements pursuant to IAS 38.126 [ [page](#page-131-0) 130 ] as well as expenses for short-term leases pursuant to IFRS 16 as presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements [ [page](#page-135-0) 134 ].

PRACTITIONER'S REPORT ON A LIMITED ASSURANCE ENGAGEMENT ON NON-FINANCIAL REPORTING 1\n\nTo Jungheinrich Aktiengesellschaft, Hamburg\n\nWe have performed a limited assurance engagement on the combined separate non-financial report of Jungheinrich Aktiengesellschaft, Hamburg, (hereinafter the \"Company\") for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2023 (hereinafter the \"Combined Separate Non-financial Report\").\n\nNot subject to our assurance engagement are the external sources of documentation or expert opinions mentioned in the Combined Separate Non-financial Report.\n\n#### Responsibility of the Executive Directors\n\nThe executive directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the Combined Separate Non-financial Report in accordance with §§ (Articles) 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB (\"Handelsgesetzbuch\": \"German Commercial Code\") and Article 8 of REGULATION (EU) 2020/852 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 18. June 2020 on establishing a framework to facilitate sustainable investment and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereinafter the \"EU Taxonomy Regulation\") and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder, as well as for\n\nmaking their own interpretation of the wording and terms contained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder, as set out in section EU Taxonomy Regulation of the Combined Separate Non-financial Report.\n\nThis responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate non-financial reporting methods and making assumptions and estimates about individual non-financial disclosures of the Group that are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for such internal controls as the executive directors consider necessary to enable the preparation of a Combined Separate Non-financial Report that is free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published in every case. Therefore, the executive directors have disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder in section EU Taxonomy Regulation of the Combined Separate Non-financial Report. They are responsible for the defensibility of this interpretation. Due to the immanent risk that indeterminate legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties.\n\n#### Audit Firm's Independence and Quality Management\n\nWe have complied with the German professional provisions regarding independence as well as other ethical requirements.\n\nOur audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional standards – in particular the Professional Code for German Public Auditors and German Chartered Auditors (\"Berufssatzung für Wirtschaftsprüfer und vereidigte Buchprüfer\": \"BS WP/vBP\") as well as the Standard on Quality Management 1 published by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany; IDW): Requirements to quality management for audit firms (IDW Qualitätsmanagementstandard 1: Anforderungen an das Qualitätsmanagement in der Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis – IDW QMS 1 (09.2022)), which requires the audit firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management that complies with the applicable legal requirements and professional standards.\n\n#### Responsibility of the Assurance Practitioner\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on the Combined Separate Non-financial Report based on our assurance engagement.\n\nWe conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan and\n\n<sup>1</sup> PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH has performed a limited assurance engagement on the German version of the combined separate non-financial report and issued an independent practitioner's report in German language, which is authoritative. The following text is a translation of the independent practitioner's report.\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\nIndependent auditor's report\n\nperform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the Company's Combined Separate Non-financial Report, other than the external sources of documentation or expert opinions mentioned in the Combined Separate Non-financial Report, are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder as well as the interpretation by the executive directors disclosed in section EU Taxonomy Regulation of the Combined Separate Non-financial Report.\n\nIn a limited assurance engagement the procedures performed are less extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and accordingly a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgement of the assurance practitioner.\n\nIn the course of our assurance engagement, we have, amongst other things, performed the following assurance procedures and other activities:\n\n- Gain an understanding of the structure of the Group's sustainability organisation and stakeholder engagement\n- Inquiries of the executive directors and relevant employees involved in the preparation of the Combined Separate Non-financial Report about the preparation process, about the internal control system relating to this process and about disclosures in the Combined Separate Non-financial Report\n- Identification of likely risks of material misstatement in the Combined Separate Non-financial Report\n- Analytical procedures on selected disclosures in the Combined Separate Non-financial Report\n- Reconciliation of selected disclosures with the corresponding data in the consolidated financial statements and group management report\n- Evaluation of the presentation of the Combined Separate Non-financial Report\n- Evaluation of the process to identify taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic activities and the corresponding disclosures in the Combined Separate Nonfinancial Report\n- Inquiries on the relevance of climate-risks\n- Assessment of CO2 compensation certificates solely in terms of their existence, but not in terms of their effect\n\nIn determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive directors are required to interpret undefined legal terms. Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties.\n\n#### Assurance Opinion\n\nBased on the assurance procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Combined Separate Non-financial Report of the Company for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2023 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder as well as the interpretation by the executive directors disclosed in section EU Taxonomy Regulation of the Combined Separate Non-financial Report.\n\nWe do not express an assurance opinion on the external sources of documentation or expert opinions mentioned in the Combined Separate Non-financial Report.\n\n#### Restriction of Use\n\nWe draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was conducted for the Company's purposes and that the report is intended solely to inform the Company about the result of the assurance engagement. Consequently, it may not be suitable for any other purpose than the aforementioned. Accordingly, the report is not intended to be used by third parties for making (financial) decisions based on it. Our responsibility is to the Company. We do not accept any responsibility to third parties. Our assurance opinion is not modified in this respect.\n\nCologne, 12 March 2024\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nTheres Schäfer ppa.

The share is listed on the MDAX.\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-3-0\"></span>Key figures at a glance\n\n# Key figures at a glance\n\n| Jungheinrich Group                               |           | 2023    | 2022    | Change in % |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|\n| Incoming orders                                  | units     | 121,800 | 128,800 | –5.4        |\n|                                                  | € million | 5,238   | 4,791   | 9.3         |\n| Orders on hand 31/12                             | € million | 1,441   | 1,595   | –9.7        |\n| Revenue                                          | € million | 5,546   | 4,763   | 16.4        |\n| thereof Germany                                  | € million | 1,205   | 1,106   | 9.0         |\n| thereof abroad                                   | € million | 4,341   | 3,657   | 18.7        |\n| Foreign ratio                                    | %         | 78      | 77      | –           |\n| Earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) | € million | 430     | 386     | 11.4        |\n| EBIT return on sales (EBIT ROS)                  | %         | 7.8     | 8.1     | –           |\n| ROCE1                                            | %         | 15.9    | 16.3    | –           |\n| Earnings before taxes (EBT)                      | € million | 399     | 347     | 15.0        |\n| EBT return on sales (EBT ROS)                    | %         | 7.2     | 7.3     | –           |\n| Profit or loss                                   | € million | 299     | 270     | 10.7        |\n| Free cash flow                                   | € million | 15      | –239    | >100        |\n| Capital expenditure2                             | € million | 90      | 73      | 23.3        |\n| Research and development expenditure             | € million | 152     | 128     | 18.8        |\n| Balance sheet total 31/12                        | € million | 6,910   | 6,164   | 12.1        |\n| Shareholders' equity 31/12                       | € million | 2,222   | 2,051   | 8.3         |\n| thereof subscribed capital                       | € million | 102     | 102     | –           |\n| Employees 31/12                                  | FTE3      | 21,117  | 19,807  | 6.6         |\n| thereof Germany                                  | FTE3      | 8,688   | 8,251   | 5.3         |\n| thereof abroad                                   | FTE3      | 12,429  | 11,556  | 7.6         |\n| Earnings per preferred share4                    | €         | 2.94    | 2.65    | 10.9        |\n| Dividend per share – ordinary share              | €         | 0.735   | 0.66    | 10.6        |\n| – preferred share                                | €         | 0.755   | 0.68    | 10.3        |\n\n<sup>1</sup> EBIT of the \"Intralogistics\" segment as a percentage of average capital employed of the \"Intralogistics\" segment.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets without capitalised development expenditure and right-of-use assets.\n\n<sup>3</sup> FTE = full-time equivalents.\n\n<sup>4</sup> Based on share of earnings attributable to the shareholders of Jungheinrich AG.\n\n<sup>5</sup> Proposal.\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-4-0\"></span>2023 quarterly overview\n\n# 2023 quarterly overview\n\nImage /page/4/Figure/12 description: The image shows four bar charts comparing financial data across four quarters.

In 1953, 70 years ago now, Dr Friedrich Jungheinrich established the company. The values of the company's founder are just as important today: reliability, integrity and solidarity as\n\nfocussing particularly on growing outside of Europe, becoming a driver of technical innovation and working more\n\nIn the past financial year, the foundations were laid for\n\nWith the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group in the United States , which was the largest acquisition in Jungheinrich's history, we expanded our global presence and strengthened our position in North America, one of the most important growth markets for warehouse equipment and automation.\n\nadvancing the transformation of Jungheinrich.\n\n<span id=\"page-7-0\"></span>Foreword from the Chairman\n\nCombined management\n\nNon-financial report\n\nwell as long-term thinking and action. Traditional values that we follow out of conviction and that we intend to follow in Transformation because we have to adapt and evolve quicker than ever before in a world of fast-paced technological changes, rising competitive pressure, geopolitical upheavals and a challenging economic environment. This includes and robotics solutions, which are unique in the field of production supply in particular. Production started at our new reach truck plant in Chomutov, Czechia, in 2023. This new location, with its modern production capacities, is an important factor in increasing Jungheinrich's efficiency. The same applies to our digital transformation program DEEP, which reached further im -\n\nportant milestones in the past year.\n\nWe also underscored our commitment to achieving our Strategy 2025+ targets in terms of inorganic growth and expanding the share of revenue generated outside of Europe.\n\nWith the complete takeover of the Munich-based robotics specialist Magazino, we also expanded our automation expertise in the past year. Together with the team at Magazino, we are driving forward the development of joint automation\n\nAnother important step was taken in our Moosburg plant last year when Jungheinrich's last IC engine-powered truck left the production lines. That makes us the first company in our industry that has completely left fossil fuels behind. We are fully committed to the decarbonisation of the intralogistics industry. The end of manufacturing combustion engines is the start of a more sustainable future for Jungheinrich, but it is also a nod to our company history that began seven decades ago with the manufacture of electric trucks.\n\nDespite a further deterioration in the macroeconomic conditions, Jungheinrich recorded all-time highs in material key figures in the 2023 financial year. Incoming orders amounted to €5,238 million, revenue came to €5,546 million and EBIT reached €430 million. We anticipate profitable growth again in the 2024 financial year, and we will continue working on the transformation of our Group.\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Management, I would like to thank our more than 21,000 employees around the world for their tireless dedication, which is the foundation of our success. And thank you, our shareholders, for your trust in Jungheinrich. I would like to thank the Supervisory Board, chaired by Rolf Najork, for its close and constructive partnership. Once again, my special thanks go to our shareholder families Lang and Wolf for their ongoing trust. Jungheinrich's 70-year history is also your story – a success story that we will keep going into the future.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nLaQBe\n\nDr Lars Brzoska Chairman of the Board of Management\n\nJungheinrich AG // Annual Report 2023 Page 6  //  189\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-8-0\"></span>Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/8 description: A man with short gray hair and glasses is smiling in front of a yellow and white background. He is wearing a white shirt and a dark blue suit jacket.\n\nRolf Najork Chairman of the Supervisory Board\n\nUnder ongoing difficult economic and geopolitical circumstances, Jungheinrich once again performed well in the year under review. The overall tendencies toward recession, triggered by Russia's continued war against Ukraine, the escalation of the Middle East conflict and other geopolitical risks, posed significant challenges. Jungheinrich was able to counter these with targeted action while also setting out a path for the future.\n\n#### FOCAL POINTS OF SUPERVISORY BOARD ACTIVITY\n\nThe 2023 financial year was dominated by great economic and geopolitical challenges. The general reticence toward investment and the associated decline in demand were also felt by Jungheinrich. The company recognised these obstacles early on and reacted with appropriate measures, closing the 2023 financial year with a good performance once more, despite the difficult situation on the market.\n\nThe Board of Management continued its work to implement Strategy 2025+ in the reporting year, and with it consistently drove forward related projects concerning the company's future strategic alignment, notably with regards to processes, digitalisation, products and the organisation. In this regard, important milestones include the acquisition of the US-based Storage Solutions Group on 15 March 2023 and the total acquisition of the robotics specialist Magazino on 23 August 2023, with which Jungheinrich will boost the field of mobile robots as a future focus of intralogistics and expand its software expertise. The Supervisory Board was included in these projects at an early stage and kept fully informed. Another highlight in the reporting year was the start of production at the new Chomutov plant and the expansion of the joint venture for mobile automation solutions with Mitsubishi Logisnext in North America (Rocrich AGV Solutions). The Supervisory Board was closely involved in efforts to implement and adapt individual points of Strategy 2025+ in the reporting year. At the organisational and personnel level, important decisions were made regarding the position of the company in the future, including the creation of a new Board of Management division for automation, effective 1 April 2024. Succession planning for the Board of Management was also a focal point of the Supervisory Board's work in 2023.\n\nAs in the past, the Supervisory Board accompanied and supported the Board of Management in all projects in an advisory capacity, and exchanged information closely with the Board of Management. In addition to the economic challenges, the focus was also on implementing regulatory requirements, further developing corporate governance and sustainability. For instance, the Supervisory Board again dealt with the [remuneration report,](https://www.jungheinrich.com/en/investor-relations/corporate-governance/remuneration-of-board-of-management-and-supervisory-board-1145400) the latest version of the German Corporate Governance Code and the overarching issue of IT security (cyber security) and sustainability reporting in 2023.\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Supervisory Board meetings were held both as virtual or hybrid meetings and in-person meetings in the 2023 financial year. The technical possibilities and the positive experiences made during the coronavirus pandemic have provided a great amount of flexibility in this regard. The Annual General Meeting in May 2023 was again held as a virtual event without the physical presence of the shareholders, in line with the possibilities provided for under the law. This took place for the first time in line with the new provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act, which replaced the former special regulations enacted during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n#### COOPERATION BETWEEN THE SUPERVISORY BOARD AND THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT\n\nOnce again, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management worked together very closely and in a spirit of trust during the year under review. The Board of Management involved the Supervisory Board early on and extensively in all relevant aspects of its work, as well as the business activities of the company and the Group companies. This enabled the Supervisory Board to discuss the relevant aspects in good time and to satisfy itself at all times of the legality, appropriateness and correctness of the company's management. The Supervisory Board was also kept informed in a timely manner by means of detailed written and oral reports, in particular on the following topics: the market situation and demand, the current and expected economic development in the individual regions of the world, the business development and financial situation in the individual Group companies (in particular by analysing key indicators such as incoming orders, revenue, EBIT and margin), the number of employees, the status of capital expenditure, the current challenges relating to supply chains and material procurement, the reactions to this and the effects of the war in Ukraine on the company, its employees, customers and suppliers. Furthermore, after careful review and deliberation, the Supervisory Board approved numerous transactions requiring its approval and presented by the Board of Management, the most important of which are listed in this report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board and the Finance and Audit Committee also examined the risk management system, the effectiveness of the internal control system, the monitoring of accounting and accounting procedures, the internal audit system, compliance within the company as well as sustainability and non-financial reporting. The Supervisory Board did not identify any irregularities or objections in any of these areas in the 2023 financial year. The Board of Management fully complied with its reporting obligations. This means that the Supervisory Board did not need to exercise its statutory rights to request and inspect. The Finance and Audit Committee recommended that the Supervisory Board again propose that PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH, Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Hamburg, (PwC) be selected as the auditor for the 2023 financial year at the Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2023. The Supervisory Board and Annual General Meeting agreed with this proposal.\n\nThe Chairman of the Supervisory Board (acting simultaneously in his role as Chairman of the Personnel Committee) and the Chairman of the Finance and Audit Committee also reviewed important topics outside of the meetings in regular discussion with the Board of Management, in particular with the Chairman of the Board of Management and the Member of the Board of Management for Finance, and prepared points to be decided on in plenary sessions.\n\n#### MAIN ISSUES ADDRESSED IN SUPERVISORY BOARD MEETINGS\n\nThe Supervisory Board convened on a total of eleven occasions in the 2023 financial year, three of which were extraordinary, and four resolutions were passed by written procedure. Three meetings were held as video conferences, five meetings were held in person, and three meetings were hybrid events, where the majority of members were physically present and individual members were connected via video link. In the majority of meetings, the Supervisory Board discussed individual agenda items alone, i.e. without the presence of the members of the Board of Management. The Board of Management reported on the Group's current state of business in the ordinary meetings. The Supervisory Board's Personnel Committee and the Finance and Audit Committee reported regularly and on an ad hoc basis on current topics regarding the committee's work. Resolutions were passed in numerous meetings on proposals of the Board of Management, of which only the most important are mentioned below.\n\nAt the beginning of the reporting year, the Supervisory Board dealt in detail with the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group in three extraordinary meetings on 6, 10 and 19 January 2023 and provided its final approval for the transaction on 19 January 2023.\n\nIn a meeting on 6 March 2023, the Supervisory Board resolved to apply the discretionary factor with regard to the Board of Management's variable remuneration for the 2022 financial year and the remuneration report in accordance with Section 162 AktG. The Supervisory Board also resolved on its proposals for the Annual General Meeting for the upcoming elections to the Supervisory Board and approved donations for victims of the earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Supervisory Board held an accounts meeting for the 2022 financial year on 30 March 2023. This was to review and approve Jungheinrich AG's annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements together with the combined management report as of 31 December 2022. The Supervisory Board also endorsed the Board of Management's proposal for the appropriation of profits for the 2022 financial year to the Annual General Meeting, and approved the 2022 combined separate non-financial report for Jungheinrich AG and the Group. Moreover, the Supervisory Board passed a resolution on the actual values for calculating the variable remuneration for the members of the Board of Management for the 2022 financial year. Proposals for Board of Management decisions on individual projects, namely in relation to the development of several new models of trucks and a digital development tool changeover, were also approved at the meeting, and the creation of a new Board of Management division for automation was discussed.\n\nAt the beginning of April 2023, the Supervisory Board resolved by written procedure to grant the associate company Magazino GmbH a loan.\n\nIn its inaugural meeting on 11 May 2023, following the Supervisory Board elections at the Annual General Meeting and the employee representative elections, which were paused during the coronavirus pandemic, the Supervisory Board elected Mr Rolf Najork as the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and re-elected Mr Markus Haase as Deputy Chairman. The Supervisory Board also elected the members of the Mediation Committee, the Personnel Committee and the Finance and Audit Committee. In addition, the Supervisory Board resolved to reappoint Dr Volker Hues as a Member of the Board of Management and to create a Board of Management division for automation. Various current and planned projects were discussed.\n\nIn another resolution passed by written procedure, the Supervisory Board approved the inclusion of the AGV business that Mitsubishi Logisnext operates under the name Rocla in the joint venture MCJ Supply Chain Solutions LLC, a capital increase for the joint venture, and the renaming to Rocrich AGV Solutions LLC at the end of May 2023.\n\nIn the meeting on 30 June 2023, the Supervisory Board approved a further proposal made by the Board of Management regarding the development of a truck model and a change to the articles of association to delete a provision that had become obsolete. A variety of topics were also discussed in depth, specifically a number of current and planned projects, details regarding the new Board of Management division for automation and how to handle skills shortages.\n\nAt the end of July 2023, following detailed reporting and discussion, the Supervisory Board agreed through written procedure to the total acquisition of Magazino GmbH, in which the company had previously held a stake of approximately 22 per cent.\n\nAt the strategy meeting of the Supervisory Board on 20 September 2023, the status as regards Strategy 2025+ as well as a variety of focal topics and projects were presented and discussed in detail.\n\nIn an ordinary meeting on 21 September 2023, the Supervisory Board resolved on the pension arrangements for new members of the Board of Management and individual amendments to the adjustment rules for key figures relating to the effects from M&A transactions that are relevant to the variable remuneration of the Board of Management. Mr Udo Panenka was appointed to the Board of Management effective 1 April 2024, and will be responsible for the Automation division. The Supervisory Board also resolved on the conclusion of a termination agreement with Ms Sabine Neuß, with which she will resign from her office on the Board of Management by 30 June 2024. Board of Management proposals regarding individual investments and projects were also approved, including new promissory notes to ensure the Group's financing is not dependent on banks, further projects were touched on and personnel management and recruitment were discussed.\n\nIn another written procedure in November 2023, the Supervisory Board resolved on an early reappointment of Mr Christian Erlach to the Board of Management.\n\nIn a meeting on 19 December 2023 regarding the DEEP (Digital End-to-End Processes) programme, the Supervisory Board was shown, as in previous years, further details of this ongoing long-term programme to realign structures, processes and the IT architecture against the backdrop of the digital transformation, and the current status of the work to implement it.\n\nIn the 20 December 2023 meeting, the Supervisory Board focused on the progress of the remuneration report preparations for the 2023 financial year, including Board of Management succession planning, amendments to individual Strategy 2025+ targets and current and planned projects, among other issues. The Supervisory Board decided to appoint Mr Maik Manthey as new member of the Board of Management from 1 July 2024 who would be responsible for the Technics division. In addition, the Supervisory Board resolved to adjust the remuneration system for members of the Board of Management as of 1 January 2024 and determined the targets for the Board of Management's variable remuneration. Ms Antoinette P. Aris was re-elected as a non-voting member of the Personnel Committee for the\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\n2024 financial year due to her expertise in matters of remuneration. Selected adjustments to the rules of procedure for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board were adopted and the plan for 2024 was approved. In addition, the Supervisory Board approved further proposals by the Board of Management regarding the DEEP programme, a truck development project, setting up an Experience Centre, renovating the main marketing and sales office in the UK, and concluding a control and profit and loss transfer agreement with Magazino GmbH. Finally, the Supervisory Board resolved on the annual declaration pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (\"declaration of compliance\") based on the recommendation of the Finance and Audit Committee.\n\n#### ACTIVITY OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD COMMITTEES\n\nThe Finance and Audit Committee convened on nine occasions in the reporting year, one of which was extraordinary. Five meetings were held in person, three meetings were held as video conferences, and one meeting was a hybrid event, where the majority of members were physically present and one member was connected via video link. Some of the issues the Committee considered were non-financial reporting, capital market communications, how to handle business activities in Russia, and all topics related to the annual and consolidated financial statements of Jungheinrich AG and the audit services (fee and order preparation, focal points of the audit, audit results, additional audit services). The Committee also carefully completed the tasks entrusted to it, including monitoring accounting and accounting processes, the effectiveness of the internal control system, risk management and internal auditing. The Committee also discussed the regular oral and written reports submitted by the Compliance Officer in detail and dealt with various compliance issues. In addition, the Committee dealt with regular reports from the departments responsible on non-financial reporting and sustainability topics. In an extraordinary meeting in December 2023, the planning for the 2024 financial year was also discussed in detail and prepared for the Supervisory Board plenary meeting. The Committee also met regularly without the Board of Management in the year under review.\n\nThe Personnel Committee convened four times in the reporting year. Three meetings were held in person and one meeting was a hybrid event, where the majority of members were physically present and one member was connected via video link. The Committee dealt with all tasks assigned to it on behalf of the entire Supervisory Board – particularly new and reappointments as well as contract and remuneration issues for members of the Board of Management, including the remuneration system and the remuneration report for the 2022 and 2023 financial year. The Personnel Committee also focused its attention on senior executives of interest who were responsible for important tasks in the Group.\n\nThe Mediation Committee, according to Section 27, Paragraph 3 of the German Co-Determination Act, did not convene.\n\n#### OTHER INFORMATION\n\nWith the exception of two meetings of the Supervisory Board, which Mr Mike Retz was unable to attend, one meeting of the Supervisory Board which Ms Kristina Thurau-Vetter was unable to attend, and one meeting of the Supervisory Board which Ms Kathrin Elisabeth Dahnke was unable to attend, all meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees were always attended by all members of the respective committee. In the reporting year, there were no conflicts of interest of Board of Management or Supervisory Board members that would have had to be immediately disclosed to the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board take responsibility for the training and further education measures required for their tasks, such as those pertaining to changes in the legal framework or new technologies, and receive support here from the company, as do new members when they take up their position. The company thus offered a training event in the reporting year, which included internal and external experts, covering non-financial reporting and sustainability topics. All members of the Supervisory Board attended this event. New members of the Supervisory Board were instructed of their tasks, rights and duties as well as the organisational processes and IT infrastructure relevant to the Supervisory Board's work as part of the onboarding process.\n\n#### ANNUAL AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\nThe annual financial statements prepared by the Board of Management, the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2023, and the combined management report of Jungheinrich AG, were audited by PwC. The auditors had no objections regarding the financial statements or the accounting, and confirmed this in their unqualified audit report.\n\nThe results of the audit performed by the auditors were the topic of meetings of the Finance and Audit Committee and of the Supervisory Board. The members of the Supervisory\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\nBoard checked the Board of Management documents for the annual and consolidated financial statements in great detail using PwC's audit reports. As is also regularly the case, the majority of members of the Supervisory Board attended the Finance and Audit Committee meeting for the preparation of the entire Supervisory Board's resolution regarding the 2023 financial statements. All members of the Supervisory Board approved the Board of Management's proposal for the appropriation of profits for the 2023 financial year. According to the audit's results, there are no objections to the internal control system, the risk management system or the compliance management system. There were also no objections to the declaration of compliance pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act.\n\nFollowing its detailed inspection of the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and combined management report, the Supervisory Board had no objections to the financial statements and agreed with the results of the audit performed by the auditors in its accounts meeting on 27 March 2024. The Supervisory Board authorised Jungheinrich AG's annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements for the period ending 31 December 2023. Jungheinrich AG's annual financial statements as of 31 December 2023 are therefore finalised.\n\nIn its meeting on 27 March 2024, the Supervisory Board also seconded the Board of Management's proposal for the appropriation of profits for the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe Finance and Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board also considered the combined separate non-financial report as of 31 December 2023, which was prepared by the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board approved this report, which was audited by PwC.\n\n#### PERSONNEL\n\nThe former Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Mr Hans-Georg Frey, resigned from office with effect from the end of the Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2023. The ordinary Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2023 elected Mr Rolf Najork to the Supervisory Board for a full term.

Nevertheless, the Jungheinrich share had a successful year on the stock market, gaining a significant 25 per cent in value. Moreover, Jungheinrich is planning to pay the highest dividend in the company's history of €0.75.\n\nImage /page/15/Figure/10 description: This bar chart shows the share price performance in 2023 in %. Jungheinrich has a share price performance of 25%. DAX has a share price performance of 20%. MDAX has a share price performance of 8%. SDAX has a share price performance of 17%.\n\n#### EQUITY MARKETS ON THE UP DESPITE CRISES\n\nIn 2023, both national and international stock markets were primarily impacted by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, rising interest rates, fears of recession and, at the end of the year, the escalation of the Middle East conflict. Stock indices rose sharply at the start of the year and were largely able to hold on to the early gains despite uncertainties until the end of the third quarter of 2023. Due to developments in the Middle East, the fourth quarter of 2023 got off to a negative start, but was also the starting point for a year-end rally and new highs for shares and indices. Geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties along with a potential lowering of interest rates in 2024 dominated the mixed picture of global investor sentiment at the end of the year.\n\nThe most important German stock market indices showed clear gains at the end of the year. The DAX ended 2023 with a comparably strong gain of 20 per cent at 16,752 points (previous year: 13,924 points). The MDAX closed the year with an 8 per cent gain, climbing to 27,137 points (previous year: 25,118 points), while the SDAX made a notable gain of 17 per cent and climbed to 13,960 points (previous year: 11,926 points).\n\n#### JUNGHEINRICH SHARE PRICE UP 25 PER CENT\n\nStarting from a closing price of €26.58 on the last trading day of 2022, the Jungheinrich share began the year under review at €27.04. The Board of Management published an ad hoc announcement on 25 January 2023 regarding the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group. Following the announcement, the share reached an annual high of €36.76 on 2 February 2023. In light of the positive business developments in the first quarter of 2023, the forecast ranges were raised on 24 April 2023 and the proportionate effects of the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group, which was completed on 15 March 2023, were outlined in more detail. This boosted the Jungheinrich share price, following a weak start to the second quarter, pushing it to significantly exceed the share price development of comparable indices in the first six months of the year at €33.54 on 30 June 2023.\n\nUncertainties around the world dominated events in the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2023. The Jungheinrich share was not able to evade this negative market environment and hit an annual low of €24.84 on 30 October 2023. In light of the prospect of easing on the interest markets, losses were soon recuperated. Seen over the course of the year, shares ended trading for 2023 at €33.22, thus recording a clear 25 per cent gain over the previous year. Market capitalisation increased accordingly by €677 million during the year and stood at €3,388 million at the end of 2023 (previous year: €2,711 million).\n\nWith market capitalisation of €1,531 million (previous year: €1,318 million), which is relevant for index calculation, the Jungheinrich preferred share ranked 79th in the Deutsche Börse ranking list (previous year: 88th) at the end of December 2023. According to Deutsche Börse's definition of free float, this includes all stock-market-listed shares of Jungheinrich AG. Of the total number of Jungheinrich AG shares (102 million), only the 48 million no-par-value preferred shares are listed and widely distributed. The 54 million ordinary shares are not listed, and they are held equally by the families of each of company founder Dr Friedrich Jungheinrich's two daughters.\n\nThe [shareholdings in Jungheinrich AG reportable](https://www.jungheinrich.com/en/investor-relations/notifications-168886) pursuant to Sections 33 et seq. of the German Securities Trading Act (WpHG) have been published in accordance with Section 40 of the German Securities Trading Act (WpHG) in the notes to the annual financial statements of Jungheinrich AG and on the company's website.\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/16/Figure/8 description: This line graph compares the share price performance of Jungheinrich, DAX, MDAX, and SDAX from 2019 to 2023, measured in percentage. The y-axis ranges from 40 to 220. The x-axis represents the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.\n\nImage /page/16/Figure/9 description: The image is a line graph titled \"Share price performance 2023 in %.\" The y-axis ranges from 90 to 150. The x-axis is divided into four quarters: Q1 2023, Q2 2023, Q3 2023, and Q4 2023. There are four lines on the graph, representing Jungheinrich, DAX, MDAX, and SDAX. Jungheinrich starts at approximately 120 in Q1, rises to 140, fluctuates between 120 and 130 in Q2 and Q3, drops to 95 in Q4, and ends at 125. DAX starts at 105 in Q1, rises to 115, fluctuates between 110 and 120 in Q2 and Q3, drops to 95 in Q4, and ends at 115. MDAX starts at 110 in Q1, rises to 115, fluctuates between 110 and 115 in Q2 and Q3, drops to 95 in Q4, and ends at 110. SDAX starts at 105 in Q1, rises to 110, fluctuates between 105 and 115 in Q2 and Q3, drops to 95 in Q4, and ends at 120.\n\n#### SHARE PRICE DEVELOPMENT OVER TIME TRADING VOLUME BELOW PREVIOUS YEAR'S LEVEL\n\nThe Jungheinrich share is listed in the Prime Standard quality segment of the Deutsche Börse. It is traded on all German stock exchanges. The trading volume (Xetra and Frankfurt) amounted to 22.6 million shares in 2023, about 40 per cent down from the trading volume in the previous year (39.3 million shares). The average number of shares traded per trading day (Xetra and Frankfurt) also decreased about 40 per cent to 89.5 thousand shares compared to the previous year (152.8 thousand shares). The average daily trading volume amounted to €2.8 million (previous year: €4.0 million).\n\n#### DIVIDEND RISES TO HISTORIC HIGH\n\nJungheinrich's dividend policy is fundamentally geared towards continuous dividend payments. The aim is to distribute between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of the profit after tax attributable to the shareholders of Jungheinrich AG.\n\nThe Board of Management and Supervisory Board of Jungheinrich AG will propose to the Annual General Meeting on 15 May 2024 that a dividend of €0.75 (previous year: €0.68) per no-par preferred share and €0.73 (previous year: €0.66) per no-par ordinary share be distributed. Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, this will result in a total payment of €75 million (previous year: €68 million).\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\nNon-financial report\n\nThe dividend payment will be made on the third working day after the Annual General Meeting. The payment ratio, which is calculated as the percentage of the total dividend in relation to the profit attributable to the shareholders of Jungheinrich AG, thus reaches 25 per cent as in the previous year.\n\n#### REASONS TO INVEST IN JUNGHEINRICH SHARES\n\nFor more than 70 years, Jungheinrich has been a leading provider of sustainable intralogistics products and solutions. Reasons to invest in Jungheinrich shares:\n\n- Attractive market: international size, sustainable growth opportunities, new operating segments\n- Corporate structure and strategic orientation: family business with a corporate structure and strategy focussed on the long-term\n- Complete solutions provider: everything from a single source – from hand pallet truck to fully automated warehouse\n- Earnings and financial strength: top rates of return, cash flow and balance sheet figures in comparison with industry and competitors\n- Resilient: intact market drivers, resilient customer structure, robust business model\n- 100 per cent electric: the leader in lithium-ion technology\n- Sustainability: among the top 1 per cent of sustainable companies in the world 1\n\n#### PROFITABILITY OVER FIVE AND TEN YEARS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN DAX, MDAX AND SDAX\n\nThe Jungheinrich share proves to be an attractive capital investment over the long term and consistently recorded a significantly better performance over both a ten- and fiveyear period than the DAX, MDAX and SDAX. A contrasting picture emerges over a three-year period, the Jungheinrich share merely shows a better performance than the MDAX.\n\nLong-term performance of the Jungheinrich share\n\n| Investment period              | 10 years   | 5 years    | 3 years    |\n|--------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Investment date                | 01/01/2014 | 01/01/2019 | 01/01/2021 |\n| Portfolio value at end of 2023 | €24,956    | €16,285    | €9,157     |\n| Average return p. a.           | 9.6%       | 10.3%      | -2.8%      |\n\n| Comparable return of<br>German share indices p. a. |      |      |       |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------|------|-------|\n| DAX                                                | 6.0% | 9.6% | 6.9%  |\n| MDAX                                               | 5.1% | 4.6% | -4.3% |\n| SDAX                                               | 7.4% | 7.8% | -2.0% |\n\nPlease note: based on an initial investment of €10 thousand; assuming that annual dividends received were reinvested in additional preferred shares.\n\n#### RISING INTEREST AMONG ANALYSTS: COVERAGE EXPANDED\n\nEquity research is important for making investors aware of share issuances, as it serves as a vital foundation when deciding to invest. With Barclays and Jefferies taking up coverage in September 2023 and October 2023 respectively, the number of banks and equity research houses regularly analysing the Jungheinrich share has risen to 17 (previous year: 15). At the end of the year under review, eleven analysts recommended buying the share, five recommended holding and one recommended to sell. Based on the key analysts' valuations, the average target share price was €35.85. The lowest value was €23.50, and the highest was €49.00.\n\nImage /page/17/Figure/26 description: The image shows the text \"Analysts' recommendations\" and \"As of: 31/12/2023\".\n\nImage /page/17/Figure/27 description: The image is a donut chart with three categories: Sell, Hold, and Buy.

Key topics of capital market communication in 2023 were the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group, the business development in light of the global geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties as well as the implementation progress of the Strategy 2025+.\n\nThe company informed the capital markets about particularly significant developments through ad hoc announcements as follows:\n\n- Announcement on 25 January 2023: \"Jungheinrich AG to acquire Storage Solutions Group\"\n- Announcement on 24 April 2023: \"Jungheinrich raises forecast for 2023 and publishes preliminary figures as of 31 March 2023\"\n\nAs in the past, communication with capital market participants took place both virtually and in the form of in-person events and meetings. For instance, the analyst conference for the 2022 financial year was again held as a video conference on 31 March 2023. The Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2023 was once again a virtual meeting, however, for the first time it was possible to pose questions during the event. While investor conferences exclusively took place in person, the roadshows were both physical and virtual events. This allowed for greater flexibility in terms of regional coverage of investor contacts. With regard to the publication of its quarterly and half-year figures, Jungheinrich reported as usual in detail on the current business development of the Group in conference calls.\n\nDuring the conference call on the business development as of 30 September 2023 on 10 November 2023, the Board of Management also presented its Strategy 2025+ status report. The focus was on the field of automation, which was dominated in the financial year by the acquisition and postmerger integration of the Storage Solutions Group and the expansion of the product and solutions portfolio through the acquisition of all shares in Magazino. Approximately 300 investors had contact with the company during the year. Further information on Strategy 2025+ can be found in the combined management report [\\[ page 23 \\]](#page-24-0).\n\n#### Basic information about the Jungheinrich share\n\n| Securities identification numbers | ISIN: DE0006219934 / WKN: 621993                                                 |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Ticker symbol Reuters/Bloomberg   | JUNG_p.de / JUN3 GR                                                              |\n| Stock exchanges                   | Hamburg and Frankfurt stock<br>exchanges and all other German<br>stock exchanges |\n| Designated Sponsor                | ODDO BHF Corporates & Markets AG                                                 |\n| IPO                               | 30 August 1990                                                                   |\n\nComprehensive information regarding the [Jungheinrich](https://www.jungheinrich.com/en/investor-relations/about-our-share) [share](https://www.jungheinrich.com/en/investor-relations/about-our-share) is published on the Jungheinrich AG website.

principles\n\n#### BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE\n\n#### Integrated business model\n\nJungheinrich is one of the world's leading solutions providers for the intralogistics sector. With a comprehensive portfolio of material handling equipment, automation and services, Jungheinrich is able to offer customers solutions to the challenges posed by Industry 4.0.\n\nThe integrated business model encompasses the development, production and sale of new material handling equipment and the planning and realisation of automation projects, the short-term rental of new and used material handling equipment, the refurbishment and sale of used trucks as well as after-sales services. Jungheinrich also supplies stacker cranes and load handling equipment. In addition, customers receive their entire factory and office equipment from a single source. In addition to electric engines and drive controls, Jungheinrich also manufactures matching lithium-ion batteries and battery chargers. All trucks produced are battery-powered and almost all are available with a lithium-ion battery. Digital products based on the latest generation of the Jungheinrich Internet of Things platform in the cloud, complement the portfolio. Customers also have access to a comprehensive range of financial services. Jungheinrich aims to create sustainable value.\n\n#### Business model of Jungheinrich Business model of Jungheinrich\n\nImage /page/20/Figure/13 description: The image is a diagram of a gear with the word \"CUSTOMER\" in the center. The gear is divided into three sections: \"Products & solutions\", \"Services\", and \"Partners of Jungheinrich\". The \"Products & solutions\" section includes \"New trucks\", \"Short-term rental\", \"Used equipment\", \"Warehouse equipment\", \"Automation\", \"Energy solutions\", \"Digital solutions\", and \"Operating & office equipment\". The \"Services\" section includes \"Consulting\", \"Financial services\", and \"After-sales services\". The \"Partners of Jungheinrich\" section includes \"Direct Sales\" and \"E-Commerce\".\n\n#### Production and refurbishment\n\nThe Group has twelve plants, seven of them primarily for the production of material handling equipment, three for stacker cranes and two for the industrial refurbishment of used trucks. In addition, Jungheinrich covers almost all demand for electric motors in a joint venture with another manufacturer of material handling equipment in Moravany (Czechia) and Putian (China).\n\nJungheinrich manufactures stacker trucks, reach trucks and horizontal order pickers in Norderstedt. In addition to truck production, the plant also manufactures electronic control units, lithium-ion batteries and battery chargers. The Lüneburg plant produces light-duty vertical order pickers, tow tractors and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in addition to small-series and customised trucks. The Moosburg plant manufactures counterbalanced trucks, while the neighbouring factory in Degernpoint manufactures narrow-aisle trucks, heavy-duty vertical order pickers and AGVs. The production focus at the Landsberg/Saale plant is on low-lift trucks and double-decker trucks. Since June 2023, the new plant in Chomutov (Czechia) has also been manufacturing reach trucks. The Qingpu plant in China produces low-lift and stacker trucks, battery-powered counterbalance trucks and reach trucks, as well as control units and batteries. The MIAS Group manufactures stacker cranes and load handling equipment at its locations in Munich, Gyöngös (Hungary) and Kunshan (China).\n\nUsed equipment is industrially refurbished in a plant close to Dresden and in a plant in Ploiești (Romania).\n\nThe development of digital products is concentrated at the locations in Graz (Austria), Hamburg and Madrid (Spain). The software and hardware development services are based in Zagreb (Croatia).\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Changes to the portfolio\n\nOn 25 January 2023, Jungheinrich announced its acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group (Storage Solutions), Westfield/ Indiana (USA), a leading provider of solutions for racking systems and warehouse automation in the US. Jungheinrich has thus expanded its access to the US market for warehouse equipment and automation. With the completion of the acquisition on 15 March 2023, 100 per cent of the shares in the Storage Solutions Group were consolidated for the first time. The Storage Solution Group comprises seven companies based in the USA. Storage Solutions' proportional contribution to revenue in the 2023 financial year was €219 million.\n\nIn another important step towards strengthening its automation expertise, Jungheinrich acquired the remaining shares in the robotics specialist Magazino GmbH, Munich (Magazino), effective 23 August 2023. The company was fully consolidated from that date.\n\n#### International sales with a focus on the direct sales and service network\n\nJungheinrich has established a global direct sales and service network with locations in 42 countries to offer the bestpossible customer service. The Jungheinrich Group is also represented in approximately 80 other countries through partner companies. The Group's core market is Europe, where 80 per cent of Group revenue is generated. Of the European revenue, 27 per cent is generated in Germany.\n\nWith the acquisition of Storage Solutions in the reporting year, Jungheinrich is now also covering the US market for warehouse equipment and automation.\n\nIn North America, Jungheinrich also cooperates with Mitsubishi Logisnext Americas Inc. (MLA), a sales partner with a comprehensive dealership footprint, in the truck business. Firstly, equipment manufactured by Jungheinrich in Germany is marketed via MLA's sales organisation in North America. Secondly, MLA produces trucks in its plants that are developed by Jungheinrich locally in Houston. Jungheinrich has also been working on the joint venture Rocrich AGV Solutions LLC (Rocrich) (formerly MCJ Supply Chain Solutions LLC) with MLA since September 2023. Rocrich offers mobile automation and robotics solutions for warehouses and production plants.\n\nIn China, Jungheinrich serves the metropolitan regions of Shanghai, Changzhou, Guangzhou and Tianjin through a joint venture with Anhui Heli Co. Ltd., leasing material handling equipment via four subsidiaries.\n\nTo cover the constantly growing after-sales services business, Jungheinrich operates a central spare parts centre in Kaltenkirchen. With this warehouse, and others in Lahr, Bratislava (Slovakia), Shanghai (China), Birmingham (UK) and Singapore (Singapore), Jungheinrich can guarantee the global supply of spare parts for its after-sales services. Through the joint venture TREX.PARTS GmbH & Co. KG, Jungheinrich is tapping into additional market potential in the spare parts market.\n\n#### Organisation and Group management\n\nJungheinrich AG is the listed management holding company of the Group. It controls company activities and is responsible for overarching functions such as strategy, financing, M&A, accounting, controlling, human resources management, sustainability, corporate communications, information technology, legal, tax, internal audit and compliance. The operating business is divided into the two reportable segments under IFRS: \"Intralogistics\" and \"Financial Services\". The Intralogistics segment comprises the business fields of new business, short-term rental and used equipment, as well as after-sales. New business consists of new manual material handling equipment, automated material handling equipment and facilities (including stacker cranes and load handling equipment), warehouse equipment, factory and office equipment, energy solutions and digital products. There is no further subdivision of the \"Financial Services\" reporting segment into business fields.\n\nAs part of a near-shoring concept, Jungheinrich has several Business Service Centers that pool internal services.\n\nThe Board of Management is responsible for the Group's strategic management and operational leadership. This involves determining and monitoring company targets, taking responsibility for leadership, management and controlling processes – including the internal compliance management system and the internal control and risk management systems – and resource allocation. The key figures and reports regularly presented to the entire Board of Management are based on Group-wide, economic performance parameters.\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe supervisory and advisory body for the Board of Management is the Supervisory Board, which consists of twelve people, pursuant to the requirements of the German Co-Determination Act. There are an equal number of shareholder representatives and employee representatives on the Supervisory Board.\n\nAs the parent company, Jungheinrich AG holds shares directly and indirectly in both domestic and foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The managing directors of the subsidiaries are responsible for operations and economic performance in the local markets. The companies receive support from the management of the holding company, but are independent from a legal perspective. The consolidated financial statements cover 102 fully consolidated companies – including Jungheinrich AG. The complete shareholdings in Jungheinrich AG can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements [ [page](#page-175-0) 174 ].\n\n#### Important key performance indicators\n\nThe Jungheinrich Group uses selected key figures to determine budget targets as well as medium- and long-term company targets. The Board of Management considers key financial indicators predominantly in order to manage the Group. The return on capital employed (ROCE) and the free cash flow are used for management purposes, in addition to incoming orders and revenue, earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) or EBIT return on sales (EBIT ROS) and earnings before taxes (EBT) or EBT return on sales (EBT ROS). Another performance parameter is the ratio of trucks equipped with lithium-ion batteries.\n\nThe financial key figure ROCE represents the rate of return based on the EBIT generated in the Intralogistics segment in relation to the capital employed that can be attributed to this segment. This means returns can be determined regardless of whether a customer has financing from the Jungheinrich Group's Financial Services segment. Capital employed is calculated from fixed assets (without trucks for short-term rental and trucks for lease) plus trucks for short-term rental and working capital less other provisions. Working capital includes inventories as well as trade accounts receivable and contract assets less trade accounts payable and contract liabilities. The average of capital employed is calculated by including the figures as at the balance sheet date of the current quarter and the three quarters before this balance sheet date in order to prevent fluctuations in the capital employed on the balance sheet date. For interim reporting, the EBIT of the period is annualised and viewed in relation to the average capital employed. ROCE is not reported for the \"Financial Services\" segment as the EBIT return on capital employed (ROCE) is not a control parameter for this segment.\n\nThe free cash flow is defined as the sum of cash flows from operating activities and investing activities. Cash flow from investing activities is adjusted for payments for acquisitions and proceeds from the sale of securities as well as payments for and proceeds from time deposits. As a rule, securities and time deposits are assigned to Group liquidity (cash and cash equivalents and securities reported in the balance sheet). Changes in these items are therefore not part of the Jungheinrich Group's free cash flow.\n\nIn addition to this, the equipment ratio of trucks with lithium-ion batteries as part of both the short-term and longterm variable remuneration of the Board of Management is a material non-financial control parameter for the Jungheinrich Group. It symbolises the company's commitment to sustainability and is an integral part of the corporate strategy. It is also one of the central targets of Strategy 2025+. The equipment ratio of lithium-ion batteries is calculated from the ratio of incoming orders for lithium-ion battery-powered trucks (units; excluding purchased electric trucks with built-in batteries) to incoming orders for battery-powered trucks, regardless of type of battery (units; excluding purchased electric trucks with built-in battery).\n\nThe Board of Management follows developments in the figures indicated above as part of the regular reporting process. Where necessary, appropriate measures are launched and significant deviations analysed based on constant monitoring of target and actual figures.\n\nChanges in various early indicators are monitored and evaluated in order to recognise possible future developments within the company in good time and to maintain a basis on which to base business policy decisions. These are primarily prognoses from economic experts on developments in gross domestic product in Jungheinrich's core markets, indices for evaluating the economic situation in the sector, and continual monitoring of incoming orders and orders on hand.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Geopolitical tensions continue to demand foresight in supply chain management\n\nGlobal supply chains continued to stabilise over the course of 2023. The situation on the energy markets also eased, although further energy policy developments still need to be observed closely. However, the availability of electronic components remained unreliable. All of the measures introduced in recent years to ensure material and energy supply are still being applied. Supplier risk management consists of the regular monitoring of inventories, supply reach, and transport times in combination with close supplier controlling. In addition, swift action was taken to changes in demand in the reporting year thanks to adjusted and flexible inventory and demand planning management in close coordination with suppliers. The ongoing establishment of alternative procurement sources to reduce dependence and the expansion of the European supplier base were vital elements in securing stable supply. Both of these measures contributed to boosting Jungheinrich's negotiating position and attain competitive prices.\n\nAn increasingly critical factor on the procurement side was the availability of skilled personnel, leading suppliers to report early on about capacity issues resulting from personnel shortages. The cooperation with suppliers, built up over many years, proved its worth here in terms of the demand and production planning as well as targeted process management. Thus far it has been possible to avoid disruptions in the supply chains.\n\nAlthough the energy supply situation in Europe continues to improve, geopolitical tensions can still have a considerable impact on energy supplies. The longer-term goal is to reduce dependence on gas supply and to substitute gas as an energy source. In this context, Jungheinrich relies on the use of alternative fossil and renewable energy sources for both process heat and heating, in addition to focused savings in consumption, in order to aid the decoupling from the gas supply.\n\nThe task of establishing and optimising sustainable procurement in internal processes and with suppliers was continued in 2023. For instance, the requirements of the Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains (LkSG) were integrated in Jungheinrich's procurement processes and the supplier qualification process. In addition, the existing management system for sustainable procurement was extended to include preventative and remedial measures and the organisational prerequisites were put in place to fulfil not only the LkSG requirements but also the strategic sustainability targets.\n\nIn light of the slight decline in production unit numbers and simultaneous reduction in safety stock levels, the purchasing volumes for production materials decreased. Mainly as a result of inflation, the purchasing volume for indirect materials and services on the other hand increased noticeably. This led to an increase in the purchasing volume overall to €3,215 million in the 2023 financial year following €3,118 million in the previous year.\n\nThe purchasing volume can generally be divided into:\n\n- Production materials, including post-production materials\n- Indirect materials and services\n- Merchandise\n\nImage /page/23/Figure/17 description: The image is a pie chart titled \"Breakdown of purchasing volume in 2023\". The pie chart is divided into three sections: 27% Merchandise, 33% Indirect materials and services, and 40% Production materials.\n\n| in € million                    | 2023  | 2022  | Change % |\n|---------------------------------|-------|-------|----------|\n| Production materials            | 1,300 | 1,387 | -6.3     |\n| Indirect materials and services | 1,043 | 903   | 15.5     |\n| Merchandise                     | 872   | 828   | 5.3      |\n| Total                           | 3,215 | 3,118 | 3.1      |\n\nDue to Jungheinrich's strong presence in the European market and the production plants being primarily located in Germany, 90 per cent of the purchasing volume was attributable to Europe.\n\nThe top-selling commodity groups were batteries, warehouse equipment, steel components, electric drive trains and logistics services.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-24-0\"></span>Research and development\n\nThe main research and development (R&D) activities in the financial year were the construction of new material handling equipment with a focus on the further development of efficient energy storage systems based on lithium-ion technology. There was also a focus on the development of mobile robots and the optimisation of automated systems. A further focal R&D point was digital products.\n\nImage /page/24/Figure/9 description: The image is a bar chart that shows the research and development expenditure in millions of euros for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The expenditure for 2023 is 152 million euros, for 2022 is 128 million euros, and for 2021 is 102 million euros.\n\nR&D expenditure consists primarily of internal services. Including the use of third-party services, it stood at €152 million in the Group, 18.8 per cent higher than in the previous year (€128 million). As in the previous year, this corresponded to a 2.7 per cent share of Group revenue. The increase in important product development work meant that the capitalisation ratio rose to 29 per cent (previous year: 24 per cent). In the reporting period, depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses on capitalised development expenditure included impairment losses of €3 million. These impairment losses were related to the development of a technology which will not be continued.\n\nR&D received another personnel boost in the reporting year; the number of employees involved in development projects across the Group stood at an average of 1,017 in the reporting period (previous year: 885). The change was largely down to the full acquisition of Magazino. Jungheinrich AG, which is responsible for Group-wide basic and product development, accounted for 141 (previous year: 130) employees.\n\n#### Research and development\n\n| in € million                                                                                     | 2023  | 2022 | Change % |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------|----------|\n| Total R&D expenditure                                                                            | 152   | 128  | 18.8     |\n| thereof capitalised<br>development expenditure                                                   | 45    | 30   | 50.0     |\n| Capitalisation ratio                                                                             | 29%   | 24%  | –        |\n| Depreciation, amortisation<br>and impairment losses on<br>capitalised development<br>expenditure | 14    | 16   | –12.5    |\n| R&D costs<br>(statement of profit or loss)                                                       | 121   | 113  | 7.1      |\n| Total R&D expenditure/<br>Group revenue                                                          | 2.7%  | 2.7% | –        |\n| Average number of<br>R&D employees (FTE)                                                         | 1,017 | 885  | 14.9     |\n| Number of patent applications                                                                    | 133   | 99   | 34.3     |\n| Number of patents granted                                                                        | 152   | 165  | –7.9     |\n\nTable contains rounding differences.\n\n#### STRATEGY 2025+\n\nWe continued implementing Strategy 2025+ in the 2023 financial year. Despite the ongoing challenging conditions from both a macroeconomic and geopolitical point of view, initiatives and measures were still implemented in all six strategic fields of action.\n\n#### Central targets reviewed and adjusted\n\nTaking into account the acquisition and anticipated contributions from Storage Solutions and in light of other material macroeconomic challenges at the time the corporate strategy was published in November 2020, we have reviewed and partially adjusted our targets in the year under review. The aim is to increase Group revenue to €6.0 billion organically by the 2025 financial year (previously: €5.5 billion) and again achieve EBIT ROS of 8 to 10 per cent. Our target is to generate more than 20 per cent of the revenue outside of Europe, this increase in revenue will be both organic and inorganic. ROCE is anticipated to be between 14 per cent and 18 per cent (previously: 21 per cent to 25 per cent). The changes in the target ranges reflect that the goodwill of the acquisitions was taken into account. By 2025, 50 per cent (previously 70 per cent) of Jungheinrich trucks should be fitted with lithium-ion batteries. The considerable increase in cell prices have led to an adjustment of this target. We are aiming for an EBIT per employee of around €23,000. By 2025, the proportion of female managers is targeted to reach 20 per cent.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe minimum target for free cash flow is now more than €300 million (previously: at least €100 million). As far as sustainability is concerned, we have set ourselves various targets, but the main target is to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. To this end, our aim is to reduce direct CO2e emissions in Scope 1 by 42 per cent compared to the baseline year of 2021 in line with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and procure 100 per cent of electricity from renewable sources by 2030.\n\n#### Automation: key factor in envisaged growth\n\nThe focus of our measures in the automation strategic field of action is on mobile robots and automated storage & retrieval systems (ASRS). Mobile robots includes both Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) and Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR).\n\nIn the reporting year, we also initiated further development activities for the PowerCube, an automated compact storage system for containers that was brought onto the market in 2022. Jungheinrich also launched the EAE 212a in 2023, a newly developed mobile robot solution for low-lift trucks.\n\nWe increased our shareholding in robotics specialist Magazino to 100 per cent in the reporting year. The purchase price for the remaining shares came to €20 million. Magazino has a high-performance technology platform that allows the operation of logistics robots even in a mixed human-machine environment. With approx. 120 employees, Magazino boosts the autonomous robot business and increases Jungheinrich's software expertise.\n\nWe expanded the customer base for the AMR arculee in 2023. The autonomous mobile robot was launched in 2022 and is used in underload transport and in goods-to-person order picking.\n\nWe firmly believe that the high-volume global market for warehouse logistics automation is a market with aboveaverage growth and we intend to keep expanding our position in this market. Accordingly, it was decided to create a new Board of Management division for automation. As a result, all customer-specific project business units and resources focussing on mobile robots, ASRS and warehouse equipment will be pooled in this division from 1 April 2024.\n\n#### Digitalisation: further development of the IT infrastructure\n\nThe digital fleet management system, Jungheinrich FMS, has been available in three more countries – Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia – since 2023. The system is now available in 25 countries. Expansion to further countries, especially outside Europe, is planned for the coming years. We added new software modules and functions to the Jungheinrich FMS in 2023. The migration of customers of the predecessor ISM Online to the new Jungheinrich FMS is also virtually complete. Since August 2023, almost every truck manufactured in Europe has a telematics box integrated as standard. That means the free Jungheinrich FMS starter kit can be activated for each truck with a telematics box and further premium modules can be added. The telematics box is the technical foundation for further data-based services in future such as remote diagnostics and predictive maintenance.\n\nJungheinrich's largest IT project to date – establishing a new IT infrastructure – was completed in 2023. The interconnectivity created between the private Jungheinrich cloud and IT providers' offers guarantees the secure, flexible and fast availability of IT services and products worldwide. On the basis of this infrastructure, Jungheinrich's ongoing digital transformation optimises the interconnectivity of processes, data and applications both in its own processes and the digitalisation of its customers' intralogistics processes.\n\n#### Energy systems: sharp increase in demand in core business\n\nJungheinrich ceased manufacturing IC engine-powered trucks in March 2023 and since then manufactures 100 per cent electric trucks. We recorded a strong rise in demand for POWERLiNE trucks, which are considerably more compact than their predecessors thanks to integrated lithium-ion batteries and thus offer an advantage in tight warehouse environments, in the 2023 financial year. In addition, POWERLiNE trucks are CO2e-neutral until delivery to the customer.\n\n#### Efficiency: organisational and procedural transformation is progressing\n\nJungheinrich has been manufacturing the ETV 216i reach truck at the new Chomutov plant in Czechia since June 2023. A new 37,000 square-metre building was constructed that is both energy-efficient and carbon-optimised. The project budget of approx. €60 million was almost completely used in the reporting year. The new plant is a central building block to increase efficiency and profitability.\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe also expanded our near-shoring organisation in 2023. In Madrid, the focus is on internal IT services and development services for digital products. At the end of 2023, the company employed a staff of almost 100 there. The personnel capacities in Braşov (Romania), where our internal administrative services are increasingly based, more than doubled in the reporting year to 140 employees. At the small location, in terms of capacity, in Zagreb, employees provide software and hardware development services for the entire Group.\n\nKey measures to increase efficiency in the Jungheinrich Group, including the digital transformation of the company, are managed through the DEEP programme (Digital End-to-End Processes). DEEP is designed to achieve customerfocussed and lean, automated processes. The design and implementation phases were continued in 2023. We have achieved the first two programme milestones with the central master data solution and the central finance system. Development work on the Group-wide ERP system was continued along with the implementation of other important applications, for example a new internal service management solution for the after-sales service business.\n\n#### Global footprint: present on the American market with Storage Solutions and Rocrich\n\nJungheinrich's strategic goal is to grow through acquisitions and partnerships, too. With the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group, a leading provider of racking systems and warehouse automation in the US, we have significantly expanded our global footprint in the North America region. The purchase price was €325 million. With Storage Solutions, we now have access to the US market for warehouse equipment and automation and thus the ability to exploit further growth potential in this market. The post-merger integration of Storage Solutions is going according to plan and the business performance was in line with expectations in the reporting period.\n\nWe have established an optimised range of automation solutions in North America with the joint venture Rocrich. The combination of Mitsubishi Logisnext's (brand: Rocla) truck portfolio and Jungheinrich's AGVs, puts us in a position to serve the North American market with more than 570 Logisnext retail locations.\n\n#### Sustainability: creating sustainable value remains the main focus\n\nWe participate in ratings and rankings in order to show the progress we are making in the field of sustainability. Based on communication with stakeholders and internal analyses, we focus on selected ESG ratings in order to specifically develop our externally evaluated sustainability performance.\n\nEcoVadis awarded Jungheinrich Platinum status for the third consecutive time in 2023. The CDP rating of B in the previous year in the climate category was again confirmed for 2023 (in a nine-step scale from A to F) for transparency and commitment to climate protection. ISS ESG Corporate Rating again awarded Jungheinrich the sector-specific status Prime in the reporting year. Jungheinrich improved its rating to B– (12-step scale from A+ to D–). The Group again achieved a rating of A from MSCI ESG Ratings (seven-step industryspecific scale from AAA to CCC) in 2023.\n\nA great deal of progress has been made throughout the Group in terms of sustainability, but the following is particularly noteworthy: By the end of the 2023 financial year, the transition to electricity from renewable energy was completed in 28 countries. We also expanded the CO2e-neutral after-sales service to five markets. We formalised the Groupwide human rights management system and Jungheinrich published its first policy statement on respecting human rights. In addition, we joined the UN Global Compact Initiative.\n\nWe provide extensive information regarding our sustainability activities in the combined separate non-financial report in this annual report in accordance with the CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG) [ [page](#page-55-0) 54 ].\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-27-0\"></span>Economic report\n\n#### ECONOMIC AND SECTOR ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe regional focus of Jungheinrich's activities lies in Europe. Outside Europe, the focus is on North America and Asia Pacific. Each country's gross domestic product (GDP) as an economic indicator is key to evaluating business developments in these regions.\n\n#### Europe holding back global economic growth\n\nIn 2023, the global economy recorded less growth than in the previous year, despite high GDP growth in the United States and China. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, rising interest rates, fears of recession and the latest escalation in the Middle East conflict all dominated the global economy and led to a much lower increase in economic output, particularly in the eurozone, in the reporting year.\n\n#### Growth rates for selected economic regions\n\n| Gross domestic product in % | 2023 | 2022 |\n|-----------------------------|------|------|\n| World                       | 3.1  | 3.5  |\n| USA                         | 2.5  | 1.9  |\n| China                       | 5.2  | 3.0  |\n| Eurozone                    | 0.5  | 3.4  |\n| Germany                     | -0.3 | 1.8  |\n\nSource: International Monetary Fund (estimates as of 30 January 2024 with updated prior-year figures compared to the 2022 combined management report).\n\nThus, with a GDP increase of just 0.5 per cent, the eurozone showed noticeably lower growth in economic output than in the previous year (3.4 per cent). Following growth of 1.8 per cent in the previous year, Germany's export-oriented economy contracted by 0.3 per cent in 2023. Based on a GDP increase of 2.5 per cent in the previous year, the French economy only recorded an increase in economic growth of 0.8 per cent in the reporting year. Similar developments were seen in the Italian and British growth rates: the Italian economy grew 0.7 per cent in the reporting year, following 3.7 per cent in the previous year, while GDP in the UK rose 0.5 per cent following 4.3 per cent in 2022. Jungheinrich generates 45 per cent of its Group revenue in the four countries mentioned above.\n\n#### STATEMENT FROM THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND TARGET ACHIEVEMENT\n\nIn light of the latest corporate planning and the positive business performance in the first quarter of 2023, the Board of Management of Jungheinrich AG raised the forecast ranges for 2023 published in the 2022 annual report in an ad hoc announcement on 24 April 2023. The impact of the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group on the individual forecast ranges was also provided in the adjusted forecast. The acquisition was taken into account in the previous forecast, but not individually quantified. Following the final purchase price adjustment and the completed purchase price allocation, the impacts of the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group were updated in the interim report as of 30 June 2023 on 9 August 2023.\n\nAt €5,238 million, incoming orders in the Group was in the middle of the forecast range (€5.0 billion to €5.4 billion). Storage Solutions' contribution was expected to be €0.3 billion but came in lower at €0.2 billion due to demand. Group revenue amounted to €5,546 million and reached the upper value of the forecast range (€5.1 billion to €5.5 billion). Storage Solutions' contribution to revenue amounted to €0.2 billion as planned.\n\nDespite an increase in personnel (including through acquisitions), tariff effects, a rise in the cost of materials and a slight decrease in number of units produced in comparison with the previous year, we were able to generate EBIT of €430 million thanks to appropriate measures and thus achieve a figure in the middle of the forecast range of €400 million to €450 million. The effect on EBIT from the Storage Solutions Group in the amount of €– 5 million is also taken into account. This effect is the result of a positive operating contribution to EBIT and negative effects from transaction-related expenses, effects from the purchase price allocation and variable remuneration elements for the management of the Storage Solutions Group. EBIT ROS came to 7.8 per cent and was thus at the lower end of the range of between 7.8 per cent and 8.6 per cent.\n\nAt €399 million, EBT was in the middle of the expected range of €370 million to €420 million. EBIT ROS came to 7.2 per cent and was thus at the lower end of the forecast range of between 7.2 per cent and 8.0 per cent.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-28-0\"></span>ROCE of 15.9 per cent was in the lower half of the forecast range of 15.0 per cent to 18.0 per cent. This was due to the increase in average capital employed in the reporting year as a result of the goodwill recognised for Storage Solutions and Magazino in the amount of €302 million.\n\nFree cash flow came to €15 million and was significantly better than in the previous year (€– 239 million), as anticipated. A negative free cash flow was originally expected, but thanks to the stable working capital compared to the previous year, even a slightly positive cash flow was generated in contrast to the forecast. The positive free cash flow figure takes into account the outflow of €326 million for the acquisition of Storage Solutions and Magazino.\n\n#### Target-to-actual comparison\n\n|                    |              | Forecast                                    |              | actual<br>2023 |\n|--------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------|\n|                    |              | March 20231                                 | April 20232  |                |\n| Incoming<br>orders | in € billion | 4.8 to 5.2                                  | 5.0 to 5.4   | 5.2            |\n| Revenue            | in € billion | 4.9 to 5.3                                  | 5.1 to 5.5   | 5.5            |\n| EBIT               | in € million | 350 to 400                                  | 400 to 450   | 430            |\n| EBIT ROS           | in %         | 7.3 to 8.1                                  | 7.8 to 8.6   | 7.8            |\n| EBT                | in € million | 325 to 375                                  | 370 to 420   | 399            |\n| EBT ROS            | in %         | 6.6 to 7.4                                  | 7.2 to 8.0   | 7.2            |\n| ROCE               | in %         | 13.0 to 16.0                                | 15.0 to 18.0 | 15.9           |\n| Free<br>cash flow  | in € million | significantly better,<br>but still negative |              | 15             |\n\n<sup>1</sup> Annual report 2022.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Ad hoc release from 24 April 2023 and interim report as of 31 March 2023.\n\n#### BUSINESS TREND AND EARNINGS POSITION\n\n#### Orders on hand reflect normalisation of supply chains\n\nAt 122 thousand units, incoming orders in new business, based on units, which includes orders for both new forklifts and trucks for short-term rental, fell by 5.4 per cent (previous year: 129 thousand units). By value, incoming orders for the business fields of new business, short-term rental and used equipment, as well as after-sales services were 9.3 per cent higher than the previous year's level at €5,238 million (previous year: €4,791 million). The incoming orders attributable to Storage Solutions amounted to €157 million.\n\nOrders on hand in new business amounted to €1,441 million as of 31 December 2023 (previous year: €1,595 million) and takes into account orders on hand of €51 million at the Storage Solutions Group. Developments in orders on hand are due to the further normalisation of supply chains, which led to a successive processing of existing orders.\n\nImage /page/28/Figure/17 description: The image shows a bar chart of incoming orders in millions of euros. In 2023, the incoming orders were 5,238 million euros. In 2022, the incoming orders were 4,791 million euros. In 2021, the incoming orders were 4,868 million euros.\n\n#### Revenue outside Europe exceeds €1 billion as a result of acquisition\n\nGroup revenue exceeded the previous year's figure (€4,763 million) by 16.4 per cent or €783 million and amounted to €5,546 million. Europe accounted for 80 per cent (previous year: 84 per cent) of revenue. Foreign revenue increased by 18.7 per cent to €4,341 million (previous year: €3,657 million). In addition to the rise in revenue outside of Europe, revenue in the UK, France and Italy also climbed considerably. The foreign ratio was 78 per cent (previous year: 77 per cent).\n\nOutside of Europe, revenue jumped 45.7 per cent to €1,087 million (previous year: €746 million). The share of Group revenue from outside Europe thus increased to 20 per cent (previous year: 16 per cent). The main reason for this is the first partial inclusion of the Storage Solutions Group.\n\n#### Revenue in 2023 by region\n\nImage /page/28/Figure/22 description: The image is a pie chart showing the distribution of something across different regions. Western Europe accounts for 43%, Germany accounts for 22%, Other countries account for 20%, and Eastern Europe accounts for 15%.\n\n| in € million    | 2023         | 2022         | Change %    |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Germany         | 1,205        | 1,106        | 9.0         |\n| Western Europe  | 2,395        | 2,113        | 13.3        |\n| Eastern Europe  | 859          | 798          | 7.6         |\n| Other countries | 1,087        | 746          | 45.7        |\n| <b>Total</b>    | <b>5,546</b> | <b>4,763</b> | <b>16.4</b> |\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\nLike the developments in orders on hand, Group revenue also profited from the further normalisation of supply chains. The main driver of Group revenue was new business, with revenue growth of €526 million. In addition to the very positive growth in new trucks, the revenue from Storage Solutions (€219 million) accounted for under new business also contributed to this performance. Revenue in the short-term rental and used equipment business also increased and amounted to €761 million (previous year: €710 million). This was due to demand for trucks for short-term rental and used trucks. After-sales grew noticeably, with revenue amounting to €1,451 million in the reporting period (previous year: €1,310 million). The after-sales services share of Group revenue amounted to 26 per cent (previous year: 28 per cent). At €1,322 million, revenue in the \"Financial Services\" segment was higher than in the previous year (€1,131 million).\n\n#### Breakdown of revenue\n\n| in € million                            | 2023   | 2022   | Change % |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| New business                            | 3,384  | 2,858  | 18.4     |\n| Short-term rental and<br>used equipment | 761    | 710    | 7.2      |\n| After-sales services                    | 1,451  | 1,310  | 10.8     |\n| \"Intralogistics\" segment                | 5,595  | 4,878  | 14.7     |\n| \"Financial Services\" segment            | 1,322  | 1,131  | 16.9     |\n| Reconciliation                          | -1,372 | -1,245 | 10.2     |\n| Jungheinrich Group                      | 5,546  | 4,763  | 16.4     |\n| in € million                            | 2023   | 2022   | Change % |\n| Cost of sales                           | 3,822  | 3,290  | 16.2     |\n| Gross profit                            | 1,724  | 1,473  | 17.0     |\n| Selling expenses                        | 975    | 834    | 16.9     |\n| R&D costs                               | 121    | 113    | 7.1      |\n| General administrative<br>expenses      | 203    | 161    | 26.1     |\n\nTable contains rounding differences.\n\n#### Gross profit benefits from higher revenue\n\nGross profit on sales increased by €251 million to €1,724 million (previous year: €1,473 million). In the reporting period, it benefited from the higher sales, despite increases in the cost of materials, including the first-time, pro rata inclusion of Storage Solutions, and appropriate measures to safeguard margins. The gross margin correspondingly rose from 30.9 per cent in the same period of the previous year to 31.1 per cent.\n\n#### Cost structure (statement of profit or loss)\n\nThe increase in selling expenses was roughly proportional to revenue growth. This was primarily due to the increase in Sales personnel and the associated increase in personnel expenses. Effects from the acquisition of Storage Solutions also had an impact. Selling expenses represented 17.6 per cent of Group revenue (previous year: 17.5 per cent).\n\nR&D costs rose by €8 million to €121 million (previous year: €113 million). This increase reflects the expansion of development activities related to expanding the product portfolio.\n\nAt 3.7 per cent of Group revenue, administrative expenses were slightly higher than the previous year's figure (3.4 per cent). The development in administrative expenses reflects expenses – including expenses for building up human resource capacities – associated with strategic projects on ongoing process optimisation, efficiency optimisation and digitalisation projects which also climbed compared to the previous year, as planned.\n\nOther operating income decreased by €9 million to €8 million (previous year: €17 million). The previous year's high figure contained net income from the transitional consolidation of shares in JT Energy Systems GmbH (€5 million) and proceeds from the sale of real estate (€6 million).\n\nOther operating expenses increased by €10 million to €12 million (previous year: €2 million). This was primarily due to transaction costs (€8 million) in connection with the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group.\n\nImage /page/29/Figure/20 description: The image shows a bar graph titled \"Earnings before interest and income taxes in € million\".

The earnings for 2021 are 360, the earnings for 2022 are 386, and the earnings for 2023 are 430.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-30-0\"></span>EBIT exceeds €400 million for the first time\n\nAt €430 million, EBIT exceeded the previous year's level (€386 million) by €44 million, or 11.4 per cent. The contribution to operating earnings from the Storage Solutions Group included in this figure amounted to €31 million. Taking into account the negative impacts from the costs related to the transaction (€8 million), the purchase price allocation (€13 million) and the variable remuneration components (€15 million), the Storage Solutions Group made a contribution to EBIT of €– 5 million in total. The impact on EBIT from the full acquisition of Magazino totalled €– 7 million. At 7.8 per cent, EBIT ROS was less than the previous year's level (8.1 per cent).\n\nThe financial income totalled €– 31 million (previous year: €– 39 million) and was particularly influenced by the results from the measurement of the securities and derivatives in the special fund. Profit was recorded here in the year under review; however significant losses were recorded in the previous year. In addition, there were positive effects from the currency hedge for the purchase price payments for Storage Solutions. At €399 million, EBT exceeded the previous year's figure (€347 million). EBT ROS amounted to 7.2 per cent (previous year: 7.3 per cent).\n\nImage /page/30/Figure/10 description: This image shows a bar chart titled \"Profit or loss in € million\". The y-axis shows the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The x-axis shows the profit or loss in € million. The bar chart shows that the profit or loss in 2021 was 267, in 2022 was 270, and in 2023 was 299.\n\nIncome tax expenses increased in line with the development in earnings to €100 million (previous year: €78 million). The Group tax rate amounted to 25 per cent following 22 per cent in the previous year. The main reason for the higher tax rate in the reporting year was that, compared to the previous year, a much higher share of profits was generated in Germany. Profit or loss of €299 million (previous year: €270 million) was thus generated. The earnings per preferred share (based on share of earnings attributable to the shareholders of Jungheinrich AG) came to €2.94 (previous year: €2.65).\n\nROCE fell to 15.9 per cent (previous year: 16.3 per cent). This was due to the increase in average capital employed in the reporting year as a result of the goodwill recognised for Storage Solutions and Magazino in the amount of €302 million.\n\n#### Dividend rises to historic high\n\nThe Board of Management and Supervisory Board of Jungheinrich AG will propose a dividend payout of €0.73 (previous year: €0.66) per ordinary share and €0.75 (previous year: €0.68) per preferred share to the Annual General Meeting on 15 May 2024. This dividend proposal will result in a total payout of €75 million (previous year: €68 million). The payment ratio of 25 per cent, as in the previous year, is in the company's target range of paying between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of profit to shareholders. Jungheinrich follows a policy of consistent dividend payments.\n\n#### FINANCIAL AND ASSET POSITION\n\n#### Principles and targets of financial management\n\nThe parent company, Jungheinrich AG, is responsible for the Group's financial management. It ensures that sufficient financial resources are available to cover strategic and operational requirements.\n\nThe Group treasury is primarily responsible for cash and currency management. It aims to provide Group companies with financial resources at the best interest and currency conditions, and to control cash flows. All financing possibilities provided by international money and capital markets are exploited in order to procure the short, medium and long-term financial resources that are required.\n\nEnsuring that the Group has sufficient liquidity reserves is particularly important so that the Group is able, even in economically difficult times, to implement all necessary strategic measures and guarantee financial independence.\n\nThe Group takes a conservative approach to investing in order to ensure sufficient liquidity. The objective is not to maximise profit, but – considering current conditions in the international money and capital markets – to preserve assets.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\nA central working capital management system is in place to strengthen internal financing that ensures the optimisation and standardisation of material processes and systems.\n\nJungheinrich AG's capital requirements are covered through operating cash flows and short and long-term financing. Jungheinrich maintains a solid liquidity reserve. As of 31 December 2023, the medium-term credit agreements in place amounted to €305 million. These were supplemented by short-term bilateral credit lines amounting to €196 million and a commercial paper programme amounting to €300 million. Both the medium-term credit agreements and shortterm credit lines were only used to a small extent. As at the balance sheet date, the commercial paper programme had not been used. In addition, separate guarantee facilities totalling €159 million were available, almost half of which were utilised. There were promissory notes in the total amount of €160 million as at the reporting date.\n\nBridge financing in the amount of €300 million was taken out specifically for the purpose of financing the acquisition of Storage Solutions. A credit agreement for €125 million was also concluded in the reporting year for the medium- and long-term financing of research and development expenditure. As of 31 December 2023, none of these funds had been used.\n\nCredit or promissory note agreements do not contain financial covenants.\n\n#### Net debt reflects acquisition activities\n\nAt €662 million at the end of 2023, cash and cash equivalents and securities were €127 million above the prior-year figure (€535 million). Working capital has remained stable in comparison with the previous year. The reduction in inventories was largely balanced out through the increase in receivables, the decrease in contract liabilities and trade accounts payable. As of 31 December 2023, net debt amounted to €262 million (previous year: €75 million). The marked rise of €187 million is first and foremost due to the purchase price payments for Storage Solutions and Magazino, which had a negative impact of €326 million on free cash flow.\n\nImage /page/31/Figure/13 description: The image shows two bar charts. The first bar chart is titled \"Shareholders' equity in € million\". The values for 2023, 2022, and 2021 are 2,222, 2,051, and 1,803, respectively.

This increase in shareholders' equity was offset by the dividend payment of €68 million (previous year: €68 million). Due to the higher increase in the balance sheet total, the equity ratio declined slightly to 32 per cent (previous year: 33 per cent). Adjusted for all effects from the \"Financial Services\" segment, the shareholder's equity for \"Intralogistics\" amounted to 47 per cent (previous year: 50 per cent).\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\nProvisions for pensions and similar obligations rose to €180 million against the previous year (€159 million). This was primarily driven by the discount rate for the remeasurement of pension provisions in Germany decreasing from 4.2 per cent at the end of 2022 to 3.5 per cent as at the balance sheet date. The Group's non-current and current financial liabilities went up by €315 million to €924 million (previous year: €609 million). This was caused by the bridge financing of €300 million for the acquisition of Storage Solutions, which was recognised in current financial liabilities. At €2,146 million, current and non-current liabilities from financial services were up €154 million against the figure as of 31 December 2022 (€1,992 million), due to the higher level of contracts.\n\nAt €343 million, other current provisions were higher than the figure reported on 31 December 2022 (€292 million). This was primarily due to additions to provisions for personnel in the amount of €57 million. Trade accounts payable remained on a par with the previous year's level at €560 million (€556 million). Other current liabilities declined slightly to €364 million, mainly as a result of a decrease in contract liabilities (previous year: €370 million).\n\nFree cash flow, the key performance indicator used to manage the Group's liquidity and financing, is determined as follows using the cash flow from operating activities and investing activities reported in the statement of cash flows:\n\n#### Reconciliation free cash flow\n\n| in € million                                                                                                                                                     | 2023 | 2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Cash flows from operating activities                                                                                                                             | 472  | -136 |\n| Cash flows from investing activities                                                                                                                             | -430 | 79   |\n| Adjustment for payments for acquisitions<br>and proceeds from the sale of securities<br>as well as payments for time deposits and<br>proceeds from time deposits | -27  | -182 |\n| Cash flows from investing activities<br>(adjusted)                                                                                                               | -457 | -103 |\n| Free cash flow                                                                                                                                                   | 15   | -239 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                  |      |      |\n\n#### Statement of cash flows 1\n\n| in € million                                                                                                                        | 2023 | 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Profit or loss                                                                                                                      | 299  | 270  |\n| Depreciation, amortisation<br>and impairment losses                                                                                 | 447  | 401  |\n| Changes in trucks for short-term rental<br>and trucks for lease (excluding depreciation)<br>and receivables from financial services | -487 | -465 |\n| Changes in liabilities from financing trucks<br>for short-term rental and financial services                                        | 145  | 19   |\n| Changes in working capital                                                                                                          | 1    | -364 |\n| Other changes                                                                                                                       | 68   | 4    |\n| Cash flows from operating activities                                                                                                | 472  | -136 |\n| Cash flows from investing activities<br>(adjusted)                                                                                  | -457 | -103 |\n| Cash flows from financing activities                                                                                                | 117  | 37   |\n| Net cash changes in cash<br>and cash equivalents                                                                                    | 132  | -202 |\n|                                                                                                                                     |      |      |\n\nTables contain rounding differences.\n\n1\n\n Exchange rate effects were eliminated in the cash flow statement. Therefore the changes in balance sheet items shown there cannot be reproduced in the statement of financial position.\n\n#### Cash flow from operating activities reflects relief from stable working capital\n\nCash flow from operating activities amounted to €+472 million for the period of January to December 2023, a significant increase of €608 million compared with the previous year (€– 136 million). The unchanged working capital had a positive impact on cash flow of €365 million in comparison with the previous year. Additions to trucks for short-term rental and trucks for lease along with developments in receivables from financial services in connection with the underlying financing transactions had a positive impact of €104 million.\n\nAt €– 457 million, the negative cash flow from investing activities in the reporting period was significantly higher than in the same period last year (€– 103 million). €326 million from the purchase price payments for Storage Solutions and Magazino is included in cash flow from investing activities in the reporting period. Investments in property, plant and equipment included €16 million for the construction of the new plant in Chomutov, Czechia.\n\nFree cash flow, the sum of cash flow from operating activities and investing activities, improved markedly to €+15 million (previous year: €– 239 million). The positive free cash flow figure takes into account the outflow for the acquisition of Storage Solutions and Magazino (€326 million).\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Financing of acquisitions dominates cash flow from financing activities\n\nCash flow from financing activities of €117 million in the reporting year climbed by €80 million compared to the same period last year (€37 million). The main reason for this was the purchase price financing of €300 million for the acquisition of Storage Solutions.\n\n#### Acquisition leads to increase in non-current and current assets\n\nThe increase in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment by €437 million to €1,355 million resulted primarily from the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group. This transaction resulted in customer relationships, brands, orders on hand and software/technologies totalling €53 million and €274 million for the remaining goodwill being reported under intangible assets as at the balance sheet date. Acquired technologies and the goodwill of Magazino came to a total of €40 million.\n\nThe carrying amounts for trucks for short-term rental and trucks for lease amounted to €1,038 million as at the balance sheet date. The carrying amount for trucks for lease increased slightly to €470 million following €459 million at the end of the 2022 financial year, while trucks for lease from financial services remained virtually unchanged at €568 million in comparison with 31 December 2022 (€567 million). Due to the expansion of business, non-current and current receivables from financial services increased by €189 million to €1,652 million compared with the figure in the previous year (€1,463 million).\n\nThe €67 million decrease in inventories to €927 million (previous year: €994 million) was a result of measures taken to reduce stocks. Cash and cash equivalents and current securities rose by €146 million as at the balance sheet date to €652 million (previous year: €506 million).\n\nImage /page/33/Figure/13 description: The image shows a bar chart titled \"Balance sheet total in € million\".

Of the project budget for the construction of the new plant in Chomutov (Czechia) (approx. €60 million), €16 million was used in the reporting year, while €7 million was included in the capital expenditure figure in the previous year. As at the balance sheet date, purchase commitments for property, plant and equipment alone amounted to €7 million. Capital expenditure was financed with the company's own resources.\n\nImage /page/33/Figure/27 description: The image shows a bar chart of capital expenditure in millions of euros.

This segment provides individual transfer of use and sales financing to promote the sale of trucks. The financial service agreements offered are always combined with full service or maintenance agreements. This business model's objective is to provide customer service for the entire duration of a truck's use and achieve long-term customer loyalty.\n\nAll risks and opportunities that result from the financial service agreements are assigned to the operating sales units of the \"Intralogistics\" segment, with the exception of customer receivable default risks and refinancing risks.\n\nJungheinrich is represented by its own financial services companies in eight countries: Germany, Italy, France, the UK, Spain, the Netherlands, Austria and Australia.\n\nThe \"Financial Services\" segment's structural and procedural organisation throughout the Group enables a financing structure with powerful domestic and foreign banks. The refinancing company Elbe River Capital S.A., Luxembourg, also enables refinancing to be obtained through the capital market. As in the previous year, the volume placed through this financing platform amounted to €301 million as of 31 December 2023.\n\nIn addition to the SAP standard software used by the financial services business to record and balance lease agreements, there is a software solution that uses a database (Global Lease Center) for smaller sales units.\n\n#### Refinancing with matching terms and interest rates\n\nJungheinrich companies conclude financial service agreements either directly with customers or indirectly via leasing companies or banks (also known as vendor contracts). Agreements concluded directly with customers are reported as operating leases or finance leases pursuant to IFRS accounting regulations. These long-term customer agreements are refinanced with matching terms and interest rates and are reported under liabilities from financial services. Payments from customer agreements cover at least the refinancing payments to credit institutes for the transactions. For vendor agreements, deferred revenue stemming from sales proceeds already generated with an intermediate leasing company are stated under deferred income.\n\n#### Key figures for financial services\n\n| in € million                                | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 | Change % |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|------------|----------|\n| Original value of<br>new contracts1         | 971        | 851        | 14.1     |\n| Original value of contracts<br>on hand      | 4,069      | 3,821      | 6.5      |\n| Trucks for lease from<br>financial services | 708        | 712        | -0.6     |\n| Receivables from<br>financial services      | 1,665      | 1,476      | 12.8     |\n| Shareholders' equity                        | 122        | 120        | 1.7      |\n| Liabilities                                 | 2,589      | 2,418      | 7.1      |\n| Revenue1                                    | 1,322      | 1,131      | 16.9     |\n| EBIT1                                       | 17         | 25         | -32.0    |\n\n<sup>1</sup> 1 January–31 December.\n\n#### Revenue from financial services significantly exceeds €1 billion\n\nNew long-term financial service agreements rose by €120 million in 2023 (previous year: €74 million). The independent financial services companies in the UK, Spain, Austria and the Netherlands are noteworthy with an increase in the value of new agreements of more than 30 per cent. Of the increase in agreements, 62 per cent was attributable to the eight countries with Jungheinrich financial services companies (previous year: 61 per cent).\n\nAt the end of 2023, existing agreements totalled 223 thousand units, 2.8 per cent more than the previous year (217 thousand units). This represents an original value of €4,069 million (previous year: €3,821 million).\n\nRelative to the number of new trucks sold, 42 per cent were sold via financial service agreements (previous year: 40 per cent).\n\nAt €1,322 million, revenue in the \"Financial Services\" segment was higher than in the previous year (€1,131 million).\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-35-0\"></span>EMPLOYEES\n\n#### Number of employees worldwide rises to more than 21,000\n\nThe number of employees around the world rose by 1,310 in the reporting year. Accordingly, on 31 December 2023, the Group had 21,117 (previous year: 19,807) employees (measured in full-time equivalents). The main factors in this increase were the acquisitions of Storage Solutions (186 employees) and Magazino (117 employees), the expansion of the nearshoring organisation (177 employees) and the start of production at the new plant in Czechia (65 employees).\n\nImage /page/35/Figure/27 description: This image shows a bar chart of the number of employees in FTE as of 31/12 for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The chart shows the number of employees in Germany and abroad. In 2021, there were 7,995 employees in Germany and 11,108 employees abroad, for a total of 19,103 employees. In 2022, there were 8,251 employees in Germany and 11,556 employees abroad, for a total of 19,807 employees.

In light of the slight decrease in the number of units produced in the year under review, the number of temporary workers also decreased on average throughout the year to 491 (previous year: 635). As of 31 December 2023, the Group employed 438 temporary workers (previous year: 681). This corresponds to a ratio of temporary workers to workforce (in this case employees and temporary workers as of 31 December 2023 in full-time equivalents) of 2.0 per cent (previous year: 3.3 per cent).\n\nAfter-sales services accounted for 42 per cent of the workforce or 8,950 employees (previous year: 8,497). Of this figure, 6,255 were after-sales service technicians located around the world (previous year: 6,022).\n\n#### Jungheinrich offers 24 different apprenticeships\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Group had 511 (previous year: 496) trainees and apprentices, of which 329 (previous year: 334) were based in Germany. The Jungheinrich Group offers 24 different apprenticeships in Germany. This includes dual study courses in cooperation with universities. As in the previous year, the number of trainees and apprentices on dual study courses was 15 per cent in 2023 – based on the number of trainees and apprentices in Germany.\n\nImage /page/35/Figure/18 description: The image is a pie chart titled \"Apprenticeable professions\" as of 31/12/2023. The pie chart shows the percentage of people in different professions. 26% are Mechatronic engineers for agricultural and construction machinery, 17% are Industrial mechanics, 15% are University graduates, 14% are Mechatronic engineers, 10% are Other commercial professions, 9% are Industrial clerks, and 9% are Other technical professions.\n\nBasis: 329 apprentices in Germany.\n\n#### Personnel changes\n\n1\n\nThe former Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Mr Hans-Georg Frey, resigned from office with effect from the end of the Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2023. The ordinary Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2023 elected Mr Rolf Najork to the Supervisory Board for a full term. Mr Najork was then elected Chairman of the Supervisory Board by the Supervisory Board and in this function also took up the chairmanship of the Personnel and Mediation Committees.\n\nMr Udo Panenka was also appointed to the Board of Management effective 1 April 2024, and will be responsible for the Automation division.\n\nA termination agreement was concluded with Ms Sabine Neuß, under which she will resign from her office on the Board of Management early by 30 June 2024. Mr Maik Manthey was appointed as her successor for the Technics division effective from 1 July 2024.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\nLegal disclosure\n\n# <span id=\"page-36-0\"></span>Legal disclosure\n\n#### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 289F AND 315D OF THE GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE (HGB)\n\nPursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the HGB, as a listed stock corporation, Jungheinrich AG is obligated to issue a Corporate Governance Statement for the Group. This statement has been published on the company's website [www.jungheinrich.com/](https://www.jungheinrich.com/en/investor-relations/corporate-governance) [en/investor-relations/corporate-governance](https://www.jungheinrich.com/en/investor-relations/corporate-governance).\n\n#### COMBINED SEPARATE NON-FINANCIAL REPORT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CSR DIRECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION ACT\n\nIn accordance with the CSR Directive Implementation Act, which aims to regulate non-financial corporate reporting, the Jungheinrich Group and Jungheinrich AG are obliged to report on non-financial aspects, including at least environmental, employee and social aspects, along with respect for human rights and combatting corruption and bribery.\n\nThe Jungheinrich Group and Jungheinrich AG fulfil this obligation in the form of a combined separate non-financial report in accordance with Sections 289b Paragraph 3 and 315b Paragraph 3 of the German Commercial Code. This report is published as a separate chapter in the annual report. The annual report is published on the company's website [www.jungheinrich.com/en/investor-relations/reports-publica](https://www.jungheinrich.com/en/investor-relations/reports-publications-6224)[tions-6224](https://www.jungheinrich.com/en/investor-relations/reports-publications-6224).\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management Re\n\nNon-financial report\n\n# <span id=\"page-37-0\"></span>Internal control and risk management system\n\n#### INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM 1\n\nJungheinrich considers the Internal Control System (ICS) to cover all principles, processes and guidelines introduced to ensure the achievement of business objectives. The objective of the ICS is to ensure the functional capacity, safety and efficiency of material business processes and the reliability of financial reporting and compliance of all activities with laws and guidelines. Jungheinrich has established an ICS in accordance with Section 91 Paragraph 3 AktG. It is based on the Committee of the Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013), which outlines the elements of a control system and sets the standards for evaluating the appropriateness and effectiveness of internal control systems. The ICS considers all material business processes and in addition to accounting also takes into consideration non-financial aspects, especially sustainability reporting. An effective and efficient ICS is crucial for managing risks in business processes.\n\nA comprehensive expansion of the ICS was initiated in the 2023 financial year, including established responsibilities, methods, processes and new ICS software.\n\nOverall responsibility for the ICS lies with the Jungheinrich Board of Management, which is therefore responsible for ensuring an appropriate and effective ICS. The Group Board of Management keeps the Supervisory Board and the Finance and Audit Committee informed on a continuous basis. In line with the Institute of Internal Auditors' three lines model, it is supported in this task in the second defensive line by the ICS organisation, which is responsible for the operational implementation of the ICS, in addition to risk management, and in the third defensive line by the internal audit department, which assesses the ICS in all audited companies for appropriateness and effectiveness within the context of the approved audit plan.\n\nThe Board of Management has established a risk management and internal control organisation to optimise and monitor the ICS process and drive the integration of standardisation of existing control activities in line with the legal and operational requirements. The organisation is a central function responsible for the guidelines, ICS process and methodology. The annual review of the scope of the guidelines ensures that all material elements are monitored by the ICS.\n\nAll Jungheinrich companies are part of the ICS. The extent of the implemented controls and the monitoring of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the controls varies and depends in part on the materiality of the companies and corporate processes for the Group and the specific risks associated with the company. The management of the respective company is obliged to establish an appropriate and effective ICS within its sphere of responsibility. Riskbased scoping (quantitative and qualitative according to the risk categories reporting, strategy & operations and compliance) for the companies and processes covered by the ICS is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary. In addition to processes relevant to accounting, such as record to report, purchase to pay and order to cash, the processes also include other topics such as sustainability reporting and IT.\n\nThe main business processes are analysed together with the central process owners in order to identify relevant risks for financial and sustainability reporting. The corresponding controls to minimise risks are documented and set out in an overarching risk-control matrix. Moreover, the Jungheinrich Group has guidelines that define responsibilities, workflows and controls for all material processes. All employees can access these guidelines on the intranet. The ICS controls are based on the processes described in the guidelines. ICS guidelines and the manual outline the aims, scope and responsibilities of the ICS as well as the ICS process.\n\n Disclosure unrelated to the management report that is not subject to audit of the financial statements.\n\n1\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\nternal control and\n\n<span id=\"page-38-0\"></span>The legal representatives of the companies and the persons responsible for the organisational areas confirm at year closing whether the control and monitoring activities conducted over the course of the year discovered violations of laws or regulations or irregularities within the framework of the ICS. They also confirm the accuracy and completeness of the ICS documentation for their respective spheres of responsibility.\n\nThe internal audit department also regularly audits the ICS. These audits are either part of the risk-based annual audit plan or triggered as the result of certain events occurring. The Supervisory Board monitors the effectiveness of internal audit, risk management and the ICS.\n\nThe external auditor also audits the effectiveness of the parts of the ICS that are relevant to financial reporting as part of a risk-oriented audit approach. The Jungheinrich Supervisory Board Finance and Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness of the ICS in accordance with Section 107, Paragraph 3 AktG.\n\nTaking into account the external and internal audits of the ICS carried out in 2023, no matters arose that would have led the Jungheinrich AG Board of Management to conclude that the ICS was not appropriate and effective in all material respects in the 2023 financial year.\n\nJungheinrich continuously develops the requirements for the ICS and adapts the control mechanisms to changing processes and requirements on an ongoing basis.\n\n#### INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM FOR THE GROUP ACCOUNTING PROCESS\n\nThe following describes the key features of the internal control and risk management system with respect to the Jungheinrich Group accounting process:\n\n- The Jungheinrich Group has a diverse organisational and corporate structure that ensures appropriate performance checks.\n- The holistic analysis and management of earnings-critical risk factors and risks jeopardising the company's existence are handled by Group-wide governance, budgeting and controlling processes as well as a risk management and risk early detection system, which is described below.\n- The functions of all Group accounting process departments (e.g. Corporate Accounting, Corporate Controlling and Group Treasury) are clearly assigned.\n- IT systems employed in Corporate Accounting are protected from unauthorised access and are largely off-the-shelf software (primarily SAP systems).\n- The Jungheinrich Group has guidelines in place determining accountabilities, workflows and controls for all material processes. All employees can access these guidelines on the intranet.\n- A comprehensive Group accounting manual regulates the Group accounting process of the individual companies and consolidation at Group level, ensuring that business transactions are accounted for, measured and uniformly reported throughout the Group. The manual is updated\n\nregularly and made available to the areas involved in the Group accounting process. Regular sample inspections and plausibility checks are performed both decentrally and centrally to verify the Group accounting data's completeness and correctness. This is done either manually or using software.\n\n- Material processes of relevance to accounting are subject to regular reviews. The establishment of the risk early detection system is examined as part of the statutory annual audit of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements. Findings derived from this audit are taken into account when considering the continual improvement of the Group-wide, Jungheinrichspecific system. The Corporate Compliance, Audit & Data Protection division reviews the effectiveness of the accounting-related internal controls.\n- The Supervisory Board or its Finance and Audit Committee is responsible for, among other issues, dealing with material issues pertaining to Group accounting and risk management, compliance and the audit assignments and focal points of audits conducted by the independent auditors and the Corporate Compliance, Audit & Data Protection division.\n- Another core element of risk governance is the audit of the companies by Internal Audit on the basis of a risk-oriented audit plan.\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-39-0\"></span>RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT\n\nThe early identification of risks and opportunities and the steps to be taken in response are an important element of corporate governance at Jungheinrich. The basic principles and courses of action are defined as part of the risk management system in a Group guideline and a risk management manual, which are continually checked and developed further.\n\n#### Objectives of the risk management system and risk culture\n\nRisks and opportunities are fundamental components of all business activities. In a complex, global market in particular there are a number of external as well as internal influences on Jungheinrich's business activities. The objective of the company's risk management system is to recognise and evaluate the risks as well as the opportunities arising from these influences so that adequate control measures can be initiated. Another aim – in addition to creating transparency on risks and opportunities – is to actively promote a corporate culture with a consistent understanding of risks and opportunities throughout the Group.\n\nRisks and opportunities include all future developments or events that could lead to a negative (risk) or positive (opportunity) deviation from targets. The Jungheinrich risk management system is based on the points of the auditing standard 981 of the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW) and it is integrated into a binding Group-wide guideline that is available to all employees.\n\n#### Risk management system organisation and processes\n\nThe Jungheinrich Board of Management is responsible for the development and maintenance of an effective risk management system. Group Risk Management, a unit assigned to Corporate Controlling, defines and develops the risk management system's methods and processes on an ongoing basis and is also responsible for Group-wide quality assurance, coordination and analyses. All those involved with risk management processes continually receive training in the form of courses, at information events and through communication initiatives about the risk management system requirements, methods and news. The risk management system covers the length of the organisational structure at the Jungheinrich Group including decentral organisational units.\n\n#### Identification\n\nThe managers of the central and decentral organisational units are responsible for identifying, evaluating and managing risks and opportunities. In addition to identifying risks and opportunities at regular management meetings, the risk managers perform a comprehensive inventory of risks and opportunities three times a year during the planning and projection processes. The risks and opportunities identified are assigned to predetermined risk areas that are based on the business environment and Jungheinrich's corporate targets.\n\n#### Evaluation and management\n\nRisks and opportunities are evaluated based on planned business development or the current projection. In addition to the current financial year, the period under consideration for evaluating the risks and opportunities includes the two following financial years. The likelihood of occurrence and the financial impact of the corporate risk on Group EBIT or the profit or loss for risks with a direct impact on the financial result or income taxes is estimated using standardised methods for each of the years considered. The financial impact is considered both before (gross) and after (net) any management measures. Management measures are systematically documented and monitored. Qualitative impacts on reputation, compliance, corporate strategy and operations are also recorded.\n\n#### Analysing risks\n\n1\n\nAll Corporate Controlling organisational units and designated risk managers perform a multi-stage quality assurance process for the risks and opportunities reported in each risk area. This allows the plausibility of the reported risks to be checked and any redundancies or interdependencies to be identified. Finally, the reported risks and opportunities are analysed by corporate risk management for impacts on the Group. Aggregating all substantial risks and opportunities through a stochastic simulation process allows potential impacts on earnings and Group-wide developments, and any interdependencies, to be identified early on. The key figure value at risk (VaR) is determined for the entire risk portfolio with a confidence level of 99 per cent.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Monitoring the Group's risk-bearing capacity\n\nTo evaluate Jungheinrich's ability to bear risks, all risks identified are checked against the risk-bearing capacity, which takes into account both shareholders' equity and cash and cash equivalents. Other early warning indicators serve to continually monitor risk-bearing capacity and early risk detection.\n\n#### Communication\n\nThe findings of risk analyses are reported in the Group Risk Committee, which is attended by the Board of Management. This includes statements on the ability to bear risks, substantial risks and opportunities and potential management measures. Ad-hoc reporting is also used to inform Group risk management and the Board of Management of all probable and highly probable risks and opportunities that would have a moderate impact or higher.\n\n#### Monitoring effectiveness\n\nThe risk and opportunity situation is an integral part of the planning and projections reported to the Supervisory Board by the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board monitors the efficacy of the risk management system and whether risks and opportunities are handled appropriately. The Corporate Compliance, Audit & Data Protection department, as an independent authority, is tasked with checking that the risk management system functions and is effective.\n\n#### Overall assessment of risks and opportunities\n\nThere were no risks identified in the reporting period that could jeopardise the Jungheinrich Group's continued existence.\n\nSupply shortages and delays originating on the procurement side, along with volatility in the cost of materials are less pronounced than in the previous year, but they remain as central risks and can impact production stability through the value chain as well as delivery times to customers. Jungheinrich established a central crisis team and additional local crisis teams in its organisational units and factories in order to identify upcoming risks caused by supply-side shortages at an early stage and keep the impact of these risks as minimal as possible through timely, appropriate and coordinated measures.\n\nDue to Jungheinrich's international operations, cyclical fluctuations involve risks for business development. Economic developments are continually observed and analysed based on regular market analyses for material handling equipment and automation, the competitive environment and capital markets, especially regarding fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates. The objective is to discover information that could be relevant to future order development. Production plans are continually adapted to incoming orders in order to achieve the best-possible production capacity utilisation. Production capacity risks in the plants have increased in comparison with the previous year due to the rise in uncertainty in economic cycles. Jungheinrich counters the risk of a downturn in business by continually enhancing the Group's product portfolio, expanding the scope of services, further intensifying marketing and sales, offering financing solutions and implementing efficiency measures.\n\nCyber attacks also pose risks that are mitigated through security precautions, particularly the continual and targeted expansion of the information technology security management system. The assessment of the potential impacts of cyber attacks has increased in comparison with the previous year due to an increase in overall threats and a more professional assessment methodology for cyber risks including comprehensive quantitative analysis of various risk scenarios.\n\nThe ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and its humanitarian, political and economic consequences have resulted in diverse risks for the Jungheinrich Group that could develop into the full impairment of the Russian company due to expropriation.\n\nThe risk posed by the potential failure of gas or electricity supplies is lower than in the previous year, not least due to the measures taken to find alternative energy supplies.\n\nTaking into account the external and internal audits of the risk management system and the compliance management system carried out in 2023, no matters became known that would have led the Jungheinrich AG Board of Management to conclude that the risk management system or the compliance management system was not appropriate and effective in all material respects in the 2023 financial year. 1\n\n1\n\nDisclosure unrelated to the management report that is not subject to audit of the financial statements.\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Risk and opportunity situation\n\nThe following table gives an overview of the substantial risks and opportunities and their potential impact on the Jungheinrich Group for the next two financial years as well as the change compared to the previous year. The net impacts of risks and opportunities are presented separately and not offset against each other. Risks and opportunities are aggregated in risk areas at Jungheinrich, with risks classified according to their negative impact on the result based on VaR 99 per cent (loss value) and opportunities according to their positive impact on the result based on VaR 20 per cent (gain value). The prior-year comparison presented here refers to a change in the assignment to the impact class as of a minimum change of €2 million.\n\nRisks and opportunities are divided into the following impact classes based on their net impact:\n\n| Very low  | ≤ €0.5 million                 |\n|-----------|--------------------------------|\n| Low       | > €0.5 million to ≤ €2 million |\n| Moderate  | > €2

cent)\n\n1 The prior-year comparison presented here refers to a change in the assignment to the impact class as of a minimum change of €2 million.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe impact of the individual risks or opportunities are assigned to impact classes based on maximum value.\n\nThe description of the probability of occurrence for individual risks and opportunities is based on the following classes:\n\n| Improbable      | ≤ 25 per cent                  |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n| Possible        | > 25 per cent to ≤ 50 per cent |\n| Probable        | > 50 per cent to ≤ 75 per cent |\n| Highly probable | > 75 per cent to 100 per cent  |\n\nThe risk areas are described separately in the following section. The gain value is shown if it has changed compared to the previous year. Material individual risks and opportunities with moderate or higher net impacts from €5 million upwards in each risk area are also described.\n\n#### Operational risks and opportunities\n\n#### After-sales\n\nThe risk area after-sales consists of risks and opportunities that could occur as part of our work with customers during the product life cycle. Jungheinrich continues to class the impact of after-sales risks as moderate overall.\n\nThe fundamental risk of potential supplier failures or delays due to material availability in spare parts operations remains but has reduced in comparison with the previous year. There is also a risk that material costs will rise further and these costs cannot be passed on to the customer. In order to avoid supplier risks in spare parts operations, despite the tense conditions on the market, regular task force meetings monitor the risk. A detailed description of the supplier risks is presented below in the procurement risk area. Materials are also stockpiled to ensure that materials are available despite any volatility.\n\n#### Procurement\n\nRisks and opportunities in the field of procurement include disruptions in the supply chain and fluctuations in the cost of raw materials, equipment and energy. Overall, procurement risks continue to be classified as very high.\n\nGlobal supply chains continually stabilised over the course of the year, nevertheless, general deterioration of the alreadytense market situation and trade restrictions along with potential supply chain disruptions due to production and logistics restrictions can result in materials shortages and a collapse in supply. Moreover, supplier insolvencies, cyber attacks on suppliers and geopolitical developments, especially with regard to China and the recent escalation in the Middle East conflict, represent further risks. The probability of occurrence has fallen in comparison with the previous year, and is considered improbable. In extreme scenarios the impacts remain very high and may lead to production downtimes and significantly higher costs for alternative procurement or necessary services.\n\nTo take preventive action against supply chain disruptions, Jungheinrich relies on control systems as part of its consistent supplier management system to monitor and analyse the financial health of the suppliers, the stability of the supply chains and transport routes. Supply chain management also analyses developments in the supply chains on a daily basis in order to react early to prevent possible materials shortages and developments in materials supply to guarantee the stability of the global supply chains to the greatest possible extent. Supply reach is also continually determined and alternative procurement sources and products are introduced.\n\nDetails with regard to a potential gas shortage or an undersupply of electricity grids are detailed in the extreme events risk area [ [page](#page-45-0) 44 ].\n\nUncertainties also remain with regard to energy price developments and the overall inflation trend. This is particularly evident in relation to the volatility of the gas and energy markets. Significant price increases, including those affecting alternative energy sources, are accepted in order to avoid a supply-side collapse in production. This concerns both the supply of energy to Jungheinrich's own sites and to suppliers' passing on higher energy costs to Jungheinrich. This may result in moderate impacts from both risks and opportunities.\n\nThe price of raw materials on the global market remains volatile, resulting in uncertainties when planning material costs. Procurement uncertainties for production materials and spare parts in the reporting period primarily affect electronic components, lithium-ion batteries and steel.\n\n#### Digital products\n\nJungheinrich develops and distributes digital products, such as the warehouse management system (Jungheinrich WMS), steering software for conveyor systems and other digital solutions for material handling equipment. Jungheinrich operates a cloud-based fleet management system (Jungheinrich FMS) to connect the material handling equipment. Risks and opportunities from the development of software applications for mobile robots are also included and assessed in the digital products risk area. Risks from digital products are again classified as moderate.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\nbined management repo\n\n<span id=\"page-43-0\"></span>A certified Information Security Management System in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001 has been put in place to enable the continuous improvement and maintenance of information security. The certification covers a large part of the development, maintenance and – insofar as it is Jungheinrich's responsibility – the operation of the end-customer software solutions. Further details on this certification are given in the information technology risk area (see below). Jungheinrich received a successful assessment according to the industry standard TISAX (Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange) in November 2022.\n\nJungheinrich is also working continually on the expansion of its digital products. This includes the ongoing expansion of expertise in the field, which is accompanied by the Group's central functions.\n\n#### Research and development\n\nThe research and development risk area covers both risks and opportunities from development projects and results. Overall, risks from research and development continue to be classified as moderate.\n\nOne fundamental risk exists in patent disputes; therefore innovations from research and development are protected by patents. Observance is monitored systematically and centrally and legal steps are taken whenever necessary.\n\n#### Information technology\n\nRisks in the field of information technology cover the general stability of the information infrastructure and include possible risks to information security and in particular the resilience of IT systems to cyber attacks. Overall, information technology risks have increased and are classified as very high.\n\nThe potential impact of the Group-wide risk of cyber attacks can be far-reaching if availability is affected, or confidentiality is breached or the integrity of information and IT systems is threatened due to security violations. Information technology systems are constantly reviewed and refined in order to limit IT risks and ensure that business processes are carried out securely, reliably and efficiently. Besides its effective IT emergency management system, Jungheinrich uses industry standards, redundant network connections and a mirror computing centre with a view to reducing failures of application-critical systems and infrastructure components. Jungheinrich mitigates the risk of unauthorised access to corporate data and of tampering with or sabotaging IT systems with Group-wide information security standards, the use of modern backup systems and regular reviews of the protective measures' effectiveness. Jungheinrich's Information Security Management System (ISMS) has been certified since November 2021 in key parts of the organisation in accordance with the international standard ISO/IEC 27001:2013. The scope was again expanded in November 2022. The above-mentioned measures are supported effectively by modern monitoring and analysis systems and are constantly monitored and developed by a dedicated cyber security team. Furthermore, the state of cyber security for the areas of IT, production and digital products is subject to an annual external maturity assessment. The probability of substantial damage occurring continues to be classed as improbable due to the comprehensive measures to mitigate the risk. The assessment of the potential impacts of cyber attacks has increased in comparison with the previous year. This is due to an increase in overall threats and a more professional assessment methodology for cyber risks including comprehensive quantitative analysis of various risk scenarios. The range of potential impacts is very large, however, ranging from moderate to very high in extreme scenarios.\n\nThe company is implementing more than 80 projects as part of the DEEP programme (Digital End-to-End Processes) for digital transformation and efficiency gains. Detailed control mechanisms are applied throughout the DEEP programme to reduce uncertainties in the planned project costs. These include weekly operational steering meetings, regular steering committee meetings and detailed programme controlling. Fluctuation in the planned project costs are still considered possible and may lead to low opportunities and moderate risks.\n\n#### Production\n\nRisks and opportunities in production relate to deviations in the product manufacturing process, such as a deviation from the capacity utilisation of production machinery or the planned production volume. Overall, the impacts of production risks have increased and are classified as very high. At the same time, the opportunities have increased slightly and classification has moved from low to moderate.\n\nThe stability of production is largely dependent on supply chains. Risks in the supply chains, such as the availability of raw materials, possible cyber attacks or supplier insolvency all constitute risks to the product manufacturing process. Supply chain management therefore analyses developments in supply chains on a daily basis in order to be able to initiate countermeasures early on. This significantly reduces the probability of production downtimes, but as in the previous year remains possible. The potential impacts of production downtime and the resulting number of units produced being below forecasts ranges from very low in the best-case scenario to very high in extreme situations.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\nut Jungheinrich\n\nProduction plans are continually adapted to incoming orders in order to guarantee the best-possible production capacity utilisation. Uncertainties in the incoming orders that can be achieved lead in turn to uncertainties in the unit production numbers. Fluctuation in the number of units produced can have a very high impact when it comes to risks and a moderate impact when it comes to opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, in improbable scenarios, production may be severely affected by interruptions to operations (for example, fires). However, comprehensive preventive safeguarding steps as well as insurance cover in the event of loss mean the impact of this risk is only classified as very low.\n\nRisks of a failure in the power or gas supply also affect the product manufacturing process. These risks are assessed in detail in the extreme events risk area [ [page](#page-45-0) 44 ].\n\n#### Product quality and safety\n\nProduct quality and safety risks cover risks and opportunities from expected deviations in product quality and the associated obligations. Compared to the previous year, the classification of risks has been increased to moderate.\n\nProduct quality obligations are associated with warranties and guarantees as well as additional expenses for goodwill gestures. The obligations also include adhering to applicable standards. In order to manage risks, product risk management observes individual cases closely and uses these to find opportunities to minimise risks, for instance through insurance policies, technical analyses and legal action.\n\n#### Project business\n\nIn relation to the project business, risks and opportunities especially revolve around staying within budget, sticking to schedule and to the agreed product specifications. Overall, project business risks are still classified as moderate.\n\nFor complex, wide-ranging, international projects in particular, there can be some deviation from the project targets or promised product specifications, which in turn can lead to additional expenses for corrections or any compensation payments from breaches of contact. Jungheinrich counters this risk through targeted project risk management, which aims to recognise, manage and systematically monitor project risks at an early stage.\n\n#### Revenue and sales\n\nThe risk area revenue and sales consists of risks and opportunities from the sale and rental of Jungheinrich trucks and associated services. Overall, revenue and sales risks have increased slightly in comparison with the previous year and are classified as very high. Opportunities in the risk area revenue and sales have been downgraded in comparison with the previous year and are classified as low.\n\nThe volatile market situation on both the procurement and sales sides and the general uncertainty about the future economic situation, especially in the eurozone, entail risks in the forecasting of incoming orders. These developments are continually analysed so that appropriate steps can be taken at an early stage. Nevertheless, fluctuations in the forecast number of incoming orders can have a moderate impact on both the risk side and the opportunity side. Additional knock-on effects from changes in incoming orders on production capacity utilisation are assigned to the production risk area [ [page](#page-43-0) 42 ].\n\nThe range of products and services are continually reviewed on the sales market and potential new customer solutions are added. Temporary sales promotion measures have been and are being developed and implemented to protect incoming orders. The result is better market penetration, increased customer loyalty and the incoming orders required for optimum utilisation of the plants. Nevertheless, uncertainty remains as to whether the measures can be implemented on the markets. Risks are deemed possible. The range of potential impacts is very large, however, ranging from very low to very high in extreme scenarios.\n\n#### Customs\n\nThe customs risk area includes risks and opportunities that could arise in relation to customs tariffs for goods. The company has established operational processes for all customs and export control issues. These processes are monitored and continuously developed by a central customs department. Customs risks are closely monitored by Jungheinrich and are still classed as very low.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-45-0\"></span>Sustainability risks and opportunities\n\n#### Extreme events\n\nRisks resulting from extreme events relate to unusual events, such as natural disasters, pandemics or acute geopolitical conflicts, and their consequences. The severity can lead to strategic risks and opportunities that would impact all areas of the company. The risks arising directly from the Russia-Ukraine war have also been included in the extreme events risk area. The risks in the extreme events risk area are still classified as very high overall.\n\nSince the beginning of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, Jungheinrich has created a central crisis team in order to identify risks at an early stage and keep the impact of these risks as minimal as possible through timely, appropriate and coordinated measures. Local and topic-specific crisis teams also analyse various scenarios and underlying legal conditions regularly so that the Group is as well prepared as possible to face the constantly changing situation. The Jungheinrich Group has subsidiaries in Russia and Ukraine.\n\nOne focus of the measures of the crisis team is protecting the staff and their families. The war and its humanitarian, political and economic consequences result in diverse risks for the Jungheinrich Group.\n\nThe embargoes and sanctions imposed by the European Union and the USA and Russia's counter-sanctions have resulted in risks for the Russian Jungheinrich company that are classed as moderate in improbable scenarios. These may develop into risks resulting in full impairment through expropriation. This improbable scenario is assessed as having a very high impact.\n\nIn Ukraine, the risk is primarily a humanitarian one. The focus is on protecting and supporting Jungheinrich employees and their families as well as the local population to the best of the Company's ability.\n\nSanctions and counter-sanctions as well as geopolitical crises such as the current escalation in the Middle East conflict may lead to disruptions in the supply of materials or energy to Jungheinrich or Jungheinrich suppliers. The energy supply situation in Europe has eased in comparison with the previous year. The risk of gas supply no longer being sufficient for production and the associated production disruptions is assessed as improbable and may lead to very high impacts in extreme scenarios. An undersupply of power grids may also cause potential disruptions in production. This risk is classified as improbable, but may lead to high to very high impacts in extreme scenarios. Jungheinrich has put in place measures to reduce plants' dependence on electricity and natural gas and continues to expand these measures. Jungheinrich is also in constant contact with production material suppliers.\n\nRisks from the coronavirus pandemic remain on a lower level. The coronavirus pandemic and potential new pandemics continue to pose a risk with regard to individual markets and in terms of local infection figures, which has an impact on Jungheinrich's business activities and global trade and supply chains.\n\n#### Climate change and environmental protection\n\nJungheinrich supports various climate change mitigation and environmental protection measures and has enshrined key sustainability objectives in Strategy 2025+. Risks and opportunities in the risk area of climate change and environmental protection continue to be classified as very low overall.\n\nJungheinrich's sustainability strategy consists of six initiatives that are backed by concrete targets and give consideration to economic, environmental and social aspects.\n\nThe defined targets set out Jungheinrich's ambition to reduce emissions and preserve the environment and resources. At the same time, the initiatives promote the expansion of sustainable products and solutions and improve the health and safety of employees.\n\nThe implementation and achievement of these targets are crucial for the Jungheinrich Group. Failure will impact Jungheinrich's reputation. In response, targeted measures have been introduced at the level of the initiatives. As the sustainability strategy covers risk areas beyond just climate change and environmental protection, the measures also have an impact on the social and compliance risk areas. Jungheinrich considers itself to be well positioned to continue making important contributions to protecting the environment and the climate.\n\nFurther information can be found in the combined separate non-financial report in accordance with the CSR Directive Implementation Act [ [page](#page-55-0) 54 ].\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Personnel and social\n\nThe personnel and social risk area includes risks and opportunities that have a direct impact on the availability, quality and costs of personnel, occupational safety and compliance with human rights. Overall, personnel and social risks continue to be classified as moderate. Opportunities can arise from fluctuations in the planned personnel costs. Opportunities in the risk area personnel and social have been upgraded in comparison with the previous year and are classified as moderate.\n\nPersonnel risks may arise if a company fails to recruit or retain qualified employees in sufficient numbers. This can impact the achievement of strategic and operational targets. In order to recruit junior engineers and IT specialists, both of which are vital to Jungheinrich, the company maintains good contacts with universities through university marketing. Jungheinrich responds to the fierce competition for skilled labour and executives and mitigates the associated risk of a loss of know-how caused by staff turnover by offering attractive qualification options and a performance-based remuneration system. A high number of trainee positions will be maintained or even expanded Group-wide in order to ensure that all future needs for skilled workers can be met. Jungheinrich employs temporary workers in order to avoid capacity utilisation risks and uses location-specific flexible working time accounts. The company also operates three Business Service Centers (BSC) in Spain, Romania and Croatia with highly trained, globally aligned experts. Uncertainties in personnel costs may result in moderate impacts from both risks and opportunities.\n\nThe continual increase in regulatory requirements with an emphasis on sustainability and human rights, as well as other social aspects along the value chain, poses risks in the event of non-compliance. Continuous monitoring of regulatory changes and compliance with existing requirements is essential for the Jungheinrich Group. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements can result in penalties. Any deviation can have a negative impact on Jungheinrich's reputation and impair its strategic goals or operational processes. In addition to the Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains (LkSG), considerable relevance in this respect has been identified in the Batteries Act 2, Material Compliance, the EU taxonomy and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.\n\nIn order to comply with the LkSG, the Group supply chain risk analysis, put in place in 2019, was revised in 2022 and important risk factors were added, particularly those focused on strengthening the attention paid to human rights. In addition, the schedule of legal provisions database, including the monitoring of the measures and initiatives derived therefrom, was expanded for the LkSG and for all other relevant regulations. Jungheinrich therefore considers itself well positioned to comply with the regulatory requirements for sustainability.\n\n#### Financial risks and opportunities\n\n#### Financial services\n\nRisks associated with financial services arise particularly from the leasing business and include risks and opportunities from changing residual values of leased items and the corresponding interest rate. Financial services risks continue to be deemed to be moderate overall. Detailed rules governing the identification and assessment of risks are documented in Group-wide guidelines and the financial service companies' internal process descriptions.\n\nThe risks and opportunities arising from the resale of truck returns from the financial services business are borne by the operating sales units. The residual value guarantees are calculated on the basis of a conservative uniform Group standard for maximum permissible residual values. The residual values of all individual contracts are subjected to a quarterly evaluation using the central financial services contracts database on the basis of their current fair value. If the originally calculated residual value is above the current fair value and the end of the term of the contract, this risk is appropriately taken into account depending on the classification of the long-term customer contract by reducing the carrying amounts for \"trucks for lease from financial services\" or \"receivables from financial services\" in profit or loss.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe refinancing risk is limited by applying the principle of matching maturities and interest rates for customer and refinancing agreements (no risk of a change in interest rates during the term of the contract) when refinancing financial service agreements. The \"Financial Services\" segment's Group-wide structural and procedural organisation ensures management of completed financial service agreements with a correlating financing structure and form through domestic and foreign refinancing banks. Moreover, an established financing platform enables us to obtain refinancing on the capital market. Sufficient lines of credit are at the company's disposal for financing the new business.\n\nFor refinancing, agreements were reached with the financing banks at an early stage in order to react flexibly to market and customer requirements. As at the balance sheet date, the scope of the required customer-specific payment agreements was negligibly small in light of this. The refinancing lines remained available to Jungheinrich in the reporting year as they were at the end of the previous financial year.\n\nCustomer defaults on receivables, insolvencies and free early terminations of contracts with break clauses in the financial services business remain at a low level.\n\n#### Foreign currency\n\nDue to its international activities and affiliates as well as dynamic developments on the financial markets, Jungheinrich is subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Overall, foreign currency risks continue to be classified as moderate. Jungheinrich uses financial instruments such as currency forwards, currency swaps and currency options to manage foreign currency risks.\n\n#### Debt defaults\n\nThe debt default risk area covers risks arising from potential debt defaults on customer payments. These risks are still classed as low.\n\nJungheinrich protects itself against debt default risks by using an IT-based system to permanently monitor customers' creditworthiness and to regularly analyse outstanding receivables and their structure. The majority of foreign revenue generated from business with third parties is covered by credit insurance policies. Comprehensive system-reported creditworthiness checks performed before contracts are concluded, as well as revolving inspections during the terms of agreements, help keep default levels on receivables from customers very low. Forklift trucks prematurely recovered from customers are handed over to the \"Intralogistics\" segment's operational sales units for marketing. The return conditions are determined centrally.\n\n#### Financing and capital investment\n\nFinancing and capital investment risks include all risks and opportunities that can arise when borrowing or investing capital. Risks in this risk area continue to be classified as moderate overall.\n\nJungheinrich's good credit rating and solid statement of financial position have a positive influence on obtaining credit. In addition to the high levels of cash and cash equivalents, confirmed medium-term credit facilities and shortterm credit lines safeguard the Group's financial flexibility and liquidity. The confirmed credit facilities had only been partially used in the \"Intralogistics\" segment as at the balance sheet date.\n\nIn addition to bilateral financing, Jungheinrich can also obtain finance through the capital market, independent of banks. The instruments employed include a commercial paper programme in addition to issuing promissory notes. The maturities for the credit lines and existing promissory notes are very spread out, giving the company plenty of long-term leeway for arranging financing. None of the financial agreements are subject to financial covenants.\n\nThe company's cash and cash equivalents and existing credit agreements ensure that it can always fulfil its payment obligations. There is, therefore, no liquidity risk. The central cash and currency management for the Jungheinrich Group enables the Group-wide, international provision of financial resources at the best possible interest and currency exchange rates, and cash flow management for domestic and foreign Group companies.\n\nThroughout the Group, Jungheinrich takes a conservative approach to investment and generally only invests in certain asset classes with flawless credit ratings and the option of liquidating its investments at any time. Part of the liquidity is invested in a special fund. The value of the capital investments held by Jungheinrich is subject to the normal fluctuations on the international capital markets. The severity of the fluctuation can have a moderate impact on the opportunities side and high on the risk side, depending on the point in time of the sale.\n\nFurther information regarding financial instruments can be found in the Jungheinrich AG consolidated financial statements [ [page](#page-155-0) 154 ].\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nImpairment risks are constantly monitored by Corporate Finance. This applies in particular to goodwill from company acquisitions, which has an indefinite useful life and is therefore not subject to amortisation. Goodwill is subjected to an impairment test in accordance with IAS 36 at least once a year, or more frequently if there are indications of a reduction in value. In addition, all assets that fall within the scope of IAS 36 are reviewed as part of an asset impairment test if there are such indications of a reduction in value.\n\n#### Taxes\n\nTax risks continue to be considered to be low overall. They arise from the constantly changing requirements under tax legislation. Risks also arise when national tax authorities deviate from the international basic rules agreed between tax authorities with regards to cross-border matters. The risk increases when updated authority viewpoints are to be applied retroactively.\n\n#### Legal and compliance risks and opportunities\n\n#### Compliance and data protection\n\nThe compliance and data protection risk area covers all risks related to non-compliance with laws and general compliance regulations, especially corruption, fraud and money laundering prevention and data protection regulations. Risks in the compliance and data protection area are still assessed as high overall.\n\nIn both the valid Group guidelines, which apply to all employees, and the company's Code of Conduct, Jungheinrich has set out regulations and measures for the prevention of corruption, fraud and money laundering risks. Compliance with these requirements is regularly reviewed by internal audit. Further information about the Code of Conduct can be found in the combined separate non-financial report in accordance with the CSR Directive Implementation Act [ [page](#page-55-0) 54 ].\n\nJungheinrich is subject to the risk of fines in the area of data protection due to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These are addressed through a number of measures. Group guidelines are continually updated to reflect new data protection regulations. The necessary data protection agreement principles with suppliers and other business partners were also amended. Jungheinrich also ensured compliance with the requirements by implementing stricter technical and organisational measures. The data protection challenges in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, in particular due to the increase in mobile working, have been taken into account through corresponding instructions and recommendations. The Board of Management obligates all employees to comply with data protection regulations. Regular Group-wide training is in place. The data protection management system is continually monitored and will be improved further. Risks of fines due to a violation of the EU GDPR are assessed as improbable. The range of potential impacts is very large, however, ranging from very low to very high in the extreme scenario.\n\nThe compliance risk assessment was analysed in 2022 and optimisations were initiated in 2023 with an emphasis on close interaction between the risk management system and compliance risk assessment. The organisation and processes of the risk management system and close dovetailing between compliance risk assessment and the risk management system facilitates a clear reconciliation between the two systems. Further information about the compliance management system can be found in the combined separate non-financial report in accordance with the CSR Directive Implementation Act [ [page](#page-55-0) 54 ].\n\n#### Legal\n\nThe Jungheinrich Group's companies are exposed to the legal risks that are customary in commercial enterprises, in particular regarding the liability for alleged non-compliance with contractual obligations or public law and for allegedly faulty products. Risks in the legal risk area have increased slightly against the previous year and are classed as low.\n\nMaterial general contract risks are eliminated by applying Group-wide policies whenever possible. In addition, central support and legal advice is available to the individual departments for material contracts and other transactions with significant legal aspects. Appropriate provisions that are in line with the respective probability of occurrence are established to cover potential financial burdens resulting from risks relating to lawsuits. The Group has adequate insurance coverage for claims filed against Group companies on grounds of allegedly faulty products.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-49-0\"></span>Forecast report\n\n#### Anticipated global economic growth hampered by geopolitical tensions\n\nThe IMF anticipates that global economic growth will amount to 3.1 per cent as in the previous year in 2024. The main reasons stated for this forecast are the central banks' restrictive monetary policies and withdrawal of fiscal support. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East in particular pose a risk for further growth in the opinion of the IMF. Slightly slower growth than in the previous year is expected for China and the USA. USA GDP is expected to climb by 2.1 per cent (2023: 2.5 per cent). An increase in economic output of 4.6 per cent (2023: 5.2 per cent) is forecast for the Chinese economy.\n\nThe IMF believes economic growth in the eurozone in 2024 will be determined by rising private consumption and catch-up effects as a result of the rise of energy prices and the slowdown in inflation. A recovery in GDP growth of 0.9 per cent is forecast for this region (2023: 0.5 per cent).\n\nThe IMF forecasts a slight rise in economic growth in Germany (0.5 per cent), following the 0.3 per cent contraction in the previous year. After growth of 0.8 per cent in the previous year, French GDP is also expected to perform slightly better in 2023 with 1.0 per cent growth. As in the previous year, for Italy an economic growth of 0.7 per cent is anticipated. For the UK, too, the economic growth of 0.6 per cent is expected to be along the lines of that seen in the previous year (0.5 per cent).\n\n#### Growth rates for selected economic regions\n\n| Gross domestic product in % | 2024 forecast |\n|-----------------------------|---------------|\n| World                       | 3.3           |\n| USA                         | 2.1           |\n| China                       | 4.6           |\n| Eurozone                    | 0.9           |\n| Germany                     | 0.5           |\n\nSource: International Monetary Fund (as of 30 January 2024).\n\n#### 2024 incoming orders target: €5.2 billion to €5.8 billion\n\nDespite a difficult market environment, we expect incoming orders to range between €5.2 billion and €5.8 billion in 2024 (2023: €5.2 billion). Providing supply chains remain stable and in light of the current interest rates and inflation, we anticipate Group revenue to range between €5.3 billion and €5.9 billion (2023: €5.5 million). This is based on the assumption that the geopolitical situation will not deteriorate.\n\n#### 2024 EBIT range: €420 million to €470 million\n\nWe estimate EBIT to be between €420 million and €470 million in the current financial year (2023: €430 million). Already in 2023, the Board of Management initiated measures to increase earnings that are bearing fruit in the current year and are countering especially rising personnel costs. Negative effects from purchase price allocations for the acquisitions made in 2023 of €13 million and from variable remuneration of €11 million have also been taken into account. We anticipate an EBIT ROS of between 7.6 per cent and 8.4 per cent (2023: 7.8 per cent).\n\nBased on current assumptions, EBT is expected to reach a value between €380 million and €430 million (2023: €399 million). We forecast EBT ROS to be between 6.9 per cent and 7.7 per cent (2023: 7.2 per cent). The ROCE for the 2024 financial year should be between 14.5 per cent and 17.5 per cent (2023: 15.9 per cent). We have set a figure of over €200 million (2023: €15 million) for free cash flow.\n\nDue to competition law, actual and target figures on the equipment ratio of lithium-ion batteries are not reported.\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\nForecast report\n\n#### General statement concerning the Jungheinrich Group's anticipated development\n\nWe assume that the geopolitical situation will not deteriorate further in the 2024 financial year and that economic conditions will improve in the second half of 2024 at the earliest.\n\nOur main goal is to achieve a solid EBIT ROS and EBT ROS. Beyond this, our focus is also on boosting ROCE and free cash flow.\n\nWe will continue to focus on our strategic fields of action automation, digitalisation, energy systems, efficiency, global footprint and sustainability. A key focus here will be on establishing the Board of Management division for automation and the expansion of the Group's automation portfolio. The post-merger integration of Storage Solutions and Magazino is also being driven forward. M&A activities will be continued to expand the Group's global footprint and digital transformation.\n\nOpportunities continue to be presented by the intact and growing global trends that will push intralogistics, digital products and services, e-commerce-oriented portfolios and electric mobility and automation offers.\n\nNegative impacts on revenue, EBIT and EBT are a possibility in an unchanged difficult market environment, particularly in the Group's European core markets, and as a result of high exchange rate fluctuations or persistently strong interest rate hikes.\n\nOur business model and our resilient customer structure, combined with a sound balance sheet and liquidity, enables us to continue implementing the Strategy 2025+ even in the event that economic and market developments fall short of expectations.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\ncombined management\n\n# <span id=\"page-51-0\"></span>Jungheinrich AG (HGB)\n\nThe annual financial statements of Jungheinrich AG follow the provisions of the German Commercial Code (HGB), while the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\n\nJungheinrich AG is a management holding company and, in addition to the Group's central functions, also comprises Corporate Research & Development and Corporate Real Estate Management. As the parent company, it holds shares directly and indirectly in both domestic and foreign subsidiaries. Jungheinrich AG especially has direct business relations with the subsidiaries in Germany. The positive annual results of the subsidiaries managed in the legal form of AG & Co. KG are recognised in the same phase in the annual financial statements of Jungheinrich AG and reported under income from affiliates. In addition, there are some profit and loss transfer agreements with domestic corporations whose income and expenses are reported under separate items in the statement of profit or loss. The income from associates consisting of these three components are the material control parameter for Jungheinrich AG.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, Jungheinrich AG had a total of 1,443 employees, including 153 trainees and apprentices (previous year: 1,320 employees, including 151 trainees and apprentices).\n\nThe overall economic and industry-related conditions correspond to those of the Group as described in the economic report [ [page](#page-27-0) 26 ].\n\n#### BUSINESS TREND AND EARNINGS POSITION\n\nThe earnings position of Jungheinrich AG is determined by the business trend of the operating subsidiaries in Germany and abroad as well as the resulting income from affiliates. Jungheinrich AG's income from affiliates exceeded expectations in 2023, amounting to €362 million following €207 million in the previous year. The reason for this was the improvement in operating subsidiaries' business developments, primarily through appropriate measures to safeguard margins, which more than compensated for the increase in costs due to personnel expansion, tariff effects and increases in the cost of materials. Earnings from profit and loss transfer agreements increased by €120 million, taking the figure to €216 million. There was an appreciation in value in the carrying amount of an investment under financial assets in the amount of €37 million in connection with the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group. The recognition of profits of subsidiaries in the same period resulted in an increase of €35 million to €146 million.\n\nJungheinrich AG's revenue in the 2023 financial year amounted to €261 million, compared to €259 million in the previous year. It includes remuneration for services, revenue from the rental of real estate and revenue from licensing agreements. Revenue from remuneration for services increased due to expansion in business volumes in the domestic operating companies in comparison with the previous year from €156 million to €160 million. Revenue from the rental of real estate to domestic Group companies of €39 million was similar to the previous year (€38 million). Revenue from licence agreements was 4 per cent lower at €63 million compared to the previous year's figure of €65 million.\n\nOther operating income increased significantly from €94 million in the previous year to €164 million in the reporting year. This resulted from compensation payments received on the basis of transfer pricing adjustments of foreign companies of €51 million (previous year: €36 million). Due to the positive performance of the German production plants, income from adjustments amounted to €86 million (previous year: €42 million). Furthermore, other operating income includes cost transfers to affiliated companies of €16 million (previous year: €12 million).\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\nJungheinrich AG's expenses developed as follows:\n\n| in € million                                                            | 2023 | 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Cost of materials                                                       | 4    | 4    |\n| Personnel expenses                                                      | 154  | 132  |\n| Depreciation and amortisation<br>of fixed assets                        | 26   | 25   |\n| Other operating expenses                                                | 389  | 317  |\n| Depreciation on financial assets and<br>securities under current assets | 4    | 4    |\n\nThe cost of materials mainly includes the energy costs for properties. Personnel expenses and other operating expenses include the administrative costs of the holding company and the central divisions. The increase in personnel expenses by €22 million resulted in part from the higher average number of employees (measured in number of employees, excluding trainees and apprentices) of 1,127 in 2022 by 92 to 1,219 employees in the 2023 financial year, the tariff increase, higher bonuses and the increase in pension liabilities.\n\nOther operating expenses increased by €72 million from €317 million in the previous year to €389 million. The main reason for the increase was a €45 million rise in charges for external services, of which €22 million relates to IT services. R&D expenditure also rose by €19 million to €137 million (previous year: €118 million). This was mainly caused by the use of services provided by affiliated companies with higher development volumes.\n\nThe earnings trend of Jungheinrich AG in the reporting period was thus as follows:\n\n| in € million                       | 2023 | 2022 |\n|------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Earnings before interest and taxes | 213  | 78   |\n| Net interest                       | 13   | -3   |\n| Earnings before taxes              | 227  | 75   |\n| Taxes on income and other taxes    | -22  | -35  |\n| Net income                         | 249  | 110  |\n\nTable contains rounding differences.\n\nEarnings before taxes increased by €152 million to €227 million. The effective tax expense rose accordingly. This was more than compensated for by the tax allocations made by the subsidiaries to Jungheinrich AG. This resulted in overall tax income of €22 million (previous year: €35 million).\n\nStable net income for the year was forecast for the reporting year compared to the 2022 financial year. Jungheinrich AG closed the 2023 financial year with a higher net profit of €249 million compared to the previous year (€110 million). This was due to the better than expected operating results of the subsidiaries. In accordance with Section 58, Paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), €124 million of the net profit for the year was transferred to other retained earnings.\n\n#### Capital expenditure\n\nAdditions to fixed assets amounted to €63 million in the reporting period and were thus significantly above the previous year's figure of €24 million. This was the result of acquiring the remaining shares in Magazino and the subsequent transfer of product technology totalling €44 million. As at the balance sheet date, Jungheinrich AG's capital expenditure commitments amounted to €2 million. Capital expenditure was financed with the company's own resources.\n\nJungheinrich acquired all remaining shares in the robotics specialist Magazino in August 2023. This caused the carrying amount of the portfolio company to go up by €19 million to €28 million.\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Financial and asset position\n\nAs the parent company of the Group, Jungheinrich AG is responsible for the financial management of the Group and ensures the availability of sufficient financial resources. Further disclosures are included in the description of the principles and objectives of financial management [ [page](#page-30-0) 29 ].\n\nThe asset structure of Jungheinrich AG is as follows:\n\n| in € million                          | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2022   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Non-current assets                    | 787          | 758          |\n| Receivables from affiliated companies | 1,019        | 705          |\n| Bank balances and securities          | 465          | 337          |\n| Other assets                          | 51           | 51           |\n| <b>Balance sheet total</b>            | <b>2,322</b> | <b>1,851</b> |\n| in € million                          | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2022   |\n| Shareholders' equity                  | 1,366        | 1,186        |\n| Provisions for pensions               | 38           | 37           |\n| Other provisions                      | 58           | 47           |\n| Liabilities due to banks              | 551          | 320          |\n| Liabilities to affiliated companies   | 277          | 227          |\n| Other liabilities                     | 32           | 34           |\n| Balance sheet total                   | 2,322        | 1,851        |\n\nThe increase of €314 million in receivables from affiliated companies resulted from the higher claims of Jungheinrich AG compared to the previous year from the provision of cash and cash equivalents to Group companies as part of central liquidity management and from adjustments.\n\nThe increase in bank balances and securities of €128 million to €465 million in the 2023 financial year arose from an increase in time deposits of €158 million, which was partially offset by a reduction in securities of €23 million to €184 million and a €7 million decline in sight deposits to a total of €43 million.\n\nThe capital structure of Jungheinrich AG is as follows:\n\nThe shareholders' equity of Jungheinrich AG amounted to €1,366 million as at the balance sheet date and was thus €180 million higher than in the previous year (€1,186 million). The net income for the year of €249 million was offset by the dividend payments of €68 million for the previous financial year. As a result of the marked increase in total assets, the equity ratio fell to 59 per cent (previous year: 64 per cent).\n\nOther provisions in the reporting year included the present value of a contingent purchase price payment in the amount of €11 million (previous year: €19 million) from the agreed earn-out clauses as part of the acquisition of arculus. This decline was caused by the early exit of a beneficiary.\n\nLiabilities due to banks increased by €231 million year-onyear. This was primarily due to the bridge financing in the amount of €300 million that was taken out specifically for the purpose of financing the acquisition of Storage Solutions. On the other hand, current loans totalling €65 million were repaid through money market loans and commercial papers.\n\nAt €277 million, liabilities to affiliated companies were €50 million higher than in the previous year (€227 million) and were related to the increased liquidity of subsidiaries of Jungheinrich AG.\n\n#### Risks and opportunities\n\nJungheinrich AG shares in the risks and opportunities of its subsidiaries. Detailed information is provided in the Risk and opportunity report [ [page](#page-39-0) 38 ].\n\n#### Forecast report\n\nWe report on our prospects and plans for operations in our Forecast report [ [page](#page-49-0) 48 ].\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe environment Society\n\n#### <span id=\"page-71-0\"></span>Preserving biodiversity\n\nTo promote the biodiversity of ecosystems and agricultural systems, Jungheinrich has launched local initiatives around the world and encourages all employees to get involved. Various measures to promote biodiversity are suggested on the internal sustainability platform that can be implemented at the sites: Opening up sealed surfaces, greening walls and roofs, planting easy-maintenance gardens for wild animals on unused outdoor areas, planting domestic and wildlife-friendly plants, setting up insect hotels and beehives and setting out drinking water for animals. Measures are also taken to promote biodiversity when new plants are\n\n# Society\n\n#### EMPLOYEE INITIATIVE\n\nAs a global enterprise with more than 21,000 employees, Jungheinrich has managed to combine growth with the values of a family-owned business and a management culture based on trust in the employees. In this financial year, Jungheinrich introduced Jellow Way, which outlines the attitude to management and cooperation. This mission statement outlines behaviours that support Jungheinrich's ongoing success. Jellow Way presents the corporate culture and serves as a foundation for discussions, feedback and development and as a guide.\n\nSome of the key figures in this chapter relating to employee numbers exclude temporary workers, apprentices and trainees. These figures exclude the companies MIAS USA,\n\nconstructed. The Chomutov plant in Czechia, for instance, is located on a 1.5-hectare green space with native bushes and trees and thus contributes to the promotion of local biodiversity.\n\n#### Hazardous substance management\n\nThe development, production and operation of material handling equipment currently requires the use of hazardous substances that can have an impact on the environment and the health of employees. Strict regulatory requirements must therefore be applied to the handling of hazardous substances. The Group has clear guidelines in place for the use of hazardous substances. There is a defined process for the approval of these substances that includes the double-check principle and the inclusion of work safety and environmental experts. Ongoing hazard assessments, including substitution evaluations, are performed as part of Jungheinrich's active hazardous substance management. During these assessments, possibilities for substituting hazardous substances or processes with alternatives are evaluated (substance, mixture, product or process). This leads to a lower endangerment of the workforce and the environment overall. The employees affected are regularly trained in the safe use of hazardous materials.\n\nMIAS Holding Asia, JFS United Kingdom, JFS Spain and JFS Italy as these companies have fewer than 10 employees. Magazino and Storage Solutions are also excluded as these were only fully consolidated in the current financial year. 98.4 per cent of FTEs at the Jungheinrich Group are covered by these figures. All other key figures relating to FTE employees at the Jungheinrich Group fully include apprentices at all companies.\n\n#### Low staff turnover and long periods of employment\n\nDemographic change and the associated labour shortage are posing significant challenges on the labour market in this decade. As an employer, Jungheinrich strives to retain employees and gain talented young people for the company. Various measures are in place to safeguard the stability of the workforce, such as promoting personal development, supporting a work-life balance, flexible working hours, company pensions and training offers. Indicators of the stability of the workforce is the average period of employment of 9.7 years 1 (2022: 9.8 years), and low staff turnover of 4.9 per cent worldwide 2 (2022: 6.6 per cent) which equates to 1,003 resignations (2022: 1,273). Overall, the number of employees has increased by 1,310 3 against the previous year (2022: 704). At 98.1 per cent 1, 3, a high number of employees have permanent employment contracts (2022: 97.9 per cent).\n\n2 Average number of employees.\n\n3 Employees in FTE.\n\n<sup>1</sup> Reporting date 1 December 2023.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\nSociety\n\n<span id=\"page-72-0\"></span>Jungheinrich cultivates a pleasant work atmosphere and a future-oriented, supportive feedback culture (feedforward) through a new structure for annual employee appraisals, which will be rolled out worldwide. It promotes trust between managers and employees and strengthens Jungheinrich's corporate culture. This exchange supports the development and common understanding of cooperation in the company. Jungheinrich's modern management approach is also defined here. The managers are responsible for creating an environment that promotes innovation, achieves results, has a focussed direction and encourages employees to act on their own initiative.\n\nJungheinrich again gained 22 talented young individuals from around the world this financial year for the Jungheinrich International Graduate Programme. Besides Germany, Italy, Spain and Thailand, the Group also welcomed its first trainees from Denmark, India, Singapore, the Netherlands and Belgium in 2023.\n\n#### Employees by region and gender\n\n|                 | FTE<br>20231,2 | FTE<br>20221,3 | Headcount<br>female<br>20231,2 | Headcount<br>female<br>20221,3 |\n|-----------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Germany         | 8,688          | 8,251          | 1,692                          | 1,587                          |\n| France          | 1,259          | 1,242          | 271                            | 273                            |\n| Italy           | 1,174          | 1,113          | 304                            | 287                            |\n| United Kingdom  | 836            | 781            | 133                            | 131                            |\n| Spain           | 649            | 533            | 147                            | 127                            |\n| Poland          | 621            | 618            | 150                            | 145                            |\n| Rest of Europe  | 4,840          | 4,482          | 1,022                          | 916                            |\n| China           | 840            | 919            | 196                            | 219                            |\n| Other countries | 2,210          | 1,868          | 411                            | 367                            |\n| Total           | 21,117         | 19,807         | 4,326                          | 4,052                          |\n\n#### Fair working conditions and promoting occupational health and safety\n\nJungheinrich has adopted numerous measures to achieve its overarching target of preserving and furthering employees' health and satisfaction. The employee health ratio reached 96.9 per cent in the financial year 2023 (2022: 96.5 per cent). The working conditions at Jungheinrich are flexible wherever possible, which is reflected in the range of offers such as working from home, working remotely and hybrid models. The following measures were taken in 2023:\n\n- Amending employment contracts to allow employees in suitable positions to permanently work remotely for up to 50 per cent of their contracted hours or up to 20 per cent from home.\n- Providing materials for remote working spaces, such as height-adjustable desks and chairs.\n- Equipping meeting rooms for hybrid meetings to enable virtual cooperation.\n- Launch of a Group-wide initiative for the future-oriented design and use of office space to promote both hybrid and analogue collaboration.\n\nMeasures to promote worker health include:\n\n- subsidised occupational health check-ups\n- vaccination advice and health checks\n- company sports programmes at different locations\n- regular, decentralised health awareness days on special topics and expert fitness and health advice\n- access to the \"Balloon\" app, which features a growing library of audio meditations on topics such as stress, sleep, calmness\n- promoting mental health through mindfulness training\n- continuing the series of \"Yes I Care\" workshops for managers to raise awareness of employee health issues\n- firmly integrated processes for employees returning to work\n- regular physical threat analyses with follow-up planning and optimisation measures\n- introduction of JobRad, a cooperation for subsidised bikes leases\n\nJungheinrich is currently working on a health offer for all employees and establishing global company health management. Protecting employees' health is Jungheinrich's top priority. Vision Zero underscores the importance placed on health with the target of zero accidents for employees in the Group, including temporary employees, staff from temping companies, trainees and apprentices. The health of every member of the workforce is decisive in preserving the individual's ability to work and thus Jungheinrich's ability to perform and be successful over the long term.\n\nJungheinrich has implemented overarching programmes in the field of safety and health management. Material work safety tools and processes were harmonised during the process. For instance, in 2023 the Group began standardising the processes for recording safety-relevant events. The integration of health and safety guidelines in workflows is being driven forward. Managers provide briefings on occupational health and safety topics annually. E-learning offers provide support for achieving work safety targets. In addition, special training courses on workspace conditions are carried out on site. This includes training safety officers, first aiders, and fire safety and evacuation assistants. The first training courses to raise awareness for health and safety were held for managers and individual departments in 2023. This series of training is scheduled to be continued and rolled out further\n\n<sup>1</sup> Employees in FTE.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Reporting date 1 December 2023.\n\n<sup>3</sup> Reporting date 1 December 2022.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-73-0\"></span>About Jungheinrich\n\nSociety\n\nin 2024. Jungheinrich's aim is to contribute to the overall strengthening of the social aspects of sustainability in the corporate culture.\n\nThe aim of conducting systematic analyses of accidents and their causes is to prevent such accidents and reduce downtimes. All safety-relevant events are included and a preventive approach is adopted. The measures taken in the 2023 financial year have led to an improvement in work safety. This is reflected in the key figures, whereby accidents in the workplace with at least one lost day are included in the statistic:\n\n- The LTIR in 2023 1 was 13.7 (2022: 13.8). The aim is to reduce this figure to 12.5 by 2025. LTIR is based on the frequency of work accidents per one million working hours.\n- There were 464 accidents in the workplace throughout the Group in the year under review 1 (2022: 471).\n- Each accident in the workplace resulted in an average of 14.8 lost days 1 (2022: 15.2).\n\nCommunication concepts to promote exchanges and synergies across locations are being developed. Jungheinrich is pushing forward with the digitalisation of EHS processes. Jungheinrich continued combining the documents and processes that have already been drawn up into an occupational safety management system in 2023. The system is to be certified according to DIN ISO 45001 in future.\n\n#### Employee personal development\n\nBoosting the company's adaptability is one of the success factors for the implementation of the corporate Strategy 2025+. Jungheinrich supports employee personal development with a comprehensive range of training. This can be seen in the various initiatives:\n\n- Training for managers, project leads and employees is as much a part of the portfolio as the establishment of an internal network of change facilitators who provide support during the design of change processes at Jungheinrich.\n- The Jungheinrich Academy offers qualifications that meet employees needs in the form of e-training and in-person courses. Special training courses for after-sales and sales employees are offered in the Group's own training centres worldwide. The range of offers also covers training courses in the field of HR, finance, IT and production as well as personal development. This range will be expanded to include target group-specific sustainability training from 2024. The range is completed with a comprehensive and international Train the Trainer programme. The range of training available is supplemented by Jungheinrich CAMPUS, an internal learning management portal with digital, modular training formats.\n- In the 2023 financial year, the internal Group-wide learning hours were recognised for the first time. They amounted to 813,053.6 hours 2 . That is equivalent to an average of 38.3 learning hours per employee. The amount of external learning hours will be recorded from 2024.\n- In their annual appraisals, employees agree on development measures together with their manager to safeguard their employability and personal development. Training managers and personal development professionals provide employees with advice regarding their training needs in order to guarantee long-term learning success.\n\n#### Equal opportunity and diversity form the foundation of the company's success\n\nThe diversity of the workforce is a major factor in Jungheinrich's success. Jungheinrich fosters a variety of perspectives, ideas and solutions in a team-oriented and tolerant environment. It is important to Jungheinrich that salaries are fair and competitive and in line with the employees' positions. Within Germany, the Jungheinrich Group employs people from 75 (2022: 76) countries, including people with disabilities.3\n\nIn order to establish the common values internationally, Jungheinrich regularly sends senior executives from Group headquarters to the subsidiaries. Jungheinrich's long-term goal is to fill senior management level posts in the subsidiaries with local managers, as they are familiar with the local conditions and the national culture. As part of the corporate Strategy 2025+, Jungheinrich plans to increase the share of international managers in the workforce. In 2023, 88.5 per cent of the managers abroad came from the country they were working in (2022: 89.6 per cent) 3. The share of female employees in the Jungheinrich Group in 2023 came to 20.8 per cent 4 worldwide (2022: 20.5 per cent) and 19.8 per cent 4 (2022: 19.4 per cent) in Germany and is thus higher than in the previous year. This exceeds the average in the German machine construction industry of 17.2 per cent. The share of women on the Board of Management is 25.0 per cent (2022: 25.0 per cent), while the Supervisory Board has a 41.7 per cent share of female members (2022: 41.7 per cent).\n\n- 3 The calculation method for the share of locally recruited managers abroad was adjusted from the previous year to exclude international managers at German locations. The previous year's figure was also recalculated and presented anew.\n- 4 Reporting date 1 December 2023.\n\n<sup>1</sup> Employees, excluding employees on parental leave, partial retirement (passive phase), employees who have been signed off as unfit for work.\n\n<sup>2</sup> This figure relates to all fully consolidated companies and includes employees from temping companies, apprentices and trainees. External people participating in Jungheinrich CAMPUS training are not included.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-74-0\"></span>About Jungheinrich\n\nSociety\n\nThe share of women in management positions was 15.1 per cent (2022: 15.3 per cent). In line with the Strategy 2025+, Jungheinrich is aiming for a share of female managers of 20.0 per cent. The CEO remuneration ratio was calculated for the first time in 2023. This figure amounted to 35.8<sup>1</sup>.\n\n#### SOCIAL INITIATIVE\n\nThe central aim of the corporate Strategy 2025+ is to create sustainable value. This also includes Jungheinrich's social responsibilities. The company is committed to supporting long-term cooperations and projects in the field of emergency humanitarian aid and education. The main initiatives are:\n\n- Partnership with [action medeor:](https://medeor.de/en/) For more than ten years, Jungheinrich has been working with action medeor, an organisation committed to improving the health of people living in the world's poorest regions. Jungheinrich provides financial support and its intralogistics expertise. Another project that the company supported in 2023 was a multiyear project to promote mother and child health in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Donations in kind were made to optimise the medication warehouse at action medeor's headquarters in Tönisvorst.\n- Internal Donate your pennies campaign: Jungheinrich employees collect donations for action medeor with the Donate your pennies campaign. The monthly penny amounts on the pay slips of employees participating in this campaign are given to select projects once a year. So far around €300 thousand has been raised. Some of the money raised through this campaign in 2022 was donated\n\nto the earthquake victims in Türkiye and Syria in the year under review. The rest of the money raised went to the WASH project in Nepal.\n\n The cooperation with ARCHE: Jungheinrich has been supporting ARCHE, a Christian child and youth charity in Hamburg-Jenfeld, for more than a decade. The charity's objective is to improve the learning opportunities and quality of life of children and youths in the local area. Jungheinrich regularly makes financial donations and donations in kind and volunteers time at events such as the 2023 summer festival.\n\nIn addition to its long-term partnerships, Jungheinrich also provides support in unexpected emergency situations. In 2023, the company rallied support for the earthquake victims in Türkiye and Syria as well as for people affected by the flooding catastrophe in Slovenia. In both cases, one of the things Jungheinrich did was double the donations collected by its employees.\n\nBesides centrally initiated donation campaigns, the Group units also get involved in local charity projects, like those below.\n\n Brazil – education: Jungheinrich Brazil is committed to supporting the expansion of environmental education. A children's book was published together with the organisation Copaíba, that teaches children about sustainability, protecting the environment and the Atlantic Forest. All proceeds go to Copaíba: A tree is planted in the Atlantic Forest for every book sold and two children from state schools are invited to visit the organisation. The 10,000 copies published can be obtained at private schools, through Copaíba and the Brazilian Jungheinrich online shop. Some copies were donated to children in state schools.\n\n- Romania education: Jungheinrich Romania taught pupils about sustainability, recycling, sustainable innovation and lithium-ion batteries over the course of two event days. Trees were also planted at the Virgil Madgearu Economic College (Bucharest) and the High School of Sports (Brașov) as part of the project.\n- Thailand social commitment: While visiting the Asia Center Foundation (ACF), Jungheinrich employees from the Asia-Pacific region built a playground on the organisation's premises and played a number of educational games with the children. Several donations in kind were also made, such as toys, teaching materials and building materials for the playground. ACF is committed to improving the lives of at-risk children in Thailand by offering them access to education, care, healthy food and the opportunity to learn life skills in a safe environment.\n\n<sup>1</sup> This figure represents the ratio of the Chairman of the Board of Management's annual total remuneration to the average total annual remuneration of all employees in Germany. All German companies were included with the exception of MIAS, Profishop, arculus, ISI and Magazino. To calculate the average total remuneration, all relevant elements of personnel costs such as wages and salaries, provisions and bonuses, other personnel costs and long-term incentives were included.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-75-0\"></span>Governance\n\n#### GOVERNANCE INITIATIVE\n\nJungheinrich is committed to value-oriented corporate governance that promotes efficiency, a sense of responsibility, sustainability and long-term corporate success at all levels. The company's understanding of corporate governance is orientated towards the regulatory frameworks relevant to the company and to best practices, including the German Corporate Governance Code that serves as a guideline for governance internally and externally.\n\nThe foundations of Jungheinrich's entrepreneurial activity also include the clear distribution of tasks, rights and responsibilities, transparent internal and external corporate communications and responsible risk management. Effective internal control and risk management and compliance management system (CMS) play a central role in governance. Responsible business practices cover Jungheinrich's entire value chain and especially include procurement processes. Jungheinrich strives to be viewed as a reliable partner by customers, suppliers, employees, shareholders and all other stakeholders. Further information about [corporate governance](https://www.jungheinrich.com/en/investor-relations/corporate-governance) at Jungheinrich, including nominations to the Board of Management, Supervisory Board and Committees and their working methods, and Board of Management and Supervisory Board remuneration are published on the company's webpage.\n\n#### Compliance, with clearly defined responsibilities\n\nJungheinrich understands compliance to mean complying with laws and internal guidelines and rules in a systematic manner. The Group's CMS, which sets out clear responsibilities within the company, covers all organisational structures and processes, which are themselves regularly adapted to changing circumstances. The CMS requires correct behaviour and integrity from employees in everyday business, based on the principle of prevention, detection and response. This means that Jungheinrich proactively prevents violations and risks, offers Group-wide ways to report any suspected violations and conducts fair and confidential investigations. Jungheinrich has followed these compliance principles and the existing structures for many years, meaning no significant official investigations or fines have been launched against the company or its managers/executive bodies.\n\nThe Jungheinrich Compliance Committee met on set dates in the 2023 financial year ensuring the further development of the CMS from a Group perspective. In addition, the Jungheinrich AG Supervisory Board was regularly informed of compliance-relevant issues. Corporate Compliance, Audit & Data Protection was subject to a quality audit performed by an external auditor in 2022 to ensure that the processes and structures still met the increasing regulatory requirements. The implementation of the agreed further developments began in 2023.\n\nVarious tools and measures for implementing internal rules and regulations are at the core of the CMS, including:\n\n- a uniform Code of Conduct that is mandatory for all employees, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board\n- clear reporting channels, for instance via Jungheinrich's compliance portal OpenLine\n- Group-wide compliance training for all employees, including members of the Board of Management\n- regular audits performed by the Corporate Compliance Audit & Data Protection division\n- compliance along the entire value chain, including external suppliers and sales partners\n\n#### Consistent Code of Conduct\n\nJungheinrich makes binding guidelines and standards, including a Group guideline for compliance with clearly defined responsibilities, processes and structures available to all employees. In addition, a new Group guideline on preventing corruption was adopted and communicated throughout the Group in the 2023 financial year. A Code of Conduct that covers ten different compliance topics and applies throughout the company is also part of the Jungheinrich Compliance Management Guideline:\n\n- avoiding conflicts of interest\n- dealing with external business partners\n- avoiding bribery and corruption\n- antitrust regulations\n- the environment\n- data protection and information security\n- confidentiality and non-disclosure\n- human resources compliance\n- financial compliance\n- capital market compliance\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-76-0\"></span>About Jungheinrich\n\nThe company is committed to transparency in its donations as well as sponsoring, and does not tolerate inappropriate structures designed for tax evasion. The company also declares it will not support any political parties or projects, or any organisations or persons with a political background. Jungheinrich follows the arm's-length principle, whereby taxes are paid in the country in which it has generated the earnings.\n\nCompliance with personal rights and protecting company secrets are of the utmost importance. An internal guideline that takes into account legal requirements stipulates how personal data is to be handled.\n\n#### Clear reporting channels for violations\n\nA process that has been clearly communicated and applies internationally is in place for compliance issue reports and the notification of suspected violations. The process stipulates three channels for reporting: to direct supervisors, local compliance officers or the central compliance team. The [Jungheinrich OpenLine portal](http://www.whistle-blow.org/JungheinrichAG/) was launched as a fourth option in the CMS in the 2017 financial year. Employees can ask questions or report violations with their name or anonymously using the portal. The portal has also been available for external notifications since 2019. Jungheinrich is currently expanding the number of languages that the portal is available in, in order to make the portal accessible to as many people who wish to make a report as possible.\n\n#### Raising awareness for compliance\n\nAwareness of compliance issues is raised among employees in order to encourage appropriate conduct. Jungheinrich has made various compliance e-learning modules available through the Jungheinrich learning platform CAMPUS. These include training sessions covering the Jungheinrich Code of Conduct, data protection and IT security. They were again rolled out as mandatory training courses in 2023 to all employees who have access to Jungheinrich CAMPUS. Alternatively, customised and updated training materials for in-person training and specific information events was made available and offered at plants and sales locations. In the 2023 financial year, there were 28 compliance briefings (2022: 24). Jungheinrich also organised additional training for relevant groups on topics such as anticorruption and antitrust via Jungheinrich CAMPUS in 2023. Jungheinrich CAMPUS has also been offering the option of training partners who have to meet compliance requirements since 2019. New Jungheinrich companies are always briefed on relevant compliance topics in a defined process.\n\n#### Ongoing audits\n\nTo inspect suspected cases of violations against legal or internal requirements fairly and confidentially, incoming reports are checked by the Head of Corporate Compliance, Audit & Data Protection – after the Chief Compliance Officer has been informed. Further steps are taken if necessary, such as receipt audits, interviews and disciplinary measures. Over the course of the reporting year, there were no reports of any incidents which, following an internal investigation, would have to be classified as significant cases of corruption (2022: 0). To prevent corruption, all Jungheinrich locations are regularly checked for risks by the Corporate Compliance and Audit & Data Protection division. The standard procedure includes reviewing receipts, financial transactions and internal controls. Donations made by the Group and sponsorships are also regularly examined. In 2023, 23 audits were conducted (2022: 20). Appropriate documentation and traceability of the audits performed are an important part of the compliance reporting process and meet all regulatory requirements. Jungheinrich's Finance and Audit Committee is also informed of the audits performed and their results every quarter.\n\n#### Compliance along the value chain\n\nJungheinrich also expects the same high compliance and data protection standards from its external suppliers and sales partners. The Group expects them to behave ethically and apply the same high standards as Jungheinrich does. This includes guaranteeing the basic principles of free and fair competition, ensuring data is protected, and preventing corruption. These standards and compliance with environmental requirements along with labour rights and working conditions are laid out in the Supplier Code of Conduct. Suppliers are also informed of the existing reporting channels at Jungheinrich via the Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\n#### Respecting human rights\n\nJungheinrich is firmly committed to respecting human rights. Human rights due diligence obligations are established both within the business processes at Jungheinrich's own locations and within the supply chains. In determining the nature of its obligations, the company follows international guidelines and standards such as the UN Human Rights Charter, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP), the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Business and the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. In accordance with these guidelines, Jungheinrich obliges its employees, customers and business partners worldwide to act in a responsible, ethical and legal manner.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-77-0\"></span>This includes the following protected legal positions:\n\n- the prohibition of child labour, including the worst forms of child labour\n- the prohibition of forced labour, human trafficking and slavery\n- occupational health and safety\n- freedom of association\n- prohibition of discrimination and harassment\n- appropriate pay\n- the prohibition of affecting human populations through environmental changes\n- the prohibition of forced evictions and expropriation of natural resources\n- making demands on private and state security forces\n- compliance environmental obligations\n- fair working conditions and working hours\n- the right to data protection and privacy\n\nWith the revision of the [Jungheinrich Code for Human Rights](https://media-live2.prod.scw.jungheinrichcloud.com/resource/blob/1405308/48a280476b2f6fa0bc7312acf8e74cf4/code-on-human-rights-occupational-safety-data.pdf) [and Occupational Health and Safety](https://media-live2.prod.scw.jungheinrichcloud.com/resource/blob/1405308/48a280476b2f6fa0bc7312acf8e74cf4/code-on-human-rights-occupational-safety-data.pdf), the adoption of a Group guideline on Corporate Due Diligence, and the publication of a [Policy Statement to Respect the Human Rights](https://media-live2.prod.scw.jungheinrichcloud.com/resource/blob/1405304/8b92c94f0ec750ed80787d0c4cde0326/policy-statement-to-respect-the-human-rights-data.pdf), Jungheinrich met further requirements of the Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains (LkSG) in the reporting year. The Human Rights Council established in 2022 is a decisive sign of the Group's attitude with regards to respecting human rights.\n\nJungheinrich performs appropriate risk analyses relating to its human rights and environmental obligations in its own business and at direct suppliers at least once a year to recognise, evaluate and prevent potential or actual negative impacts. The priority human rights and environmental risks for Jungheinrich determined by the risk analyses are presented in the following:\n\n#### Own business\n\n- Appropriate pay, fair working conditions and working hours: Jungheinrich complies with the applicable minimum wages around the world. An analysis of the production locations also confirmed that Jungheinrich pays a living wage at least at these locations. Jungheinrich also complies with statutory regulations on working hours. Overtime may occasionally be required during working hours. However, this does not represent a systematic or structural deviation but rather one-off cases.\n- Discrimination: Jungheinrich employs more than 21,000 people worldwide. There may therefore be individual cases of discrimination within the workforce. However, Jungheinrich does not systematically or structurally discriminate against people or groups of people.\n- Occupational health and safety: Jungheinrich creates value through production, sales and after-sales services (maintenance, repair and spare parts service). In production and the after-sales service in particular, work safety risks can be higher, which is why EHS-related topics [ [page](#page-72-0) 71 ] are given high priority.\n- Freedom of association: Jungheinrich operates worldwide. This includes countries where the freedom of association is legally restricted.\n\n#### Direct suppliers\n\nThe risk analyses for direct suppliers were performed according to product groups. The following product groups with higher abstract human rights risks were identified: logistics, third-party assembly services, event marketing, facility management, printed circuit boards. The following abstract risks were determined and prioritised for these product groups:\n\n- Occupational health and safety: There is a latent risk in the field of work safety in particular when it comes to Jungheinrich suppliers' labour-intensive value creation and services. Depending on the precautions taken by the suppliers, varying levels of remaining occupational health and safety risks cannot be excluded.\n- Forced labour and slavery: Jungheinrich suppliers operate in different cultural, social, economic and political contexts around the world. This can result in varying levels of dependence on the part of the employees.\n- Discrimination: Jungheinrich's suppliers are at different stages of development when it comes to managing equal opportunities and operate in different cultural contexts. They have many employees and there may be discrimination in individual cases.\n\nIn the coming financial years, Jungheinrich will implement further measures relating to its human rights due diligence obligations, including:\n\n- annual publication of a Jungheinrich Human Rights Declaration\n- expanding and embedding the management approach\n- checking the efficacy of the measures and procedures introduced\n- creating a global organisational structure in the Group to implement the measures\n- raising awareness among Group employees, suppliers, customers and business partners regarding human rights and how to handle human rights issues in business practices\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-78-0\"></span>About Jungheinrich\n\nJungheinrich sees fulfilling its human rights due diligence obligations as an ongoing process. Regulatory developments, such as the LkSG and the planned EU Directive on human rights due diligence obligations will therefore be translated into appropriate internal measures.\n\n#### Establishing sustainable procurement\n\nSustainable procurement is an integral part of the Jungheinrich sustainability strategy. Including suppliers within a holistic supplier management process is of vital importance and contributes to stability of supply. The careful selection of suppliers that share Jungheinrich's approach to sustainability is an important prerequisite for sustainable supplier management. Potential suppliers must fulfil uniform approval criteria throughout the Group. The most important aspects are the Supplier Code of Conduct, the Supplier Manual and the sustainability self-assessments. The Supplier Manual was updated in the 2023 financial year. Suppliers are regularly classified for risk according to economic, ecological and social criteria. Appropriate measures are taken depending on the risk class.\n\nThe integration of sustainable procurement in internal processes and at suppliers, including the implementation of LkSG requirements, was continued in 2023. The management system for sustainable procurement was expanded to include preventative and remedial action. The preventative measures form part of a four-step model that stretches from the Supplier Code of Conduct to potentially on-site social audits. An internal workflow was designed for remedial action which enables a swift and appropriate response to any incident in Jungheinrich's supply chains.\n\nIn order to increase key-supplier transparency, they now undergo a sustainability self-assessment, which is carried out via the [Integrity Next](https://www.integritynext.com) platform. Currently, more than 750 of the potential approximately 1,500 key suppliers are participating, which equates to 74 per cent of the Group purchasing volume 1 . The management system was expanded to the Jungheinrich companies Profishop AG & Co. KG, Profishop AG, Profishop GmbH and MIAS Group in 2023 in order to formalise their sustainable procurement processes further. The sustainability self-assessment comprises the following topics:\n\n- anti-corruption and anti-bribery\n- occupational safety\n- energy management\n- conflicts of interest\n- human and labour rights\n- environmental protection\n- responsibility in the supply chains\n\nThe sustainability self-assessments form the basis for calculating the sustainable spend key figure. This figure was introduced in 2021 with the aim of classifying at least 80 per cent of the relevant purchasing volume as sustainable by 2025. Sustainable spend stood at 75 per cent in 2023 (2022: approximately 70 per cent).\n\nFuture sustainable procurement measures include procurement training for buyers and suppliers, direct supplier risk analysis, expansion of sustainability self-assessments and audits, and focussing on reducing CO2e emissions in the supply chains.\n\n#### SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODELS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INITIATIVE\n\nAs a sustainability enabler, Jungheinrich wants to support its stakeholders in achieving their sustainability targets and considers sustainability to be an opportunity. The company's sustainable orientation releases potential to increase the company's innovativeness, expand the portfolio of solutions and generate competitive advantages, for example. Sustainable business models, products and services are a decisive driver for Jungheinrich, as they support customers in particular in achieving their sustainability and climate targets and contribute to customer retention. Product quality and safety are also vital factors when it comes to customer satisfaction.\n\n#### Sustainability as a growth driver\n\nJungheinrich offers a broad range of products that support customers in their sustainability efforts:\n\n- Since March 2023, all of the trucks manufactured have been battery-powered. However, the electric ratio was almost 100 per cent in previous years, too.\n- The company offers lithium-ion solutions through its own research, development and production capacities. These provide customers with fully networked systems where the battery, charger and truck all perfectly complement one another.\n\n<sup>1</sup> Due to changes in business relationships, these figures are only a snapshot at a given point in time; they may fluctuate over time.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\nNon-financial report\n\nConsolidated statement of profit or

Of the European revenue, 27 per cent is generated in Germany.\n\nThe distribution of Jungheinrich material handling equipment in North America is carried out by an exclusive distribution partner.\n\nWith the acquisition of Storage Solutions in the reporting year, Jungheinrich is now also covering the US market for warehouse equipment and automation.\n\n#### (2) Accounting principles\n\n#### Fundamentals\n\nJungheinrich AG prepared the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ending on 31 December 2023 in compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). All standards and interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee endorsed by the EU and effective as at the balance sheet date were applied. Regulations under commercial law pursuant to Section 315e of the German Commercial Code (HGB) were complementarily taken into account.\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements generally draws on the historical acquisition and manufacturing costs. Certain financial instruments measured at fair value as at the balance sheet date are an exception to this rule. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in euros (€). Unless indicated otherwise, disclosure is in thousands of euros. The statement of profit or loss has been prepared using the cost of sales accounting method.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2023 were approved for publication by the Board of Management on 12 March 2024.\n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Consolidation\n\nSubsidiaries, including structured entities over which Jungheinrich AG, Hamburg, can exercise direct or indirect control, are included in the consolidated financial statements. Control can be exercised if the parent company has control over the subsidiary on the basis of voting rights or other rights, participates in the variable returns and can use its control to influence these returns. Structured entities which are controlled are also included in the scope of consolidation. Structured entities are companies in which the voting rights or comparable rights are not definitive for the determination of control. For example, this is the case if the voting rights only pertain to the administrative responsibilities and the material activities are regulated by way of contractual agreements.\n\nJoint ventures and associated companies are reported using the equity method. A joint venture is a joint arrangement according to which Jungheinrich exercises control together with a partner company, and has rights in the net assets of the investment together with that partner. Associated companies are companies where Jungheinrich AG, Hamburg, has a significant direct or indirect influence on their finance and business policies. A significant influence is said to exist if Jungheinrich holds a share of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting rights.\n\nSubsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies which are of subordinated importance to the Group and to the presentation of the actual assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss due to their dormancy or minimal business activity are accounted for at fair value.\n\nSubsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements starting from the point in time at which Jungheinrich AG obtains control over the company until the point in time at which control by Jungheinrich AG ends.\n\nThe financial statements of Jungheinrich AG as the parent company and of included subsidiaries that are to be consolidated are prepared using uniform accounting and valuation methods as at the balance sheet date of the parent company.\n\nThe same accounting and valuation methods are used to determine the pro rata shareholders' equity of companies accounted for using the equity method.\n\nBusiness combinations, or in other words, acquisitions of companies and business areas, are accounted for using the acquisition method in compliance with IFRS 3. Accordingly, the consideration transferred at the acquisition date is offset against the net assets measured at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. Transaction costs associated with business combinations are generally recognised in profit or loss. If the consideration transferred includes conditional consideration, the latter is measured at its fair value at the acquisition date. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are also measured at their fair values at the acquisition date. If the acquisition costs are higher than the fair value of the identified net asset, the positive balance is capitalised as goodwill. If the fair value of the acquired net asset is higher than the acquisition costs, the negative balance is recognised as negative goodwill. This is recognised immediately in profit or loss in the year of acquisition. If the fair values of the business combination can only be determined on a preliminary basis until their initial reporting date, the business combination is accounted for on the basis of these preliminary figures. In accordance with IFRS 3.45, initial accounting observes the twelve-month measurement period from the acquisition date. All necessary adjustments to the determined fair values are booked against the preliminary goodwill or negative goodwill within this measurement period. Non-controlling interests in shareholders' equity are reported under \"Non-controlling interests\" in shareholders' equity.\n\nAll receivables and liabilities, expenses and income as well as intragroup results within the scope of consolidation are eliminated within the consolidation.\n\nInvestments in companies accounted for using the equity method are recognised at their acquisition cost upon initial recognition. Changes in the pro rata shareholders' equity of the investments following acquisition are offset against the investments' carrying amount. The Jungheinrich Group's investments in companies accounted for using the equity method include goodwill arising at the time of their acquisition. Since this goodwill is not stated separately, it does not have to be separately tested for impairment pursuant to IAS 36. Instead, the investment's entire carrying amount is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 as soon as there are indications of the recoverable amount dropping below the investment's carrying amount. If the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount of a company accounted for using the equity method, an impairment loss in the amount of the difference is recognised. Reversal of impairment losses in subsequent reporting periods are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Currency translation\n\nCash and cash equivalents, receivables and liabilities in foreign currency in the Group companies' annual financial statements are translated at the exchange rate valid at the balance sheet date and any differences resulting from such translation are recognised in profit and loss.\n\n#### Key exchange rates for the Jungheinrich Group\n\n| Currency | Baseline 1€ | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 | 2023    | 2022    |\n|----------|-------------|------------|------------|---------|---------|\n| CHF      |             | 0.9260     | 0.9847     | 0.9717  | 1.0052  |\n| CNY      |             | 7.8509     | 7.3582     | 7.6591  | 7.0801  |\n| CZK      |             | 24.7240    | 24.1160    | 24.0007 | 24.5603 |\n| GBP      |             | 0.8691     | 0.8869     | 0.8699  | 0.8526  |\n| PLN      |             | 4.3395     | 4.6808     | 4.5421  | 4.6845  |\n| RUB      |             | 98.5052    | 77.9635    | 92.4333 | 74.2259 |\n| USD      |             | 1.1050     | 1.0666     | 1.0816  | 1.0539  |\n\nThe annual financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements are translated according to the functional currency concept. In each case, this is the local currency if the subsidiaries are integrated into the currency area of the country in which they are domiciled as commercially independent entities. As regards the companies of the Jungheinrich Group, the functional currency is the local currency.\n\nTo prepare the consolidated financial statements, assets and liabilities reported in local currency are converted to euros at the mean exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Changes during the year, the items on the statement of profit or loss, and the components of the other comprehensive income are translated at the annual average exchange rate for the financial year. Shareholders' equity is carried at historic exchange rates. Translation differences are recognised in shareholders' equity under \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (expense)\" with no effect on profit or loss until the subsidiary is removed from the scope of consolidation. The respective cumulative translation differences are reversed in profit or loss when Group companies are deconsolidated.\n\n#### Hyperinflation\n\nIf the functional currency of a subsidiary included in the consolidated financial statements is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy, the subsidiary will apply the requirements of IAS 29 \"Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies\" in preparing the annual financial statements.\n\nThe carrying amounts of non-monetary assets and liabilities, equity attributable to shareholders of Jungheinrich AG and all comprehensive income (expense) items will be adjusted to the value applicable on the balance sheet date. Under these circumstances, a general price index is applied that reflects the change in purchasing power.\n\nNon-monetary assets adjusted in accordance with IAS 29 remain subject to review for indications of impairment.\n\nThe gain or loss on net monetary position in the year under review is reported under other financial income (expense).\n\nAll items in the annual financial statement of an included subsidiary whose functional currency is a hyperinflationary economy currency are converted at the rate applicable as at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe impact of inflation on equity is offset against the currency translation effect with no effect on profit or loss and reported as other changes under the item \"currency translation\" in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.\n\nIn the first year for which IAS 29 is applied in the consolidated financial statement, the previous year's figures are not adjusted.\n\nTürkiye was classified as a hyperinflationary economy for the first time in 2022. The annual financial statements of the Turkish sales company, whose functional currency is the Turkish lira, included in the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2023, were prepared using the requirements of IAS 29 and is accounted for at cost. The consumer price index published by the Turkish national statistics office was used to adjust the annual financial statements to the value applicable as at the balance sheet date. As of 31 December 2023 the price index stood at 1,859.38 (31 December 2022: 1,128.45). The loss on net monetary position is reported under other financial income (expense) in 2023 and 2022.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue is recognised after deduction of bonuses, discounts or rebates when control of disposal over the goods or services has been transferred to the customer. In general, this is the case when the delivery has been made or the service has been rendered, when the selling price is fixed or determinable and when the receipt of payment is reasonably certain.\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers, particularly in relation to the sale of material handling equipment and the performance of after-sales services, is recognised in the Jungheinrich Group primarily on the basis of individual contracts. Revenue is recognised at the amount of the contractually agreed consideration as soon as the customer has obtained control of disposal over the goods or uses the services provided. Revenue from the sale of material handling equipment and the sale of spare parts by the after-sales service is generally recognised at a specific point in time. Revenue from the provision of customer services is generally recognised over a period of time. Significant financing components are not included in the contracts with customers as standard market payment targets are agreed as a general rule. A provision is set up for statutory and contractual warranty obligations.\n\nWith regard to automation projects, which are under the control of the ordering party during production and for which the Group has a legal right to payment for the work already performed, including an appropriate margin, Jungheinrich recognises revenue and the cost of sales in accordance with the degree of completion. This means that, for these projects, control is transferred and revenue is recognised over a specific period. The degree of completion results from the relation of the contract-related costs incurred as at the balance sheet date vis-à-vis the estimated total contract-related costs as at the balance sheet date and reflects, according to the management's assessment, the completion progress and the associated transfer of control over the project to the customer to an appropriate extent. If the earnings from a project contract cannot be determined reliably, revenue is only recognised in the amount of the costs incurred that are likely recoverable. The rules for revenue recognition set out above are also applied to the project business of Storage Solutions.\n\nRevenue from financial service transactions is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the contracts if the contract is classified as an \"operating lease\" in the amount of the lease payments. If the contract is deemed to be a \"finance lease\", revenue is recognised in the amount of the fair value of the leased item or the present value of the lease payments attributable to the lessor at the start of the contract, whichever is lower. The interest income is realised over the terms of the contracts using the effective interest method. If a leasing company or bank acts as an intermediary, the sales proceeds received, less the agreed residual values, from concluded sales contracts which contain repurchase obligations and are classified as an \"operating lease\", are recognised under deferred income. They are reversed with an effect on revenue on a straight-line basis over time until the repurchase date contractually agreed with the leasing company/bank. If the contracts are deemed to be \"finance leases\", revenue is recognised in the amount of the fair value of the leased item or the present value of the lease payments attributable to the lessor at the start of the contract, whichever is lower.\n\n#### Product-related expenses\n\nExpenses for advertising and sales promotion, as well as other sales-related expenses are recognised in profit or loss when they are incurred. Freight and dispatch costs are carried under the cost of sales.\n\nProduct-related expenses also include additions to provisions for warranty obligations as well as to provisions for onerous contracts.\n\n#### Research and development costs\n\nResearch costs and development expenses that cannot be capitalised are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nFrom the beginning of production, capitalised development expenditure is reduced by straight-line depreciation over the series production's expected duration.\n\nResearch costs and non-capitalisable development expenditure, as well as amortisation and impairment of capitalised development expenditure, are stated under research and development costs.\n\n#### Government grants\n\nInvestment grants and subsidies are recognised if there is sufficient certainty that Jungheinrich can satisfy the associated conditions and that the benefits are granted. Government grants related to income are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the corresponding claim arises. Government grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the functional costs, in which the expenses being compensated are also reported. Other government grants related to income are recognised as \"other operating income\".\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\nGovernment grants related to assets are deducted when determining the carrying amount of the asset and recognised in profit or loss over the useful life of the depreciable asset using a reduced depreciation amount.\n\nJungheinrich enters into contracts as a lessee for the use of property, plant and equipment, primarily properties and trucks. Government grants for related right-of-use assets recognised in property, plant and equipment are generally recognised as deferred income and distributed over the useful lives of the right-of-use assets. The reversals are recognised in profit or loss as other operating income on a pro rata temporis basis.\n\n#### Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share are calculated based on share of profit or loss attributable to the shareholders of Jungheinrich AG, and this in turn is based on the average number of the respective shares outstanding during a financial year. In the 2023 and 2022 financial years, no equity instruments diluted the earnings per share on the basis of the respective shares issued.\n\n#### Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\n\nPurchased intangible assets are measured at acquisition costs, and reduced by straight-line depreciation over their useful lives insofar as their useful lives are limited. The useful lives used as a basis for software licences are 3 to 8 years. Intangible assets with limited useful lives acquired as part of business combinations primarily relate to customer relationships, technologies and customer contracts. The economic useful lives determined are between 4 and 15 years for these customer relationships and technologies, and between 15 and 20 years for the customer contracts. Usage rights in land acquired in China and Singapore are limited to 50 and 36 years respectively.\n\nDevelopment expenses for material handling equipment, vehicle components and digital products are capitalised if the manufacturing of the developed products is expected to result in an economic benefit for the Jungheinrich Group and is technically feasible and if the costs can be determined reliably. Capitalised development expenditure comprises all costs directly allocable to the development process, including development-related overheads. From the beginning of production, capitalised development expenditure is amortised using the straight-line method over the series production's expected duration, which is normally between 4 and 7 years.\n\nAt initial recognition, goodwill from business combinations is measured at acquisition cost and classified as an intangible asset. Acquisition costs are the positive balance of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the acquired net asset. In subsequent periods, goodwill is accounted for at acquisition cost, less accumulated impairment losses where necessary. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least once a year or whenever there is an indication of a potential reduction in value. If the carrying amount of a cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss in the amount of the difference is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Impairment losses, including impairment losses recognised during the current financial year, will not be reversed in subsequent reporting periods. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the goodwill is allocated needs to be determined. The CGUs are generally identical to the legal sales companies. The MIAS Group is the designated CGU to which goodwill from the acquisition of the MIAS Group has been assigned. Storage Solutions is the designated CGU to which goodwill from the acquisition of Storage Solutions has been assigned. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less selling costs and the value in use. The impairment test is performed on the basis of the determined value in use of a CGU using the discounted cash flow method. As a rule, the cash flows budgeted for in the bottom-up five-year budget, made plausible by Jungheinrich AG management, are used. The parameters set are derived from historical information and mirrored by external sources of information. Forecasts for long-term revenue and returns form the basis for cash flows beyond the budget period. A pre-tax interest rate in line with the conditions prevailing on the market is used as the discount rate. The total cost of capital is based on the risk-free interest rate and risk premiums for equity and debt specific to the Group units and countries. If the value in use is lower than the carrying amount, the recoverable amount is also calculated on the basis of fair value less selling costs.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are measured at historical acquisition and manufacturing costs, less accumulated depreciation. Government grants are normally deducted from acquisition or manufacturing costs as from the beginning of the 2023 financial year. Deferred government grants related to property, plant and equipment totalling €4,427 thousand as of 31 December 2022 were derecognised from deferred income as of 1 January 2023 and recognised as a reduction in the acquisition and manufacturing costs of the property, plant and equipment to which the grants relate. The manufacturing costs for self-produced equipment contain not only the direct material and manufacturing expenses, but also attributable\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\nmaterial and production overheads as well as production-related administrative expenses and depreciation. Maintenance and repair expenses are stated as expenses. All costs for measures that lead to an extension of the useful life or a widening of the future possibilities for use of the assets are capitalised. Depreciable objects are reduced by straight-line depreciation. If objects are sold or scrapped, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are derecognised; any resulting profits or losses are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n#### Useful lives of property, plant and equipment\n\n| Buildings                                   | 10–50 years |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Land improvement, improvements in buildings | 10–50 years |\n| Plant facilities                            | 8–15 years  |\n| Technical equipment and machinery           | 5–10 years  |\n| Factory and office equipment                | 3–10 years  |\n\nIntangible assets and property, plant and equipment with indefinite useful lives are not reduced using depreciation or amortisation.\n\nJungheinrich enters into contracts as a lessee for the use of property, plant and equipment, primarily properties and trucks. The right-of-use assets reported under property, plant and equipment are measured at acquisition cost, less cumulated depreciation and any necessary impairment, taking into account any remeasurements of the lease liability. The acquisition cost of the right-of-use asset is the present value of contractually agreed lease payments plus initial direct costs, less all lease incentives received. If there is an obligation to restore the underlying asset of the lease to its original state, then these costs are considered part of the acquisition cost. Jungheinrich makes use of the option in property lease contracts to consider payments for non-lease components as lease payments, and in so doing to recognise every lease component and all associated non-lease components as a single lease component. For all other leases, lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately.\n\nIf ownership of the leased item is transferred to Jungheinrich at the end of the contract's term as a result of the exercise of an option or a contractual agreement, the item is depreciated over its economic useful life. Otherwise, the right-of-use asset is reduced by straight-line depreciation over the lease term.\n\nFor leases with a maximum term of twelve months and leases of low-value assets, the rental and lease payments made by Jungheinrich are recognised by Jungheinrich using the straightline method as an expense over the term of the contract under functional costs. Low-value leases consist of assets whose individual acquisition costs at original value do not exceed €5 thousand.\n\n#### Trucks for short-term rental\n\nJungheinrich rents trucks to customers on the basis of short-term agreements. These trucks for short-term rental are capitalised at historical acquisition or manufacturing costs and depreciated over their economic useful lives, which are set at six and nine years respectively according to product group. Depending on the product group, they are depreciated at 30 or 20 per cent of their cost in each of the first two years, after which they are reduced using the straight-line method until the end of their useful lives.\n\n#### Impairments of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and trucks for short-term rental\n\nThe impairment test for goodwill is explained in the section headed \"Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\".\n\nAll other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and trucks for short-term rental are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication of a potential reduction in value. Besides qualitative criteria, particularly macroeconomic indicators, quantitative criteria are also used to furnish indications that a cash-generating unit (CGU) may be impaired. The CGUs are generally identical to the legal sales companies. The assets and contributions to profit of the other Group companies are allocated to the CGUs according to a revenue formula. As its quantitative criterion for assessing the impact of crises on recognised assets, Jungheinrich uses the ratio between the EBIT coverage ratio based on the CGU's current annual forecast and the current total carrying amounts of its fixed assets and net current assets. If the ratio falls below 3 per cent, the relevant CGU's intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and trucks for short-term rental are tested for impairment.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\nIn such cases, the recoverable amount of the asset is compared with its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is determined for each individual asset unless an asset generates cash flows that are not largely independent of those of other assets or other groups of assets (cash-generating units). The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value of the asset less selling costs and value in use, which is the estimated discounted future cash flow. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount of the asset, an impairment is performed.\n\nIf the reason for a recognised impairment in previous years no longer exists, a write-up to amortised acquisition and manufacturing costs is performed.\n\n#### Leasing and financial services\n\nWithin the framework of their financial services business, Jungheinrich Group companies conclude contracts with customers either directly or with a leasing company or bank acting as an intermediary.\n\nThe classification of the leases, and thus the way they are reported in the accounts, depends on the attribution of the economic ownership of the lease object. In the case of \"finance lease\" contracts, essentially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset are transferred so that the economic ownership lies with the lessee. At the Jungheinrich Group companies, as the lessor, this leads to identification of such assets as receivables from financial services in the amount of their net investment value. If the contract is deemed to be a \"finance lease\", revenue is recognised in the amount of the fair value of the leased item or the present value of the lease payments attributable to the lessor at the start of the contract, whichever is lower. Interest income realised in instalments over the term to maturity ensures that a stable return on outstanding net investments is achieved.\n\nIf economic ownership is attributed to Jungheinrich as the lessor, the agreement is classified as an \"operating lease\".The trucks are then capitalised as \"trucks for lease from financial services\" at cost and then depreciated over their economic useful lives. Underlying assets acquired before 1 January 2021 are depreciated over an economic useful life of six or nine years, depending on product group. Depending on the product group, they are depreciated at 30 or 20 per cent of their cost in each of the first two years, after which they are reduced using the straight-line method until the end of their useful lives. Underlying assets acquired from 1 January 2021 onwards is reduced by straight-line depreciation during the term of the customer contract down to the residual value. Lease income is recognised in profit or loss over the terms of the contracts using the straight-line method. Upon termination of the customer lease contract, the trucks are transferred to inventories at their carrying amounts.\n\nThese long-term customer contracts (\"finance leases\" and \"operating leases\") are financed by loans with maturities as identical as possible to those of the contracts. They are recognised under liabilities from financing as part of the item \"liabilities from financial services\". In addition to truck-related loan financing, proceeds from the sale of future lease instalments from intragroup usage right agreements in the Jungheinrich Group are deferred as liabilities from financing and released over the period of the usage right using the effective interest method. In addition, Jungheinrich finances itself via Elbe River Capital S.A., Luxembourg, an affiliated company established exclusively for this purpose. This refinancing company buys all lease instalments from intragroup usage right agreements – and, in Germany and the United Kingdom, from customer contracts, too – that mature in the future, and refinances itself through the issuance of promissory notes.\n\nIn addition, the underlying trucks in long-term customer contracts are refinanced using the sale and leaseback method. For sale and leaseback transactions completed prior to the first application of IFRS 16 (\"Leases\") there was no reassessment regarding the transfer of control to the leasing companies/banks, and the distribution of the profit from the sale from these contracts over the term of the contract is continued in accordance with the transition rules of IFRS 16. For sale and leaseback transactions signed after 1 January 2019, assessments are performed to see if control of the trucks has been transferred to the refinancing partner. As this is usually not the case, the trucks are not considered to have been sold, and are derecognised. They are recognised and measured as either trucks for lease from financial services (operating lease) or receivables from financial services (finance lease) depending on how the customer contract is classified. Refinancing liabilities in the amount of the revenue from the transfer are accounted for as financial liabilities and recognised as liabilities from financial services.\n\nIn the case of customer contracts with a leasing company or bank acting as an intermediary, Jungheinrich concludes sales contracts with the leasing companies/banks for the assets provided to the customer. Jungheinrich is frequently required under these contracts to repurchase the trucks from the leasing company/bank for an agreed residual value when the customer contracts expire. As a result, these contracts satisfy the definition of a lease contract and are classified as an \"operating lease\" or \"finance lease\" in accordance with the classification criteria which are used to classify lease contracts concluded directly with customers. If economic ownership is held by the Jungheinrich Group companies, the trucks sold to leasing companies/banks continue to be recognised in Jungheinrich's statement of financial position in accordance with IFRS. When they are capitalised as \"trucks for lease from financial services\", sales proceeds less the agreed residual value are recorded as \"deferred revenue from\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\nfinancial services\" under deferred income. Trucks for lease are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the term of the underlying leases between the leasing companies/banks and the end customer. The sales proceeds recognised as part of deferred income are reversed with an effect on revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract until payment of the agreed residual value is due. The repurchase obligations are reported in the amount of the contractually agreed residual values under the item \"liabilities from financial services\".\n\n#### Financial instruments\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, financial instruments are defined as contracts that at the same time lead to financial assets in one company and financial liabilities or equity instruments in the other.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, financial assets must be assigned to one of the following three measurement categories:\n\n- At amortised cost\n- At fair value through other comprehensive income (expense)\n- At fair value through profit or loss\n\nThe financial assets are classified based on the Jungheinrich Group's business model for managing financial assets and on the characteristics of the contractually agreed cash flows.\n\nFinancial liabilities must be assigned to one of the following three measurement categories:\n\n- At amortised cost\n- At fair value through profit or loss\n- Other financial liabilities\n\nFinancial instruments carried at amortised cost are primary non-derivative financial instruments such as trade accounts receivable and payable, contract assets, other receivables and financial assets, other financial liabilities, receivables and liabilities from financial services, as well as financial liabilities.\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments are recognised at the settlement date, i.e. the time at which the asset is delivered to or by Jungheinrich.\n\n#### Trade accounts receivable and contract assets\n\nTrade accounts receivable and contract assets are held by the Jungheinrich Group primarily for the purpose of realising their nominal value. The contractual conditions result in cash flows at agreed times which exclusively constitute repayments and, if applicable, interest payments on the outstanding receivable amount. As a rule, the Jungheinrich Group's trade accounts receivable and contract assets have contractually agreed short-term payment terms. They are categorised as \"at amortised cost\" and measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, whereby the amortised cost corresponds to the nominal value less loss allowances.\n\nFurther information on receivables from financial services can be found in the notes on the treatment of leases.\n\n#### Non-consolidated investments in affiliated companies and joint ventures\n\nNon-consolidated investments in affiliated companies and joint ventures are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. Non-consolidated investments in affiliated companies and joint ventures are reported under \"Other financial assets\" in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n#### Other investments\n\nInvestments in companies that are neither affiliated companies, associated companies nor joint ventures are recognised under other non-current financial assets. These investments are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss and reported under \"Other financial assets\" in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Securities\n\nSecurities which are held for the purpose of holding them to maturity and realising their contractual cash flows are categorised as \"at amortised cost\" and measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. These securities are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Differences between the original amount and the amount repayable at maturity are distributed over their terms and recognised in financial income (expense). With these securities, the amortised cost corresponds to the nominal value less (plus) any discounts (premiums) and less loss allowances for expected credit losses.\n\nSecurities which are held for the purpose of selling or holding in order to realise contractual cash flows but which cannot be assigned to the category \"fair value through other comprehensive income (expense)\" are categorised as \"at fair value through profit or loss\". These securities are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the purchase of the financial instrument. The fair value corresponds to the market prices quoted on active markets. Gains and losses from these securities resulting from measurement at fair value are recognised directly in profit or loss.\n\nJungheinrich does not have any securities categorised as \"at fair value through other comprehensive income (expense)\".\n\n#### Other financial assets\n\nOther financial assets are categorised as \"at amortised cost\" and carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, in other words at the nominal value less loss allowances for expected credit losses.\n\n#### Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents are available at short notice and have an original maturity of up to three months. They also include short-term deposits with an original contractual term of up to twelve months. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortised cost; in other words, at the nominal amount less valuation allowances for expected credit losses.\n\n#### Liabilities\n\nLiabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The interest cost is recognised in accordance with the effective interest rate.\n\nLease liabilities are recognised at the beginning of the lease at present value of the outstanding lease payments using the maturity- and country-specific incremental borrowing rate and finally measured using the effective interest method at amortised cost. The lease liability's carrying amount increases by accrued interest and decreases by lease payments made. Changes to the carrying amount from remeasurement of the lease liability due to reassessments or adjustments to the lease are also taken into account.\n\n#### Impairment of financial instruments\n\nFor financial instruments in the category \"at amortised cost\", impairment losses are calculated for expected credit losses and recognised immediately in profit or loss as loss allowances.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, loss allowances for expected credit losses must be recognised at the time of initial recognition of financial assets.\n\nJungheinrich uses the simplified approach (two-level model) to measure loss allowances recognised for trade accounts receivable and contract assets. Due to the predominantly short-term maturity of these financial assets, the expected credit losses resulting from potential defaults relates to the remaining term of the trade accounts receivable and contract assets (level 2). A transfer from level 1 to level 2, as envisaged in the general impairment model (three-level model), is thus not relevant for these financial instruments.\n\nThe Jungheinrich Group has established standardised risk categories for ranges of credit rating indices. To measure the loss allowances in the consolidated financial statements, the upper limit of the range has been specified for each risk group as the Group probability of default for a twelve-month term to maturity. Trade accounts receivable and contract assets existing as at the balance sheet date are assigned to these risk categories in accordance with the individual customer rating. The loss allowances for expected credit losses are determined by applying the Group probability of default to the portfolio of receivables of the individual risk groups, while taking account of the average payment targets agreed by the respective Group companies. In the case of portfolios of receivables for which there is loan insurance, only the contractually agreed deductible is subject to a credit risk. The individual customer ratings contain forward-looking information.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\nTrade accounts receivable and contract assets are transferred to Level 3 as soon as there are objective indications of impairment affecting these financial instruments. These indications include a clear deterioration in the customer rating, registered insolvencies and a clear increase in the debtor's overdue payments. Individual event-based loss allowances are recognised for these doubtful trade accounts receivable and contract assets with an impaired credit rating.\n\nInsofar as the objective indications of impairment no longer apply and the trade accounts receivable and contract assets no longer have an impaired credit rating, the impairment losses are reversed. The financial instruments are included again in the measurement of expected credit loss allowances at Level 2.\n\nIf it can no longer be assumed, based on an appropriate evaluation, that trade accounts receivable or assets are recoverable in whole or in part, they are derecognised in line with local regulations.\n\nJungheinrich uses the three-level model to calculate potential future impairment losses for all other financial instruments in the category \"at amortised cost\". At the time of initial recognition, these financial assets are assigned to level 1, and loss allowances equal to the expected twelve-month credit losses are recognised. The probabilities of default for a twelvemonth period are based on CDS prices containing forward-looking information and the expected loss given default ratio. Parameters for loss given default ratios (LGD) reflect an assumed recoverability rate of 40 to 45 per cent. In this case, the estimated loss is calculated based on the current market price of the financial instruments and the remaining term to maturity. If the credit risk rate increases significantly in subsequent periods, these financial instruments would have to be transferred to level 2, and loss allowances equal to the expected credit loss for the remaining term to maturity would have to be recognised. Were contractual payments to become more than 30 days overdue, this would not by itself signal a significant increase in the credit risk, but it would indicate that a significant increase in the credit risk might have occurred. Jungheinrich's risk management system treats a downgrading of the counterparty's external rating below investment grade as a criterion for a significant increase in the credit risk. However, in line with Jungheinrich's risk management strategy, all other financial instruments are immediately liquidated if there is a significant increase in the creditworthiness risk.\n\nIFRS 9 requires that loss allowances be recognised for expected credit losses. These loss allowances are calculated based on estimated probabilities of default. The credit losses that actually occur in the future may deviate from the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Derivative financial instruments\n\nAt Jungheinrich, derivative financial instruments are mainly used for hedging purposes.\n\nJungheinrich has opted to continue to apply the provisions of IAS 39 when accounting for hedges, as permitted by IFRS 9.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognised at the trade date, i.e. the time the obligation to buy or sell the asset was entered into.\n\nIAS 39 requires all derivative financial instruments to be accounted for at fair value as assets or liabilities. Depending on whether the derivative is a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge, gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised in profit or loss or are otherwise recognised in shareholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income (expense)), with no effect on profit or loss. In the case of a fair value hedge, the results from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in profit or loss. The changes in the fair value of derivatives that are to be classified as cash flow hedges are initially recognised with no effect on profit or loss under shareholders' equity in the amount of the hedge-effective part. These amounts are transferred to the statement of profit or loss at the same time as the effect on the result of the underlying transaction. The hedgeineffective part is recognised directly in financial income (expense).\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\nDerivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments are categorised as \"at fair value through profit or loss\". Gains and losses from these derivative financial instruments resulting from measurement at fair value are recognised directly in profit or loss.\n\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value are classified and assigned to measurement categories according to the significance of the factors considered in their measurement. Financial instruments are assigned to levels depending on the significance their input factors have on their overall measurement. Assignments are based on the lowest level of substantial or main relevance for the measurement. The fair value hierarchy is based on the input factors used:\n\nLevel 1 – (unchanged) market prices quoted on active markets for identical assets or liabilities,\n\nLevel 2 – input data other than listed market prices, which can be observed either directly (as a price) or indirectly (derived from prices) for the asset or liability,\n\nLevel 3 – referenced input factors used for the measurement of the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.\n\nJungheinrich records reclassifications between these different measurement levels at the end of the reporting period in which the change occurred.\n\n#### Inventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of acquisition or manufacturing cost and net realisable value. Manufacturing costs include not only the direct material and manufacturing expenses, but also the attributable material and production overhead costs as well as production-related administrative expenses and depreciation. The average cost method is applied to calculate the acquisition and manufacturing costs of inventories of the same type.\n\nUtilisation risks resulting from storage time are taken into account by way of value reductions on the basis of historical usage. Once the reason for the write-downs ceases to exist, a reversal of the write-down is carried out.\n\n#### Income tax expense\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in accordance with the balance-sheetorientated method for all temporary differences between Group and tax-based valuation. This procedure is generally applicable for all assets and liabilities with the exception of goodwill from the consolidation of investments. In addition, deferred tax assets are stated on the statement of financial position to carry forward unused tax losses and unused tax credits if it is probable that they can be utilised. Deferred taxes are valued at the current rates of taxation. If it is expected that the differences will be offset in years with different rates of taxation, then the latter rates valid at that time are applied. If there are any changes in the tax rates, these changes are taken into account in the year in which the relevant changes in tax rates are approved. Actual income tax expense is recorded on the statement of financial position as of the time it was incurred. It is calculated taking into account the respective local tax legislation and current case law. The complexity of these regulations and the resulting potential for them to be interpreted in different ways means that there is uncertainty as to how individual transactions are to be treated for tax purposes. Uncertain tax positions are assessed regularly at the end of the year. These uncertain tax items are measured in accordance with IFRIC 23 by using the most likely amount. Material judgements are made in the measurement of intragroup service flows and the impairment analysis of deferred tax assets.\n\nA loss allowance is recognised for deferred tax assets, the recovery of which is improbable.\n\n#### Accumulated other comprehensive income (expense)\n\nStated in this item are changes in the shareholders' equity with no effect on profit or loss insofar as these are not based on capital transactions with shareholders. These include the currency translation adjustment, including the impact of inflation on equity that arises as a result of applying the provisions of IAS 29, as well as differences resulting from the remeasurement of defined benefit pension plans. This item also includes the unrealised gains from derivative financial instruments with a hedging relationship. Changes in the year under review are presented in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\n#### Provisions\n\nProvisions for pensions and similar obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial calculations in accordance with IAS 19 by applying the projected unit credit method for defined benefit obligations from pensions. This method takes into account pensions and vested future benefits known as at the balance sheet date, expected increases in salaries and pensions as well as demographic calculation principles. Remeasurements relating to actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets at Jungheinrich (excluding amounts included in the net interest on the net defined benefit liability) are recognised in other comprehensive income (expense) as soon as they occur and are thus disclosed directly on the statement of financial position. Remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income (expense) are a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (expense) and are not transferred to the statement of profit or loss in subsequent periods. The cost component \"service cost\" is recognised in profit or loss in the personnel costs of the corresponding functional areas. Net interest on the net liability from defined benefit pension plans is recognised in profit or loss in financial income (expense). Pension obligations and similar obligations of some foreign companies are financed by pension funds. These pension funds are qualifying plan assets pursuant to IAS 19.\n\nThe defined benefit obligation stated on the consolidated statement of financial position represents the current funding gap of the Jungheinrich Group's defined benefit pension plans.\n\nTermination benefits are recognised if the employee's employment contract is terminated before reaching the normal pension age or if an employee volunteers to terminate the employment contract in exchange for severance benefits. The Group recognises such benefits only if Jungheinrich is obliged to terminate the employment contract and provide the benefits due to a detailed formal plan, which cannot be revised, or if there is an individual agreement. Termination benefits are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19.\n\nFurthermore, provisions have been accrued to cover employee benefits due pursuant to local statutory regulations in the event of their departure, as well as to cover other employee benefits due over the short or long term. These obligations are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19.\n\nThe measurement of the long-term incentive (LTI) as a share-based performance-related component of the Board of Management's remuneration with a long-term incentive effect is carried out at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation. The obligations are recorded as personnel provisions under other provisions.\n\nOther provisions are accrued in accordance with IAS 37 if a past event results in a present obligation to third parties, it is probable that resources will be used to meet this obligation and the anticipated amount of the required provision can be reliably estimated. Other provisions are accounted for based on the best possible estimate of costs required to meet the present obligation as at the balance sheet date. If the amount of the necessary provision can only be determined within a certain bandwidth, the most probable value is stated. If all amounts are of equal probability, the mean value is stated.\n\nProvisions for restructuring measures are accrued pursuant to IAS 37 if a detailed, formal plan has been established and all the parties involved have been informed of said plan. The measures are implemented without undue delay.\n\nNon-current provisions are discounted and recognised at the present value of the expected expense. Provisions are not offset against claims under rights of recourse.\n\n#### Classification of accounts\n\nCurrent and non-current assets, as well as current and non-current liabilities, are recognised on the statement of financial position as separate classification groups. Assets and liabilities are classified as being current if their realisation or repayment is expected within twelve months from the balance sheet date. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are classified as being non-current if they have a remaining term to maturity of more than one year. Pension provisions are recognised in line with their nature under non-current liabilities as benefits due to employees in the long term. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and non-current liabilities.\n\nIndividual items in the statement of profit or loss and in the statement of financial position are summarised. They are shown separately in the notes.\n\n#### Estimates\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements, it is necessary to a certain degree to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the level and recognition of assets and liabilities stated on the statement of financial position as at the balance sheet date and of income and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions must be made primarily to determine the economic useful lives of property, plant and equipment, trucks for short-term rental and leased equipment uniformly throughout the Group, to conduct impairment tests on assets and to account for and measure provisions, including those for pensions, guarantee\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\nand disposal obligations or legal disputes. Further estimates and assumptions about the expected residual values at the end of the term of long-term customer leases must be made to measure the underlying assets. Assumptions and estimates are also necessary when determining the intrinsic value of deferred tax assets, especially on loss carryforwards, and when recognising tax items that are still uncertain. Estimates and assumptions are made on the basis of the latest knowledge available and historical experience as well as additional factors such as future expectations.\n\nThe amounts which actually materialise may deviate from the estimates. When the actual course of events deviates from the expectations, the premises and, if necessary, the carrying amounts of the affected assets and liabilities, are adjusted accordingly.\n\nTo identify any impairment of goodwill, it is necessary to calculate the recoverable value of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the goodwill has been allocated. Calculating the recoverable amount involves estimating future cash flows from the CGU, a sustainable growth rate and an appropriate discount rate for the calculation of the net present value. Any change in these and other influential factors may lead to impairment losses. Goodwill is tested for impairment once a year and also if there is any indication for impairment.\n\nAll other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and trucks for short-term rental are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication for impairment. Besides qualitative criteria, particularly macroeconomic indicators, quantitative criteria are also used to furnish indications that an impairment may occur in individual cash-generating units (CGU).\n\nJungheinrich reclassified the CGUs with effect from 1 January 2023. Previously, each legal company generally constituted a CGU. Due to changes in the long-term earnings management, particularly in the production plants, the legal companies no longer fulfil the definition of a CGU pursuant to IAS 36. The legal sales companies are usually deemed to be the new CGUs. The assets and contributions to profit of the other Group companies are allocated to the new CGUs according to a revenue formula.\n\nAt the time the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2023 were prepared, Jungheinrich assumed that Jungheinrich companies in Russia and Ukraine would continue to operate.\n\nAs a result, for the Russian CGU the carrying amounts of the intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and trucks for short-term rental were tested for impairment as at the balance sheet date. The probability of various scenarios was weighted to estimate the expected cash flows. There was no need to record an impairment for the Russian CGU as of 31 December 2023.\n\nFor the Ukrainian CGU, impairment losses on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and trucks for short-term rental were recognised in the previous year. Furthermore, the test of the property, plant and equipment and trucks for short-term rental capitalised in 2023 revealed no need for impairment or reversal of impairment.\n\nEstimates of future costs for legal disputes, warranty and disposal obligations are subject to a number of uncertainties.\n\nIt is often impossible to predict the outcome of individual lawsuits with certainty. It cannot be ruled out that, due to the final ruling on some of the outstanding lawsuits, Jungheinrich may be faced with costs that exceed the provisions accrued for this purpose and whose timing and extent cannot be predicted with certainty.\n\nWarranty and disposal obligations are subject to uncertainties surrounding the enactment of new laws and regulations, the number of affected trucks and the nature of measures to be initiated. It cannot be ruled out that the expenses actually incurred for these measures may exceed the provisions accrued for them to an unpredictable extent. Further information can be found in note (26) [ [page](#page-150-0) 149 ].\n\nAlthough expenses resulting from a necessary adjustment in provisions in the reporting period can have a significant impact on Jungheinrich's results, it is expected that any potentially ensuing obligations will not have a material effect on the Group's economic situation, particularly in light of the provisions already accrued for this purpose.\n\nAll significant risks known at the time the consolidated financial statements were prepared and affecting the assets and liabilities stated on the statement of financial position as of 31 December 2023 have been taken into consideration in preparing the statements.\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-118-0\"></span>IFRS published, adopted by the EU, and applied for the first time in the 2023 financial year\n\nAs of 1 January 2023, Jungheinrich was required to apply for the first time the amendments to IAS 12 \"Income Taxes\" published by the IASB in May 2023 and adopted by the EU in November 2023 with regard to the Pillar 2 model rules for the reform of international business taxation. The amendments contain a temporary mandatory exemption from the obligation to recognise deferred taxes resulting from the implementation of the Pillar 2 rules. In this context additional disclosures have been introduced, which Jungheinrich reports under note (11) [ [page](#page-127-0) 126 ].\n\nJungheinrich was required to apply the amendments to IAS 1 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\", published by the IASB in February 2021 and adopted by the EU in March 2022, for the first time from 1 January 2023. These amendments clarify that an entity must disclose all \"material\" accounting policy information. Previously, the standard referred to \"significant\" accounting policies. The amendments also define what is meant by \"material accounting policy information\" and how this is identified. The application of this amended standard had no material impact on the Jungheinrich consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2023.\n\nJungheinrich was required to apply the amendments to IAS 8 \"Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors\", published by the IASB in February 2021 and adopted by the EU in March 2022, for the first time from 1 January 2023. These amendments clarify how to distinguish between changes in accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates. The application of this amended standard had no material impact on the Jungheinrich consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2023.\n\nJungheinrich was required to apply the IFRS 17 \"Insurance Contracts\", published by the IASB in June 2020 and adopted by the EU in November 2021, for the first time as of 1 January 2023. This standard determines the accounting and disclosure of insurance contracts. Through another mandatory amendment published by the IASB in December 2021 and adopted by the EU in September 2022, a transition option relating to the comparative period was added. The application of this amended standard had no impact on the Jungheinrich consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2023.\n\nJungheinrich was required to apply for the first time, the amendments to IAS 12 \"Income Taxes\" published by the IASB in May 2021 and adopted by the EU in August 2022 for the first time as of 1 January 2023. These amendments require companies to recognise deferred tax assets and tax liabilities for transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences on initial recognition. The application of this amended standard had no material impact on the Jungheinrich consolidated financial statement as of December 2023.\n\n#### Published IFRS adopted by the EU and not yet applied\n\nIn September 2022, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 16 \"Leases\" regarding the measurement of the lease liability from sale and leaseback transactions. These amendments stipulate that the seller/lessee must determine \"lease payments\" and \"revised lease payments\" in the subsequent measurement of the lease liability in a manner that prevents the recognition of a gain or loss in relation to the retained right-of-use asset. No material impacts are currently expected on the consolidated financial statements. The amendments published by the IASB were adopted by the EU in November 2023 and become effective for the first time for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024.\n\nThe IASB first published amendments to IAS 1 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\" in January 2020 regarding the classification of liabilities as current or non-current. These amendments clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current is based on the rights available to the entity at the balance sheet date. No material impacts are currently expected on the consolidated financial statements. The amendments published by the IASB were adopted by the EU in December 2023 and become effective for the first time for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024.\n\n#### Published IFRS that are yet to be adopted by the EU and have not yet been applied\n\nThe other standards that have been published but not yet adopted by the EU, and not yet applied by Jungheinrich are not expected to have a material impact on the Jungheinrich Group's assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss. Jungheinrich does not currently plan to apply these standards, when these have been endorsed by the EU, until they become mandatory in later financial years.\n\n#### Scope of consolidation\n\nIn addition to the parent company, Jungheinrich AG, Hamburg, the consolidated financial statements included 89 (previous year: 82) foreign and 28 (previous year: 28) domestic (German-based) companies. The scope of consolidation comprised 101 (previous year: 93) fully consolidated subsidiaries, including one structured entity, which were directly or indirectly controlled by Jungheinrich AG. Fifteen joint ventures (previous year: 15) and one associated company (previous year: two) were accounted for using the equity method.\n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\nUniversal-FORMICA-Fonds, Frankfurt / Main, in which Jungheinrich AG holds 100 per cent of the shares, was included in the scope of consolidation as a structured entity. On the basis of contractual agreements, Jungheinrich is able to steer the activities of the special fund and thus influence the amount of return. The purpose of investments in the fund is to take advantage of opportunities to earn returns on the capital market while limiting risk. The special fund is managed to maintain value in order to limit risks.\n\nAll of the shareholdings of Jungheinrich AG, Hamburg, are disclosed in note (44) [ [page](#page-175-0) 174 ].\n\n#### Changes in the scope of consolidation\n\n#### Development of the scope of consolidation\n\n|                       | Jungheinrich AG | Subsidiaries |                 |         | Joint ventures  |         | Associated companies |  |  |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|---------|-----------------|---------|----------------------|--|--|\n|                       | Germany         | Germany      | Outside Germany | Germany | Outside Germany | Germany | Total                |  |  |\n| Balance on 01/01/2023 | 1               | 21           | 72              | 5       | 10              | 2       | 111                  |  |  |\n| Additions             | –               | 1            | 8               | –       | –               | –       | 9                    |  |  |\n| Disposals             | –               | –            | 1               | –       | –               | 1       | 2                    |  |  |\n| Balance on 31/12/2023 | 1               | 22           | 79              | 5       | 10              | 1       | 118                  |  |  |\n| Balance on 01/01/2022 | 1               | 22           | 70              | 4       | 8               | 1       | 106                  |  |  |\n| Additions             | –               | –            | 2               | 1       | 2               | 1       | 6                    |  |  |\n| Disposals             | –               | 1            | –               | –       | –               | –       | 1                    |  |  |\n| Balance on 31/12/2022 | 1               | 21           | 72              | 5       | 10              | 2       | 111                  |  |  |\n\n#### Significant acquisitions\n\nIn order to expand direct sales for racking systems and warehouse automation in North America, Jungheinrich gained control of the Storage Solutions Group (Storage Solutions) in return for a purchase price of €325.4 million on 15 March 2023 and has since held 100 per cent of the voting rights and capital shares of SSI Acquisition LLC, Westfield/Indiana (USA) and its subsidiaries. This has enlarged the scope of consolidation by seven companies, based in the USA:\n\n- SSI Acquisition LLC, Westfield/Indiana\n- SSI Holdings Inc., Westfield/Indiana\n- Storage Solutions Inc., Westfield/Indiana\n- Warehouse Solutions Inc., Westfield/Indiana\n- Logistics Handling Solutions LLC, Westfield/Indiana\n- SSI-SNC Solutions, LLC, Rancho Cucamonga/California\n- Electronic Mechanical Integration Technologies Inc., Nashville/Tennessee\n\nStorage Solutions, one of the USA's leading providers of racking and warehouse automation solutions, has been allocated to the \"Intralogistics\" segment.

The identified recognisable intangible assets primarily related to acquired customer relationships, and had a fair value of €57.4 million with an assumed useful life of 8 years. The goodwill was mainly based on the fact that the consideration transferred included amounts for the well-trained workforce acquired and the anticipated exploitation of synergies and future potential in the field of warehouse automation in the USA. Storage Solutions will form the strategic base for this future, fast-growing market in the US. With access to important logistics hubs, there is also an opportunity for Jungheinrich to support existing European customers in the US. These anticipated benefits were not recognised separately from goodwill as they do not fulfil the criteria for the recognition of intangible assets. A portion of the goodwill amounting to €56.7 million is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill of €287.1 million was allocated to Storage Solutions.\n\nThe receivables acquired were solely comprised of receivables which are expected to be recoverable. The fair values determined take into account the credit risk for expected credit losses, which was rated very low.\n\nJungheinrich measured the acquired lease liabilities at the present value of the remaining lease payments at the time of acquisition. The right-of-use assets were measured at the same amount as the lease liabilities.\n\nSince the date of acquisition, Storage Solutions has contributed revenue of €219.4 million to the revenue reported in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Its share of consolidated earnings after taxes for the same period was €13.7 million, including the effects of the purchase price allocation.\n\nIf the acquisition date of the business combination had been 1 January 2023, Group revenue and consolidated earnings after taxes for 2023 would have been approximately €5,592 million and approximately €299.9 million, respectively. When determining these figures, Jungheinrich assumed that the determined fair value adjustments made as of the date of acquisition would also have been valid in the event of an acquisition on 1 January 2023.\n\nWith a payment of €30.8 million, Jungheinrich repaid Storage Solutions' bank liabilities at the time of the acquisition.\n\nIn connection with the acquisition, an agreement was made that former shareholders who were also employees of Storage Solutions would receive further, variable payments in the coming years. The amount of these payments depends on the fulfilment of key figures laid out in the purchase agreement for the 2023, 2024 and 2025 financial years (earn-out payments). The employees included in this scheme only have a right to payment if they are still employed by Storage Solutions at the end of the respective financial year. Jungheinrich expects contingent payments of €26 million, which would be due in part for payment in 2024, 2025 and 2026.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\nThe repayment of bank liabilities and the agreed, expected future performance-related payments in 2024 to 2026 are not part of the consideration transferred in accordance with IFRS 3.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, the total costs associated with the business combination totalled approximately €10 million. These included acquisition-related costs of approximately €8 million, incurred in the reporting year and recognised in profit or loss in other operating expenses.\n\nJungheinrich has wholly acquired the Munich-based robotics specialist Magazino GmbH in order to expand and strengthen its automation expertise. Jungheinrich acquired the remaining 74.5 per cent of shares in Magazino GmbH, Munich (Germany) on 23 August 2023 for a purchase price of €20.0 million and since that date has held 100 per cent of the voting rights and capital shares in the company, which was previously classified as an associate. The company, previously recognised using the equity method, was included in the scope of consolidation as a fully consolidated company for the first time at the time of acquisition. As of 23 August 2023, the carrying amount calculated using the equity method was €8.4 million. The 25.5 per cent shares held in Magazino GmbH prior to 23 August 2023 were remeasured at the fair value applicable on that date. A loss of €2.2 million resulting from the market valuation was recognised through profit or loss in other financial income (expense) for 2023.\n\nMagazino GmbH, based in Munich, is a technology company active in the field of autonomous mobile robots and has one of Europe's largest development teams in mobile robotics. The company has a high-performance technology platform that allows the operation of logistics robots even in a mixed human-machine environment. Jungheinrich has thus added highly innovative hardware and software solutions in the rapidly growing autonomous mobile robots market to its existing portfolio of automation systems. Magazino GmbH, Munich, is allocated to the \"Intralogistics\" segment.\n\nThe purchase price for the remaining shares was provided in the form of cash and cash equivalents in the reporting year.\n\nThe consideration transferred in the amount of €26.2 million for 100 per cent of the shares in Magazino GmbH, Munich (Germany), included €20.0 million for the purchase price for the acquisition of the 74.5 per cent of the shares and €6.2 million for the fair value of the previously held 25.5 per cent of the shares in the acquired company.\n\nThe table below shows the allocation to the net assets acquired of the consideration transferred.\n\n#### Purchase price allocation at the date of acquisition\n\n| in € million                                  | Fair values |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Assets                                        |             |\n| Intangible assets                             | 25.1        |\n| Property, plant and equipment                 | 0.5         |\n| Inventories                                   | 3.0         |\n| Trade accounts receivable and contract assets | 1.6         |\n| Other receivables and other assets            | 0.2         |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                     | 1.5         |\n|                                               | 31.9        |\n| Liabilities                                   |             |\n| Other provisions                              | 0.7         |\n| Financial liabilities                         | 8.3         |\n| Trade accounts payable                        | 0.2         |\n| Contract liabilities                          | 0.2         |\n| Other liabilities                             | 4.2         |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                      | 7.5         |\n|                                               | 21.1        |\n| Net assets acquired                           | 10.8        |\n| Consideration transferred                     | 26.2        |\n| Differential amount                           | 15.4        |\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\nNon-financial report\n\nAdditional information\n\nIntangible assets in the amount of €25.1 million and goodwill totalling €15.4 million were identified as part of the purchase price allocation. The recognisable intangible assets identified as part of the purchase price allocation primarily related to acquired technologies with a fair value of €22.8 million and an assumed useful life of ten years. The goodwill was mainly based on the fact that the consideration transferred included amounts reflecting the expectation of being able to harness potential synergy effects as well as a very well qualified workforce. These benefits were not recognised separately from goodwill as they do not meet the criteria for the recognition of intangible assets. No part of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill of €15.4 million that was recorded when Magazino GmbH, Munich, was combined with the business was allocated to the sales companies in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Sweden, Poland and Spain.\n\nThe receivables acquired were solely comprised of receivables which are expected to be recoverable. The fair values determined take into account the credit risk for expected credit losses, which was rated very low.\n\nSince the date of acquisition, Magazino GmbH, Munich, has contributed revenue of €0.6 million to the revenue reported in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Its share of consolidated earnings after taxes for the same period was €– 4.5 million, including the effects of the purchase price allocation.\n\nIf the acquisition date of the business combination had been 1 January 2023, Group revenue and consolidated earnings after taxes for 2023 would have been approximately €5,548 million and approximately €293.9 million, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the acquisition of the company, it was agreed that the sellers of the shares and the employees of Magazino GmbH, Munich, at the time of acquisition would receive further variable payments in subsequent years, provided that the conditions set out in the purchase agreement were met (referred to as long-term incentive payments). The beneficiaries are only entitled to payment upon fulfilment of the performance-related key figures if they are employed by Magazino GmbH, Munich, at the contractually agreed time. Jungheinrich expects contingent payments totalling €5.0 million, which would be due for payment in 2024, 2025 and 2026. These payments are not part of the consideration transferred in accordance with IFRS 3.\n\nThe acquisition-related costs of €0.5 million were recorded in profit or loss under general administrative expenses in 2023.\n\n#### Other changes in the scope of consolidation\n\nJungheinrich Financial Services B.V., Alphen a.d. Rijn (Netherlands) took over all the assets and liabilities of the absorbed Jungheinrich Finance B.V., Alphen a.d. Rijn (Netherlands) by way of a merger by absorption as of 1 January 2023.\n\nJungheinrich Digital Solutions s.l., Madrid (Spain) was included in the scope of consolidation for the first time as of 1 January 2023. Jungheinrich established this company as an internal service provider for the development of digital products in 2018 and has since held all of the shares in the company. The net assets of €0.4 million included in the scope of consolidation for the first time at the beginning of the financial year primarily consisted of financial assets and liabilities. The first-time consolidation resulted in a negative difference of €0.4 million, which was the result of the accumulated earnings from invoices for services provided to Jungheinrich Group companies in previous years. The difference was recognised in profit or loss under other operating income for the year 2023.\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-123-0\"></span>NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS\n\n#### (3) Revenue\n\nJungheinrich generates revenue from contracts with customers by providing goods and services, both at a specific point in time and over time. The Group also generates revenue from short-term rental and lease agreements, in respect of which Jungheinrich is the lessor.\n\n#### Composition of revenue\n\n|

revenue for long-term project contracts with reference to the stage of completion of the activity.\n\nRevenue generated by the \"Financial Services\" segment includes €182,587 thousand (previous year:

thousand) as of 1 January 2023.\n\nIn addition, contract liabilities as of 1 January 2023 included €15,502 thousand (previous year: €13,731 thousand) for performance obligations satisfied by Jungheinrich in the previous year and revenue deductions contractually agreed with customers but not yet refunded. In relation to this, contract liabilities of €11,011 thousand (previous year: €9,551 thousand) were paid in the reporting year, and an amount of €2,266 thousand (previous year: €1,208 thousand) was reversed with an effect on revenue.\n\nIn the area of after-sales services, Jungheinrich concludes with customers both long-term service contracts with fixed contractual terms and short-term service contracts with the option to extend at standard market prices. With regard to long-term service contracts, the total value of performance obligations not satisfied was €1,191,644 thousand as of 31 December 2023 (previous year: €1,052,383 thousand). Jungheinrich will recognise revenue of the same amount over the remaining contractual terms when the agreed services are provided.\n\n#### Future revenue from performance obligations existing as at the balance sheet date\n\n|                                                |                      | 31/12/2023 |           |                      |         | 31/12/2022 |  |  |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------|-----------|----------------------|---------|------------|--|--|\n| in € thousand                                  | After-sales services | Other      | Total     | After-sales services | Other   | Total      |  |  |\n| Revenue recognition within one year            | 414,326              | 118,731    | 533,057   | 330,439              | 105,020 | 435,459    |  |  |\n| Revenue recognition between one and five years | 699,497              | 64,224     | 763,721   | 641,165              | 60,455  | 701,620    |  |  |\n| Revenue recognition in more than five years    | 77,821               | –          | 77,821    | 80,779               | –       | 80,779     |  |  |\n| Total                                          | 1,191,644            | 182,955    | 1,374,599 | 1,052,383            | 165,475 | 1,217,858  |  |  |\n\nThe other revenue recognition disclosed in the table relates to performance obligations for long-term project contracts, the revenue of which is recognised over time, and for which the obligations existed as at the balance sheet date and had not yet been satisfied.\n\nAll of the Jungheinrich Group's other not satisfied performance obligations existing as at the balance sheet date related to periods of no more than one year.

Income from derivatives includes all income from derivative financial instruments that do not relate to supplies and services, are not held in the special fund and were not designated as hedges as at the balance sheet date. These primarily include derivative financial instruments used to hedge foreign exchange rates when concluding intragroup financial transactions. Income from derivatives also includes changes in currency exchange rates pertaining to financing.\n\nThe loss on net monetary positions of €–3,682 thousand (previous year: €–3,826 thousand) was in connection with the annual financial statements of the Turkish sales company included in the consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in line with the provisions of IAS 29. For further details, please refer to the note on hyperinflation.\n\nIn August 2023, Jungheinrich acquired the remaining shares in Magazino GmbH, Munich.

Please see the notes for more details on changes to the scope of consolidation.\n\nOther financial income (expense) included earnings of €94 thousand (previous year: €11 thousand) from changes in loss allowances recognised in profit or loss for expected credit losses on securities, cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets, and €884 thousand (previous year: €1,048 thousand) in income from accrued interest and changes to discount rates on non-current provisions for personnel.\n\n#### (11) Income taxes\n\n#### Composition of tax expense\n\n| in € thousand   | 2023    | 2022   |\n|-----------------|---------|--------|\n| Current taxes   |         |        |\n| Germany         | 42,303  | 13,164 |\n| Outside Germany | 68,805  | 55,569 |\n| Deferred taxes  |         |        |\n| Germany         | 2,374   | 10,248 |\n| Outside Germany | -13,629 | -1,155 |\n| Tax expense     | 99,853  | 77,826 |\n\nThe current tax expense in Germany was higher than in the previous year due to higher earnings. Taxes in the previous year resulted in an expense of €3.7 million (previous year: tax income of €0.6 million).\n\nThe current tax expense outside Germany was higher than in the previous year due to higher earnings, higher tax rates and higher permanent effects. Taxes in the previous year resulted in income of €0.8 million (previous year: tax income of €0.5 million).\n\n€2.4 million (previous year: tax expense of €10.2 million) of deferred tax expense pertaining to Germany was mainly attributable to higher deferred tax liabilities for intangible assets. The deferred tax income pertaining to business outside Germany, amounting to €13.6 million (previous year: tax income of €1.1 million), was primarily caused by the reversal of deferred tax assets in connection with US loss carryforwards from the acquisition of Storage Solutions and the reduction of deferred tax liabilities on temporary differences. The Jungheinrich Group's deferred tax income in 2023 of €11.3 million (previous year: tax expense of €9.1 million) was attributable to tax income of €6.4 million (previous year: tax income of €0.3 million) from changes in loss carryforwards and tax income of €4.9 million (previous year: tax expense of €9.4 million) arising from changes in temporary differences.\n\nThe domestic (German) corporate income tax rate for the 2023 financial year was 30.6 per cent (previous year: 30.5 per cent). It continues to comprise the corporate income tax burden of 15.0 per cent along with the solidarity surcharge of 5.5 per cent of the corporate income tax burden and a trade tax rate of 14.7 per cent (previous year: 14.6 per cent).\n\nThe applied local income tax rates for foreign companies varied between 9.0 per cent (previous year: 9.0 per cent) and 35.0 per cent (previous year: 34.0 per cent).\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Group had approximately €70 million in corporate tax loss carryforwards (previous year: €73 million). Of this amount, €26 million (previous year: €46 million) related to the US loss carryforward. The loss carryforwards accrued in or before 2014 can be utilised subject to a specific time limit; those accrued later have no such limit on when they can be used.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Group had €70.3 million in utilisable corporate tax loss carryforwards (previous year: €26.2 million). The increase is largely due to the fact that the US loss carryforwards have now been classified as utilisable following the acquisition of Storage Solutions, whereas in previous years they were generally reported as non-utilisable. Loss\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\ncarryforwards also increased as a result of the full consolidation of Magazino GmbH, Munich (Germany). Valuation allowances of €6.3 million (previous year: €4.0 million) were recognised for deferred tax assets in connection with corporate income tax loss carryforwards. Of this amount, €3.5 million is attributable to loss carryforwards of German companies (previous year: €1.0 million) and €2.4 million (previous year: €2.4 million) is related to the loss carryforward in Australia. As of 31 December 2023, trade tax loss carryforwards also amounted to €29.0 million (previous year: €12.1 million). Valuation allowances of €3.2 million (previous year: €0.8 million) was recognised for deferred tax assets in connection with these loss carryforwards.\n\nIncome tax receivables and liabilities are recognised in the amount of an expected reimbursement from or payment to tax authorities based on the estimated tax rates valid as at the balance sheet date.\n\nSeveral years have not yet been conclusively assessed with regard to the Group's taxation. Jungheinrich believes that it has provided sufficiently for these outstanding tax assessment years.\n\n#### Pillar 2\n\nThe Group falls within the scope of the OECD Pillar 2 model rules. The Pillar 2 legislation has been adopted in Germany. As the new tax law only came into force in Germany from 1 January 2024, there was no impact on the actual tax expense for the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe Group applied the temporary, mandatory exemption rule with regard to the recognition of deferred taxes, which was the subject of the amendments to IAS 12 published in May 2023.\n\nThe Group has assessed the potential risk for the Group with regard to income taxes in accordance with Pillar 2.\n\nThe potential risk of income taxes under Pillar 2 was assessed on the basis of country-bycountry reporting (CbCR) and the Group's IFRS separate financial statements. Based on this assessment, the effective tax rates in most of the countries in which the Group operates are above 15 per cent. However, there are a limited number of countries where the effective tax rate under Pillar 2 is close to 15 per cent. The Group does not anticipate any material income tax charge under Pillar 2 in these countries.\n\nWhen stating deferred tax assets on the statement of financial position, the extent to which future effective tax relief might result from existing tax loss carryforwards and the differences in accounting and valuation must be assessed. In this context, all factors that could have a positive or negative influence have been taken into account. The current assessment in this regard may alter depending on changes to the earnings position in future years and may therefore result in a higher or lower impairment loss.\n\n#### Composition of deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\n|                                                            | Deferred tax assets |            | Deferred tax liabilities |            |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------|--------------------------|------------|\n| in € thousand                                              | 31/12/2023          | 31/12/2022 | 31/12/2023               | 31/12/2022 |\n| Property, plant and equipment<br>and intangible assets     | 357,058             | 337,723    | 142,310                  | 118,346    |\n| Inventories                                                | 19,897              | 13,981     | 12,294                   | 9,591      |\n| Receivables and other assets                               | 43,749              | 33,809     | 573,241                  | 512,427    |\n| Tax loss carryforwards                                     | 18,183              | 7,140      | –                        | –          |\n| Provisions for pensions<br>and similar obligations         | 21,867              | 15,920     | 726                      | 1,837      |\n| Other provisions                                           | 38,816              | 20,879     | 12,602                   | 9,648      |\n| Liabilities                                                | 520,187             | 463,740    | 192,095                  | 149,755    |\n| Deferred income                                            | 4,413               | 4,223      | –                        | –          |\n| Valuation allowances                                       | -12,596             | -7,111     | –                        | –          |\n| Other                                                      | 29,638              | 23,774     | 44,704                   | 48,748     |\n| Deferred taxes prior to offsetting                         | 1,041,212           | 914,078    | 977,972                  | 850,352    |\n| of which relating to non-current<br>assets and liabilities | 843,202             | 776,098    | 831,075                  | 677,425    |\n| Offsetting                                                 | -920,902            | -806,457   | -920,902                 | -806,457   |\n| Balance sheet recognition                                  | 120,310             | 107,621    | 57,070                   | 43,895     |\n\n€25,478 thousand (previous year: €14,360 thousand) of the net amount of the deferred taxes of €63,240 thousand (previous year: €63,726 thousand) was recognised directly in shareholders' equity.

This is because Jungheinrich is able to manage the timing of the reversal of temporary differences, and no turnaround is expected with regard to the temporary differences in the near future.\n\nThe following table shows the reconciliation of the expected amount with the disclosed tax expense. The expected tax expense reported represents the amount that results from applying the total tax rate of 30.6 per cent (previous year: 30.5 per cent) applicable to the parent company to consolidated earnings before income taxes. The figure for \"Change in taxes from the previous year\" arose as a result of deviations in assessments and company audits and an adjustment of deferred taxes. The change in valuation allowances is mainly attributable to the fact that loss carryforwards could be made utilisable following the acquisitions of Storage Solutions and Magazino GmbH, Munich (Germany) in 2023.\n\n#### Reconciliation of the expected tax expense to the disclosed tax expense\n\n| in € thousand                                        | 2023    | 2022

Please see the notes for more details on changes to the scope of consolidation.\n\nAn event-driven impairment test as of 31 December 2023 of the intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and trucks for short-term rental acquired revealed impairment losses on acquired intangible assets in the total amount of €379 thousand at the sales company in Ecuador resulting from a reduction in the future expected cash flows of the CGU. The estimate of the value in use for the Ecuador CGU, of €6,325 thousand, was calculated using a pre-tax discount rate of 23.8 per cent (previous year: 25.4 per cent). The impairment losses were recognised in selling expenses for 2023.\n\nJungheinrich Systemlösungen Deutschland AG & Co. KG (formerly: ISI Automation GmbH & Co.

The residual carrying amounts for the customer contracts acquired as part of the business combination totalling €953 thousand were derecognised through profit or loss in the year under review. The impairment losses were recognised in cost of sales for 2023.\n\nInternally generated intangible assets include the Jungheinrich Group's capitalised development expenditure. In the reporting year, €44,632 thousand in incurred development expenditure (previous year: €30,422 thousand) met the capitalisation criteria under IFRS.\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-131-0\"></span>Research and development costs in the consolidated statement of profit or loss\n\n| in € thousand                                                         | 2023    | 2022    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Research costs and uncapitalised development expenditure              | 107,160 | 97,443  |\n| Amortisation of capitalised development expenditure                   | 10,904  | 12,313  |\n| Impairment loss of capitalised development expenditure                | 4,163   | 3,347   |\n| Reversal of impairment loss of<br>capitalised development expenditure | 1,554   | –       |\n| Research and development costs                                        | 120,673 | 113,103 |\n\nJungheinrich decided in the year under review to discontinue the development of a technology. Development expenditure of €3,240 thousand already capitalised for this development project was recognised as an impairment in profit or loss under the 2023 research and development costs.\n\nAn event-driven impairment test as of 31 December 2023 of the intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and trucks for short-term rental acquired revealed impairment losses in the total amount of €923 thousand at six sales companies, primarily due to an increase in pre-tax discount rates in the sales region as of 31 December 2023, which were fully allocated to the capitalised development expenditure allocated to these CGUs. All impairment losses were recognised in the research and development costs for 2023.\n\nA need for an impairment reversal totalling €1,554 thousand as of 31 December 2023 was identified in seventeen sales companies. The reversals related to capitalised development services allocated to these sales companies from the plant in Qingpu/Shanghai (China) and resulted from the expansion of the plant's sales regions. The reversals were fully assigned to the capitalised development expenditure carrying amounts for products already in series production, and were reported as reversals of impairment losses in the amount of €1,554 thousand in profit or loss under the 2023 research and development costs.\n\nThe table below shows the allocation of goodwill to CGUs.\n\n#### Allocation of goodwill to the cash-generating units (CGUs)\n\n| in € thousand                                                                                                             | 31/12/2022 | Additions due to business combinations | Reallocation | Changes in currency exchange rates | 31/12/2023 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------|------------|\n| Storage Solutions                                                                                                         | –          | 287,148                                | –            | -13,019                            | 274,129    |\n| MIAS Group                                                                                                                | 24,109     | –                                      | –            | –                                  | 24,109     |\n| Sales company in:                                                                                                         |            |                                        |              |                                    |            |\n| Germany                                                                                                                   | 27,702     | 7,767                                  | 487          | –                                  | 35,956     |\n| France                                                                                                                    | 6,664      | 1,868                                  | 117          | –                                  | 8,649      |\n| United Kingdom                                                                                                            | 5,009      | 1,474                                  | 93           | 86                                 | 6,662      |\n| Italy                                                                                                                     | 5,194      | 1,456                                  | 91           | –                                  | 6,741      |\n| Sweden                                                                                                                    | 3,536      | 1,110                                  | 70           | 80                                 | 4,796      |\n| Poland                                                                                                                    | 3,061      | 838                                    | 53           | 255                                | 4,207      |\n| Spain                                                                                                                     | 2,984      | 837                                    | 53           | –                                  | 3,874      |\n| Serbia                                                                                                                    | 1,831      | –                                      | –            | 5                                  | 1,836      |\n| Austria                                                                                                                   | 1,771      | –                                      | –            | –                                  | 1,771      |\n| Jungheinrich Systemlösungen<br>GmbH, Graz (Austria)                                                                       | 102        | –                                      | -102         | –                                  | –          |\n| Jungheinrich Systemlösungen<br>Deutschland AG & Co.

Please see the notes for more details on changes to the scope of consolidation.\n\nThe goodwill acquired as part of the business combination with Magazino in 2023 was allocated to the sales companies in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Sweden, Poland and Spain. Please see the notes for more details on changes to the scope of consolidation.\n\nAs at the previous year's balance sheet date, goodwill totalling €862 thousand and €102 thousand was allocated to the CGUs Jungheinrich Systemlösungen Deutschland AG & Co. KG, Extertal (Germany) and Jungheinrich Systemlösungen GmbH, Graz (Austria). Jungheinrich reclassified the CGUs with effect from 1 January 2023. This goodwill was reallocated to seven sales companies as a result at the same time. The review of this goodwill as of 31 December 2022 did not result in any impairment losses.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Jungheinrich performed annual impairment tests on the goodwill assigned to CGUs. The review of goodwill did not result in any impairment losses.\n\nThe main assumptions on which the calculation of the value in use of a CGU was based were free cash flows, the discount rate and the long-term growth rate.\n\n| Financial assumptions for the purposes of calculating the value in use of the CGUs

Receivables from financial services\n\nWithin the framework of the financial services business in which Jungheinrich Group companies act as lessors, the net investment values of customer leases classified as \"finance leases\" in accordance with IFRS are capitalised as receivables from financial services from the beginning of the lease onwards. If the agreed residual value in the long-term customer contract is above the truck's expected market value at the end of the contract term, this risk is reflected by immediately reducing receivables from financial services recognised in profit or loss. Furthermore, the receivables from financial services reported as at the balance sheet date only include lease payments due in the future, and the carrying amounts are 100 per cent secured by the fair values of the trucks underlying the leases. This is why loss allowances for expected credit losses are not taken into account.\n\nLoss allowances for expected credit losses are determined for the amounts transferred to trade accounts receivable when the lease payments fall due, and they are recognised in note (19) [ [page](#page-141-0) 140 ].\n\nIn relation to the \"finance lease\" customer contracts valid as at the balance sheet date, the future lease payments to be paid to Jungheinrich are presented in the following table, broken down by maturity.\n\n#### Receivables from financial services: Maturity analysis and reconciliation of total outstanding lease payments with their net investment value\n\n| in € thousand                              | 31/12/2023       | 31/12/2022       |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Due in the following year                  | 513,163          | 457,324          |\n| Due in the second year                     | 415,079          | 368,697          |\n| Due in the third year                      | 326,281          | 281,189          |\n| Due in the fourth year                     | 237,015          | 195,433          |\n| Due in the fifth year                      | 143,997          | 110,375          |\n| Due in more than five years                | 109,175          | 72,647           |\n| <b>Total outstanding lease payments</b>    | <b>1,744,710</b> | <b>1,485,665</b> |\n| Plus unguaranteed residual value           | 189,683          | 172,259          |\n| Less unrealised interest income            | 283,007          | 195,217          |\n| <b>Receivables from financial services</b> | <b>1,651,386</b> | <b>1,462,707</b> |\n\nIn the reporting year, Jungheinrich realised income of around €148 million (previous year: around €100 million) from the difference between additions to \"finance lease\" customer contracts and the carrying amounts of the underlying assets.\n\nReceivables from financial services with carrying amounts of €824,967 thousand (previous year: €741,486) were pledged as collateral for liabilities from financial services as at the balance sheet date.\n\n#### (21) Other receivables and other assets\n\n#### Composition of other receivables and other assets\n\n| in € thousand                                       | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Receivables from other taxes                        | 41,467     | 41,632     |\n| Assets from the measurement of funded pension plans | 2,614      | 6,784      |\n| Prepaid expenses                                    | 19,858     | 16,309     |\n| Other financial assets                              | 14,367     | 18,000     |\n| Miscellaneous other assets                          | 19,649     | 19,593     |\n\nPrepaid expenses primarily consisted of deferred prepayments for software usage fees and insurance premiums.\n\nOther financial assets included receivables from joint ventures of €12,931 thousand (previous year: €15,364 thousand).

With this in mind, Jungheinrich absorbed the additional expenses incurred by the suppliers when purchasing electronic parts as a result of price increases. The suppliers use these electronic parts to make electronic components. As regards parts still in supplier inventories as of 31 December 2022, claims vis-à-vis suppliers of €2,091 thousand were recorded in miscellaneous other assets as of 31 December 2022. Jungheinrich ordered electronic components from suppliers in line with its incoming orders, which reduced receivables in 2023 by €1,187 thousand. The remaining claims vis-à-vis suppliers amounting to €904 thousand were derecognised through profit or loss in the year under review, as Jungheinrich will no longer have any significant consumption of these electronic components in future due to a redesign of the control units.\n\nThe credit risk for all other financial assets was rated as very low. As at the balance sheet date, loss allowances totalling €4 thousand were recognised for expected credit losses (previous year: €15 thousand). Details on the development of loss allowances can be found in note (33) [ [page](#page-155-0) 154 ].\n\nNo other receivables and other assets were either past due or impaired. As at the balance sheet date, there was no indication that the debtors could not meet their payment obligations.\n\n#### (22) Securities\n\n#### Composition of securities\n\n| in € thousand                                | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Commercial papers, bonds and debenture bonds | 87,897     | 131,736    |\n| Investment funds                             | 26,936     | 20,000     |\n| Promissory notes                             | 20,000     | 8,641      |\n| Covered bonds                                | 15,614     | 27,992     |\n| Shares                                       | –          | 9,751      |\n| Valuation allowances                         | -11        | -129       |\n| Securities                                   | 150,436    | 197,991    |\n\nThe total portfolio of securities included €28,999 thousand (previous year: €53,055 thousand) in financial instruments assigned to the measurement category \"at amortised cost\" as of 31 December 2023. These securities were held by Jungheinrich for the purpose of holding them to maturity and realising their contractual cash flows. Jungheinrich's securities as of 31 December 2023 will mature in the years 2024 and 2025. All of Jungheinrich's securities as of 31 December 2022 that were due to mature in 2023 were redeemed when they matured, as contractually agreed. The credit risk for securities measured at amortised cost was rated as low, with the result that the loss allowances were calculated based on the expected twelve-month credit losses. As at the balance sheet date, loss allowances in the amount of €11 thousand were recognised for expected credit losses in relation to these securities (previous year: €129 thousand). Details on the development of loss allowances can be found in note (33).\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, the total portfolio of securities also included €121,448 thousand (previous year: €145,065 thousand) in financial instruments assigned to the measurement category \"at fair value through profit or loss\". €94,512 thousand (previous year: €119,151 thousand) of the carrying amount of these financial instruments is attributable to securities held in the special fund.\n\n#### (23) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents are available at short notice and have an original maturity of up to three months. They also include fixed-term deposits with an original contractual term of up to twelve months. As at the balance sheet date, cash and cash equivalents included bank balances of €35,386 thousand (previous year: €6,814 thousand) held in the special fund, of which €23,500 thousand (previous year: €-thousand) related to term deposits with an original term of over three months and without the option of termination at no cost at short notice. €9,051 thousand (previous year: €9,368 thousand) in bank balances were pledged to banks as of 31 December 2023. As at the balance sheet date, loss allowances in the amount of €48 thousand were recognised for expected credit losses (previous year: €13 thousand).

As in the previous year, it was divided among 54,000,000 ordinary shares and 48,000,000 preferred shares, each accounting for an imputed €1.00 share of the subscribed capital. All of the shares had been issued as at the balance sheet date.\n\nHolders of no-par-value preferred shares will receive a preferential share of the profit of €0.04 per preferred share from the distributable profit that is distributed. On payment of a €0.04 share of the profit per ordinary share, the distributable profit remaining for distribution will be distributed among ordinary and preferred shareholders in line with the pro rata share of subscribed capital attributable to their shares, although unlike ordinary shareholders, preferred shareholders are entitled to an additional dividend of €0.02 per preferred share.\n\n#### Capital reserve\n\nThe capital reserve includes premiums from the issuance of shares and additional income from the sale of own shares in previous years.\n\n#### Retained earnings\n\nRetained earnings include undistributed earnings generated by Jungheinrich AG and consolidated subsidiaries in previous years, as well as profit or loss attributable to shareholders of Jungheinrich AG for the reporting period.\n\nIn the reporting year, a dividend for the 2022 financial year of €0.66 per ordinary share and €0.68 per preferred share was paid to the shareholders of Jungheinrich AG.\n\n#### Dividend proposal\n\nJungheinrich AG pays its dividend from the distributable profit stated in the annual financial statements of Jungheinrich AG, which are prepared in accordance with the German Commercial Code. The Board of Management of Jungheinrich AG proposes to use the €124,425 thousand distributable profit for the 2023 financial year to make a total dividend payment of €75,420 thousand, corresponding to a dividend of €0.73 per ordinary share and €0.75 per preferred share, as well as to transfer €49,005 thousand to other retained earnings.\n\n#### Accumulated other comprehensive income (expense)\n\n=\n\n🔍\n\n>\n\n<\n\n<<\n\nChanges in equity not recognised through profit or loss are reported in this item, provided they are not based on capital transactions with shareholders. The development of other changes in equity in the reportijng year and the previous year are recognised as other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income after taxes was exclusivly attributable to the shareholders of Jungheinrich AG.\n\nOther changes in equity in the amount of €– 64,866 thousand (previous year: €– 42,732 thousand) were attributable to the accumulated profit or loss recognised in other comprehensive income from the remeasurement of defined benefit pension plans. Details on the composition of the unrealised income of the reporting year can be found in note (25) [ [page](#page-146-0) 145 ]. As at the balance sheet date, other changes in equity included €–47,267 thousand (previous year: €–21,882 thousand) from the currency translation adjustment, including the impact of inflation on equity that arises as a result of applying the provisions of IAS 29.\n\nIn addition, other comprehensive income of €1,955 thousand (previous year: €13,866 thousand) related to the accumulated profit or loss recognised in other comprehensive income arising from the measurement at fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments as at the balance sheet date.

Please see the notes for the definition and calculation of ROCE in the combined management report for the 2023 financial year.\n\nROCE in the year under review was 15.9 per cent (previous year: 16.3 per cent).\n\n#### EBIT return on capital employed (ROCE) for the \"Intralogistics\" segment\n\n| in € thousand                  | 2023      | 2022      |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Average capital employed 31/12 | 2,563,471 | 2,084,951 |\n| EBIT                           | 407,063   | 340,113   |\n| ROCE in %                      | 15.9      | 16.3      |\n\nJungheinrich determines the key figure when preparing its quarterly financial statements. The statements are reported to the Board of Management once a quarter in order to enable it to take action as necessary.\n\n#### Non-controlling interests\n\nAs of 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, there were no non-controlling interests in equity.\n\n#### (25) Provisions for pensions and similar obligations\n\n#### Pension plans\n\nJungheinrich Group company pension schemes are either defined contribution or defined benefit plans. In defined contribution plans, Jungheinrich does not assume any obligation in addition to the contributions made to state-owned or private pension insurers. In the reporting year, expenses of €14,648 thousand for defined contribution plans (previous year: €16,432 thousand) were recognised in functional costs.\n\nIn Germany, major obligations have been assumed for defined benefit pension commitments regulated in individual and collective agreements for members of the Board of Management, managing directors and employees of Jungheinrich AG and its German subsidiaries. When pension benefits are committed to within the framework of collective agreements, the amount of the pension claim depends on the individual's number of eligible years of service when pension payments are scheduled to start, as well as on the monthly average salary of the beneficiary. German pension plans are funded by provisions. The company pension plans of Jungheinrich AG and of Jungheinrich Moosburg AG & Co. KG have been closed to managing directors and employees since 1 July 1987 and 14 April 1994 respectively.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, major obligations have been assumed to fulfil defined benefit pension commitments regulated in collective agreements and due to employees of Jungheinrich UK Ltd. and former employees of the Boss Manufacturing Ltd. production plant, which was closed in 2004. The pension plans of these companies were merged in 2003. The level of the benefit commitment depends on the average compensation received by the beneficiaries during their years of service. The pension plan is funded by an outsourced fund and has been closed to new employees of the two companies since 1 October 2002 and 18 January 2003 respectively. The pension plan was closed to current employees with effect from 31 July 2020. As a result, since 1 August 2020 employees have not been able to accrue any additional benefit claims by completing more years of service. The benefit claims accrued up until the plan was closed will continue to be adjusted in line with changes in the basis for calculating them.\n\nIn other countries outside of Germany, several companies have pension plans for managing directors and employees. The principle pension claims outside Germany are covered by insurance contracts.\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Balance sheet development of the net defined benefit

The net interest and the plan administration costs were included in financial income (expense).\n\n#### Significant financial assumptions (weighted average) for determining the present value of defined benefit obligations\n\n|                                      | Germany    |            | United Kingdom |            | Other countries |            |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|----------------|------------|-----------------|------------|\n| in %                                 | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 | 31/12/2023     | 31/12/2022 | 31/12/2023      | 31/12/2022 |\n| Discount rate                        | 3.5        | 4.2        | 4.8            | 5.0        | 2.3             | 3.0        |\n| Expected rate of<br>pension increase | 2.0        | 2.0        | 2.9            | 3.0        | 0.2             | 0.1        |\n\nThe demographic assumptions for Germany in the 2023 and 2022 financial years were based on Prof. Klaus Heubeck's 2018G mortality tables. In addition to the long-term pension trend of 2.0 per cent, adjustments of 5.3 per cent and 3.0 per cent were assumed for Germany for 2024 and 2025, in order to adequately account for the accumulated inflation for the upcoming adjustment dates.\n\nIn the reporting year, the valuation of pension plans in the United Kingdom was based on the SAPS S3PxA CMI 2022 mortality table (1.25 per cent) (previous year: SAPS S3PxA CMI 2021 (1.25 per cent)). The application of the new mortality table in the United Kingdom resulted in a reduction in the present value of defined benefit obligations of €3,799 thousand (previous year: €185 thousand) as at the balance sheet date. The life expectancies used to measure plans in other countries were based on local mortality tables.\n\nJungheinrich primarily derives the interest rate risk, the pension increase risk and the longevity risk from the pension plans. The sensitivity analyses presented below were performed on the basis of reasonable potential changes in the assumptions as at the balance sheet date, while the other assumptions remained unchanged.\n\n#### Sensitivity analysis of the significant financial assumptions: impact on the present value of defined benefit obligations\n\n| in € thousand                                 | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Discount rate 0.5% higher                     | -21,631    | -19,753    |\n| Discount rate 0.5% lower                      | 23,876     | 22,034     |\n| Expected rate of pension increase 0.5% higher | 15,621     | 11,477     |\n| Expected rate of pension increase 0.5% lower  | -12,607    | -10,287    |\n\nA one-year increase in life expectancy would cause the present value of the defined benefit obligations in Germany and the United Kingdom to rise by approximately 4.6 per cent (previous year: 4.2 per cent) and 2.8 per cent (previous year: 2.8 per cent), respectively.\n\nThe actual change in the present value of defined benefit obligations cannot be derived from the aforementioned sensitivity analysis. It is not expected that the deviations will occur in isolation from one another as some of the assumptions are related to each other.\n\nFurthermore, Jungheinrich is not exposed to any material risks arising from pension obligations.\n\nThe weighted average duration of defined benefit obligations on the balance sheet date was around 10 years in Germany (previous year: 10 years), around 14 years in the United Kingdom (previous year: 13 years) and around 13 years in other countries (previous year: 9 years).\n\nJungheinrich expects to make approximately €10.1 million (previous year: €9.7 million) in pension payments using company assets in the 2024 financial year.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\n#### Plan assets\n\nIn the year under review, the actual return on plan assets amounted to €7,439 thousand (previous year: €– 97,249 thousand). As in the previous year, there were no effects from a limitation to the asset ceiling.\n\nPlan assets largely comprised the outsourced fund set up to cover pension obligations in the UK. The assets and income from the pension fund are intended exclusively for the payment of benefits and administrative expenses for the pension plan. Jungheinrich works with an external asset manager to invest in the plan assets. Our long-term investment strategy complies with, among other things, minimum capital cover requirements and the goal of maximising income from the plan assets while keeping volatility at a reasonable level in order to minimise the long-term costs of defined benefit pension plans. Plan asset investments are made while ensuring that cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to cover benefits that fall due.\n\n#### Composition of the fair value of the plan assets in the United Kingdom\n\n| in € thousand                                              | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                  | 1,420      | 1,494      |\n| Equity instruments                                         | 32,028     | 34,903     |\n| Stock index funds in the United Kingdom                    | 19,113     | 20,614     |\n| Stock index funds in Europe (excluding the United Kingdom) | 12,915     | 14,289     |\n| Debt instruments                                           | 132,503    | 130,037    |\n| United Kingdom government bonds                            | 116,673    | 111,592    |\n| Corporate bonds                                            | 15,830     | 18,445     |\n| Miscellaneous                                              | 2,100      | –          |\n| Fair value on 31/12                                        | 168,051    | 166,434    |\n\nThe fair values of the aforementioned equity and debt instruments were determined on the basis of prices quoted on active markets.\n\nThe fair value of plan assets in the other countries totalled €61,864 thousand (previous year: €54,582 thousand) and cannot be broken down into asset classes as these plan assets are qualifying insurance policies.\n\nAs in the previous year, the outsourced pension funds did not include any own financial instruments or property used by Group companies as at the balance sheet date.\n\nJungheinrich expects to make cash-effective employer contributions totalling approximately €4.7 million for the 2024 financial year (previous year: €4.2 million) in order to comply with minimum statutory and contractual requirements.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-150-0\"></span>(26) Other provisions\n\n#### Development of other provisions\n\n| in € thousand                       | Balance as of<br>01/01/2023 | Changes<br>in currency<br>exchange rates | Additions from<br>business<br>combinations | Additions | Utilisations | Releases | Balance as<br>of 31/12/2023 |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|----------|-----------------------------|\n| Provisions for personnel            | 185,561                     | –1,774                                   | 7,529                                      | 198,193   | 141,061      | 5,221    | 243,227                     |\n| Provisions for warranty obligations | 63,500                      | –401                                     | 4                                          | 97,805    | 89,566       | 3,024    | 68,318                      |\n| Provisions for onerous contracts    | 54,969                      | –258                                     | –                                          | 21,897    | 22,683       | 2,034    | 51,891                      |\n| Other provisions                    | 54,307                      | –875                                     | 365                                        | 31,735    | 11,707       | 4,472    | 69,353                      |\n| Other provisions                    | 358,337                     | –3,308                                   | 7,898                                      | 349,630   | 265,017      | 14,751   | 432,789                     |\n\nProvisions for personnel as of 31 December 2023 primarily related to provisions for obligations arising from phased retirement agreements, anniversary obligations, performance-related remuneration and holiday entitlements.\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, obligations arising from phased retirement agreements amounted to €28,339 thousand (previous year: €25,937 thousand), which were netted against €15,656 thousand in financial assets (previous year: €12,956 thousand). Cash and cash equivalents and securities were transferred to an external trust in order to finance these obligations. These trust assets are being exclusively held to secure long-term benefits due to employees within the scope of phased retirement agreements and qualify as plan assets in accordance with IAS 19. The cash and cash equivalents and securities are not freely available due to the hedging role they play for these agreements. Furthermore, €1,523 thousand in provisions were accrued to cover the claims of candidates potentially qualifying for future phased retirement work arrangements commensurate to their probability of occurrence (previous year: €3,300 thousand).\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, there were also obligations related to performance-based payments totalling €21,858 thousand (previous year: €7,389 thousand), which were agreed in connection with business combinations. These earn-out payments are accumulated under personnel provisions until the individual tranches are due.\n\nAdditions to provisions for personnel included a total of €884 thousand in interest accretions and changes in discount rates (previous year: €–1,048 thousand), which were recognised in the other financial income (expense) for the year under review. €42,237 thousand (previous year: €32,271 thousand) of the provisions for personnel had a remaining maturity of more than one year. The increase in the non-current item was primarily due to additions to performance-based payment obligations in connection with business combinations.\n\nThe Group recognises provisions for warranty obligations based on past experience when products are sold or when new warranty measures are initiated. These provisions relate to the assessment of the extent to which warranty obligations must be met in the future, and to the cost involved. Provisions for warranty obligations contain the expected expense of statutory and contractual warranty claims as well as the expected expense of voluntary concessions and recall actions. Additions to warranty obligations cover the product-related warranty expenses for the 2023 financial year for material handling equipment sold in the year under review.\n\nThe provisions for onerous contracts primarily related to impending losses from contracts with customers. Impending losses from cancellations of contracts and other contractual risks were also recognised.\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, €6,923 thousand (previous year: €4,647 thousand) of the provisions for onerous contracts had a remaining term to maturity of more than one year.\n\nOther provisions contained provisions for disposal obligations, legal disputes, environmental risks and other obligations. €40,832 thousand (previous year: €29,714 thousand) of the other provisions had a remaining term to maturity of more than one year as at the balance sheet date. The increase in non-current other provisions related primarily to further additions to provisions for disposal obligations.\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### (27)

In such cases, due to the contractually agreed repurchase obligations, Jungheinrich Group companies had commercial ownership despite the sale of the trucks to the leasing company/bank. The resultant IFRS obligation to capitalise this ownership led to the deferral of the sales proceeds that have already been received from the leasing company. This deferred income is reversed using the straight-line method with an effect on revenue until the agreed residual value is paid.\n\nDeferred profit from financial services related to sale and leaseback transactions for refinancing trucks for lease that were concluded before the initial application of IFRS 16 \"Leases\". Deferred profit is reversed over the remaining terms of the leases.\n\nOther deferrals as of 31 December 2023 included €707 thousand (previous year: €5,363 thousand) in government grants. Deferred government grants for acquired property, plant and equipment totalling €4,427 thousand as of 31 December 2022 were derecognised from other deferrals at the beginning of the 2023 financial year and recognised as a reduction in the acquisition and manufacturing costs of the property, plant and equipment on which the grants are based.\n\n#### (32) Other liabilities\n\n#### Composition of

was determined in line with generally acknowledged valuation models based on discounted cash flow analyses and using observable current market prices for similar instruments. The fair value of currency forwards is determined using the mean spot rate as at the balance sheet date, adjusted up or down to reflect the remaining term of the futures contract. The fair value of interest rate derivatives is determined on the basis of the market interest rates and interest rate curves on the balance sheet date, taking their maturities into account. Jungheinrich has taken counterparty risks into consideration when measuring fair value.\n\nThe fair value of Level 3 financial instruments related to other financial assets.

The fair value for these shares was calculated based on amortised cost as at the balance sheet date.\n\nNo transfers between Levels 1 and 2 took place in the reporting period.\n\nFurther information on measurement levels is provided in the chapter on accounting principles.\n\nCurrent interest rates at which comparable loans with identical maturities as at the balance sheet date could have been taken out were used to determine the fair values of liabilities due to banks, promissory notes and commercial papers, as well as of receivables and liabilities from financial services.\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\nThe fair values of interest-bearing securities with maturities categorised as \"at amortised cost\" corresponded to the fair values available as at the balance sheet date.\n\nCash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable primarily have short terms of maturity. Their carrying amounts as at the balance sheet date therefore roughly corresponded to their fair values.\n\nFor non-current other financial assets with variable interest rates, it was assumed for reasons of simplicity that their fair values correspond to their carrying amounts since the interest rates contractually agreed and realisable on the market were virtually at the same level. For the current other financial assets, their carrying amounts as at the balance sheet date approximated their fair values.\n\nOther financial assets comprise investments in non-consolidated affiliated companies, joint ventures and other investments and were measured at fair value in the consolidated financial statements. The shares did not have a quoted market price. The fair value for these shares was calculated based on amortised cost as at the balance sheet date.\n\n#### Development of the fair value of Level 3 financial instruments\n\n| in € thousand

was assumed that the fair values of trade accounts payable and other financial liabilities corresponded to the carrying amounts of these financial instruments owing to their short remaining terms to maturity.\n\nAs regards liabilities from financing trucks for short-term rental with variable interest rates, it was assumed for reasons of simplicity that their fair values corresponded to their carrying amounts since the interest rates agreed and realisable on the market were almost identical.\n\nThe carrying amounts of current, interest-bearing financial liabilities corresponded almost exactly to their fair values.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Hierarchy levels for financial instruments which are not measured at fair value and for which the

statement of cash flows\n\nCash flows have been presented in the statement of cash flows independently of the structure of the statement of financial position and are broken down into cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash flows from investing and financing activities were directly attributed to corresponding cash flows. Cash flow from operating activities was derived indirectly.\n\nCash flow from operating activities was derived from profit or loss, which was adjusted to exclude non-cash income and expenses, mainly consisting of depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses, along with monetary profit or loss resulting from the application of IAS 29. Changes in working capital are also taken into account. Cash flow from operating activities also included changes in the carrying amounts of trucks for short-term rental and trucks for lease as well as liabilities and deferred revenue and profit stemming from the financing of these assets. Changes to carrying amounts for right-of-use assets on property, plant and equipment, and non-cash changes and the interest portion of lease payments for the corresponding lease liabilities are also reported under cash flow from operating activities.\n\nCash flow from investing activities included disposals and additions on property, plant and equipment without right-of-use assets capitalised and intangible assets and in particular additions in capitalised development expenditure. In addition, the cash flow from investing activities includes: purchases and sales of securities; inflows and outflows from time deposits with an original term of more than three months and without a short-term, cost-free termination option; inflows and outflows for loans granted to related parties; purchase price payments for business combinations, and payments for investments in companies accounted for using the equity method and other financial assets, as well as inflows from the sale of other financial assets. Cash flow from investing activities of €–325.7 million in 2023 was affected by the purchase price for the acquisition of Storage Solutions and Magazino GmbH, Munich (Germany), less acquired cash and cash equivalents.\n\nCash flow from financing activities included capital-related transactions, dividend payments, cash flow from obtaining and repaying long-term financial loans including promissory notes and commercial papers, and changes in short-term liabilities due to banks. In addition, the repayment portion of the lease payments were reported under cash flow from financing activities in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 16 \"Leases\". Cash flow from financing activities of €300.0 million in 2023 related to the purchase price financing for the acquisition of Storage Solutions, which was reported under changes in short-term liabilities to banks.\n\nThe changes to the balance sheet items shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows cannot be traced directly back to the consolidated statement of financial position, because non-cash effects resulting from currency translations and changes to the scope of consolidation are calculated out.\n\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the year correspond to the amount disclosed for cash and cash equivalents on the statement of financial position, less the cash and cash equivalents not freely available to Jungheinrich. The way the balance sheet item for cash and cash equivalents reconciles in respect of the figures for cash and cash equivalents according to the consolidated statement of cash flows can be seen in the table below.\n\n#### Derivation of cash and cash equivalents according to the consolidated statement of cash flows:\n\n| in € thousand

companies are involved in ongoing legal or arbitration proceedings that could have a considerable impact on the Group's economic situation, are likely to become involved in such litigation, or had done so within the last two years.\n\nThe respective Group companies have accrued provisions sufficient to cover financial burdens potentially resulting from other legal or arbitration proceedings.\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, Jungheinrich had issued letters of comfort for joint ventures and associated companies to secure €10,920 thousand in credit lines (previous year: €19,988 thousand). Against the backdrop of the companies' appropriate funding, it was assumed that the underlying obligations would be met; no withdrawals were anticipated.\n\n#### (36) Other financial obligations\n\nPurchase commitments for capital expenditure exclusively on property, plant and equipment totalled €6,755 thousand as at the balance sheet date (previous year: €22,882 thousand).\n\nGroup companies have entered into leases and service agreements for vehicles at their various locations. As at the balance sheet date, payment obligations for the non-lease components of these contracts amounted to €22,957 thousand (previous year: €20,659 thousand).\n\nIn addition, the Jungheinrich Group incurred payment obligations totalling €108,636 thousand (previous year: €76,460 thousand) for long-term software use and maintenance contracts and leases for low-value assets as at the balance sheet date, as well as other service contracts.\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\n#### (37) Risk management and financial instruments\n\n#### Risk management principles\n\nThe Jungheinrich Group's risk management system is designed to enable the company to identify developments in financial price risks – resulting primarily from interest rate and currency risks – early on and react to them via systematic courses of action both rapidly and effectively. Furthermore, it ensures that the Group only concludes financial transactions for which it possesses the necessary expertise and technical preconditions.\n\nFinancial markets present the opportunity to transfer risks to other market participants who have a comparative advantage or a higher capacity for accepting risks. The Jungheinrich Group makes use of these opportunities solely to hedge risks arising from underlying operating transactions and to invest or raise liquidity. Group guidelines do not allow the conclusion of financial transactions that are speculative in nature. As a rule, the Jungheinrich Group's financial transactions may only be concluded with banks or leasing companies as contractual partners.\n\nThe Board of Management as a whole bears responsibility for the initiation of organisational measures required to limit financial price risks. Jungheinrich has established a risk controlling and risk management system that enables it to identify, measure, monitor and control its risk positions. Risk management encompasses the development and determination of methods to measure risk and performance, monitor established risk limits and set up the associated reporting system.\n\nJungheinrich controls financial risks arising from its core business centrally as part of the Group strategy. Risks stemming from the Jungheinrich Group's financial services operations are subject to a separate risk management system.\n\nRisks specific to the financial services business are determined by residual value risks, refinancing risks and counterparty credit risks.\n\nA material element of risk management in the financial service business is a contract database based on SAP-ERP and the Global Lease Center (GLC), which is used by smaller sales companies, that allows uniform recording, risk analysis and risk evaluation of financial service agreements throughout the Group.\n\nThe contractually agreed residual values are calculated on the basis of a conservative uniform Group standard for maximum permissible residual values. The residual values of all individual contracts are subjected to a quarterly evaluation using the central financial services contracts database on the basis of their current fair value. If the originally calculated residual value is higher than the actual fair value at the end of the respective contract's term, the risk is taken into consideration depending on the classification of the long-term customer contract through a reduction of the carrying amounts \"Trucks for lease from financial services\" or \"Receivables from financial services\" with effect on profit or loss.\n\nFinancial service agreements are wherever possible refinanced in accordance with the principle of matching maturities and interest rates for customer and refinancing contracts.\n\nReference is made to the commentary on credit risks as regards general creditworthiness and contingent loss risks in connection with customers.\n\nBreak clauses agreed on in customer contracts are limited by central parameters and linked to risk-minimising performance targets. The earnings risk potentially resulting from break clauses is covered by accruing suitable provisions.\n\n#### Market price risks\n\nMarket price risks are risks arising from changes in an item's realisable income or value, with the item being defined as an item on the assets or liabilities side of the statement of financial position. These risks result from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, share prices and other items and factors affecting the formation of prices. These parameters are used to determine the interest rate risk, the currency risk and the share price risk exposure of the Jungheinrich Group. There were no noteworthy risk concentrations in the year under review, as was the case in the previous year.\n\n#### Interest rate risks\n\nInterest rate risks result from the Group's financing and cash investment activity. Fixed and variable-interest items are regarded separately in order to determine this risk. Net positions are formed from interest-bearing instruments on the assets and liabilities sides and hedges are concluded to cover these net positions, if necessary. Interest rate swaps were used to hedge interest rates in the reporting period.\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\nThe interest rate risk from investments is composed of the shares accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, pension futures and pension funds amounting to €132,946 thousand (previous year: €112,791 thousand), which are largely held in a special fund. If going interest rates as at the balance sheet date had been 100 basis points higher (lower), this would have led to a change in the fair value in the amount of €486 thousand (previous year: €1,027 thousand).\n\nThe Jungheinrich Group's interest rate risks include cash flow risks arising from variableinterest financial instruments for which no interest rate hedges have been concluded. These financial instruments were analysed as follows based on the assumption that the amount of liabilities outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the full year.\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, the net exposure of variable-interest financial instruments was at €492,942 thousand (previous year: €158,516 thousand). If going interest rates had been 100 basis points higher on 31 December 2023, income would have been €4,929 thousand (previous year: €1,589 thousand) lower. If going interest rates had been 100 basis points lower, income would have been €4,929 thousand (previous year: €1,589 thousand) higher.\n\nFor interest rate swaps designated as a hedging instrument as at the balance sheet date, such an increase (decrease) in the market interest level would have resulted in a change in fair value of €+5,685 thousand (€–5,886 thousand) recognised in other comprehensive income with no effect on profit or loss.\n\n#### Currency risks\n\nWhen calculating this risk position, the Jungheinrich Group considers foreign currency inflows and outflows, primarily from revenue and purchases based on fixed and flexible contracts. This risk position reflects the net currency exposure resulting from balancing counteracting cash flows in individual currencies while taking hedges already concluded for the period in question into account. Jungheinrich used currency forwards and currency swaps to manage risks during the reporting period. In accordance with the Jungheinrich Group's risk management principles, a maximum of 75 per cent of the volumes to be hedged are designated as underlying transactions. These, in turn, can be fully hedged.\n\nThe Jungheinrich Group applies the value-at-risk approach to quantify its risk position. The value-at-risk indicates the maximum loss that may not be exceeded before the end of a predetermined holding period with a certain probability (confidence level). Parameters and market volatility, which are used to quantify risk, are calculated based on the standard deviation of logarithmic changes in the last 180 trading days and converted to a one-day holding period with a one-sided confidence level of 95 per cent.\n\nTo manage risk, a maximum loss limit for the entire Group is determined based on the company's planning. Furthermore, corresponding lower limits are determined at the individual Group company level. These limits are compared to the current value-at-risk for all open positions as part of monthly reporting.\n\nBy applying the value-at-risk method as of 31 December 2023, the maximum risk did not exceed €1,414 thousand (previous year: €2,345 thousand) based on a holding period of one day and a confidence level of 95 per cent. In the reporting period, the value-at-risk was between a minimum of €1,414 thousand (previous year: €1,342 thousand) and a maximum of €2,492 thousand (previous year: €2,370 thousand). The average for the year was €2,058 thousand (previous year: €2,012 thousand).\n\nAdditionally, hedging of foreign currency risks takes place in the Jungheinrich Group with matching amounts and identical maturities from intragroup financing via currency swaps.\n\n#### Share price risks\n\nJungheinrich has invested €125,000 thousand (previous year: €125,000 thousand) in cash and cash equivalents in a special fund. Shares, stock index funds and share derivatives held in this fund and directly held equity funds expose the Jungheinrich Group to a significant share price risk. On 31 December 2023, the total share price risk exposure of Jungheinrich Group amounted to €18,185 thousand (previous year: €8,944 thousand). If the share price level had been 10 per cent higher (lower) on 31 December 2023, this would have led to additional income (losses) in other financial income (expense) of €1,819 thousand (previous year: €894 thousand).\n\nThe special fund is managed to maintain value in order to limit share price risks. The lower value limit specified for the reporting year was not reached at any time.\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\n#### Credit risks\n\nJungheinrich's exposure to credit risks stems almost exclusively from its core business. Trade accounts receivable from operations are constantly monitored by the business units responsible for them. Loss allowances for expected credit losses are recognised in order to offset the credit risks.\n\nThe entire business is continuously subjected to creditworthiness checks. Given the overall exposure to credit risks, accounts receivable from major customers are not substantial enough to give rise to extraordinary risk concentrations. Agreements made with customers and measures taken within the scope of risk management that minimise the creditworthiness risk largely consist of agreements on prepayments made by customers, the sharing of risks with financing partners and the permanent monitoring of customers via information portals. In addition, selected operating trade accounts receivable are collateralised by federal government credit insurance and private credit insurance covering 90 per cent of the respective receivable amount. Letters of credit are also used for collateral and generally cover 100 per cent of the receivable amount. There were no significant changes to the quality of the collateral during the reporting periods.\n\nNotwithstanding existing collateral securities, in principle the carrying amounts of the financial assets in the balance sheet represent the maximum credit risk. As at the balance sheet date, there were no major agreements that reduced the maximum credit risk such as offsetting arrangements.\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss had carrying amounts totalling €128,569 thousand (previous year: €149,464 thousand) as of 31 December 2023 in the balance sheet. The carrying amounts reflect the maximum credit risk of these financial instruments.\n\n#### Liquidity risks\n\nA liquidity reserve consisting of lines of credit and of cash is kept in order to ensure that the Jungheinrich Group can meet its payment obligations and maintain its financial flexibility at all times. Medium-term credit lines have been granted by the Group's principal banks and are supplemented by short-term credit lines of individual Group companies awarded by local banks.\n\n#### Counterparty risks\n\nThe Group is exposed to counterparty risks that arise from the non-fulfilment of contractual agreements by counterparties. To mitigate these risks, such contracts are only concluded with selected financial institutions, which meet the internal demands placed on the creditworthiness of business partners. The creditworthiness of contractual partners is constantly monitored on the basis of their credit rating, which is determined by reputable rating agencies, as well as on the basis of additional risk indicators. No major risks ensued for Jungheinrich from its dependence on individual counterparties as at the balance sheet date. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are adjusted by the risk values calculated using analytical tools (credit value adjustment/debit value adjustment).\n\nWith regard to cash and cash equivalents and investments in securities, the Group monitors changes to the credit risk by tracking published ratings. To determine whether there are material increases in credit risks as at the balance sheet date which are not reflected in published ratings, the Group also monitors price changes for credit default swaps (CDSs) as well as press releases and regulatory information about the issuer. In accordance with Group investment policies, capital expenditure is only made in financial assets if they have an investment grade rating. Impairment losses for expected credit losses are calculated based on the three-level model in IFRS 9. Potential future impairment losses are calculated for all cash and cash equivalents and securities for the expected 12-month credit loss (Level 1). They are reclassified to Level 2 if the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly compared to its initial recognition. Were contractual payments to become more than 30 days overdue, this would not by itself signal a significant increase in the credit risk, but it would indicate that a significant increase in the credit risk might have occurred. Jungheinrich's risk management system treats a downgrading of the counterparty's external rating below investment grade as a criterion for a significant increase in the credit risk. There were no reclassifications from Level 1 to Level 2 in the 2023 and 2022 financial years.\n\nThe general liquidity risk from the financial instruments used, which arises if a counterparty fails to meet its payment obligations or only meets them to a limited extent, is considered to be negligible.\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\n#### Hedging relationships\n\nThe Jungheinrich Group concludes cash flow hedges to secure, among other things, future variable cash flows resulting from revenue and purchases of materials that are partially realised and partially forecasted, but highly probable. Comprehensive documentation ensures the clear assignment of hedges and underlying transactions. A maximum of 75 per cent of the volumes to be hedged are designated as underlying transactions. These, in turn, can be fully hedged.\n\nIn order to hedge against interest rate risks, cash flows from tranches of a promissory note with variable interest rates are hedged with a matching maturity and an identical payment schedule by means of suitable interest rate swaps.\n\nFurthermore, the variable-interest liabilities existing for the purpose of financing the financial services business via the Group's financing company Elbe River Capital S.A., Luxembourg, are hedged against interest rate risks via interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.\n\nThe hedging ratio for all risk types is generally 1:1.\n\nThe effectiveness of hedging relationships is determined in each case at the beginning of the hedging relationship and through regular prospective assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.\n\nThe hedging relationships can prospectively be classified as highly effective. An assessment of the retrospective effectiveness of hedging relationships is conducted at the end of every quarter using the dollar-offset method together with the hypothetical-derivative method.\n\nHedging can become ineffective if the counterparty's credit risk changes.\n\n#### Nominal values of derivative financial instruments\n\n#### Nominal volume of derivative financial instruments\n\n|                                    | Nominal volume of hedging<br>instruments for cash flow hedges |                    | Nominal volume of<br>other derivatives |        |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|--------|\n| in € thousand                      | Currency<br>hedges                                            | Interest<br>hedges | Currency<br>hedges                     | Other  |\n| 31/12/2023                         |                                                               |                    |                                        |        |\n| Total nominal volume               | 249,594                                                       | 336,074            | 477,224                                | 29,631 |\n| Maturities of up to one year       | 208,935                                                       | 83,286             | 477,224                                | 29,631 |\n| Maturities of one to five years    | 40,659                                                        | 220,576            | –                                      | –      |\n| Maturities of more than five years | –                                                             | 32,212             | –                                      | –      |\n\n#### 31/12/2022\n\n| Total nominal volume               | 209,940 | 344,226 | 312,062 | 26,212 |\n|------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Maturities of up to one year       | 182,960 | 83,841  | 312,062 | 26,212 |\n| Maturities of one to five years    | 26,980  | 213,937 | –       | –      |\n| Maturities of more than five years | –       | 46,448  | –       | –      |\n\nThe nominal values of the currency hedging contracts primarily contain currency forwards that are used to hedge against rolling twelve-month exposure in individual currencies.

As at the balance sheet date the average hedging rate was 0.85 per cent (previous year: 1.23 per cent) for interest rate hedges in EUR and 2.30 per cent (previous year: 3.41 per cent) for interest rate hedges in GBP.\n\n#### Interest hedges: future cash flows that are not discounted\n\n| in € thousand                          | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|----------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Due within one year                    | 5,759      | 6,020      |\n| Due in one to five years               | -948       | 9,614      |\n| Due in more than five years            | -40        | 365        |\n| Total future non-discounted cash flows | 4,771      | 15,999     |\n\nThe nominal volume of the other derivative financial instruments included listed futures and options in special funds.\n\nThe transactions underlying the cash flow hedges are expected to be realised in line with the maturities of the hedges shown in the table.\n\nThe fair values of the underlying transactions and hedging instruments are used to measure effectiveness. Hedging measures were not associated with any material ineffectiveness until the balance sheet date.\n\nFor the currency forwards from cash flow hedges existing as at the balance sheet date, the change in the fair values of the hedging transactions amounted to €–2,124 thousand (previous year: €2,674 thousand). The change in the fair values of the underlying transactions amounted to €2,118 thousand (previous year: €–2,674 thousand).\n\nFor the interest rate hedging contracts existing as at the balance sheet date, the change in the fair values of the hedging transactions as at the balance sheet date was €4,587 thousand (previous year: €15,106 thousand). The change in the fair values of the underlying transactions amounted to €– 4,586 thousand (previous year: €–15,066 thousand).\n\n#### Fair values of derivative financial instruments\n\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument is the price at which the instrument could have been sold on the market as at the balance sheet date. Fair values were calculated on the basis of market-related information available as at the balance sheet date and on the basis of measurement methods stated in note (33) [ [page](#page-155-0) 154 ] that are based on specific prices. In view of the varying influencing factors, the values stated here may differ from the values realised later on the market.\n\n#### Fair values of derivative financial instruments\n\n| in € thousand                              | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Derivative financial assets                | 13,852     | 22,974     |\n| Derivatives with a hedging relationship    | 7,729      | 19,353     |\n| Currency forwards/currency swaps           | 604        | 3,884      |\n| Interest rate swaps                        | 7,125      | 15,469     |\n| Derivatives without a hedging relationship | 6,123      | 3,621      |\n| Currency forwards/currency swaps           | 5,564      | 2,736      |\n| Futures                                    | 559        | 885        |\n| Derivative financial liabilities           | 7,830      | 4,374      |\n| Derivatives with a hedging relationship    | 4,992      | 1,553      |\n| Currency forwards/currency swaps           | 3,098      | 1,520      |\n| Interest rate swaps                        | 1,894      | 33         |\n| Derivatives without a hedging relationship | 2,838      | 2,821      |\n| Currency forwards/currency swaps           | 2,822      | 2,779      |\n| Futures                                    | 16         | 42         |\n\nDetails regarding the development of the fair value of derivatives in hedging relationships in the reporting year and previous year can be found in note (24) [ [page](#page-145-0) 144 ].\n\n#### Offsetting of derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Group concludes derivative transactions according to a German framework agreement and similar national framework agreements. These agreements do not fulfil the criteria for offsetting to take place in the consolidated statement of financial position, since they only grant the right to offsetting if future events occur, such as the default or insolvency of the Group or the counterparty. All currency and interest rate hedging contracts belonging to the Jungheinrich Group fall under existing global netting agreements, meaning that, taking into account the counterparty structure, the offsetting potential as of 31 December 2023 would amount to €5,373 thousand (previous year: €3,518 thousand).\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, the gross value of derivative financial assets from currency and interest rate hedging contracts amounted to €13,293 thousand (previous year: €22,089 thousand), and the gross amount of derivative financial liabilities from currency and interest rate hedging contracts was €7,814 thousand (previous year: €4,332 thousand). After netting, this would result in receivables in the amount of €7,920 thousand (previous year: €18,571 thousand) and liabilities in the amount of €2,441 thousand (previous year: €814 thousand).\n\n#### (38) Segment information\n\nJungheinrich is one of the world's leading solutions providers for the intralogistics sector. With a comprehensive portfolio of material handling equipment, automated systems and services, Jungheinrich is able to offer customers solutions to the challenges posed by Industry 4.0.\n\nThe integrated business model encompasses the development, production and sale of new material handling equipment and the planning and realisation of automation projects, the short-term rental of new and used material handling equipment, the refurbishment and sale of used trucks and after-sales services. Jungheinrich also supplies stacker cranes and load handling equipment.\n\nIn addition, customers receive their entire factory and office equipment from a single source. In addition to electric engines and drive controls, Jungheinrich also manufactures matching lithium-ion batteries and battery chargers. Digital products based on the latest generation of the Jungheinrich Internet of Things platform in the cloud, complement the portfolio. Customers also have access to a comprehensive range of financial services.\n\nThe Board of Management of Jungheinrich AG acts and makes decisions with overall responsibility for all the Group's business areas. Jungheinrich's business model is designed to serve customers from a single source over a product's entire life cycle.\n\nSegment reporting is in line with the internal organisational and reporting structure, thus encompassing the reportable segments \"Intralogistics\" and \"Financial Services\".\n\nThe \"Intralogistics\" segment encompasses the development, production, sale and short-term rental of new material handling equipment and warehousing equipment products including automation as well as the sale and short-term leasing of used trucks and after-sales services, consisting of maintenance, repair and spare parts.\n\nActivities undertaken by the \"Financial Services\" segment encompass the sales financing and usage transfer of material handling equipment and warehousing equipment products. In line with Jungheinrich's business model, this independent business area supports the operating sales units of the \"Intralogistics\" segment. In this context, the \"Financial Services\" segment finances itself autonomously.\n\nSegment information is generally subject to the disclosure and measurement methods applied in the consolidated financial statements. One exception is that the segments do not determine or record impairments for expected credit losses pursuant to IFRS 9 \"Financial instruments\" for intragroup receivables. Business segments were not aggregated.\n\nThe segment income (expense) is presented as earnings before taxes (EBT). Income tax expense is not reported and managed by segment at Jungheinrich. Income tax expense is therefore only stated as a summarised item at the Group level. Accordingly, profit or loss is only stated for the Jungheinrich Group.\n\nCapital expenditure, depreciation and amortisation, impairment losses as well as reversal of impairments concern property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, excluding capitalised development expenditure and excluding capitalised usage rights on property, plant and equipment. Segment assets and segment liabilities encompass all assets and liabilities allocable to the segment in question. All items on the statement of financial position relating to effective and deferred income tax expense are therefore also included.\n\nThe \"Intralogistics\" segment acquires products from long-term customer lease agreements at the end of the term of these agreements at contractually agreed residual values from the \"Financial Services\" segment. If the contractually agreed residual value is above the current fair value at the end of an agreement's term, the \"Intralogistics\" segment will take this residual value risk into consideration by forming appropriate reserves for onerous contracts. Within the Jungheinrich Group, these residual value risks are represented as reductions in either the carrying amounts of trucks for lease from financial services, receivables from financial services and/or the inventories affected, depending on the classification of long-term customer contracts. The figures from this cross-segment offsetting were included in the reconciliation items for 2023 and 2022.\n\nThe reconciliation items in the reporting year and 2022 also included the intragroup revenue, interest, interim profits and receivables and liabilities eliminated within the scope of consolidation.\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Segment information

All transactions with these companies are conducted on arm's length terms.\n\nInformation about the remuneration of the Supervisory Board and Board of Management can be found in note (43).\n\n#### (43) Total remuneration of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board\n\nTotal remuneration of the active members of the Board of Management pursuant to Section 314, Paragraph 1, Item 6a HGB amounted to €7,281 thousand in 2023 (previous year: €4,930 thousand). In addition to basic remuneration, this included remuneration in kind and fringe benefits, the short-term incentive (STI) and long-term incentive (LTI – a share-based performance-related component with a long-term incentive effect). The appropriateness requirement was taken into consideration when determining the individual variable remuneration.\n\nThe LTI has a term of three years and is allocated annually in the form of virtual performance share (VPS) tranches. Settlement occurs exclusively in cash at the end of the relevant performance period. The target amount forms the basis for the allocation and amounts to 55 per cent of the basic remuneration for each member of the Board of Management. At the start of the term, the target amount is divided by Jungheinrich AG's average share price (the arithmetical mean of the closing prices in the last 120 trading days before the start of the performance period) to calculate the number of virtual shares (VPS) assigned conditionally. The target values for the performance criteria are set by the Supervisory Board, and the degree to which they have been achieved is decided by the Supervisory Board after the end of the performance period. The number of final VPS is always limited to 150 per cent of the originally allocated VPS.\n\nBased on the currently applicable remuneration system, a total of 78,852.69 VPS were granted in 2023 for the last financial year's LTI (previous year: 43,046.19). The fair value determined by Monte Carlo simulation at the time when they were granted was €1,630 thousand (previous year: €1,624 thousand).\n\nThe tranches for 2021–2023, 2022–2024 and 2023–2025 have been recognised as cash-settled share-based payment transactions pursuant to IFRS 2. The fair value is calculated at every balance sheet date and recognised as a personnel expense, distributed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and as a provision in the same amount. As of 31 December 2023, provisions had been made for the LTI amounting to €3,366 thousand (previous year: €794 thousand), of which €1,684 thousand was for the 2021 – 2023 LTI tranche.\n\nThe LTI calculation is based on the financial performance criteria of \"return on capital employed (ROCE)\" and \"relative total shareholder return\", and on the sustainability-related non-financial performance criterion of \"lithium-ion equipment ratio\".\n\nThe entitlements for the LTI for the 2021 financial year (2021 – 2023 tranche) were fully awarded with the activities in the 2023 financial year. In this regard, the actual payment will be measured based on target achievement determined by the Supervisory Board according to the currently applicable remuneration system and paid in April 2024. The payment of LTI is dependent on the weighted degree of overall target achievement, which is determined using the above performance criteria, and the performance of the reference share price.\n\nProvisions of €2,019 thousand (previous year: €1,486 thousand) were reported as of 31 December 2023 for the STI for active members of the Board of Management. The entitlements were fully awarded with the activities in the 2023 financial year. In this regard, the actual payment will be measured based on target achievement determined by the Supervisory Board according to the currently applicable remuneration system and paid in April 2024. The payment of STI is dependent on the weighted degree of overall target achievement, which is determined using \"Group EBT return on sales\", \"increase in Group revenue\" and \"equipment ratio of lithium-ion\".\n\nThere were pension commitments for all active members of the Board of Management; the corresponding provisions amount to €3,613 thousand (previous year: €2,812 thousand). The pensions will be paid out at the end of the 63rd year as lifelong monthly pensions as long as there is no active employment relationship with Jungheinrich AG at this point. The provision for dependants for spouses or partners and children entitled to maintenance is restricted to a maximum of 100 per cent of the regular pension claim.\n\nThe disclosure of the remuneration of management staff in key positions in the Jungheinrich Group pursuant to IAS 24 includes the remuneration of active members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\n\n{174}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Remuneration of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board\n\n|                          | Board of Management |       | Supervisory Board |       |\n|--------------------------|---------------------|-------|-------------------|-------|\n| in € thousand            | 2023                | 2022  | 2023              | 2022  |\n| Short-term benefits due  | 5,651               | 4,856 | 1,175             | 1,140 |\n| Termination benefits     | 1,138               | –     | –                 | –     |\n| Post-employment benefits | 263                 | 709   | –                 | –     |\n| Share-based payments     | 2,573               | 74    | –                 | –     |\n| Total                    | 9,625               | 5,639 | 1,175             | 1,140 |\n\nIn the reporting year, the Supervisory Board made arrangements for succession planning for the Board of Management. The employment contracts of Mr Christian Erlach and Dr Volker Hues were extended until 31 December 2024 (Mr Erlach) and 31 March 2027 (Dr Hues) respectively. A provision for early termination was added to the contracts. Accordingly, in the event of early resignation from office with the agreement of the Supervisory Board after 30 June 2024 (Mr Erlach) or after 1 July 2025 (Dr Hues), the basic and variable remuneration as well as the fringe benefits and pension commitment will continue to be paid until the regular end of the respective employment contract. A termination agreement was concluded with Ms Sabine Neuß in the reporting year, according to which Ms Neuß will resign from office by mutual agreement by 30 June 2024. The basic and variable remuneration as well as the fringe benefits and pension commitment will continue to be paid until the regular end of the employment contract on 31 December 2025. Ms Neuß is entitled to terminate the employment contract by mutual agreement by resigning from office on 30 April 2024 at the earliest. In this case, she will receive a compensatory payment equal to half of the outstanding remuneration from the date of termination instead of the continued remuneration payment. A provision for termination benefits for Ms Neuß of €1,138 thousand was recognised as of 31 December 2023. The early termination agreement with Dr Hues and individual provisions of the agreement with Ms Neuß are subject to the approval by the Annual General Meeting in May 2024 of a selectively amended remuneration system.\n\nPost-employment benefits include the current service cost resulting from the defined benefit obligations to the members of the Board of Management. As share-based payments, expenses from share-based payments in the 2023 financial year are reported.\n\nThe Supervisory Board remuneration includes basic annual remuneration and fixed annual remuneration for sitting on Supervisory Board committees. The full Supervisory Board remuneration is only due after the end of the financial year. As of 31 December 2023, provisions for Supervisory Board remuneration totalled €1,175 thousand (previous year: €1,140 thousand). These will be disbursed early in the next financial year. Employee representatives on the Supervisory Board receive a regular salary from their employment in the Group; the amount represents appropriate remuneration for their role and/or work within the Group.\n\nAs in the previous year, no advances or loans to members of the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board of Jungheinrich AG existed on 31 December 2023.

In addition, we have audited the group management report of Jungheinrich Aktiengesellschaft, which is combined with the Company's management report, for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the disclosures marked as unaudited in section \"Internal control and risk management system\" of the group management report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § [Article] 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and\n- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion\n\non the group management report does not cover the content of the disclosures in section \"Internal control and risk management system\" of the group management report referred to above.\n\nPursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n#### Basis for the Audit Opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\n#### Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\n{181}------------------------------------------------\n\nNon-financial report\n\nAuditor's Report\n\nIn our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows:\n\n- Recoverability of goodwill\n- Recoverability of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and trucks for short-term rental\n- Accounting of lessor contracts in the sales area\n- First-time consolidation of Storage-Solutions (SSI)-Group\n\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows:\n\n- Matter and issue\n- Audit approach and findings\n- Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter we present the key audit matters:\n\n#### Recoverability of goodwill\n\n In the Company's consolidated financial statements goodwill amounting in total to EUR 372.7 million (5.4% of total assets or 16,8% of equity) is reported under the \"Intangible assets\" balance sheet item. Goodwill is tested for impairment by the Company once a year or when there are indications of impairment to determine any possible need for writedowns. The impairment test is carried out at the level of the cash-generating units to which the relevant goodwill is allocated. The carrying amount of the relevant cash-generating units, including goodwill, is compared with the corresponding recoverable amount in the context of the impairment test. The recoverable amount is generally determined using the value in use. The present value of the future cash flows from the respective cash-generating units normally serves as the basis of valuation. Present values are calculated using discounted cash flow models. For this purpose, the adopted medium-term business plan of the Group forms the starting point which is extrapolated based on assumptions about long-term rates of growth. Expectations relating to future market developments and assumptions about the development of macroeconomic factors on the business activities of the Group are also taken into account. The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital for the respective cash-generating units. The impairment test determined that no write-downs were necessary.\n\n The outcome of this valuation is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the executive directors with respect to the future cash inflows from the respective cash-generating units, the discount rate used, the rate of growth and other assumptions, and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background and due to the complex nature of the valuation, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n As part of our audit, we assessed the methodology used for the purposes of performing the impairment test, among other things. After matching the future cash inflows used for the calculation against the adopted medium-term business plan of the Group, we assessed the appropriateness of the calculation, in particular by reconciling it with general and sector-specific market expectations. In addition, we assessed the appropriate consideration of the costs of Group functions. In the knowledge that even relatively small changes in the discount rate applied can have a material impact on the value of the entity calculated in this way, we focused our testing in particular on the parameters used to determine the discount rate applied, and assessed the calculation model. In order to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the projections, we evaluated the sensitivity analyses performed by the Company. Taking into account the information available, we determined that the carrying amounts of the cash-generating units, including the allocated goodwill, were adequately covered by the discounted future cash flows. We also satisfied ourselves that the necessary disclosures were made in the notes.\n\n Overall, the valuation parameters and assumptions used by the executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also within the ranges considered by us to be reasonable.\n\n The Company's disclosures on goodwill are contained in number 6 and 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{182}------------------------------------------------\n\nNon-financial report\n\n#### Recoverability of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and trucks for shortterm rental\n\n In the Company's consolidated financial statements, an amount in total to EUR 1,824.8 million is reported under the balance sheet items \"Intangible assets\", \"Property, plant and equipment\", and \"trucks for short-term rental\". The recoverability of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and trucks for short-term rental was assessed as of the balance sheet date by means of impairment tests in accordance with IAS 36. The present value of the future cash flows from the respective cash-generating units normally serves as the basis of valuation. Present values are calculated using discounted cash flow models. For this purpose, the adopted medium-term business plan of the Group forms the starting point which is extrapolated based on assumptions about, for example, long-term growth rates to reflect a sustainable situation (so-called \"perpetual annuity\"). Expectations relating to future market developments and assumptions about the development of macroeconomic factors on the business activities of the Group are also taken into account. The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital for the respective cash-generating units. The impairment test determined that even after taking into account the fair value less costs of disposal, it was necessary to recognize write-downs amounting to a total of EUR 1.3 million with respect to the cash-generating units Ecuador, Denmark, Finland, Sputh Africa, Australia, Malaysia and Peru, In addition, reversals of write-downs amounting to a total of EUR 1.6 million were identified for the cash-generating unit China.\n\n The outcome of this valuation is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the executive directors with respect to the future cash inflows from the respective cashgenerating units, the discount rate used, the rate of growth and other assumptions, and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background and due to the complexity of the methodological requirements, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n As part of our audit, we assessed the methodology used for the purposes of performing the impairment test and the determination of the weighted average costs of capital, among other things. After matching the future cash inflows used for the calculation against the adopted medium-term business plan of the Group, we assessed the appropriateness of the calculation, in particular by reconciling it with general and sector-specific market expectations. In addition, we assessed the appropriate consideration of the costs of Group functions in the impairment tests of the respective cash-generating units. In the knowledge that even relatively small changes in the discount rate applied can have a material impact on the value of the entity calculated in this way, we focused our testing in particular on the parameters used to determine the discount rate and growth rates applied, and assessed the calculation model. With regard to the cash-generating units for which the need for writedowns and reversal of write downs, respectively, was identified, we assessed whether the write-downs were appropriately determined and recognized. We also satisfied ourselves that the necessary disclosures were made in the notes. Overall, the valuation parameters and assumptions used by the executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also within the ranges considered by us to be reasonable.\n\n The Company's disclosures on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and trucks for short-term rental are contained in section \"Accounting principles\" and numbers 6, 12, 13 and 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Accounting of lessor contracts in the sales area\n\n In the Company's consolidated financial statements, carrying amounts in total to EUR 1,651.4 million (23.9% of total assets) are reported under the balance sheet item \"'Receivables from financial services\" and carrying amounts in total to EUR 1,038.1 million (15.0% of total assets) are reported under the balance sheet items \"Trucks for short-term rental\" and \"Trucks for lease from financial services\". Jungheinrich makes extensive use of leases as a sales instrument in the \"Financial Services\" operating segment. The corresponding agreements include both contracts in which Jungheinrich Group companies are contracting parties and those in which the leased asset was sold to external financial partners. Monetization mainly takes place through the long-term leasing of new trucks as leased assets to the end customer, the sale of the leased asset to a financial partner and subsequent leaseback as well as the leasing of the leased asset to the end customer at the same time (sale-and-leaseback) and the sale of the (leased) asset to a financial partner, who leases it to the end customer (vendor leasing).\n\n Leases directly to the end customer are classified as finance leases or operating leases as defined by IFRS 16. In the case of sale and leaseback agreements concluded, the transaction is classified as a financing agreement and therefore a liability from financial services is recognized in addition to an asset. Vendor leases are classified uniformly as leases within the meaning of IFRS 16 in accordance with IFRS 15.\n\n{183}------------------------------------------------\n\nNon-financial report\n\n Leasing applications used throughout the Group have been set up to ensure the complete and correct recognition, categorization and classification of the various contract types in accordance with IFRS. The updating, programming, and administration of the classification and booking routines of the leasing applications are performed centrally in Germany, while contract recording is decentralized to the sales units or the Group's own financial services companies. The definition of criteria and parameters in the leasing applications requires discretionary decisions by the executive directors. Due to the high volume of transactions in connection with the different types of contracts, errors in this area can have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. Against this background, the assessment of the accounting treatment of leases in the sales area was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n As part of the audit, we first obtained an understanding of the process for accounting for leases in the sales area, including an understanding of the existing types of contracts as well as the company's internal controls in the leasing area. With the knowledge of the organizational structure and the overall process, the audit focused on the leasing application used and on the completeness and accuracy of the data input in the individual sub-areas. In a further step, we assessed whether the criteria and parameters defined in the leasing applications used were appropriate for accounting for the lease and whether the automatic booking and classification routines stored complied with the relevant IFRS. To this we examined the Jungheinrich Group Accounting Manual, as the basis for programming the routines, for compliance with IFRS. Furthermore, we assessed the appropriateness of the accounting and classification routines. Our assessment was based on a selected sample of contracts. Based on the data inputs, we verified for each selected contract whether the results of the leasing applications are in compliance with the relevant IFRS. We assessed the data inputs in the financial year in the individual sub-areas on a sample basis. In this context, we verified the accuracy, proper accrual and completeness of the data input using the original contracts.\n\n We were able to satisfy ourselves that the criteria and parameters defined by the executive directors in the leasing application are appropriate overall for the accounting of leases in the sales area.\n\n The Company's disclosures on accounting of lessor contracts in the sales area are contained in sections \"Revenue recognition\" and \"Leasing and financial services\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### First-time consolidation of Storage-Solutions (SSI)-Group\n\n With effect as at 15 March 2023, Jungheinrich Group acquired via Jungheinrich Lift Truck Corp., Houston/Texas, USA, 100% of the shares in Storage-Solutions (SSI)-Group and since then has held 100 percent of the shares in SSI Acquisition LLC, Westfield/Indiana (USA), and its subsidiaries.The total purchase price for the acquisition was EUR 325.4 million.The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3. In the context of the purchase price allocation, the identified assets and assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities of the company acquired were generally recognized at their fair values. After taking into account the revalued aquired assets of EUR 38.3 million, the resulting purchased goodwill amounts in total to EUR 287.1 million.\n\n Due to the uncertainties in the estimations made in connection with the measurement of assets and liabilities as part of the purchase price allocation, and the overall material impact of the amounts involved in the acquisition on the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Jungheinrich Group, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n In auditing the acquisition of Storage-Solutions (SSI)-Group, we initially inspected and assessed the corresponding contractual agreements and reconciled the purchase price paid as consideration for the acquired business operations received with the supporting payment documentation provided to us. In doing so, we assessed the delineation of the components included in the consideration transferred. Based on that, we evaluated the balance sheet underlying the acquisition based on the fair values at the time of first-time consolidation. This involved assessing the appropriateness of, among other things, the models on which the valuations were based as well as the valuation parameters and assumptions used. Given the special features relating to the calculation of the fair values within the context of the purchase price allocation, we received support in our assessment from our valuation specialists. We also checked the notes to the financial statements that are required under IFRS 3.\n\n{184}------------------------------------------------\n\nNon-financial report\n\nIndependent Auditor's Report\n\n Overall, we were able to satisfy ourselves that this acquisition was presented appropriately in the financial statements and that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors are comprehensible and adequately substantiated.\n\n The Company's disclosures on the first-time consolidation are contained in section \"Significant aquisitions\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Other Information\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the disclosures marked as unaudited in section \"Internal control and risk management system\" of the group management report as an unaudited part of the group management report.\n\nThe other information comprises further\n\n- the statement on corporate governance pursuant to § 289f HGB and § 315d HGB\n- the separate non-financial report to comply with §§ 289b to 289e HGB and with §§ 315b to 315c HGB\n- all remaining parts of the annual report excluding cross-references to external information – with the exception of the audited consolidated financial statements, the audited group management report and our auditor's report\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information mentioned above and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information\n\n- is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report disclosures audited in terms of content or with our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\n#### Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n{185}------------------------------------------------\n\nNon-financial report\n\nIndependent Auditor's Report\n\n#### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\n{186}------------------------------------------------\n\nNon-financial report\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n#### OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\nReport on the Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB\n\n#### Assurance Opinion\n\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report (hereinafter the \"ESEF documents\") contained in the electronic file Jungheinrich\\_KA\\_KLB\\_ESEF-2023-12-31.zip and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format (\"ESEF format\").

We were engaged by the supervisory board on 11 May 2023. We have been the group auditor of the Jungheinrich Aktiengesellschaft, Hamburg, without interruption since the financial year 2020.\n\nWe declare that the audit opinions expressed in this auditor's report are consistent with the additional report to the audit committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report).\n\n#### Reference to an other matter – use of the Auditor's Report\n\nOur auditor's report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited group management report as well as the assured ESEF documents. The consolidated financial statements and the group management report converted to the ESEF format – including the versions to be filed in the company register – are merely electronic renderings of the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited group management report and do not take their place. In particular, the \"Report on the Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB\" and our assurance opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the assured ESEF documents made available in electronic form.\n\n#### German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement\n\nThe German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement is Alexander Fernis.\n\nHamburg, 12 March 2024\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nAlexander Fernis ppa.

This includes and robotics solutions, which are unique in the field of production supply in particular. Production started at our new reach truck plant in Chomutov, Czechia, in 2023. This new location, with its modern production capacities, is an important factor in increasing Jungheinrich's efficiency. The same applies to our digital transformation program DEEP, which reached further im -\n\nportant milestones in the past year.\n\nWe also underscored our commitment to achieving our Strategy 2025+ targets in terms of inorganic growth and expanding the share of revenue generated outside of Europe.\n\nWith the complete takeover of the Munich-based robotics specialist Magazino, we also expanded our automation expertise in the past year. Together with the team at Magazino, we are driving forward the development of joint automation\n\nAnother important step was taken in our Moosburg plant last year when Jungheinrich's last IC engine-powered truck left the production lines. That makes us the first company in our industry that has completely left fossil fuels behind. We are fully committed to the decarbonisation of the intralogistics industry. The end of manufacturing combustion engines is the start of a more sustainable future for Jungheinrich, but it is also a nod to our company history that began seven decades ago with the manufacture of electric trucks.\n\nDespite a further deterioration in the macroeconomic conditions, Jungheinrich recorded all-time highs in material key figures in the 2023 financial year. Incoming orders amounted to €5,238 million, revenue came to €5,546 million and EBIT reached €430 million. We anticipate profitable growth again in the 2024 financial year, and we will continue working on the transformation of our Group.\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Management, I would like to thank our more than 21,000 employees around the world for their tireless dedication, which is the foundation of our success. And thank you, our shareholders, for your trust in Jungheinrich. I would like to thank the Supervisory Board, chaired by Rolf Najork, for its close and constructive partnership. Once again, my special thanks go to our shareholder families Lang and Wolf for their ongoing trust. Jungheinrich's 70-year history is also your story – a success story that we will keep going into the future.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nLaQBe\n\nDr Lars Brzoska Chairman of the Board of Management\n\nJungheinrich AG // Annual Report 2023 Page 6  //  189\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-8-0\"></span>Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/8 description: A man with short gray hair and glasses is smiling in front of a yellow and white background. He is wearing a white shirt and a dark blue suit jacket.\n\nRolf Najork Chairman of the Supervisory Board\n\nUnder ongoing difficult economic and geopolitical circumstances, Jungheinrich once again performed well in the year under review. The overall tendencies toward recession, triggered by Russia's continued war against Ukraine, the escalation of the Middle East conflict and other geopolitical risks, posed significant challenges. Jungheinrich was able to counter these with targeted action while also setting out a path for the future.\n\n#### FOCAL POINTS OF SUPERVISORY BOARD ACTIVITY\n\nThe 2023 financial year was dominated by great economic and geopolitical challenges. The general reticence toward investment and the associated decline in demand were also felt by Jungheinrich. The company recognised these obstacles early on and reacted with appropriate measures, closing the 2023 financial year with a good performance once more, despite the difficult situation on the market.\n\nThe Board of Management continued its work to implement Strategy 2025+ in the reporting year, and with it consistently drove forward related projects concerning the company's future strategic alignment, notably with regards to processes, digitalisation, products and the organisation. In this regard, important milestones include the acquisition of the US-based Storage Solutions Group on 15 March 2023 and the total acquisition of the robotics specialist Magazino on 23 August 2023, with which Jungheinrich will boost the field of mobile robots as a future focus of intralogistics and expand its software expertise. The Supervisory Board was included in these projects at an early stage and kept fully informed. Another highlight in the reporting year was the start of production at the new Chomutov plant and the expansion of the joint venture for mobile automation solutions with Mitsubishi Logisnext in North America (Rocrich AGV Solutions). The Supervisory Board was closely involved in efforts to implement and adapt individual points of Strategy 2025+ in the reporting year. At the organisational and personnel level, important decisions were made regarding the position of the company in the future, including the creation of a new Board of Management division for automation, effective 1 April 2024. Succession planning for the Board of Management was also a focal point of the Supervisory Board's work in 2023.\n\nAs in the past, the Supervisory Board accompanied and supported the Board of Management in all projects in an advisory capacity, and exchanged information closely with the Board of Management. In addition to the economic challenges, the focus was also on implementing regulatory requirements, further developing corporate governance and sustainability. For instance, the Supervisory Board again dealt with the [remuneration report,](https://www.jungheinrich.com/en/investor-relations/corporate-governance/remuneration-of-board-of-management-and-supervisory-board-1145400) the latest version of the German Corporate Governance Code and the overarching issue of IT security (cyber security) and sustainability reporting in 2023.\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Supervisory Board meetings were held both as virtual or hybrid meetings and in-person meetings in the 2023 financial year. The technical possibilities and the positive experiences made during the coronavirus pandemic have provided a great amount of flexibility in this regard. The Annual General Meeting in May 2023 was again held as a virtual event without the physical presence of the shareholders, in line with the possibilities provided for under the law. This took place for the first time in line with the new provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act, which replaced the former special regulations enacted during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n#### COOPERATION BETWEEN THE SUPERVISORY BOARD AND THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT\n\nOnce again, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management worked together very closely and in a spirit of trust during the year under review. The Board of Management involved the Supervisory Board early on and extensively in all relevant aspects of its work, as well as the business activities of the company and the Group companies. This enabled the Supervisory Board to discuss the relevant aspects in good time and to satisfy itself at all times of the legality, appropriateness and correctness of the company's management. The Supervisory Board was also kept informed in a timely manner by means of detailed written and oral reports, in particular on the following topics: the market situation and demand, the current and expected economic development in the individual regions of the world, the business development and financial situation in the individual Group companies (in particular by analysing key indicators such as incoming orders, revenue, EBIT and margin), the number of employees, the status of capital expenditure, the current challenges relating to supply chains and material procurement, the reactions to this and the effects of the war in Ukraine on the company, its employees, customers and suppliers. Furthermore, after careful review and deliberation, the Supervisory Board approved numerous transactions requiring its approval and presented by the Board of Management, the most important of which are listed in this report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board and the Finance and Audit Committee also examined the risk management system, the effectiveness of the internal control system, the monitoring of accounting and accounting procedures, the internal audit system, compliance within the company as well as sustainability and non-financial reporting. The Supervisory Board did not identify any irregularities or objections in any of these areas in the 2023 financial year. The Board of Management fully complied with its reporting obligations. This means that the Supervisory Board did not need to exercise its statutory rights to request and inspect. The Finance and Audit Committee recommended that the Supervisory Board again propose that PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH, Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Hamburg, (PwC) be selected as the auditor for the 2023 financial year at the Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2023. The Supervisory Board and Annual General Meeting agreed with this proposal.\n\nThe Chairman of the Supervisory Board (acting simultaneously in his role as Chairman of the Personnel Committee) and the Chairman of the Finance and Audit Committee also reviewed important topics outside of the meetings in regular discussion with the Board of Management, in particular with the Chairman of the Board of Management and the Member of the Board of Management for Finance, and prepared points to be decided on in plenary sessions.\n\n#### MAIN ISSUES ADDRESSED IN SUPERVISORY BOARD MEETINGS\n\nThe Supervisory Board convened on a total of eleven occasions in the 2023 financial year, three of which were extraordinary, and four resolutions were passed by written procedure. Three meetings were held as video conferences, five meetings were held in person, and three meetings were hybrid events, where the majority of members were physically present and individual members were connected via video link. In the majority of meetings, the Supervisory Board discussed individual agenda items alone, i.e. without the presence of the members of the Board of Management. The Board of Management reported on the Group's current state of business in the ordinary meetings. The Supervisory Board's Personnel Committee and the Finance and Audit Committee reported regularly and on an ad hoc basis on current topics regarding the committee's work. Resolutions were passed in numerous meetings on proposals of the Board of Management, of which only the most important are mentioned below.\n\nAt the beginning of the reporting year, the Supervisory Board dealt in detail with the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group in three extraordinary meetings on 6, 10 and 19 January 2023 and provided its final approval for the transaction on 19 January 2023.\n\nIn a meeting on 6 March 2023, the Supervisory Board resolved to apply the discretionary factor with regard to the Board of Management's variable remuneration for the 2022 financial year and the remuneration report in accordance with Section 162 AktG. The Supervisory Board also resolved on its proposals for the Annual General Meeting for the upcoming elections to the Supervisory Board and approved donations for victims of the earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Supervisory Board held an accounts meeting for the 2022 financial year on 30 March 2023. This was to review and approve Jungheinrich AG's annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements together with the combined management report as of 31 December 2022. The Supervisory Board also endorsed the Board of Management's proposal for the appropriation of profits for the 2022 financial year to the Annual General Meeting, and approved the 2022 combined separate non-financial report for Jungheinrich AG and the Group. Moreover, the Supervisory Board passed a resolution on the actual values for calculating the variable remuneration for the members of the Board of Management for the 2022 financial year. Proposals for Board of Management decisions on individual projects, namely in relation to the development of several new models of trucks and a digital development tool changeover, were also approved at the meeting, and the creation of a new Board of Management division for automation was discussed.\n\nAt the beginning of April 2023, the Supervisory Board resolved by written procedure to grant the associate company Magazino GmbH a loan.\n\nIn its inaugural meeting on 11 May 2023, following the Supervisory Board elections at the Annual General Meeting and the employee representative elections, which were paused during the coronavirus pandemic, the Supervisory Board elected Mr Rolf Najork as the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and re-elected Mr Markus Haase as Deputy Chairman. The Supervisory Board also elected the members of the Mediation Committee, the Personnel Committee and the Finance and Audit Committee. In addition, the Supervisory Board resolved to reappoint Dr Volker Hues as a Member of the Board of Management and to create a Board of Management division for automation. Various current and planned projects were discussed.\n\nIn another resolution passed by written procedure, the Supervisory Board approved the inclusion of the AGV business that Mitsubishi Logisnext operates under the name Rocla in the joint venture MCJ Supply Chain Solutions LLC, a capital increase for the joint venture, and the renaming to Rocrich AGV Solutions LLC at the end of May 2023.\n\nIn the meeting on 30 June 2023, the Supervisory Board approved a further proposal made by the Board of Management regarding the development of a truck model and a change to the articles of association to delete a provision that had become obsolete. A variety of topics were also discussed in depth, specifically a number of current and planned projects, details regarding the new Board of Management division for automation and how to handle skills shortages.\n\nAt the end of July 2023, following detailed reporting and discussion, the Supervisory Board agreed through written procedure to the total acquisition of Magazino GmbH, in which the company had previously held a stake of approximately 22 per cent.\n\nAt the strategy meeting of the Supervisory Board on 20 September 2023, the status as regards Strategy 2025+ as well as a variety of focal topics and projects were presented and discussed in detail.\n\nIn an ordinary meeting on 21 September 2023, the Supervisory Board resolved on the pension arrangements for new members of the Board of Management and individual amendments to the adjustment rules for key figures relating to the effects from M&A transactions that are relevant to the variable remuneration of the Board of Management. Mr Udo Panenka was appointed to the Board of Management effective 1 April 2024, and will be responsible for the Automation division. The Supervisory Board also resolved on the conclusion of a termination agreement with Ms Sabine Neuß, with which she will resign from her office on the Board of Management by 30 June 2024. Board of Management proposals regarding individual investments and projects were also approved, including new promissory notes to ensure the Group's financing is not dependent on banks, further projects were touched on and personnel management and recruitment were discussed.\n\nIn another written procedure in November 2023, the Supervisory Board resolved on an early reappointment of Mr Christian Erlach to the Board of Management.\n\nIn a meeting on 19 December 2023 regarding the DEEP (Digital End-to-End Processes) programme, the Supervisory Board was shown, as in previous years, further details of this ongoing long-term programme to realign structures, processes and the IT architecture against the backdrop of the digital transformation, and the current status of the work to implement it.\n\nIn the 20 December 2023 meeting, the Supervisory Board focused on the progress of the remuneration report preparations for the 2023 financial year, including Board of Management succession planning, amendments to individual Strategy 2025+ targets and current and planned projects, among other issues. The Supervisory Board decided to appoint Mr Maik Manthey as new member of the Board of Management from 1 July 2024 who would be responsible for the Technics division. In addition, the Supervisory Board resolved to adjust the remuneration system for members of the Board of Management as of 1 January 2024 and determined the targets for the Board of Management's variable remuneration. Ms Antoinette P. Aris was re-elected as a non-voting member of the Personnel Committee for the\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\n2024 financial year due to her expertise in matters of remuneration. Selected adjustments to the rules of procedure for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board were adopted and the plan for 2024 was approved. In addition, the Supervisory Board approved further proposals by the Board of Management regarding the DEEP programme, a truck development project, setting up an Experience Centre, renovating the main marketing and sales office in the UK, and concluding a control and profit and loss transfer agreement with Magazino GmbH. Finally, the Supervisory Board resolved on the annual declaration pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (\"declaration of compliance\") based on the recommendation of the Finance and Audit Committee.\n\n#### ACTIVITY OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD COMMITTEES\n\nThe Finance and Audit Committee convened on nine occasions in the reporting year, one of which was extraordinary. Five meetings were held in person, three meetings were held as video conferences, and one meeting was a hybrid event, where the majority of members were physically present and one member was connected via video link. Some of the issues the Committee considered were non-financial reporting, capital market communications, how to handle business activities in Russia, and all topics related to the annual and consolidated financial statements of Jungheinrich AG and the audit services (fee and order preparation, focal points of the audit, audit results, additional audit services). The Committee also carefully completed the tasks entrusted to it, including monitoring accounting and accounting processes, the effectiveness of the internal control system, risk management and internal auditing. The Committee also discussed the regular oral and written reports submitted by the Compliance Officer in detail and dealt with various compliance issues. In addition, the Committee dealt with regular reports from the departments responsible on non-financial reporting and sustainability topics. In an extraordinary meeting in December 2023, the planning for the 2024 financial year was also discussed in detail and prepared for the Supervisory Board plenary meeting. The Committee also met regularly without the Board of Management in the year under review.\n\nThe Personnel Committee convened four times in the reporting year. Three meetings were held in person and one meeting was a hybrid event, where the majority of members were physically present and one member was connected via video link. The Committee dealt with all tasks assigned to it on behalf of the entire Supervisory Board – particularly new and reappointments as well as contract and remuneration issues for members of the Board of Management, including the remuneration system and the remuneration report for the 2022 and 2023 financial year. The Personnel Committee also focused its attention on senior executives of interest who were responsible for important tasks in the Group.\n\nThe Mediation Committee, according to Section 27, Paragraph 3 of the German Co-Determination Act, did not convene.\n\n#### OTHER INFORMATION\n\nWith the exception of two meetings of the Supervisory Board, which Mr Mike Retz was unable to attend, one meeting of the Supervisory Board which Ms Kristina Thurau-Vetter was unable to attend, and one meeting of the Supervisory Board which Ms Kathrin Elisabeth Dahnke was unable to attend, all meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees were always attended by all members of the respective committee. In the reporting year, there were no conflicts of interest of Board of Management or Supervisory Board members that would have had to be immediately disclosed to the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board take responsibility for the training and further education measures required for their tasks, such as those pertaining to changes in the legal framework or new technologies, and receive support here from the company, as do new members when they take up their position. The company thus offered a training event in the reporting year, which included internal and external experts, covering non-financial reporting and sustainability topics. All members of the Supervisory Board attended this event. New members of the Supervisory Board were instructed of their tasks, rights and duties as well as the organisational processes and IT infrastructure relevant to the Supervisory Board's work as part of the onboarding process.\n\n#### ANNUAL AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF 31 DECEMBER 2023\n\nThe annual financial statements prepared by the Board of Management, the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2023, and the combined management report of Jungheinrich AG, were audited by PwC. The auditors had no objections regarding the financial statements or the accounting, and confirmed this in their unqualified audit report.\n\nThe results of the audit performed by the auditors were the topic of meetings of the Finance and Audit Committee and of the Supervisory Board. The members of the Supervisory\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\nBoard checked the Board of Management documents for the annual and consolidated financial statements in great detail using PwC's audit reports. As is also regularly the case, the majority of members of the Supervisory Board attended the Finance and Audit Committee meeting for the preparation of the entire Supervisory Board's resolution regarding the 2023 financial statements. All members of the Supervisory Board approved the Board of Management's proposal for the appropriation of profits for the 2023 financial year. According to the audit's results, there are no objections to the internal control system, the risk management system or the compliance management system. There were also no objections to the declaration of compliance pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act.\n\nFollowing its detailed inspection of the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and combined management report, the Supervisory Board had no objections to the financial statements and agreed with the results of the audit performed by the auditors in its accounts meeting on 27 March 2024. The Supervisory Board authorised Jungheinrich AG's annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements for the period ending 31 December 2023. Jungheinrich AG's annual financial statements as of 31 December 2023 are therefore finalised.\n\nIn its meeting on 27 March 2024, the Supervisory Board also seconded the Board of Management's proposal for the appropriation of profits for the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe Finance and Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board also considered the combined separate non-financial report as of 31 December 2023, which was prepared by the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board approved this report, which was audited by PwC.\n\n#### PERSONNEL\n\nThe former Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Mr Hans-Georg Frey, resigned from office with effect from the end of the Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2023. The ordinary Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2023 elected Mr Rolf Najork to the Supervisory Board for a full term. Mr Najork was then elected Chairman of the Supervisory Board by the Supervisory Board and in this function also took up the chairmanship of the Personnel and Mediation Committees.\n\nThe ordinary Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2023 also elected Ms Kathrin Elisabeth Dahnke, who had been a court-appointed member since 1 December 2022, to the Supervisory Board for a full term. Ms Dahnke was also elected once more to sit on the Finance and Audit Committee by the Supervisory Board and was chosen to chair the said committee by its members.\n\nMs Dagmar Bieber resigned from the Supervisory Board effective 17 November 2023. Ms Eva Kohn, business IT specialist, software specialist at the company and member of various works council committees, has replaced her on the Supervisory Board as a substitute member elected by the employees. The Supervisory Board thanks Ms Bieber sincerely for her dedicated work.\n\nEffective at the end of his appointment term on 31 March 2024, Dr Volker Hues has been reappointed as a Member of the Board of Management responsible for Finance for a further three years. At the same time, an agreement was entered into with Dr Hues regarding a premature termination of office, which allows him to resign from office after 1 July 2025 with the consent of the Supervisory Board. Mr Christian Erlach was reappointed early as a Member of the Board of Management, responsible for Sales, with effect from 1 January 2024 until 31 December 2024. An agreement was also entered into with Mr Erlach regarding a premature termination of office, which allows him to resign from office after 30 June 2024 with the consent of the Supervisory Board.\n\nMr Udo Panenka was appointed to the Board of Management effective 1 April 2024, and will be responsible for the Automation division.\n\nA termination agreement was concluded with Ms Sabine Neuß, with which she will resign from her office on the Board of Management early by 30 June 2024. The Supervisory Board thanks Ms Neuß sincerely for her commitment and successful work for the company over the years. Ms Neuß left her mark on the Technics division in the most positive fashion, laying the foundation for outstanding developments in the future. Mr Maik Manthey was appointed as her successor in the Technics division effective from 1 July 2024.\n\nThe Supervisory Board acknowledges the exceptional performance of the Board of Management, senior executives and all employees in meeting the challenges of 2023 and would like to thank them all very much for their successful work.\n\nHamburg, 27 March 2024\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board\n\nR.

Nevertheless, the Jungheinrich share had a successful year on the stock market, gaining a significant 25 per cent in value. Moreover, Jungheinrich is planning to pay the highest dividend in the company's history of €0.75.\n\nImage /page/15/Figure/10 description: This bar chart shows the share price performance in 2023 in %. Jungheinrich has a share price performance of 25%. DAX has a share price performance of 20%. MDAX has a share price performance of 8%. SDAX has a share price performance of 17%.\n\n#### EQUITY MARKETS ON THE UP DESPITE CRISES\n\nIn 2023, both national and international stock markets were primarily impacted by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, rising interest rates, fears of recession and, at the end of the year, the escalation of the Middle East conflict. Stock indices rose sharply at the start of the year and were largely able to hold on to the early gains despite uncertainties until the end of the third quarter of 2023. Due to developments in the Middle East, the fourth quarter of 2023 got off to a negative start, but was also the starting point for a year-end rally and new highs for shares and indices. Geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties along with a potential lowering of interest rates in 2024 dominated the mixed picture of global investor sentiment at the end of the year.\n\nThe most important German stock market indices showed clear gains at the end of the year. The DAX ended 2023 with a comparably strong gain of 20 per cent at 16,752 points (previous year: 13,924 points). The MDAX closed the year with an 8 per cent gain, climbing to 27,137 points (previous year: 25,118 points), while the SDAX made a notable gain of 17 per cent and climbed to 13,960 points (previous year: 11,926 points).\n\n#### JUNGHEINRICH SHARE PRICE UP 25 PER CENT\n\nStarting from a closing price of €26.58 on the last trading day of 2022, the Jungheinrich share began the year under review at €27.04. The Board of Management published an ad hoc announcement on 25 January 2023 regarding the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group. Following the announcement, the share reached an annual high of €36.76 on 2 February 2023. In light of the positive business developments in the first quarter of 2023, the forecast ranges were raised on 24 April 2023 and the proportionate effects of the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group, which was completed on 15 March 2023, were outlined in more detail. This boosted the Jungheinrich share price, following a weak start to the second quarter, pushing it to significantly exceed the share price development of comparable indices in the first six months of the year at €33.54 on 30 June 2023.\n\nUncertainties around the world dominated events in the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2023. The Jungheinrich share was not able to evade this negative market environment and hit an annual low of €24.84 on 30 October 2023. In light of the prospect of easing on the interest markets, losses were soon recuperated. Seen over the course of the year, shares ended trading for 2023 at €33.22, thus recording a clear 25 per cent gain over the previous year. Market capitalisation increased accordingly by €677 million during the year and stood at €3,388 million at the end of 2023 (previous year: €2,711 million).\n\nWith market capitalisation of €1,531 million (previous year: €1,318 million), which is relevant for index calculation, the Jungheinrich preferred share ranked 79th in the Deutsche Börse ranking list (previous year: 88th) at the end of December 2023. According to Deutsche Börse's definition of free float, this includes all stock-market-listed shares of Jungheinrich AG. Of the total number of Jungheinrich AG shares (102 million), only the 48 million no-par-value preferred shares are listed and widely distributed. The 54 million ordinary shares are not listed, and they are held equally by the families of each of company founder Dr Friedrich Jungheinrich's two daughters.\n\nThe [shareholdings in Jungheinrich AG reportable](https://www.jungheinrich.com/en/investor-relations/notifications-168886) pursuant to Sections 33 et seq. of the German Securities Trading Act (WpHG) have been published in accordance with Section 40 of the German Securities Trading Act (WpHG) in the notes to the annual financial statements of Jungheinrich AG and on the company's website.\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/16/Figure/8 description: This line graph compares the share price performance of Jungheinrich, DAX, MDAX, and SDAX from 2019 to 2023, measured in percentage. The y-axis ranges from 40 to 220. The x-axis represents the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.\n\nImage /page/16/Figure/9 description: The image is a line graph titled \"Share price performance 2023 in %.\" The y-axis ranges from 90 to 150. The x-axis is divided into four quarters: Q1 2023, Q2 2023, Q3 2023, and Q4 2023. There are four lines on the graph, representing Jungheinrich, DAX, MDAX, and SDAX. Jungheinrich starts at approximately 120 in Q1, rises to 140, fluctuates between 120 and 130 in Q2 and Q3, drops to 95 in Q4, and ends at 125. DAX starts at 105 in Q1, rises to 115, fluctuates between 110 and 120 in Q2 and Q3, drops to 95 in Q4, and ends at 115. MDAX starts at 110 in Q1, rises to 115, fluctuates between 110 and 115 in Q2 and Q3, drops to 95 in Q4, and ends at 110. SDAX starts at 105 in Q1, rises to 110, fluctuates between 105 and 115 in Q2 and Q3, drops to 95 in Q4, and ends at 120.\n\n#### SHARE PRICE DEVELOPMENT OVER TIME TRADING VOLUME BELOW PREVIOUS YEAR'S LEVEL\n\nThe Jungheinrich share is listed in the Prime Standard quality segment of the Deutsche Börse. It is traded on all German stock exchanges. The trading volume (Xetra and Frankfurt) amounted to 22.6 million shares in 2023, about 40 per cent down from the trading volume in the previous year (39.3 million shares). The average number of shares traded per trading day (Xetra and Frankfurt) also decreased about 40 per cent to 89.5 thousand shares compared to the previous year (152.8 thousand shares). The average daily trading volume amounted to €2.8 million (previous year: €4.0 million).\n\n#### DIVIDEND RISES TO HISTORIC HIGH\n\nJungheinrich's dividend policy is fundamentally geared towards continuous dividend payments. The aim is to distribute between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of the profit after tax attributable to the shareholders of Jungheinrich AG.\n\nThe Board of Management and Supervisory Board of Jungheinrich AG will propose to the Annual General Meeting on 15 May 2024 that a dividend of €0.75 (previous year: €0.68) per no-par preferred share and €0.73 (previous year: €0.66) per no-par ordinary share be distributed. Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, this will result in a total payment of €75 million (previous year: €68 million).\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\nNon-financial report\n\nThe dividend payment will be made on the third working day after the Annual General Meeting. The payment ratio, which is calculated as the percentage of the total dividend in relation to the profit attributable to the shareholders of Jungheinrich AG, thus reaches 25 per cent as in the previous year.\n\n#### REASONS TO INVEST IN JUNGHEINRICH SHARES\n\nFor more than 70 years, Jungheinrich has been a leading provider of sustainable intralogistics products and solutions.

Key topics of capital market communication in 2023 were the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group, the business development in light of the global geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties as well as the implementation progress of the Strategy 2025+.\n\nThe company informed the capital markets about particularly significant developments through ad hoc announcements as follows:\n\n- Announcement on 25 January 2023: \"Jungheinrich AG to acquire Storage Solutions Group\"\n- Announcement on 24 April 2023: \"Jungheinrich raises forecast for 2023 and publishes preliminary figures as of 31 March 2023\"\n\nAs in the past, communication with capital market participants took place both virtually and in the form of in-person events and meetings. For instance, the analyst conference for the 2022 financial year was again held as a video conference on 31 March 2023. The Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2023 was once again a virtual meeting, however, for the first time it was possible to pose questions during the event. While investor conferences exclusively took place in person, the roadshows were both physical and virtual events. This allowed for greater flexibility in terms of regional coverage of investor contacts. With regard to the publication of its quarterly and half-year figures, Jungheinrich reported as usual in detail on the current business development of the Group in conference calls.\n\nDuring the conference call on the business development as of 30 September 2023 on 10 November 2023, the Board of Management also presented its Strategy 2025+ status report. The focus was on the field of automation, which was dominated in the financial year by the acquisition and postmerger integration of the Storage Solutions Group and the expansion of the product and solutions portfolio through the acquisition of all shares in Magazino. Approximately 300 investors had contact with the company during the year.

Customers also have access to a comprehensive range of financial services. Jungheinrich aims to create sustainable value.\n\n#### Business model of Jungheinrich Business model of Jungheinrich\n\nImage /page/20/Figure/13 description: The image is a diagram of a gear with the word \"CUSTOMER\" in the center. The gear is divided into three sections: \"Products & solutions\", \"Services\", and \"Partners of Jungheinrich\". The \"Products & solutions\" section includes \"New trucks\", \"Short-term rental\", \"Used equipment\", \"Warehouse equipment\", \"Automation\", \"Energy solutions\", \"Digital solutions\", and \"Operating & office equipment\". The \"Services\" section includes \"Consulting\", \"Financial services\", and \"After-sales services\".

In addition, Jungheinrich covers almost all demand for electric motors in a joint venture with another manufacturer of material handling equipment in Moravany (Czechia) and Putian (China).\n\nJungheinrich manufactures stacker trucks, reach trucks and horizontal order pickers in Norderstedt. In addition to truck production, the plant also manufactures electronic control units, lithium-ion batteries and battery chargers.

The Moosburg plant manufactures counterbalanced trucks, while the neighbouring factory in Degernpoint manufactures narrow-aisle trucks, heavy-duty vertical order pickers and AGVs. The production focus at the Landsberg/Saale plant is on low-lift trucks and double-decker trucks. Since June 2023, the new plant in Chomutov (Czechia) has also been manufacturing reach trucks. The Qingpu plant in China produces low-lift and stacker trucks, battery-powered counterbalance trucks and reach trucks, as well as control units and batteries. The MIAS Group manufactures stacker cranes and load handling equipment at its locations in Munich, Gyöngös (Hungary) and Kunshan (China).\n\nUsed equipment is industrially refurbished in a plant close to Dresden and in a plant in Ploiești (Romania).\n\nThe development of digital products is concentrated at the locations in Graz (Austria), Hamburg and Madrid (Spain). The software and hardware development services are based in Zagreb (Croatia).\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Changes to the portfolio\n\nOn 25 January 2023, Jungheinrich announced its acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group (Storage Solutions), Westfield/ Indiana (USA), a leading provider of solutions for racking systems and warehouse automation in the US. Jungheinrich has thus expanded its access to the US market for warehouse equipment and automation. With the completion of the acquisition on 15 March 2023, 100 per cent of the shares in the Storage Solutions Group were consolidated for the first time. The Storage Solution Group comprises seven companies based in the USA. Storage Solutions' proportional contribution to revenue in the 2023 financial year was €219 million.\n\nIn another important step towards strengthening its automation expertise, Jungheinrich acquired the remaining shares in the robotics specialist Magazino GmbH, Munich (Magazino), effective 23 August 2023. The company was fully consolidated from that date.\n\n#### International sales with a focus on the direct sales and service network\n\nJungheinrich has established a global direct sales and service network with locations in 42 countries to offer the bestpossible customer service. The Jungheinrich Group is also represented in approximately 80 other countries through partner companies. The Group's core market is Europe, where 80 per cent of Group revenue is generated. Of the European revenue, 27 per cent is generated in Germany.\n\nWith the acquisition of Storage Solutions in the reporting year, Jungheinrich is now also covering the US market for warehouse equipment and automation.\n\nIn North America, Jungheinrich also cooperates with Mitsubishi Logisnext Americas Inc. (MLA), a sales partner with a comprehensive dealership footprint, in the truck business. Firstly, equipment manufactured by Jungheinrich in Germany is marketed via MLA's sales organisation in North America. Secondly, MLA produces trucks in its plants that are developed by Jungheinrich locally in Houston. Jungheinrich has also been working on the joint venture Rocrich AGV Solutions LLC (Rocrich) (formerly MCJ Supply Chain Solutions LLC) with MLA since September 2023. Rocrich offers mobile automation and robotics solutions for warehouses and production plants.\n\nIn China, Jungheinrich serves the metropolitan regions of Shanghai, Changzhou, Guangzhou and Tianjin through a joint venture with Anhui Heli Co. Ltd., leasing material handling equipment via four subsidiaries.\n\nTo cover the constantly growing after-sales services business, Jungheinrich operates a central spare parts centre in Kaltenkirchen. With this warehouse, and others in Lahr, Bratislava (Slovakia), Shanghai (China), Birmingham (UK) and Singapore (Singapore), Jungheinrich can guarantee the global supply of spare parts for its after-sales services. Through the joint venture TREX.PARTS GmbH & Co. KG, Jungheinrich is tapping into additional market potential in the spare parts market.\n\n#### Organisation and Group management\n\nJungheinrich AG is the listed management holding company of the Group. It controls company activities and is responsible for overarching functions such as strategy, financing, M&A, accounting, controlling, human resources management, sustainability, corporate communications, information technology, legal, tax, internal audit and compliance. The operating business is divided into the two reportable segments under IFRS: \"Intralogistics\" and \"Financial Services\". The Intralogistics segment comprises the business fields of new business, short-term rental and used equipment, as well as after-sales. New business consists of new manual material handling equipment, automated material handling equipment and facilities (including stacker cranes and load handling equipment), warehouse equipment, factory and office equipment, energy solutions and digital products. There is no further subdivision of the \"Financial Services\" reporting segment into business fields.\n\nAs part of a near-shoring concept, Jungheinrich has several Business Service Centers that pool internal services.\n\nThe Board of Management is responsible for the Group's strategic management and operational leadership. This involves determining and monitoring company targets, taking responsibility for leadership, management and controlling processes – including the internal compliance management system and the internal control and risk management systems – and resource allocation. The key figures and reports regularly presented to the entire Board of Management are based on Group-wide, economic performance parameters.\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe supervisory and advisory body for the Board of Management is the Supervisory Board, which consists of twelve people, pursuant to the requirements of the German Co-Determination Act. There are an equal number of shareholder representatives and employee representatives on the Supervisory Board.\n\nAs the parent company, Jungheinrich AG holds shares directly and indirectly in both domestic and foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. The managing directors of the subsidiaries are responsible for operations and economic performance in the local markets. The companies receive support from the management of the holding company, but are independent from a legal perspective. The consolidated financial statements cover 102 fully consolidated companies – including Jungheinrich AG. The complete shareholdings in Jungheinrich AG can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements [ [page](#page-175-0) 174 ].\n\n#### Important key performance indicators\n\nThe Jungheinrich Group uses selected key figures to determine budget targets as well as medium- and long-term company targets. The Board of Management considers key financial indicators predominantly in order to manage the Group. The return on capital employed (ROCE) and the free cash flow are used for management purposes, in addition to incoming orders and revenue, earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) or EBIT return on sales (EBIT ROS) and earnings before taxes (EBT) or EBT return on sales (EBT ROS). Another performance parameter is the ratio of trucks equipped with lithium-ion batteries.\n\nThe financial key figure ROCE represents the rate of return based on the EBIT generated in the Intralogistics segment in relation to the capital employed that can be attributed to this segment. This means returns can be determined regardless of whether a customer has financing from the Jungheinrich Group's Financial Services segment. Capital employed is calculated from fixed assets (without trucks for short-term rental and trucks for lease) plus trucks for short-term rental and working capital less other provisions. Working capital includes inventories as well as trade accounts receivable and contract assets less trade accounts payable and contract liabilities. The average of capital employed is calculated by including the figures as at the balance sheet date of the current quarter and the three quarters before this balance sheet date in order to prevent fluctuations in the capital employed on the balance sheet date. For interim reporting, the EBIT of the period is annualised and viewed in relation to the average capital employed. ROCE is not reported for the \"Financial Services\" segment as the EBIT return on capital employed (ROCE) is not a control parameter for this segment.\n\nThe free cash flow is defined as the sum of cash flows from operating activities and investing activities. Cash flow from investing activities is adjusted for payments for acquisitions and proceeds from the sale of securities as well as payments for and proceeds from time deposits. As a rule, securities and time deposits are assigned to Group liquidity (cash and cash equivalents and securities reported in the balance sheet). Changes in these items are therefore not part of the Jungheinrich Group's free cash flow.\n\nIn addition to this, the equipment ratio of trucks with lithium-ion batteries as part of both the short-term and longterm variable remuneration of the Board of Management is a material non-financial control parameter for the Jungheinrich Group. It symbolises the company's commitment to sustainability and is an integral part of the corporate strategy. It is also one of the central targets of Strategy 2025+. The equipment ratio of lithium-ion batteries is calculated from the ratio of incoming orders for lithium-ion battery-powered trucks (units; excluding purchased electric trucks with built-in batteries) to incoming orders for battery-powered trucks, regardless of type of battery (units; excluding purchased electric trucks with built-in battery).\n\nThe Board of Management follows developments in the figures indicated above as part of the regular reporting process. Where necessary, appropriate measures are launched and significant deviations analysed based on constant monitoring of target and actual figures.\n\nChanges in various early indicators are monitored and evaluated in order to recognise possible future developments within the company in good time and to maintain a basis on which to base business policy decisions. These are primarily prognoses from economic experts on developments in gross domestic product in Jungheinrich's core markets, indices for evaluating the economic situation in the sector, and continual monitoring of incoming orders and orders on hand.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Geopolitical tensions continue to demand foresight in supply chain management\n\nGlobal supply chains continued to stabilise over the course of 2023. The situation on the energy markets also eased, although further energy policy developments still need to be observed closely. However, the availability of electronic components remained unreliable. All of the measures introduced in recent years to ensure material and energy supply are still being applied. Supplier risk management consists of the regular monitoring of inventories, supply reach, and transport times in combination with close supplier controlling. In addition, swift action was taken to changes in demand in the reporting year thanks to adjusted and flexible inventory and demand planning management in close coordination with suppliers. The ongoing establishment of alternative procurement sources to reduce dependence and the expansion of the European supplier base were vital elements in securing stable supply. Both of these measures contributed to boosting Jungheinrich's negotiating position and attain competitive prices.\n\nAn increasingly critical factor on the procurement side was the availability of skilled personnel, leading suppliers to report early on about capacity issues resulting from personnel shortages. The cooperation with suppliers, built up over many years, proved its worth here in terms of the demand and production planning as well as targeted process management. Thus far it has been possible to avoid disruptions in the supply chains.\n\nAlthough the energy supply situation in Europe continues to improve, geopolitical tensions can still have a considerable impact on energy supplies. The longer-term goal is to reduce dependence on gas supply and to substitute gas as an energy source. In this context, Jungheinrich relies on the use of alternative fossil and renewable energy sources for both process heat and heating, in addition to focused savings in consumption, in order to aid the decoupling from the gas supply.\n\nThe task of establishing and optimising sustainable procurement in internal processes and with suppliers was continued in 2023. For instance, the requirements of the Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains (LkSG) were integrated in Jungheinrich's procurement processes and the supplier qualification process. In addition, the existing management system for sustainable procurement was extended to include preventative and remedial measures and the organisational prerequisites were put in place to fulfil not only the LkSG requirements but also the strategic sustainability targets.\n\nIn light of the slight decline in production unit numbers and simultaneous reduction in safety stock levels, the purchasing volumes for production materials decreased. Mainly as a result of inflation, the purchasing volume for indirect materials and services on the other hand increased noticeably. This led to an increase in the purchasing volume overall to €3,215 million in the 2023 financial year following €3,118 million in the previous year.\n\nThe purchasing volume can generally be divided into:\n\n- Production materials, including post-production materials\n- Indirect materials and services\n- Merchandise\n\nImage /page/23/Figure/17 description: The image is a pie chart titled \"Breakdown of purchasing volume in 2023\". The pie chart is divided into three sections: 27% Merchandise, 33% Indirect materials and services, and 40% Production materials.\n\n| in € million                    | 2023  | 2022  | Change % |\n|---------------------------------|-------|-------|----------|\n| Production materials            | 1,300 | 1,387 | -6.3     |\n| Indirect materials and services | 1,043 | 903   | 15.5     |\n| Merchandise                     | 872   | 828   | 5.3      |\n| Total                           | 3,215 | 3,118 | 3.1      |\n\nDue to Jungheinrich's strong presence in the European market and the production plants being primarily located in Germany, 90 per cent of the purchasing volume was attributable to Europe.\n\nThe top-selling commodity groups were batteries, warehouse equipment, steel components, electric drive trains and logistics services.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-24-0\"></span>Research and development\n\nThe main research and development (R&D) activities in the financial year were the construction of new material handling equipment with a focus on the further development of efficient energy storage systems based on lithium-ion technology. There was also a focus on the development of mobile robots and the optimisation of automated systems. A further focal R&D point was digital products.\n\nImage /page/24/Figure/9 description: The image is a bar chart that shows the research and development expenditure in millions of euros for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The expenditure for 2023 is 152 million euros, for 2022 is 128 million euros, and for 2021 is 102 million euros.\n\nR&D expenditure consists primarily of internal services. Including the use of third-party services, it stood at €152 million in the Group, 18.8 per cent higher than in the previous year (€128 million). As in the previous year, this corresponded to a 2.7 per cent share of Group revenue. The increase in important product development work meant that the capitalisation ratio rose to 29 per cent (previous year: 24 per cent). In the reporting period, depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses on capitalised development expenditure included impairment losses of €3 million. These impairment losses were related to the development of a technology which will not be continued.\n\nR&D received another personnel boost in the reporting year; the number of employees involved in development projects across the Group stood at an average of 1,017 in the reporting period (previous year: 885). The change was largely down to the full acquisition of Magazino. Jungheinrich AG, which is responsible for Group-wide basic and product development, accounted for 141 (previous year: 130) employees.\n\n#### Research and development\n\n| in € million                                                                                     | 2023  | 2022 | Change % |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------|----------|\n| Total R&D expenditure                                                                            | 152   | 128  | 18.8     |\n| thereof capitalised<br>development expenditure                                                   | 45    | 30   | 50.0     |\n| Capitalisation ratio                                                                             | 29%   | 24%  | –        |\n| Depreciation, amortisation<br>and impairment losses on<br>capitalised development<br>expenditure | 14    | 16   | –12.5    |\n| R&D costs<br>(statement of profit or loss)                                                       | 121   | 113  | 7.1      |\n| Total R&D expenditure/<br>Group revenue                                                          | 2.7%  | 2.7% | –        |\n| Average number of<br>R&D employees (FTE)                                                         | 1,017 | 885  | 14.9     |\n| Number of patent applications                                                                    | 133   | 99   | 34.3     |\n| Number of patents granted                                                                        | 152   | 165  | –7.9     |\n\nTable contains rounding differences.\n\n#### STRATEGY 2025+\n\nWe continued implementing Strategy 2025+ in the 2023 financial year. Despite the ongoing challenging conditions from both a macroeconomic and geopolitical point of view, initiatives and measures were still implemented in all six strategic fields of action.\n\n#### Central targets reviewed and adjusted\n\nTaking into account the acquisition and anticipated contributions from Storage Solutions and in light of other material macroeconomic challenges at the time the corporate strategy was published in November 2020, we have reviewed and partially adjusted our targets in the year under review. The aim is to increase Group revenue to €6.0 billion organically by the 2025 financial year (previously: €5.5 billion) and again achieve EBIT ROS of 8 to 10 per cent. Our target is to generate more than 20 per cent of the revenue outside of Europe, this increase in revenue will be both organic and inorganic. ROCE is anticipated to be between 14 per cent and 18 per cent (previously: 21 per cent to 25 per cent). The changes in the target ranges reflect that the goodwill of the acquisitions was taken into account. By 2025, 50 per cent (previously 70 per cent) of Jungheinrich trucks should be fitted with lithium-ion batteries. The considerable increase in cell prices have led to an adjustment of this target. We are aiming for an EBIT per employee of around €23,000. By 2025, the proportion of female managers is targeted to reach 20 per cent.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe minimum target for free cash flow is now more than €300 million (previously: at least €100 million). As far as sustainability is concerned, we have set ourselves various targets, but the main target is to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. To this end, our aim is to reduce direct CO2e emissions in Scope 1 by 42 per cent compared to the baseline year of 2021 in line with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and procure 100 per cent of electricity from renewable sources by 2030.\n\n#### Automation: key factor in envisaged growth\n\nThe focus of our measures in the automation strategic field of action is on mobile robots and automated storage & retrieval systems (ASRS). Mobile robots includes both Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) and Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR).\n\nIn the reporting year, we also initiated further development activities for the PowerCube, an automated compact storage system for containers that was brought onto the market in 2022. Jungheinrich also launched the EAE 212a in 2023, a newly developed mobile robot solution for low-lift trucks.\n\nWe increased our shareholding in robotics specialist Magazino to 100 per cent in the reporting year. The purchase price for the remaining shares came to €20 million. Magazino has a high-performance technology platform that allows the operation of logistics robots even in a mixed human-machine environment. With approx. 120 employees, Magazino boosts the autonomous robot business and increases Jungheinrich's software expertise.\n\nWe expanded the customer base for the AMR arculee in 2023. The autonomous mobile robot was launched in 2022 and is used in underload transport and in goods-to-person order picking.\n\nWe firmly believe that the high-volume global market for warehouse logistics automation is a market with aboveaverage growth and we intend to keep expanding our position in this market. Accordingly, it was decided to create a new Board of Management division for automation. As a result, all customer-specific project business units and resources focussing on mobile robots, ASRS and warehouse equipment will be pooled in this division from 1 April 2024.\n\n#### Digitalisation: further development of the IT infrastructure\n\nThe digital fleet management system, Jungheinrich FMS, has been available in three more countries – Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia – since 2023. The system is now available in 25 countries. Expansion to further countries, especially outside Europe, is planned for the coming years. We added new software modules and functions to the Jungheinrich FMS in 2023. The migration of customers of the predecessor ISM Online to the new Jungheinrich FMS is also virtually complete. Since August 2023, almost every truck manufactured in Europe has a telematics box integrated as standard. That means the free Jungheinrich FMS starter kit can be activated for each truck with a telematics box and further premium modules can be added. The telematics box is the technical foundation for further data-based services in future such as remote diagnostics and predictive maintenance.\n\nJungheinrich's largest IT project to date – establishing a new IT infrastructure – was completed in 2023. The interconnectivity created between the private Jungheinrich cloud and IT providers' offers guarantees the secure, flexible and fast availability of IT services and products worldwide. On the basis of this infrastructure, Jungheinrich's ongoing digital transformation optimises the interconnectivity of processes, data and applications both in its own processes and the digitalisation of its customers' intralogistics processes.\n\n#### Energy systems: sharp increase in demand in core business\n\nJungheinrich ceased manufacturing IC engine-powered trucks in March 2023 and since then manufactures 100 per cent electric trucks. We recorded a strong rise in demand for POWERLiNE trucks, which are considerably more compact than their predecessors thanks to integrated lithium-ion batteries and thus offer an advantage in tight warehouse environments, in the 2023 financial year. In addition, POWERLiNE trucks are CO2e-neutral until delivery to the customer.\n\n#### Efficiency: organisational and procedural transformation is progressing\n\nJungheinrich has been manufacturing the ETV 216i reach truck at the new Chomutov plant in Czechia since June 2023. A new 37,000 square-metre building was constructed that is both energy-efficient and carbon-optimised. The project budget of approx. €60 million was almost completely used in the reporting year. The new plant is a central building block to increase efficiency and profitability.\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe also expanded our near-shoring organisation in 2023. In Madrid, the focus is on internal IT services and development services for digital products. At the end of 2023, the company employed a staff of almost 100 there. The personnel capacities in Braşov (Romania), where our internal administrative services are increasingly based, more than doubled in the reporting year to 140 employees. At the small location, in terms of capacity, in Zagreb, employees provide software and hardware development services for the entire Group.\n\nKey measures to increase efficiency in the Jungheinrich Group, including the digital transformation of the company, are managed through the DEEP programme (Digital End-to-End Processes). DEEP is designed to achieve customerfocussed and lean, automated processes. The design and implementation phases were continued in 2023. We have achieved the first two programme milestones with the central master data solution and the central finance system. Development work on the Group-wide ERP system was continued along with the implementation of other important applications, for example a new internal service management solution for the after-sales service business.\n\n#### Global footprint: present on the American market with Storage Solutions and Rocrich\n\nJungheinrich's strategic goal is to grow through acquisitions and partnerships, too. With the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group, a leading provider of racking systems and warehouse automation in the US, we have significantly expanded our global footprint in the North America region. The purchase price was €325 million. With Storage Solutions, we now have access to the US market for warehouse equipment and automation and thus the ability to exploit further growth potential in this market. The post-merger integration of Storage Solutions is going according to plan and the business performance was in line with expectations in the reporting period.\n\nWe have established an optimised range of automation solutions in North America with the joint venture Rocrich. The combination of Mitsubishi Logisnext's (brand: Rocla) truck portfolio and Jungheinrich's AGVs, puts us in a position to serve the North American market with more than 570 Logisnext retail locations.\n\n#### Sustainability: creating sustainable value remains the main focus\n\nWe participate in ratings and rankings in order to show the progress we are making in the field of sustainability. Based on communication with stakeholders and internal analyses, we focus on selected ESG ratings in order to specifically develop our externally evaluated sustainability performance.\n\nEcoVadis awarded Jungheinrich Platinum status for the third consecutive time in 2023. The CDP rating of B in the previous year in the climate category was again confirmed for 2023 (in a nine-step scale from A to F) for transparency and commitment to climate protection. ISS ESG Corporate Rating again awarded Jungheinrich the sector-specific status Prime in the reporting year. Jungheinrich improved its rating to B– (12-step scale from A+ to D–). The Group again achieved a rating of A from MSCI ESG Ratings (seven-step industryspecific scale from AAA to CCC) in 2023.\n\nA great deal of progress has been made throughout the Group in terms of sustainability, but the following is particularly noteworthy: By the end of the 2023 financial year, the transition to electricity from renewable energy was completed in 28 countries. We also expanded the CO2e-neutral after-sales service to five markets. We formalised the Groupwide human rights management system and Jungheinrich published its first policy statement on respecting human rights. In addition, we joined the UN Global Compact Initiative.\n\nWe provide extensive information regarding our sustainability activities in the combined separate non-financial report in this annual report in accordance with the CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG) [ [page](#page-55-0) 54 ].\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-27-0\"></span>Economic report\n\n#### ECONOMIC AND SECTOR ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe regional focus of Jungheinrich's activities lies in Europe. Outside Europe, the focus is on North America and Asia Pacific. Each country's gross domestic product (GDP) as an economic indicator is key to evaluating business developments in these regions.\n\n#### Europe holding back global economic growth\n\nIn 2023, the global economy recorded less growth than in the previous year, despite high GDP growth in the United States and China. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, rising interest rates, fears of recession and the latest escalation in the Middle East conflict all dominated the global economy and led to a much lower increase in economic output, particularly in the eurozone, in the reporting year.\n\n#### Growth rates for selected economic regions\n\n| Gross domestic product in % | 2023 | 2022 |\n|-----------------------------|------|------|\n| World                       | 3.1  | 3.5  |\n| USA                         | 2.5  | 1.9  |\n| China                       | 5.2  | 3.0  |\n| Eurozone                    | 0.5  | 3.4  |\n| Germany                     | -0.3 | 1.8  |\n\nSource: International Monetary Fund (estimates as of 30 January 2024 with updated prior-year figures compared to the 2022 combined management report).\n\nThus, with a GDP increase of just 0.5 per cent, the eurozone showed noticeably lower growth in economic output than in the previous year (3.4 per cent). Following growth of 1.8 per cent in the previous year, Germany's export-oriented economy contracted by 0.3 per cent in 2023. Based on a GDP increase of 2.5 per cent in the previous year, the French economy only recorded an increase in economic growth of 0.8 per cent in the reporting year. Similar developments were seen in the Italian and British growth rates: the Italian economy grew 0.7 per cent in the reporting year, following 3.7 per cent in the previous year, while GDP in the UK rose 0.5 per cent following 4.3 per cent in 2022. Jungheinrich generates 45 per cent of its Group revenue in the four countries mentioned above.\n\n#### STATEMENT FROM THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND TARGET ACHIEVEMENT\n\nIn light of the latest corporate planning and the positive business performance in the first quarter of 2023, the Board of Management of Jungheinrich AG raised the forecast ranges for 2023 published in the 2022 annual report in an ad hoc announcement on 24 April 2023. The impact of the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group on the individual forecast ranges was also provided in the adjusted forecast. The acquisition was taken into account in the previous forecast, but not individually quantified. Following the final purchase price adjustment and the completed purchase price allocation, the impacts of the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group were updated in the interim report as of 30 June 2023 on 9 August 2023.\n\nAt €5,238 million, incoming orders in the Group was in the middle of the forecast range (€5.0 billion to €5.4 billion). Storage Solutions' contribution was expected to be €0.3 billion but came in lower at €0.2 billion due to demand. Group revenue amounted to €5,546 million and reached the upper value of the forecast range (€5.1 billion to €5.5 billion). Storage Solutions' contribution to revenue amounted to €0.2 billion as planned.\n\nDespite an increase in personnel (including through acquisitions), tariff effects, a rise in the cost of materials and a slight decrease in number of units produced in comparison with the previous year, we were able to generate EBIT of €430 million thanks to appropriate measures and thus achieve a figure in the middle of the forecast range of €400 million to €450 million. The effect on EBIT from the Storage Solutions Group in the amount of €– 5 million is also taken into account. This effect is the result of a positive operating contribution to EBIT and negative effects from transaction-related expenses, effects from the purchase price allocation and variable remuneration elements for the management of the Storage Solutions Group. EBIT ROS came to 7.8 per cent and was thus at the lower end of the range of between 7.8 per cent and 8.6 per cent.\n\nAt €399 million, EBT was in the middle of the expected range of €370 million to €420 million. EBIT ROS came to 7.2 per cent and was thus at the lower end of the forecast range of between 7.2 per cent and 8.0 per cent.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-28-0\"></span>ROCE of 15.9 per cent was in the lower half of the forecast range of 15.0 per cent to 18.0 per cent. This was due to the increase in average capital employed in the reporting year as a result of the goodwill recognised for Storage Solutions and Magazino in the amount of €302 million.\n\nFree cash flow came to €15 million and was significantly better than in the previous year (€– 239 million), as anticipated. A negative free cash flow was originally expected, but thanks to the stable working capital compared to the previous year, even a slightly positive cash flow was generated in contrast to the forecast. The positive free cash flow figure takes into account the outflow of €326 million for the acquisition of Storage Solutions and Magazino.\n\n#### Target-to-actual comparison\n\n|                    |              | Forecast                                    |              | actual<br>2023 |\n|--------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------|\n|                    |              | March 20231                                 | April 20232  |                |\n| Incoming<br>orders | in € billion | 4.8 to 5.2                                  | 5.0 to 5.4   | 5.2            |\n| Revenue            | in € billion | 4.9 to 5.3                                  | 5.1 to 5.5   | 5.5            |\n| EBIT               | in € million | 350 to 400                                  | 400 to 450   | 430            |\n| EBIT ROS           | in %         | 7.3 to 8.1                                  | 7.8 to 8.6   | 7.8            |\n| EBT                | in € million | 325 to 375                                  | 370 to 420   | 399            |\n| EBT ROS            | in %         | 6.6 to 7.4                                  | 7.2 to 8.0   | 7.2            |\n| ROCE               | in %         | 13.0 to 16.0                                | 15.0 to 18.0 | 15.9           |\n| Free<br>cash flow  | in € million | significantly better,<br>but still negative |              | 15             |\n\n<sup>1</sup> Annual report 2022.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Ad hoc release from 24 April 2023 and interim report as of 31 March 2023.\n\n#### BUSINESS TREND AND EARNINGS POSITION\n\n#### Orders on hand reflect normalisation of supply chains\n\nAt 122 thousand units, incoming orders in new business, based on units, which includes orders for both new forklifts and trucks for short-term rental, fell by 5.4 per cent (previous year: 129 thousand units). By value, incoming orders for the business fields of new business, short-term rental and used equipment, as well as after-sales services were 9.3 per cent higher than the previous year's level at €5,238 million (previous year: €4,791 million). The incoming orders attributable to Storage Solutions amounted to €157 million.\n\nOrders on hand in new business amounted to €1,441 million as of 31 December 2023 (previous year: €1,595 million) and takes into account orders on hand of €51 million at the Storage Solutions Group. Developments in orders on hand are due to the further normalisation of supply chains, which led to a successive processing of existing orders.\n\nImage /page/28/Figure/17 description: The image shows a bar chart of incoming orders in millions of euros. In 2023, the incoming orders were 5,238 million euros. In 2022, the incoming orders were 4,791 million euros. In 2021, the incoming orders were 4,868 million euros.\n\n#### Revenue outside Europe exceeds €1 billion as a result of acquisition\n\nGroup revenue exceeded the previous year's figure (€4,763 million) by 16.4 per cent or €783 million and amounted to €5,546 million. Europe accounted for 80 per cent (previous year: 84 per cent) of revenue. Foreign revenue increased by 18.7 per cent to €4,341 million (previous year: €3,657 million). In addition to the rise in revenue outside of Europe, revenue in the UK, France and Italy also climbed considerably. The foreign ratio was 78 per cent (previous year: 77 per cent).\n\nOutside of Europe, revenue jumped 45.7 per cent to €1,087 million (previous year: €746 million). The share of Group revenue from outside Europe thus increased to 20 per cent (previous year: 16 per cent). The main reason for this is the first partial inclusion of the Storage Solutions Group.\n\n#### Revenue in 2023 by region\n\nImage /page/28/Figure/22 description: The image is a pie chart showing the distribution of something across different regions. Western Europe accounts for 43%, Germany accounts for 22%, Other countries account for 20%, and Eastern Europe accounts for 15%.\n\n| in € million    | 2023         | 2022         | Change %    |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Germany         | 1,205        | 1,106        | 9.0         |\n| Western Europe  | 2,395        | 2,113        | 13.3        |\n| Eastern Europe  | 859          | 798          | 7.6         |\n| Other countries | 1,087        | 746          | 45.7        |\n| <b>Total</b>    | <b>5,546</b> | <b>4,763</b> | <b>16.4</b> |\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\nLike the developments in orders on hand, Group revenue also profited from the further normalisation of supply chains. The main driver of Group revenue was new business, with revenue growth of €526 million. In addition to the very positive growth in new trucks, the revenue from Storage Solutions (€219 million) accounted for under new business also contributed to this performance. Revenue in the short-term rental and used equipment business also increased and amounted to €761 million (previous year: €710 million). This was due to demand for trucks for short-term rental and used trucks. After-sales grew noticeably, with revenue amounting to €1,451 million in the reporting period (previous year: €1,310 million). The after-sales services share of Group revenue amounted to 26 per cent (previous year: 28 per cent). At €1,322 million, revenue in the \"Financial Services\" segment was higher than in the previous year (€1,131 million).\n\n#### Breakdown of revenue\n\n| in € million                            | 2023   | 2022   | Change % |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| New business                            | 3,384  | 2,858  | 18.4     |\n| Short-term rental and<br>used equipment | 761    | 710    | 7.2      |\n| After-sales services                    | 1,451  | 1,310  | 10.8     |\n| \"Intralogistics\" segment                | 5,595  | 4,878  | 14.7     |\n| \"Financial Services\" segment            | 1,322  | 1,131  | 16.9     |\n| Reconciliation                          | -1,372 | -1,245 | 10.2     |\n| Jungheinrich Group                      | 5,546  | 4,763  | 16.4     |\n| in € million                            | 2023   | 2022   | Change % |\n| Cost of sales                           | 3,822  | 3,290  | 16.2     |\n| Gross profit                            | 1,724  | 1,473  | 17.0     |\n| Selling expenses                        | 975    | 834    | 16.9     |\n| R&D costs                               | 121    | 113    | 7.1      |\n| General administrative<br>expenses      | 203    | 161    | 26.1     |\n\nTable contains rounding differences.\n\n#### Gross profit benefits from higher revenue\n\nGross profit on sales increased by €251 million to €1,724 million (previous year: €1,473 million). In the reporting period, it benefited from the higher sales, despite increases in the cost of materials, including the first-time, pro rata inclusion of Storage Solutions, and appropriate measures to safeguard margins. The gross margin correspondingly rose from 30.9 per cent in the same period of the previous year to 31.1 per cent.\n\n#### Cost structure (statement of profit or loss)\n\nThe increase in selling expenses was roughly proportional to revenue growth. This was primarily due to the increase in Sales personnel and the associated increase in personnel expenses. Effects from the acquisition of Storage Solutions also had an impact. Selling expenses represented 17.6 per cent of Group revenue (previous year: 17.5 per cent).\n\nR&D costs rose by €8 million to €121 million (previous year: €113 million). This increase reflects the expansion of development activities related to expanding the product portfolio.\n\nAt 3.7 per cent of Group revenue, administrative expenses were slightly higher than the previous year's figure (3.4 per cent). The development in administrative expenses reflects expenses – including expenses for building up human resource capacities – associated with strategic projects on ongoing process optimisation, efficiency optimisation and digitalisation projects which also climbed compared to the previous year, as planned.\n\nOther operating income decreased by €9 million to €8 million (previous year: €17 million). The previous year's high figure contained net income from the transitional consolidation of shares in JT Energy Systems GmbH (€5 million) and proceeds from the sale of real estate (€6 million).\n\nOther operating expenses increased by €10 million to €12 million (previous year: €2 million). This was primarily due to transaction costs (€8 million) in connection with the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group.\n\nImage /page/29/Figure/20 description: The image shows a bar graph titled \"Earnings before interest and income taxes in € million\". The bar graph shows the earnings for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The earnings for 2021 are 360, the earnings for 2022 are 386, and the earnings for 2023 are 430.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-30-0\"></span>EBIT exceeds €400 million for the first time\n\nAt €430 million, EBIT exceeded the previous year's level (€386 million) by €44 million, or 11.4 per cent. The contribution to operating earnings from the Storage Solutions Group included in this figure amounted to €31 million. Taking into account the negative impacts from the costs related to the transaction (€8 million), the purchase price allocation (€13 million) and the variable remuneration components (€15 million), the Storage Solutions Group made a contribution to EBIT of €– 5 million in total. The impact on EBIT from the full acquisition of Magazino totalled €– 7 million. At 7.8 per cent, EBIT ROS was less than the previous year's level (8.1 per cent).\n\nThe financial income totalled €– 31 million (previous year: €– 39 million) and was particularly influenced by the results from the measurement of the securities and derivatives in the special fund. Profit was recorded here in the year under review; however significant losses were recorded in the previous year. In addition, there were positive effects from the currency hedge for the purchase price payments for Storage Solutions. At €399 million, EBT exceeded the previous year's figure (€347 million). EBT ROS amounted to 7.2 per cent (previous year: 7.3 per cent).\n\nImage /page/30/Figure/10 description: This image shows a bar chart titled \"Profit or loss in € million\". The y-axis shows the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The x-axis shows the profit or loss in € million. The bar chart shows that the profit or loss in 2021 was 267, in 2022 was 270, and in 2023 was 299.\n\nIncome tax expenses increased in line with the development in earnings to €100 million (previous year: €78 million). The Group tax rate amounted to 25 per cent following 22 per cent in the previous year. The main reason for the higher tax rate in the reporting year was that, compared to the previous year, a much higher share of profits was generated in Germany. Profit or loss of €299 million (previous year: €270 million) was thus generated. The earnings per preferred share (based on share of earnings attributable to the shareholders of Jungheinrich AG) came to €2.94 (previous year: €2.65).\n\nROCE fell to 15.9 per cent (previous year: 16.3 per cent). This was due to the increase in average capital employed in the reporting year as a result of the goodwill recognised for Storage Solutions and Magazino in the amount of €302 million.\n\n#### Dividend rises to historic high\n\nThe Board of Management and Supervisory Board of Jungheinrich AG will propose a dividend payout of €0.73 (previous year: €0.66) per ordinary share and €0.75 (previous year: €0.68) per preferred share to the Annual General Meeting on 15 May 2024. This dividend proposal will result in a total payout of €75 million (previous year: €68 million). The payment ratio of 25 per cent, as in the previous year, is in the company's target range of paying between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of profit to shareholders. Jungheinrich follows a policy of consistent dividend payments.\n\n#### FINANCIAL AND ASSET POSITION\n\n#### Principles and targets of financial management\n\nThe parent company, Jungheinrich AG, is responsible for the Group's financial management. It ensures that sufficient financial resources are available to cover strategic and operational requirements.\n\nThe Group treasury is primarily responsible for cash and currency management. It aims to provide Group companies with financial resources at the best interest and currency conditions, and to control cash flows. All financing possibilities provided by international money and capital markets are exploited in order to procure the short, medium and long-term financial resources that are required.\n\nEnsuring that the Group has sufficient liquidity reserves is particularly important so that the Group is able, even in economically difficult times, to implement all necessary strategic measures and guarantee financial independence.\n\nThe Group takes a conservative approach to investing in order to ensure sufficient liquidity. The objective is not to maximise profit, but – considering current conditions in the international money and capital markets – to preserve assets.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\nA central working capital management system is in place to strengthen internal financing that ensures the optimisation and standardisation of material processes and systems.\n\nJungheinrich AG's capital requirements are covered through operating cash flows and short and long-term financing. Jungheinrich maintains a solid liquidity reserve. As of 31 December 2023, the medium-term credit agreements in place amounted to €305 million. These were supplemented by short-term bilateral credit lines amounting to €196 million and a commercial paper programme amounting to €300 million. Both the medium-term credit agreements and shortterm credit lines were only used to a small extent. As at the balance sheet date, the commercial paper programme had not been used. In addition, separate guarantee facilities totalling €159 million were available, almost half of which were utilised. There were promissory notes in the total amount of €160 million as at the reporting date.\n\nBridge financing in the amount of €300 million was taken out specifically for the purpose of financing the acquisition of Storage Solutions. A credit agreement for €125 million was also concluded in the reporting year for the medium- and long-term financing of research and development expenditure. As of 31 December 2023, none of these funds had been used.\n\nCredit or promissory note agreements do not contain financial covenants.\n\n#### Net debt reflects acquisition activities\n\nAt €662 million at the end of 2023, cash and cash equivalents and securities were €127 million above the prior-year figure (€535 million). Working capital has remained stable in comparison with the previous year. The reduction in inventories was largely balanced out through the increase in receivables, the decrease in contract liabilities and trade accounts payable. As of 31 December 2023, net debt amounted to €262 million (previous year: €75 million). The marked rise of €187 million is first and foremost due to the purchase price payments for Storage Solutions and Magazino, which had a negative impact of €326 million on free cash flow.\n\nImage /page/31/Figure/13 description: The image shows two bar charts. The first bar chart is titled \"Shareholders' equity in € million\". The values for 2023, 2022, and 2021 are 2,222, 2,051, and 1,803, respectively.

This increase in shareholders' equity was offset by the dividend payment of €68 million (previous year: €68 million). Due to the higher increase in the balance sheet total, the equity ratio declined slightly to 32 per cent (previous year: 33 per cent). Adjusted for all effects from the \"Financial Services\" segment, the shareholder's equity for \"Intralogistics\" amounted to 47 per cent (previous year: 50 per cent).\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\nProvisions for pensions and similar obligations rose to €180 million against the previous year (€159 million). This was primarily driven by the discount rate for the remeasurement of pension provisions in Germany decreasing from 4.2 per cent at the end of 2022 to 3.5 per cent as at the balance sheet date. The Group's non-current and current financial liabilities went up by €315 million to €924 million (previous year: €609 million). This was caused by the bridge financing of €300 million for the acquisition of Storage Solutions, which was recognised in current financial liabilities. At €2,146 million, current and non-current liabilities from financial services were up €154 million against the figure as of 31 December 2022 (€1,992 million), due to the higher level of contracts.\n\nAt €343 million, other current provisions were higher than the figure reported on 31 December 2022 (€292 million). This was primarily due to additions to provisions for personnel in the amount of €57 million. Trade accounts payable remained on a par with the previous year's level at €560 million (€556 million). Other current liabilities declined slightly to €364 million, mainly as a result of a decrease in contract liabilities (previous year: €370 million).\n\nFree cash flow, the key performance indicator used to manage the Group's liquidity and financing, is determined as follows using the cash flow from operating activities and investing activities reported in the statement of cash flows:\n\n#### Reconciliation free cash flow\n\n| in € million                                                                                                                                                     | 2023 | 2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Cash flows from operating activities                                                                                                                             | 472  | -136 |\n| Cash flows from investing activities                                                                                                                             | -430 | 79   |\n| Adjustment for payments for acquisitions<br>and proceeds from the sale of securities<br>as well as payments for time deposits and<br>proceeds from time deposits | -27  | -182 |\n| Cash flows from investing activities<br>(adjusted)                                                                                                               | -457 | -103 |\n| Free cash flow                                                                                                                                                   | 15   | -239 |\n|                                                                                                                                                                  |      |      |\n\n#### Statement of cash flows 1\n\n| in € million                                                                                                                        | 2023 | 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Profit or loss                                                                                                                      | 299  | 270  |\n| Depreciation, amortisation<br>and impairment losses                                                                                 | 447  | 401  |\n| Changes in trucks for short-term rental<br>and trucks for lease (excluding depreciation)<br>and receivables from financial services | -487 | -465 |\n| Changes in liabilities from financing trucks<br>for short-term rental and financial services                                        | 145  | 19   |\n| Changes in working capital                                                                                                          | 1    | -364 |\n| Other changes                                                                                                                       | 68   | 4    |\n| Cash flows from operating activities                                                                                                | 472  | -136 |\n| Cash flows from investing activities<br>(adjusted)                                                                                  | -457 | -103 |\n| Cash flows from financing activities                                                                                                | 117  | 37   |\n| Net cash changes in cash<br>and cash equivalents                                                                                    | 132  | -202 |\n|                                                                                                                                     |      |      |\n\nTables contain rounding differences.\n\n1\n\n Exchange rate effects were eliminated in the cash flow statement. Therefore the changes in balance sheet items shown there cannot be reproduced in the statement of financial position.\n\n#### Cash flow from operating activities reflects relief from stable working capital\n\nCash flow from operating activities amounted to €+472 million for the period of January to December 2023, a significant increase of €608 million compared with the previous year (€– 136 million). The unchanged working capital had a positive impact on cash flow of €365 million in comparison with the previous year. Additions to trucks for short-term rental and trucks for lease along with developments in receivables from financial services in connection with the underlying financing transactions had a positive impact of €104 million.\n\nAt €– 457 million, the negative cash flow from investing activities in the reporting period was significantly higher than in the same period last year (€– 103 million). €326 million from the purchase price payments for Storage Solutions and Magazino is included in cash flow from investing activities in the reporting period. Investments in property, plant and equipment included €16 million for the construction of the new plant in Chomutov, Czechia.\n\nFree cash flow, the sum of cash flow from operating activities and investing activities, improved markedly to €+15 million (previous year: €– 239 million). The positive free cash flow figure takes into account the outflow for the acquisition of Storage Solutions and Magazino (€326 million).\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Financing of acquisitions dominates cash flow from financing activities\n\nCash flow from financing activities of €117 million in the reporting year climbed by €80 million compared to the same period last year (€37 million). The main reason for this was the purchase price financing of €300 million for the acquisition of Storage Solutions.\n\n#### Acquisition leads to increase in non-current and current assets\n\nThe increase in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment by €437 million to €1,355 million resulted primarily from the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group. This transaction resulted in customer relationships, brands, orders on hand and software/technologies totalling €53 million and €274 million for the remaining goodwill being reported under intangible assets as at the balance sheet date. Acquired technologies and the goodwill of Magazino came to a total of €40 million.\n\nThe carrying amounts for trucks for short-term rental and trucks for lease amounted to €1,038 million as at the balance sheet date. The carrying amount for trucks for lease increased slightly to €470 million following €459 million at the end of the 2022 financial year, while trucks for lease from financial services remained virtually unchanged at €568 million in comparison with 31 December 2022 (€567 million). Due to the expansion of business, non-current and current receivables from financial services increased by €189 million to €1,652 million compared with the figure in the previous year (€1,463 million).\n\nThe €67 million decrease in inventories to €927 million (previous year: €994 million) was a result of measures taken to reduce stocks. Cash and cash equivalents and current securities rose by €146 million as at the balance sheet date to €652 million (previous year: €506 million).\n\nImage /page/33/Figure/13 description: The image shows a bar chart titled \"Balance sheet total in € million\".

Of the project budget for the construction of the new plant in Chomutov (Czechia) (approx. €60 million), €16 million was used in the reporting year, while €7 million was included in the capital expenditure figure in the previous year. As at the balance sheet date, purchase commitments for property, plant and equipment alone amounted to €7 million. Capital expenditure was financed with the company's own resources.\n\nImage /page/33/Figure/27 description: The image shows a bar chart of capital expenditure in millions of euros. The capital expenditure for 2023 is 90, for 2022 is 73, and for 2021 is 71.\n\n Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding capitalised development expenditure and right-of-use assets.\n\n#### Distribution of capital expenditure 2023²\n\n1\n\n2\n\nImage /page/33/Figure/22 description: The image is a pie chart showing the breakdown of assets. 4% are intangible assets, 9% are land and buildings, 9% are construction in progress, 17% are technical equipment and machinery, 33% are capitalized development expenditure, and 28% are factory and office equipment.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding right-of-use assets.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-34-0\"></span>FINANCIAL SERVICES\n\n#### Financial services business secures long-term customer loyalty\n\nAll of the company's financial services activities are pooled in the \"Financial Services\" segment. This segment provides individual transfer of use and sales financing to promote the sale of trucks. The financial service agreements offered are always combined with full service or maintenance agreements. This business model's objective is to provide customer service for the entire duration of a truck's use and achieve long-term customer loyalty.\n\nAll risks and opportunities that result from the financial service agreements are assigned to the operating sales units of the \"Intralogistics\" segment, with the exception of customer receivable default risks and refinancing risks.\n\nJungheinrich is represented by its own financial services companies in eight countries: Germany, Italy, France, the UK, Spain, the Netherlands, Austria and Australia.\n\nThe \"Financial Services\" segment's structural and procedural organisation throughout the Group enables a financing structure with powerful domestic and foreign banks. The refinancing company Elbe River Capital S.A., Luxembourg, also enables refinancing to be obtained through the capital market. As in the previous year, the volume placed through this financing platform amounted to €301 million as of 31 December 2023.\n\nIn addition to the SAP standard software used by the financial services business to record and balance lease agreements, there is a software solution that uses a database (Global Lease Center) for smaller sales units.\n\n#### Refinancing with matching terms and interest rates\n\nJungheinrich companies conclude financial service agreements either directly with customers or indirectly via leasing companies or banks (also known as vendor contracts). Agreements concluded directly with customers are reported as operating leases or finance leases pursuant to IFRS accounting regulations. These long-term customer agreements are refinanced with matching terms and interest rates and are reported under liabilities from financial services. Payments from customer agreements cover at least the refinancing payments to credit institutes for the transactions. For vendor agreements, deferred revenue stemming from sales proceeds already generated with an intermediate leasing company are stated under deferred income.\n\n#### Key figures for financial services\n\n| in € million                                | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 | Change % |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|------------|----------|\n| Original value of<br>new contracts1         | 971        | 851        | 14.1     |\n| Original value of contracts<br>on hand      | 4,069      | 3,821      | 6.5      |\n| Trucks for lease from<br>financial services | 708        | 712        | -0.6     |\n| Receivables from<br>financial services      | 1,665      | 1,476      | 12.8     |\n| Shareholders' equity                        | 122        | 120        | 1.7      |\n| Liabilities                                 | 2,589      | 2,418      | 7.1      |\n| Revenue1                                    | 1,322      | 1,131      | 16.9     |\n| EBIT1                                       | 17         | 25         | -32.0    |\n\n<sup>1</sup> 1 January–31 December.\n\n#### Revenue from financial services significantly exceeds €1 billion\n\nNew long-term financial service agreements rose by €120 million in 2023 (previous year: €74 million). The independent financial services companies in the UK, Spain, Austria and the Netherlands are noteworthy with an increase in the value of new agreements of more than 30 per cent. Of the increase in agreements, 62 per cent was attributable to the eight countries with Jungheinrich financial services companies (previous year: 61 per cent).\n\nAt the end of 2023, existing agreements totalled 223 thousand units, 2.8 per cent more than the previous year (217 thousand units). This represents an original value of €4,069 million (previous year: €3,821 million).\n\nRelative to the number of new trucks sold, 42 per cent were sold via financial service agreements (previous year: 40 per cent).\n\nAt €1,322 million, revenue in the \"Financial Services\" segment was higher than in the previous year (€1,131 million).\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-35-0\"></span>EMPLOYEES\n\n#### Number of employees worldwide rises to more than 21,000\n\nThe number of employees around the world rose by 1,310 in the reporting year. Accordingly, on 31 December 2023, the Group had 21,117 (previous year: 19,807) employees (measured in full-time equivalents). The main factors in this increase were the acquisitions of Storage Solutions (186 employees) and Magazino (117 employees), the expansion of the nearshoring organisation (177 employees) and the start of production at the new plant in Czechia (65 employees).\n\nImage /page/35/Figure/27 description: This image shows a bar chart of the number of employees in FTE as of 31/12 for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The chart shows the number of employees in Germany and abroad. In 2021, there were 7,995 employees in Germany and 11,108 employees abroad, for a total of 19,103 employees. In 2022, there were 8,251 employees in Germany and 11,556 employees abroad, for a total of 19,807 employees. In 2023, there were 8,688 employees in Germany and 12,429 employees abroad, for a total of 21,117 employees.\n\nImage /page/35/Figure/11 description: The image shows a pie chart titled \"Employees by region\" as of 31/12/2023. The chart shows the percentage of employees in different regions: Germany (41%), Rest of Europe (23%), Other countries (10%), Italy (6%), France (6%), China (4%), United Kingdom (4%), Poland (3%), and Spain (3%).\n\n| in FTE          | 2023   | 2022   | Change % |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Germany         | 8,688  | 8,251  | 5.3      |\n| France          | 1,259  | 1,242  | 1.4      |\n| Italy           | 1,174  | 1,113  | 5.5      |\n| United Kingdom  | 836    | 781    | 7.0      |\n| Poland          | 649    | 533    | 21.8     |\n| Spain           | 621    | 618    | 0.5      |\n| Rest of Europe  | 4,840  | 4,482  | 8.0      |\n| China           | 840    | 919    | -8.6     |\n| Other countries | 2,210  | 1,868  | 18.3     |\n| Total           | 21,117 | 19,807 | 6.6      |\n\nIn order to be able to react more flexibly to workload fluctuation, temporary workers are employed alongside the permanent workforce in production plants. In light of the slight decrease in the number of units produced in the year under review, the number of temporary workers also decreased on average throughout the year to 491 (previous year: 635). As of 31 December 2023, the Group employed 438 temporary workers (previous year: 681). This corresponds to a ratio of temporary workers to workforce (in this case employees and temporary workers as of 31 December 2023 in full-time equivalents) of 2.0 per cent (previous year: 3.3 per cent).\n\nAfter-sales services accounted for 42 per cent of the workforce or 8,950 employees (previous year: 8,497). Of this figure, 6,255 were after-sales service technicians located around the world (previous year: 6,022).\n\n#### Jungheinrich offers 24 different apprenticeships\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Group had 511 (previous year: 496) trainees and apprentices, of which 329 (previous year: 334) were based in Germany. The Jungheinrich Group offers 24 different apprenticeships in Germany. This includes dual study courses in cooperation with universities. As in the previous year, the number of trainees and apprentices on dual study courses was 15 per cent in 2023 – based on the number of trainees and apprentices in Germany.\n\nImage /page/35/Figure/18 description: The image is a pie chart titled \"Apprenticeable professions\" as of 31/12/2023.

The ordinary Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2023 elected Mr Rolf Najork to the Supervisory Board for a full term. Mr Najork was then elected Chairman of the Supervisory Board by the Supervisory Board and in this function also took up the chairmanship of the Personnel and Mediation Committees.\n\nMr Udo Panenka was also appointed to the Board of Management effective 1 April 2024, and will be responsible for the Automation division.\n\nA termination agreement was concluded with Ms Sabine Neuß, under which she will resign from her office on the Board of Management early by 30 June 2024. Mr Maik Manthey was appointed as her successor for the Technics division effective from 1 July 2024.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\nLegal disclosure\n\n# <span id=\"page-36-0\"></span>Legal disclosure\n\n#### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 289F AND 315D OF THE GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE (HGB)\n\nPursuant to Sections 289f and 315d of the HGB, as a listed stock corporation, Jungheinrich AG is obligated to issue a Corporate Governance Statement for the Group.

The annual report is published on the company's website [www.jungheinrich.com/en/investor-relations/reports-publica](https://www.jungheinrich.com/en/investor-relations/reports-publications-6224)[tions-6224](https://www.jungheinrich.com/en/investor-relations/reports-publications-6224).\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management Re\n\nNon-financial report\n\n# <span id=\"page-37-0\"></span>Internal control and risk management system\n\n#### INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM 1\n\nJungheinrich considers the Internal Control System (ICS) to cover all principles, processes and guidelines introduced to ensure the achievement of business objectives. The objective of the ICS is to ensure the functional capacity, safety and efficiency of material business processes and the reliability of financial reporting and compliance of all activities with laws and guidelines. Jungheinrich has established an ICS in accordance with Section 91 Paragraph 3 AktG. It is based on the Committee of the Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013), which outlines the elements of a control system and sets the standards for evaluating the appropriateness and effectiveness of internal control systems. The ICS considers all material business processes and in addition to accounting also takes into consideration non-financial aspects, especially sustainability reporting. An effective and efficient ICS is crucial for managing risks in business processes.\n\nA comprehensive expansion of the ICS was initiated in the 2023 financial year, including established responsibilities, methods, processes and new ICS software.\n\nOverall responsibility for the ICS lies with the Jungheinrich Board of Management, which is therefore responsible for ensuring an appropriate and effective ICS. The Group Board of Management keeps the Supervisory Board and the Finance and Audit Committee informed on a continuous basis. In line with the Institute of Internal Auditors' three lines model, it is supported in this task in the second defensive line by the ICS organisation, which is responsible for the operational implementation of the ICS, in addition to risk management, and in the third defensive line by the internal audit department, which assesses the ICS in all audited companies for appropriateness and effectiveness within the context of the approved audit plan.\n\nThe Board of Management has established a risk management and internal control organisation to optimise and monitor the ICS process and drive the integration of standardisation of existing control activities in line with the legal and operational requirements. The organisation is a central function responsible for the guidelines, ICS process and methodology. The annual review of the scope of the guidelines ensures that all material elements are monitored by the ICS.\n\nAll Jungheinrich companies are part of the ICS. The extent of the implemented controls and the monitoring of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the controls varies and depends in part on the materiality of the companies and corporate processes for the Group and the specific risks associated with the company. The management of the respective company is obliged to establish an appropriate and effective ICS within its sphere of responsibility. Riskbased scoping (quantitative and qualitative according to the risk categories reporting, strategy & operations and compliance) for the companies and processes covered by the ICS is reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary. In addition to processes relevant to accounting, such as record to report, purchase to pay and order to cash, the processes also include other topics such as sustainability reporting and IT.\n\nThe main business processes are analysed together with the central process owners in order to identify relevant risks for financial and sustainability reporting. The corresponding controls to minimise risks are documented and set out in an overarching risk-control matrix. Moreover, the Jungheinrich Group has guidelines that define responsibilities, workflows and controls for all material processes. All employees can access these guidelines on the intranet. The ICS controls are based on the processes described in the guidelines. ICS guidelines and the manual outline the aims, scope and responsibilities of the ICS as well as the ICS process.\n\n Disclosure unrelated to the management report that is not subject to audit of the financial statements.\n\n1\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\nternal control and\n\n<span id=\"page-38-0\"></span>The legal representatives of the companies and the persons responsible for the organisational areas confirm at year closing whether the control and monitoring activities conducted over the course of the year discovered violations of laws or regulations or irregularities within the framework of the ICS. They also confirm the accuracy and completeness of the ICS documentation for their respective spheres of responsibility.\n\nThe internal audit department also regularly audits the ICS. These audits are either part of the risk-based annual audit plan or triggered as the result of certain events occurring. The Supervisory Board monitors the effectiveness of internal audit, risk management and the ICS.\n\nThe external auditor also audits the effectiveness of the parts of the ICS that are relevant to financial reporting as part of a risk-oriented audit approach. The Jungheinrich Supervisory Board Finance and Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness of the ICS in accordance with Section 107, Paragraph 3 AktG.\n\nTaking into account the external and internal audits of the ICS carried out in 2023, no matters arose that would have led the Jungheinrich AG Board of Management to conclude that the ICS was not appropriate and effective in all material respects in the 2023 financial year.\n\nJungheinrich continuously develops the requirements for the ICS and adapts the control mechanisms to changing processes and requirements on an ongoing basis.\n\n#### INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM FOR THE GROUP ACCOUNTING PROCESS\n\nThe following describes the key features of the internal control and risk management system with respect to the Jungheinrich Group accounting process:\n\n- The Jungheinrich Group has a diverse organisational and corporate structure that ensures appropriate performance checks.\n- The holistic analysis and management of earnings-critical risk factors and risks jeopardising the company's existence are handled by Group-wide governance, budgeting and controlling processes as well as a risk management and risk early detection system, which is described below.\n- The functions of all Group accounting process departments (e.g. Corporate Accounting, Corporate Controlling and Group Treasury) are clearly assigned.\n- IT systems employed in Corporate Accounting are protected from unauthorised access and are largely off-the-shelf software (primarily SAP systems).\n- The Jungheinrich Group has guidelines in place determining accountabilities, workflows and controls for all material processes. All employees can access these guidelines on the intranet.\n- A comprehensive Group accounting manual regulates the Group accounting process of the individual companies and consolidation at Group level, ensuring that business transactions are accounted for, measured and uniformly reported throughout the Group. The manual is updated\n\nregularly and made available to the areas involved in the Group accounting process. Regular sample inspections and plausibility checks are performed both decentrally and centrally to verify the Group accounting data's completeness and correctness. This is done either manually or using software.\n\n- Material processes of relevance to accounting are subject to regular reviews. The establishment of the risk early detection system is examined as part of the statutory annual audit of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements. Findings derived from this audit are taken into account when considering the continual improvement of the Group-wide, Jungheinrichspecific system. The Corporate Compliance, Audit & Data Protection division reviews the effectiveness of the accounting-related internal controls.\n- The Supervisory Board or its Finance and Audit Committee is responsible for, among other issues, dealing with material issues pertaining to Group accounting and risk management, compliance and the audit assignments and focal points of audits conducted by the independent auditors and the Corporate Compliance, Audit & Data Protection division.\n- Another core element of risk governance is the audit of the companies by Internal Audit on the basis of a risk-oriented audit plan.\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-39-0\"></span>RISK AND OPPORTUNITY REPORT\n\nThe early identification of risks and opportunities and the steps to be taken in response are an important element of corporate governance at Jungheinrich. The basic principles and courses of action are defined as part of the risk management system in a Group guideline and a risk management manual, which are continually checked and developed further.\n\n#### Objectives of the risk management system and risk culture\n\nRisks and opportunities are fundamental components of all business activities. In a complex, global market in particular there are a number of external as well as internal influences on Jungheinrich's business activities. The objective of the company's risk management system is to recognise and evaluate the risks as well as the opportunities arising from these influences so that adequate control measures can be initiated. Another aim – in addition to creating transparency on risks and opportunities – is to actively promote a corporate culture with a consistent understanding of risks and opportunities throughout the Group.\n\nRisks and opportunities include all future developments or events that could lead to a negative (risk) or positive (opportunity) deviation from targets. The Jungheinrich risk management system is based on the points of the auditing standard 981 of the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW) and it is integrated into a binding Group-wide guideline that is available to all employees.\n\n#### Risk management system organisation and processes\n\nThe Jungheinrich Board of Management is responsible for the development and maintenance of an effective risk management system. Group Risk Management, a unit assigned to Corporate Controlling, defines and develops the risk management system's methods and processes on an ongoing basis and is also responsible for Group-wide quality assurance, coordination and analyses. All those involved with risk management processes continually receive training in the form of courses, at information events and through communication initiatives about the risk management system requirements, methods and news. The risk management system covers the length of the organisational structure at the Jungheinrich Group including decentral organisational units.\n\n#### Identification\n\nThe managers of the central and decentral organisational units are responsible for identifying, evaluating and managing risks and opportunities. In addition to identifying risks and opportunities at regular management meetings, the risk managers perform a comprehensive inventory of risks and opportunities three times a year during the planning and projection processes. The risks and opportunities identified are assigned to predetermined risk areas that are based on the business environment and Jungheinrich's corporate targets.\n\n#### Evaluation and management\n\nRisks and opportunities are evaluated based on planned business development or the current projection. In addition to the current financial year, the period under consideration for evaluating the risks and opportunities includes the two following financial years. The likelihood of occurrence and the financial impact of the corporate risk on Group EBIT or the profit or loss for risks with a direct impact on the financial result or income taxes is estimated using standardised methods for each of the years considered. The financial impact is considered both before (gross) and after (net) any management measures. Management measures are systematically documented and monitored. Qualitative impacts on reputation, compliance, corporate strategy and operations are also recorded.\n\n#### Analysing risks\n\n1\n\nAll Corporate Controlling organisational units and designated risk managers perform a multi-stage quality assurance process for the risks and opportunities reported in each risk area. This allows the plausibility of the reported risks to be checked and any redundancies or interdependencies to be identified. Finally, the reported risks and opportunities are analysed by corporate risk management for impacts on the Group. Aggregating all substantial risks and opportunities through a stochastic simulation process allows potential impacts on earnings and Group-wide developments, and any interdependencies, to be identified early on. The key figure value at risk (VaR) is determined for the entire risk portfolio with a confidence level of 99 per cent.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Monitoring the Group's risk-bearing capacity\n\nTo evaluate Jungheinrich's ability to bear risks, all risks identified are checked against the risk-bearing capacity, which takes into account both shareholders' equity and cash and cash equivalents. Other early warning indicators serve to continually monitor risk-bearing capacity and early risk detection.\n\n#### Communication\n\nThe findings of risk analyses are reported in the Group Risk Committee, which is attended by the Board of Management. This includes statements on the ability to bear risks, substantial risks and opportunities and potential management measures. Ad-hoc reporting is also used to inform Group risk management and the Board of Management of all probable and highly probable risks and opportunities that would have a moderate impact or higher.\n\n#### Monitoring effectiveness\n\nThe risk and opportunity situation is an integral part of the planning and projections reported to the Supervisory Board by the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board monitors the efficacy of the risk management system and whether risks and opportunities are handled appropriately. The Corporate Compliance, Audit & Data Protection department, as an independent authority, is tasked with checking that the risk management system functions and is effective.\n\n#### Overall assessment of risks and opportunities\n\nThere were no risks identified in the reporting period that could jeopardise the Jungheinrich Group's continued existence.\n\nSupply shortages and delays originating on the procurement side, along with volatility in the cost of materials are less pronounced than in the previous year, but they remain as central risks and can impact production stability through the value chain as well as delivery times to customers. Jungheinrich established a central crisis team and additional local crisis teams in its organisational units and factories in order to identify upcoming risks caused by supply-side shortages at an early stage and keep the impact of these risks as minimal as possible through timely, appropriate and coordinated measures.\n\nDue to Jungheinrich's international operations, cyclical fluctuations involve risks for business development. Economic developments are continually observed and analysed based on regular market analyses for material handling equipment and automation, the competitive environment and capital markets, especially regarding fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates. The objective is to discover information that could be relevant to future order development. Production plans are continually adapted to incoming orders in order to achieve the best-possible production capacity utilisation. Production capacity risks in the plants have increased in comparison with the previous year due to the rise in uncertainty in economic cycles. Jungheinrich counters the risk of a downturn in business by continually enhancing the Group's product portfolio, expanding the scope of services, further intensifying marketing and sales, offering financing solutions and implementing efficiency measures.\n\nCyber attacks also pose risks that are mitigated through security precautions, particularly the continual and targeted expansion of the information technology security management system. The assessment of the potential impacts of cyber attacks has increased in comparison with the previous year due to an increase in overall threats and a more professional assessment methodology for cyber risks including comprehensive quantitative analysis of various risk scenarios.\n\nThe ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and its humanitarian, political and economic consequences have resulted in diverse risks for the Jungheinrich Group that could develop into the full impairment of the Russian company due to expropriation.\n\nThe risk posed by the potential failure of gas or electricity supplies is lower than in the previous year, not least due to the measures taken to find alternative energy supplies.\n\nTaking into account the external and internal audits of the risk management system and the compliance management system carried out in 2023, no matters became known that would have led the Jungheinrich AG Board of Management to conclude that the risk management system or the compliance management system was not appropriate and effective in all material respects in the 2023 financial year. 1\n\n1\n\nDisclosure unrelated to the management report that is not subject to audit of the financial statements.\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Risk and opportunity situation\n\nThe following table gives an overview of the substantial risks and opportunities and their potential impact on the Jungheinrich Group for the next two financial years as well as the change compared to the previous year. The net impacts of risks and opportunities are presented separately and not offset against each other. Risks and opportunities are aggregated in risk areas at Jungheinrich, with risks classified according to their negative impact on the result based on VaR 99 per cent (loss value) and opportunities according to their positive impact on the result based on VaR 20 per cent (gain value). The prior-year comparison presented here refers to a change in the assignment to the impact class as of a minimum change of €2 million.\n\nRisks and opportunities are divided into the following impact classes based on their net impact:\n\n| Very low  | ≤ €0.5 million                 |\n|-----------|--------------------------------|\n| Low       | > €0.5 million to ≤ €2 million |\n| Moderate  | > €2

cent)\n\n1 The prior-year comparison presented here refers to a change in the assignment to the impact class as of a minimum change of €2 million.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe impact of the individual risks or opportunities are assigned to impact classes based on maximum value.\n\nThe description of the probability of occurrence for individual risks and opportunities is based on the following classes:\n\n| Improbable      | ≤ 25 per cent                  |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n| Possible        | > 25 per cent to ≤ 50 per cent |\n| Probable        | > 50 per cent to ≤ 75 per cent |\n| Highly probable | > 75 per cent to 100 per cent  |\n\nThe risk areas are described separately in the following section. The gain value is shown if it has changed compared to the previous year. Material individual risks and opportunities with moderate or higher net impacts from €5 million upwards in each risk area are also described.\n\n#### Operational risks and opportunities\n\n#### After-sales\n\nThe risk area after-sales consists of risks and opportunities that could occur as part of our work with customers during the product life cycle. Jungheinrich continues to class the impact of after-sales risks as moderate overall.\n\nThe fundamental risk of potential supplier failures or delays due to material availability in spare parts operations remains but has reduced in comparison with the previous year. There is also a risk that material costs will rise further and these costs cannot be passed on to the customer. In order to avoid supplier risks in spare parts operations, despite the tense conditions on the market, regular task force meetings monitor the risk. A detailed description of the supplier risks is presented below in the procurement risk area. Materials are also stockpiled to ensure that materials are available despite any volatility.\n\n#### Procurement\n\nRisks and opportunities in the field of procurement include disruptions in the supply chain and fluctuations in the cost of raw materials, equipment and energy. Overall, procurement risks continue to be classified as very high.\n\nGlobal supply chains continually stabilised over the course of the year, nevertheless, general deterioration of the alreadytense market situation and trade restrictions along with potential supply chain disruptions due to production and logistics restrictions can result in materials shortages and a collapse in supply. Moreover, supplier insolvencies, cyber attacks on suppliers and geopolitical developments, especially with regard to China and the recent escalation in the Middle East conflict, represent further risks. The probability of occurrence has fallen in comparison with the previous year, and is considered improbable. In extreme scenarios the impacts remain very high and may lead to production downtimes and significantly higher costs for alternative procurement or necessary services.\n\nTo take preventive action against supply chain disruptions, Jungheinrich relies on control systems as part of its consistent supplier management system to monitor and analyse the financial health of the suppliers, the stability of the supply chains and transport routes. Supply chain management also analyses developments in the supply chains on a daily basis in order to react early to prevent possible materials shortages and developments in materials supply to guarantee the stability of the global supply chains to the greatest possible extent. Supply reach is also continually determined and alternative procurement sources and products are introduced.\n\nDetails with regard to a potential gas shortage or an undersupply of electricity grids are detailed in the extreme events risk area [ [page](#page-45-0) 44 ].\n\nUncertainties also remain with regard to energy price developments and the overall inflation trend. This is particularly evident in relation to the volatility of the gas and energy markets. Significant price increases, including those affecting alternative energy sources, are accepted in order to avoid a supply-side collapse in production. This concerns both the supply of energy to Jungheinrich's own sites and to suppliers' passing on higher energy costs to Jungheinrich. This may result in moderate impacts from both risks and opportunities.\n\nThe price of raw materials on the global market remains volatile, resulting in uncertainties when planning material costs. Procurement uncertainties for production materials and spare parts in the reporting period primarily affect electronic components, lithium-ion batteries and steel.\n\n#### Digital products\n\nJungheinrich develops and distributes digital products, such as the warehouse management system (Jungheinrich WMS), steering software for conveyor systems and other digital solutions for material handling equipment. Jungheinrich operates a cloud-based fleet management system (Jungheinrich FMS) to connect the material handling equipment. Risks and opportunities from the development of software applications for mobile robots are also included and assessed in the digital products risk area. Risks from digital products are again classified as moderate.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\nbined management repo\n\n<span id=\"page-43-0\"></span>A certified Information Security Management System in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001 has been put in place to enable the continuous improvement and maintenance of information security. The certification covers a large part of the development, maintenance and – insofar as it is Jungheinrich's responsibility – the operation of the end-customer software solutions. Further details on this certification are given in the information technology risk area (see below). Jungheinrich received a successful assessment according to the industry standard TISAX (Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange) in November 2022.\n\nJungheinrich is also working continually on the expansion of its digital products. This includes the ongoing expansion of expertise in the field, which is accompanied by the Group's central functions.\n\n#### Research and development\n\nThe research and development risk area covers both risks and opportunities from development projects and results. Overall, risks from research and development continue to be classified as moderate.\n\nOne fundamental risk exists in patent disputes; therefore innovations from research and development are protected by patents. Observance is monitored systematically and centrally and legal steps are taken whenever necessary.\n\n#### Information technology\n\nRisks in the field of information technology cover the general stability of the information infrastructure and include possible risks to information security and in particular the resilience of IT systems to cyber attacks. Overall, information technology risks have increased and are classified as very high.\n\nThe potential impact of the Group-wide risk of cyber attacks can be far-reaching if availability is affected, or confidentiality is breached or the integrity of information and IT systems is threatened due to security violations. Information technology systems are constantly reviewed and refined in order to limit IT risks and ensure that business processes are carried out securely, reliably and efficiently. Besides its effective IT emergency management system, Jungheinrich uses industry standards, redundant network connections and a mirror computing centre with a view to reducing failures of application-critical systems and infrastructure components. Jungheinrich mitigates the risk of unauthorised access to corporate data and of tampering with or sabotaging IT systems with Group-wide information security standards, the use of modern backup systems and regular reviews of the protective measures' effectiveness. Jungheinrich's Information Security Management System (ISMS) has been certified since November 2021 in key parts of the organisation in accordance with the international standard ISO/IEC 27001:2013. The scope was again expanded in November 2022. The above-mentioned measures are supported effectively by modern monitoring and analysis systems and are constantly monitored and developed by a dedicated cyber security team. Furthermore, the state of cyber security for the areas of IT, production and digital products is subject to an annual external maturity assessment. The probability of substantial damage occurring continues to be classed as improbable due to the comprehensive measures to mitigate the risk. The assessment of the potential impacts of cyber attacks has increased in comparison with the previous year. This is due to an increase in overall threats and a more professional assessment methodology for cyber risks including comprehensive quantitative analysis of various risk scenarios. The range of potential impacts is very large, however, ranging from moderate to very high in extreme scenarios.\n\nThe company is implementing more than 80 projects as part of the DEEP programme (Digital End-to-End Processes) for digital transformation and efficiency gains. Detailed control mechanisms are applied throughout the DEEP programme to reduce uncertainties in the planned project costs. These include weekly operational steering meetings, regular steering committee meetings and detailed programme controlling. Fluctuation in the planned project costs are still considered possible and may lead to low opportunities and moderate risks.\n\n#### Production\n\nRisks and opportunities in production relate to deviations in the product manufacturing process, such as a deviation from the capacity utilisation of production machinery or the planned production volume. Overall, the impacts of production risks have increased and are classified as very high. At the same time, the opportunities have increased slightly and classification has moved from low to moderate.\n\nThe stability of production is largely dependent on supply chains. Risks in the supply chains, such as the availability of raw materials, possible cyber attacks or supplier insolvency all constitute risks to the product manufacturing process. Supply chain management therefore analyses developments in supply chains on a daily basis in order to be able to initiate countermeasures early on. This significantly reduces the probability of production downtimes, but as in the previous year remains possible. The potential impacts of production downtime and the resulting number of units produced being below forecasts ranges from very low in the best-case scenario to very high in extreme situations.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\nut Jungheinrich\n\nProduction plans are continually adapted to incoming orders in order to guarantee the best-possible production capacity utilisation. Uncertainties in the incoming orders that can be achieved lead in turn to uncertainties in the unit production numbers. Fluctuation in the number of units produced can have a very high impact when it comes to risks and a moderate impact when it comes to opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, in improbable scenarios, production may be severely affected by interruptions to operations (for example, fires). However, comprehensive preventive safeguarding steps as well as insurance cover in the event of loss mean the impact of this risk is only classified as very low.\n\nRisks of a failure in the power or gas supply also affect the product manufacturing process. These risks are assessed in detail in the extreme events risk area [ [page](#page-45-0) 44 ].\n\n#### Product quality and safety\n\nProduct quality and safety risks cover risks and opportunities from expected deviations in product quality and the associated obligations. Compared to the previous year, the classification of risks has been increased to moderate.\n\nProduct quality obligations are associated with warranties and guarantees as well as additional expenses for goodwill gestures. The obligations also include adhering to applicable standards. In order to manage risks, product risk management observes individual cases closely and uses these to find opportunities to minimise risks, for instance through insurance policies, technical analyses and legal action.\n\n#### Project business\n\nIn relation to the project business, risks and opportunities especially revolve around staying within budget, sticking to schedule and to the agreed product specifications. Overall, project business risks are still classified as moderate.\n\nFor complex, wide-ranging, international projects in particular, there can be some deviation from the project targets or promised product specifications, which in turn can lead to additional expenses for corrections or any compensation payments from breaches of contact. Jungheinrich counters this risk through targeted project risk management, which aims to recognise, manage and systematically monitor project risks at an early stage.\n\n#### Revenue and sales\n\nThe risk area revenue and sales consists of risks and opportunities from the sale and rental of Jungheinrich trucks and associated services. Overall, revenue and sales risks have increased slightly in comparison with the previous year and are classified as very high. Opportunities in the risk area revenue and sales have been downgraded in comparison with the previous year and are classified as low.\n\nThe volatile market situation on both the procurement and sales sides and the general uncertainty about the future economic situation, especially in the eurozone, entail risks in the forecasting of incoming orders. These developments are continually analysed so that appropriate steps can be taken at an early stage. Nevertheless, fluctuations in the forecast number of incoming orders can have a moderate impact on both the risk side and the opportunity side. Additional knock-on effects from changes in incoming orders on production capacity utilisation are assigned to the production risk area [ [page](#page-43-0) 42 ].\n\nThe range of products and services are continually reviewed on the sales market and potential new customer solutions are added. Temporary sales promotion measures have been and are being developed and implemented to protect incoming orders. The result is better market penetration, increased customer loyalty and the incoming orders required for optimum utilisation of the plants. Nevertheless, uncertainty remains as to whether the measures can be implemented on the markets. Risks are deemed possible. The range of potential impacts is very large, however, ranging from very low to very high in extreme scenarios.\n\n#### Customs\n\nThe customs risk area includes risks and opportunities that could arise in relation to customs tariffs for goods. The company has established operational processes for all customs and export control issues. These processes are monitored and continuously developed by a central customs department. Customs risks are closely monitored by Jungheinrich and are still classed as very low.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-45-0\"></span>Sustainability risks and opportunities\n\n#### Extreme events\n\nRisks resulting from extreme events relate to unusual events, such as natural disasters, pandemics or acute geopolitical conflicts, and their consequences. The severity can lead to strategic risks and opportunities that would impact all areas of the company. The risks arising directly from the Russia-Ukraine war have also been included in the extreme events risk area. The risks in the extreme events risk area are still classified as very high overall.\n\nSince the beginning of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, Jungheinrich has created a central crisis team in order to identify risks at an early stage and keep the impact of these risks as minimal as possible through timely, appropriate and coordinated measures. Local and topic-specific crisis teams also analyse various scenarios and underlying legal conditions regularly so that the Group is as well prepared as possible to face the constantly changing situation. The Jungheinrich Group has subsidiaries in Russia and Ukraine.\n\nOne focus of the measures of the crisis team is protecting the staff and their families. The war and its humanitarian, political and economic consequences result in diverse risks for the Jungheinrich Group.\n\nThe embargoes and sanctions imposed by the European Union and the USA and Russia's counter-sanctions have resulted in risks for the Russian Jungheinrich company that are classed as moderate in improbable scenarios. These may develop into risks resulting in full impairment through expropriation. This improbable scenario is assessed as having a very high impact.\n\nIn Ukraine, the risk is primarily a humanitarian one. The focus is on protecting and supporting Jungheinrich employees and their families as well as the local population to the best of the Company's ability.\n\nSanctions and counter-sanctions as well as geopolitical crises such as the current escalation in the Middle East conflict may lead to disruptions in the supply of materials or energy to Jungheinrich or Jungheinrich suppliers. The energy supply situation in Europe has eased in comparison with the previous year. The risk of gas supply no longer being sufficient for production and the associated production disruptions is assessed as improbable and may lead to very high impacts in extreme scenarios. An undersupply of power grids may also cause potential disruptions in production. This risk is classified as improbable, but may lead to high to very high impacts in extreme scenarios. Jungheinrich has put in place measures to reduce plants' dependence on electricity and natural gas and continues to expand these measures. Jungheinrich is also in constant contact with production material suppliers.\n\nRisks from the coronavirus pandemic remain on a lower level. The coronavirus pandemic and potential new pandemics continue to pose a risk with regard to individual markets and in terms of local infection figures, which has an impact on Jungheinrich's business activities and global trade and supply chains.\n\n#### Climate change and environmental protection\n\nJungheinrich supports various climate change mitigation and environmental protection measures and has enshrined key sustainability objectives in Strategy 2025+. Risks and opportunities in the risk area of climate change and environmental protection continue to be classified as very low overall.\n\nJungheinrich's sustainability strategy consists of six initiatives that are backed by concrete targets and give consideration to economic, environmental and social aspects.\n\nThe defined targets set out Jungheinrich's ambition to reduce emissions and preserve the environment and resources. At the same time, the initiatives promote the expansion of sustainable products and solutions and improve the health and safety of employees.\n\nThe implementation and achievement of these targets are crucial for the Jungheinrich Group. Failure will impact Jungheinrich's reputation. In response, targeted measures have been introduced at the level of the initiatives. As the sustainability strategy covers risk areas beyond just climate change and environmental protection, the measures also have an impact on the social and compliance risk areas. Jungheinrich considers itself to be well positioned to continue making important contributions to protecting the environment and the climate.\n\nFurther information can be found in the combined separate non-financial report in accordance with the CSR Directive Implementation Act [ [page](#page-55-0) 54 ].\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Personnel and social\n\nThe personnel and social risk area includes risks and opportunities that have a direct impact on the availability, quality and costs of personnel, occupational safety and compliance with human rights. Overall, personnel and social risks continue to be classified as moderate. Opportunities can arise from fluctuations in the planned personnel costs. Opportunities in the risk area personnel and social have been upgraded in comparison with the previous year and are classified as moderate.\n\nPersonnel risks may arise if a company fails to recruit or retain qualified employees in sufficient numbers. This can impact the achievement of strategic and operational targets. In order to recruit junior engineers and IT specialists, both of which are vital to Jungheinrich, the company maintains good contacts with universities through university marketing. Jungheinrich responds to the fierce competition for skilled labour and executives and mitigates the associated risk of a loss of know-how caused by staff turnover by offering attractive qualification options and a performance-based remuneration system. A high number of trainee positions will be maintained or even expanded Group-wide in order to ensure that all future needs for skilled workers can be met. Jungheinrich employs temporary workers in order to avoid capacity utilisation risks and uses location-specific flexible working time accounts. The company also operates three Business Service Centers (BSC) in Spain, Romania and Croatia with highly trained, globally aligned experts. Uncertainties in personnel costs may result in moderate impacts from both risks and opportunities.\n\nThe continual increase in regulatory requirements with an emphasis on sustainability and human rights, as well as other social aspects along the value chain, poses risks in the event of non-compliance. Continuous monitoring of regulatory changes and compliance with existing requirements is essential for the Jungheinrich Group. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements can result in penalties. Any deviation can have a negative impact on Jungheinrich's reputation and impair its strategic goals or operational processes. In addition to the Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains (LkSG), considerable relevance in this respect has been identified in the Batteries Act 2, Material Compliance, the EU taxonomy and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.\n\nIn order to comply with the LkSG, the Group supply chain risk analysis, put in place in 2019, was revised in 2022 and important risk factors were added, particularly those focused on strengthening the attention paid to human rights. In addition, the schedule of legal provisions database, including the monitoring of the measures and initiatives derived therefrom, was expanded for the LkSG and for all other relevant regulations. Jungheinrich therefore considers itself well positioned to comply with the regulatory requirements for sustainability.\n\n#### Financial risks and opportunities\n\n#### Financial services\n\nRisks associated with financial services arise particularly from the leasing business and include risks and opportunities from changing residual values of leased items and the corresponding interest rate. Financial services risks continue to be deemed to be moderate overall. Detailed rules governing the identification and assessment of risks are documented in Group-wide guidelines and the financial service companies' internal process descriptions.\n\nThe risks and opportunities arising from the resale of truck returns from the financial services business are borne by the operating sales units. The residual value guarantees are calculated on the basis of a conservative uniform Group standard for maximum permissible residual values. The residual values of all individual contracts are subjected to a quarterly evaluation using the central financial services contracts database on the basis of their current fair value. If the originally calculated residual value is above the current fair value and the end of the term of the contract, this risk is appropriately taken into account depending on the classification of the long-term customer contract by reducing the carrying amounts for \"trucks for lease from financial services\" or \"receivables from financial services\" in profit or loss.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe refinancing risk is limited by applying the principle of matching maturities and interest rates for customer and refinancing agreements (no risk of a change in interest rates during the term of the contract) when refinancing financial service agreements. The \"Financial Services\" segment's Group-wide structural and procedural organisation ensures management of completed financial service agreements with a correlating financing structure and form through domestic and foreign refinancing banks. Moreover, an established financing platform enables us to obtain refinancing on the capital market. Sufficient lines of credit are at the company's disposal for financing the new business.\n\nFor refinancing, agreements were reached with the financing banks at an early stage in order to react flexibly to market and customer requirements. As at the balance sheet date, the scope of the required customer-specific payment agreements was negligibly small in light of this. The refinancing lines remained available to Jungheinrich in the reporting year as they were at the end of the previous financial year.\n\nCustomer defaults on receivables, insolvencies and free early terminations of contracts with break clauses in the financial services business remain at a low level.\n\n#### Foreign currency\n\nDue to its international activities and affiliates as well as dynamic developments on the financial markets, Jungheinrich is subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Overall, foreign currency risks continue to be classified as moderate. Jungheinrich uses financial instruments such as currency forwards, currency swaps and currency options to manage foreign currency risks.\n\n#### Debt defaults\n\nThe debt default risk area covers risks arising from potential debt defaults on customer payments. These risks are still classed as low.\n\nJungheinrich protects itself against debt default risks by using an IT-based system to permanently monitor customers' creditworthiness and to regularly analyse outstanding receivables and their structure. The majority of foreign revenue generated from business with third parties is covered by credit insurance policies. Comprehensive system-reported creditworthiness checks performed before contracts are concluded, as well as revolving inspections during the terms of agreements, help keep default levels on receivables from customers very low. Forklift trucks prematurely recovered from customers are handed over to the \"Intralogistics\" segment's operational sales units for marketing. The return conditions are determined centrally.\n\n#### Financing and capital investment\n\nFinancing and capital investment risks include all risks and opportunities that can arise when borrowing or investing capital. Risks in this risk area continue to be classified as moderate overall.\n\nJungheinrich's good credit rating and solid statement of financial position have a positive influence on obtaining credit. In addition to the high levels of cash and cash equivalents, confirmed medium-term credit facilities and shortterm credit lines safeguard the Group's financial flexibility and liquidity. The confirmed credit facilities had only been partially used in the \"Intralogistics\" segment as at the balance sheet date.\n\nIn addition to bilateral financing, Jungheinrich can also obtain finance through the capital market, independent of banks. The instruments employed include a commercial paper programme in addition to issuing promissory notes. The maturities for the credit lines and existing promissory notes are very spread out, giving the company plenty of long-term leeway for arranging financing. None of the financial agreements are subject to financial covenants.\n\nThe company's cash and cash equivalents and existing credit agreements ensure that it can always fulfil its payment obligations. There is, therefore, no liquidity risk. The central cash and currency management for the Jungheinrich Group enables the Group-wide, international provision of financial resources at the best possible interest and currency exchange rates, and cash flow management for domestic and foreign Group companies.\n\nThroughout the Group, Jungheinrich takes a conservative approach to investment and generally only invests in certain asset classes with flawless credit ratings and the option of liquidating its investments at any time. Part of the liquidity is invested in a special fund. The value of the capital investments held by Jungheinrich is subject to the normal fluctuations on the international capital markets. The severity of the fluctuation can have a moderate impact on the opportunities side and high on the risk side, depending on the point in time of the sale.\n\nFurther information regarding financial instruments can be found in the Jungheinrich AG consolidated financial statements [ [page](#page-155-0) 154 ].\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nImpairment risks are constantly monitored by Corporate Finance. This applies in particular to goodwill from company acquisitions, which has an indefinite useful life and is therefore not subject to amortisation. Goodwill is subjected to an impairment test in accordance with IAS 36 at least once a year, or more frequently if there are indications of a reduction in value. In addition, all assets that fall within the scope of IAS 36 are reviewed as part of an asset impairment test if there are such indications of a reduction in value.\n\n#### Taxes\n\nTax risks continue to be considered to be low overall. They arise from the constantly changing requirements under tax legislation. Risks also arise when national tax authorities deviate from the international basic rules agreed between tax authorities with regards to cross-border matters. The risk increases when updated authority viewpoints are to be applied retroactively.\n\n#### Legal and compliance risks and opportunities\n\n#### Compliance and data protection\n\nThe compliance and data protection risk area covers all risks related to non-compliance with laws and general compliance regulations, especially corruption, fraud and money laundering prevention and data protection regulations. Risks in the compliance and data protection area are still assessed as high overall.\n\nIn both the valid Group guidelines, which apply to all employees, and the company's Code of Conduct, Jungheinrich has set out regulations and measures for the prevention of corruption, fraud and money laundering risks. Compliance with these requirements is regularly reviewed by internal audit. Further information about the Code of Conduct can be found in the combined separate non-financial report in accordance with the CSR Directive Implementation Act [ [page](#page-55-0) 54 ].\n\nJungheinrich is subject to the risk of fines in the area of data protection due to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These are addressed through a number of measures. Group guidelines are continually updated to reflect new data protection regulations. The necessary data protection agreement principles with suppliers and other business partners were also amended. Jungheinrich also ensured compliance with the requirements by implementing stricter technical and organisational measures. The data protection challenges in the context of the coronavirus pandemic, in particular due to the increase in mobile working, have been taken into account through corresponding instructions and recommendations. The Board of Management obligates all employees to comply with data protection regulations. Regular Group-wide training is in place. The data protection management system is continually monitored and will be improved further. Risks of fines due to a violation of the EU GDPR are assessed as improbable. The range of potential impacts is very large, however, ranging from very low to very high in the extreme scenario.\n\nThe compliance risk assessment was analysed in 2022 and optimisations were initiated in 2023 with an emphasis on close interaction between the risk management system and compliance risk assessment. The organisation and processes of the risk management system and close dovetailing between compliance risk assessment and the risk management system facilitates a clear reconciliation between the two systems. Further information about the compliance management system can be found in the combined separate non-financial report in accordance with the CSR Directive Implementation Act [ [page](#page-55-0) 54 ].\n\n#### Legal\n\nThe Jungheinrich Group's companies are exposed to the legal risks that are customary in commercial enterprises, in particular regarding the liability for alleged non-compliance with contractual obligations or public law and for allegedly faulty products. Risks in the legal risk area have increased slightly against the previous year and are classed as low.\n\nMaterial general contract risks are eliminated by applying Group-wide policies whenever possible. In addition, central support and legal advice is available to the individual departments for material contracts and other transactions with significant legal aspects. Appropriate provisions that are in line with the respective probability of occurrence are established to cover potential financial burdens resulting from risks relating to lawsuits. The Group has adequate insurance coverage for claims filed against Group companies on grounds of allegedly faulty products.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-49-0\"></span>Forecast report\n\n#### Anticipated global economic growth hampered by geopolitical tensions\n\nThe IMF anticipates that global economic growth will amount to 3.1 per cent as in the previous year in 2024. The main reasons stated for this forecast are the central banks' restrictive monetary policies and withdrawal of fiscal support. Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East in particular pose a risk for further growth in the opinion of the IMF. Slightly slower growth than in the previous year is expected for China and the USA. USA GDP is expected to climb by 2.1 per cent (2023: 2.5 per cent). An increase in economic output of 4.6 per cent (2023: 5.2 per cent) is forecast for the Chinese economy.\n\nThe IMF believes economic growth in the eurozone in 2024 will be determined by rising private consumption and catch-up effects as a result of the rise of energy prices and the slowdown in inflation. A recovery in GDP growth of 0.9 per cent is forecast for this region (2023: 0.5 per cent).\n\nThe IMF forecasts a slight rise in economic growth in Germany (0.5 per cent), following the 0.3 per cent contraction in the previous year. After growth of 0.8 per cent in the previous year, French GDP is also expected to perform slightly better in 2023 with 1.0 per cent growth. As in the previous year, for Italy an economic growth of 0.7 per cent is anticipated. For the UK, too, the economic growth of 0.6 per cent is expected to be along the lines of that seen in the previous year (0.5 per cent).\n\n#### Growth rates for selected economic regions\n\n| Gross domestic product in % | 2024 forecast |\n|-----------------------------|---------------|\n| World                       | 3.3           |\n| USA                         | 2.1           |\n| China                       | 4.6           |\n| Eurozone                    | 0.9           |\n| Germany                     | 0.5           |\n\nSource: International Monetary Fund (as of 30 January 2024).\n\n#### 2024 incoming orders target: €5.2 billion to €5.8 billion\n\nDespite a difficult market environment, we expect incoming orders to range between €5.2 billion and €5.8 billion in 2024 (2023: €5.2 billion). Providing supply chains remain stable and in light of the current interest rates and inflation, we anticipate Group revenue to range between €5.3 billion and €5.9 billion (2023: €5.5 million). This is based on the assumption that the geopolitical situation will not deteriorate.\n\n#### 2024 EBIT range: €420 million to €470 million\n\nWe estimate EBIT to be between €420 million and €470 million in the current financial year (2023: €430 million). Already in 2023, the Board of Management initiated measures to increase earnings that are bearing fruit in the current year and are countering especially rising personnel costs. Negative effects from purchase price allocations for the acquisitions made in 2023 of €13 million and from variable remuneration of €11 million have also been taken into account. We anticipate an EBIT ROS of between 7.6 per cent and 8.4 per cent (2023: 7.8 per cent).\n\nBased on current assumptions, EBT is expected to reach a value between €380 million and €430 million (2023: €399 million). We forecast EBT ROS to be between 6.9 per cent and 7.7 per cent (2023: 7.2 per cent). The ROCE for the 2024 financial year should be between 14.5 per cent and 17.5 per cent (2023: 15.9 per cent). We have set a figure of over €200 million (2023: €15 million) for free cash flow.\n\nDue to competition law, actual and target figures on the equipment ratio of lithium-ion batteries are not reported.\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\nForecast report\n\n#### General statement concerning the Jungheinrich Group's anticipated development\n\nWe assume that the geopolitical situation will not deteriorate further in the 2024 financial year and that economic conditions will improve in the second half of 2024 at the earliest.\n\nOur main goal is to achieve a solid EBIT ROS and EBT ROS. Beyond this, our focus is also on boosting ROCE and free cash flow.\n\nWe will continue to focus on our strategic fields of action automation, digitalisation, energy systems, efficiency, global footprint and sustainability. A key focus here will be on establishing the Board of Management division for automation and the expansion of the Group's automation portfolio. The post-merger integration of Storage Solutions and Magazino is also being driven forward. M&A activities will be continued to expand the Group's global footprint and digital transformation.\n\nOpportunities continue to be presented by the intact and growing global trends that will push intralogistics, digital products and services, e-commerce-oriented portfolios and electric mobility and automation offers.\n\nNegative impacts on revenue, EBIT and EBT are a possibility in an unchanged difficult market environment, particularly in the Group's European core markets, and as a result of high exchange rate fluctuations or persistently strong interest rate hikes.\n\nOur business model and our resilient customer structure, combined with a sound balance sheet and liquidity, enables us to continue implementing the Strategy 2025+ even in the event that economic and market developments fall short of expectations.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\ncombined management\n\n# <span id=\"page-51-0\"></span>Jungheinrich AG (HGB)\n\nThe annual financial statements of Jungheinrich AG follow the provisions of the German Commercial Code (HGB), while the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\n\nJungheinrich AG is a management holding company and, in addition to the Group's central functions, also comprises Corporate Research & Development and Corporate Real Estate Management. As the parent company, it holds shares directly and indirectly in both domestic and foreign subsidiaries. Jungheinrich AG especially has direct business relations with the subsidiaries in Germany. The positive annual results of the subsidiaries managed in the legal form of AG & Co. KG are recognised in the same phase in the annual financial statements of Jungheinrich AG and reported under income from affiliates. In addition, there are some profit and loss transfer agreements with domestic corporations whose income and expenses are reported under separate items in the statement of profit or loss. The income from associates consisting of these three components are the material control parameter for Jungheinrich AG.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, Jungheinrich AG had a total of 1,443 employees, including 153 trainees and apprentices (previous year: 1,320 employees, including 151 trainees and apprentices).\n\nThe overall economic and industry-related conditions correspond to those of the Group as described in the economic report [ [page](#page-27-0) 26 ].\n\n#### BUSINESS TREND AND EARNINGS POSITION\n\nThe earnings position of Jungheinrich AG is determined by the business trend of the operating subsidiaries in Germany and abroad as well as the resulting income from affiliates. Jungheinrich AG's income from affiliates exceeded expectations in 2023, amounting to €362 million following €207 million in the previous year. The reason for this was the improvement in operating subsidiaries' business developments, primarily through appropriate measures to safeguard margins, which more than compensated for the increase in costs due to personnel expansion, tariff effects and increases in the cost of materials. Earnings from profit and loss transfer agreements increased by €120 million, taking the figure to €216 million. There was an appreciation in value in the carrying amount of an investment under financial assets in the amount of €37 million in connection with the acquisition of the Storage Solutions Group. The recognition of profits of subsidiaries in the same period resulted in an increase of €35 million to €146 million.\n\nJungheinrich AG's revenue in the 2023 financial year amounted to €261 million, compared to €259 million in the previous year. It includes remuneration for services, revenue from the rental of real estate and revenue from licensing agreements. Revenue from remuneration for services increased due to expansion in business volumes in the domestic operating companies in comparison with the previous year from €156 million to €160 million. Revenue from the rental of real estate to domestic Group companies of €39 million was similar to the previous year (€38 million). Revenue from licence agreements was 4 per cent lower at €63 million compared to the previous year's figure of €65 million.\n\nOther operating income increased significantly from €94 million in the previous year to €164 million in the reporting year. This resulted from compensation payments received on the basis of transfer pricing adjustments of foreign companies of €51 million (previous year: €36 million). Due to the positive performance of the German production plants, income from adjustments amounted to €86 million (previous year: €42 million). Furthermore, other operating income includes cost transfers to affiliated companies of €16 million (previous year: €12 million).\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\nJungheinrich AG's expenses developed as follows:\n\n| in € million                                                            | 2023 | 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Cost of materials                                                       | 4    | 4    |\n| Personnel expenses                                                      | 154  | 132  |\n| Depreciation and amortisation<br>of fixed assets                        | 26   | 25   |\n| Other operating expenses                                                | 389  | 317  |\n| Depreciation on financial assets and<br>securities under current assets | 4    | 4    |\n\nThe cost of materials mainly includes the energy costs for properties. Personnel expenses and other operating expenses include the administrative costs of the holding company and the central divisions. The increase in personnel expenses by €22 million resulted in part from the higher average number of employees (measured in number of employees, excluding trainees and apprentices) of 1,127 in 2022 by 92 to 1,219 employees in the 2023 financial year, the tariff increase, higher bonuses and the increase in pension liabilities.\n\nOther operating expenses increased by €72 million from €317 million in the previous year to €389 million. The main reason for the increase was a €45 million rise in charges for external services, of which €22 million relates to IT services. R&D expenditure also rose by €19 million to €137 million (previous year: €118 million). This was mainly caused by the use of services provided by affiliated companies with higher development volumes.\n\nThe earnings trend of Jungheinrich AG in the reporting period was thus as follows:\n\n| in € million                       | 2023 | 2022 |\n|------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Earnings before interest and taxes | 213  | 78   |\n| Net interest                       | 13   | -3   |\n| Earnings before taxes              | 227  | 75   |\n| Taxes on income and other taxes    | -22  | -35  |\n| Net income                         | 249  | 110  |\n\nTable contains rounding differences.\n\nEarnings before taxes increased by €152 million to €227 million. The effective tax expense rose accordingly. This was more than compensated for by the tax allocations made by the subsidiaries to Jungheinrich AG. This resulted in overall tax income of €22 million (previous year: €35 million).\n\nStable net income for the year was forecast for the reporting year compared to the 2022 financial year. Jungheinrich AG closed the 2023 financial year with a higher net profit of €249 million compared to the previous year (€110 million). This was due to the better than expected operating results of the subsidiaries. In accordance with Section 58, Paragraph 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), €124 million of the net profit for the year was transferred to other retained earnings.\n\n#### Capital expenditure\n\nAdditions to fixed assets amounted to €63 million in the reporting period and were thus significantly above the previous year's figure of €24 million. This was the result of acquiring the remaining shares in Magazino and the subsequent transfer of product technology totalling €44 million. As at the balance sheet date, Jungheinrich AG's capital expenditure commitments amounted to €2 million. Capital expenditure was financed with the company's own resources.\n\nJungheinrich acquired all remaining shares in the robotics specialist Magazino in August 2023. This caused the carrying amount of the portfolio company to go up by €19 million to €28 million.\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Financial and asset position\n\nAs the parent company of the Group, Jungheinrich AG is responsible for the financial management of the Group and ensures the availability of sufficient financial resources. Further disclosures are included in the description of the principles and objectives of financial management [ [page](#page-30-0) 29 ].\n\nThe asset structure of Jungheinrich AG is as follows:\n\n| in € million                          | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2022   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Non-current assets                    | 787          | 758          |\n| Receivables from affiliated companies | 1,019        | 705          |\n| Bank balances and securities          | 465          | 337          |\n| Other assets                          | 51           | 51           |\n| <b>Balance sheet total</b>            | <b>2,322</b> | <b>1,851</b> |\n| in € million                          | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2022   |\n| Shareholders' equity                  | 1,366        | 1,186        |\n| Provisions for pensions               | 38           | 37           |\n| Other provisions                      | 58           | 47           |\n| Liabilities due to banks              | 551          | 320          |\n| Liabilities to affiliated companies   | 277          | 227          |\n| Other liabilities                     | 32           | 34           |\n| Balance sheet total                   | 2,322        | 1,851        |\n\nThe increase of €314 million in receivables from affiliated companies resulted from the higher claims of Jungheinrich AG compared to the previous year from the provision of cash and cash equivalents to Group companies as part of central liquidity management and from adjustments.\n\nThe increase in bank balances and securities of €128 million to €465 million in the 2023 financial year arose from an increase in time deposits of €158 million, which was partially offset by a reduction in securities of €23 million to €184 million and a €7 million decline in sight deposits to a total of €43 million.\n\nThe capital structure of Jungheinrich AG is as follows:\n\nThe shareholders' equity of Jungheinrich AG amounted to €1,366 million as at the balance sheet date and was thus €180 million higher than in the previous year (€1,186 million). The net income for the year of €249 million was offset by the dividend payments of €68 million for the previous financial year. As a result of the marked increase in total assets, the equity ratio fell to 59 per cent (previous year: 64 per cent).\n\nOther provisions in the reporting year included the present value of a contingent purchase price payment in the amount of €11 million (previous year: €19 million) from the agreed earn-out clauses as part of the acquisition of arculus. This decline was caused by the early exit of a beneficiary.\n\nLiabilities due to banks increased by €231 million year-onyear. This was primarily due to the bridge financing in the amount of €300 million that was taken out specifically for the purpose of financing the acquisition of Storage Solutions. On the other hand, current loans totalling €65 million were repaid through money market loans and commercial papers.\n\nAt €277 million, liabilities to affiliated companies were €50 million higher than in the previous year (€227 million) and were related to the increased liquidity of subsidiaries of Jungheinrich AG.\n\n#### Risks and opportunities\n\nJungheinrich AG shares in the risks and opportunities of its subsidiaries. Detailed information is provided in the Risk and opportunity report [ [page](#page-39-0) 38 ].\n\n#### Forecast report\n\nWe report on our prospects and plans for operations in our Forecast report [ [page](#page-49-0) 48 ].\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\nup-regulating A.C. (UCP).\n\nShould revenue develop as expected, the operating results of the subsidiaries of Jungheinrich AG will be on a par with the previous year in 2024. As a result, the total income from affiliates and Jungheinrich AG's net income for the year should also be on a par with the previous year in 2024.\n\nThe explanations above are partially forward-looking statements that are based on the company management's current expectations, assumptions and assessments for future developments. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainty that are largely beyond the company's control. This includes changes in the overall economic situation, such as impacts from geopolitical conflicts, natural catastrophes, pandemics and similar force majeure events, debt issues, within the intralogistics sector, in materials supply, the availability and price development of energy and raw materials, demand in important markets, developments in competition and regulatory frameworks and regulations, exchange and interest rates and the outcome of pending or future legal proceedings. Should these or other uncertainties or unknown factors apply or the assumptions on which these statements are based prove false, actual results may deviate significantly from the results stated or implied.

Pursuant to Sections 289b, Paragraph 3 and 315b, Paragraph 3 of the German Commercial Code (HGB), this is the combined separate non-financial report for the Jungheinrich Group and Jungheinrich AG. Jungheinrich AG does not have any separate concepts and is managed by the Group. Jungheinrich uses the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) management approaches as its framework in line with Section 289d of the German Commercial Code (HGB).\n\nIn publishing this report, Jungheinrich is also meeting the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable capital expenditure, and regarding the amendment of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereafter EU Taxonomy Regulation) [ [page 79](#page-80-0) ].\n\nAll fully consolidated companies of the Jungheinrich Group according to the consolidated financial statements (as of 31 December 2023) are included. Deviations are indicated in the document. The companies Storage Solutions and Magazino, acquired in the reporting year, have not yet been fully integrated into the management approaches.\n\nThe report is published annually and is based on the 2022 non-financial report, which was published as part of the annual report on 31 March 2023. This combined separate non-financial report was subject to a limited audit in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised) by independent auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers, Cologne, (PwC), and was issued with an unqualified assurance opinion [ [page 96](#page-97-0) ].\n\n#### SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY\n\nSustainability is part Jungheinrich's identity. As a familyowned listed business, uniting economic, environmental and social responsibility is the focus of all business activities. One focus of the sustainability strategy is on creating sustainable value for all stakeholders – that is for customers, employees, shareholders, business partners and also for society as a whole. Another focal point for Jungheinrich is minimising the negative impacts its activities have on people and the environment while building on the positive contributions it makes. Jungheinrich contributes towards the sustainable transformation of intralogistics with its products and services and thus sees itself as a sustainability enabler. This is why sustainability is one of the six fields of action and an integral part of the corporate Strategy 2025+.\n\n#### Integrated business model and customer structure\n\nWith a comprehensive portfolio of material handling equipment, automated systems and services, Jungheinrich is able to offer customers solutions to the challenges posed by Industry 4.0. The integrated business model encompasses the development, production and sale of material handling equipment and the planning and realisation of automated systems, the short-term rental of new and used material handling equipment, the refurbishment and sale of used forklifts, and after-sales services. Jungheinrich's product range also includes stacker cranes and load handling equipment.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\nCustomers can therefore receive their entire factory and office equipment from a single source. Since 13 March 2023, all of our trucks manufactured have been battery-powered. In addition to electric motors and drive controls, Jungheinrich also manufactures suitable lithium-ion batteries and battery chargers. Digital products, such as the Jungheinrich warehouse management system and the fleet management system, which is based on the latest generation of the Jungheinrich Internet of Things platform in the cloud, complement the portfolio. A comprehensive range of financial services is also available to customers. Jungheinrich is active in around 120 countries both with its own direct sales and service networks, and through partner companies.\n\n#### Customers by sector 2023¹\n\n1\n\nImage /page/57/Figure/9 description: This image is a pie chart showing the distribution of different sectors. 42% is Retail and wholesale (including foodstuffs), 18% is Other sectors, 15% is Logistics, 12% is Machine/vehicle construction and electrical engineering, 9% is Food industry (production), and 4% is Chemical industry.\n\n#### Sustainable development highlights in 2023\n\nAs part of its corporate Strategy 2025+, Jungheinrich set measurable sustainability targets covering greenhouse gas emissions<sup>2</sup>, waste management and occupational health and safety. This supports the company's long-term goal of becoming a sustainability enabler. The following are some of the measures put in place in 2023 as part of the sustainability strategy:\n\n- Manufacture of battery-powered trucks only.\n- Expansion of the CO2e-neutral3 after-sales service4 to five countries.\n- Reorientation of the sustainability organisation toward the ESG5 structure in order to push through a more efficient implementation of the sustainability strategy.\n- Introduction of a global, internal communication platform for sustainability that enables employees to get involved with the sustainable transformation.\n- Use of electricity from renewable sources in 28 countries.\n- Introduction of Jellow Way, the mission statement outlining behaviours that support Jungheinrich's ongoing success.\n- Formalisation of the Group-wide human rights management system and publication of Jungheinrich's first policy statement on respecting human rights.\n- Expansion of the sustainable procurement management system to include preventative and remedial action, and integration of the subsidiaries MIAS and Profishop.\n- Performance of an external quality control audit by an external auditor on the compliance management system, and implementation of certain measures in 2022 and 2023.\n- Expansion of commitment to sustainability initiatives such as the United Nations (UN) Global Compact and the sustainability network ecosense – Forum Nachhaltige Entwicklung der Deutschen Wirtschaft e.V.\n\n- 2 There are a number of greenhouse gases that have various impacts on the climate; these include CO2 , CH4, N2 O, FKW, PFC, SF6 and NF3 . In order for these gases to be compared, they are indexed as CO2 equivalents (CO2 e).\n- 3 For reasons of clarity, Jungheinrich uses the adjective CO2 e-neutral in certain contexts interchangeably with net zero greenhouse gas emissions. This formulation is used in connection with specific products and projects in order to point out that they exhibit net zero emissions.\n- 4 Jungheinrich will achieve neutrality by reducing emissions in after-sales service processes and through capital expenditure in certified compensation projects to offset CO2 e emissions.

Based on communication with stakeholders and internal analysis, Jungheinrich has selected strategically relevant ESG ratings in order to develop the externally evaluated sustainability performance. Their relevance to active processing is regularly examined. The relevant ratings in Jungheinrich's view are EcoVadis, CDP, ISS ESG and MSCI ESG.\n\n#### Platinum EcoVadis rating\n\nEcoVadis, the world's biggest provider of sustainability ratings with more than 100,000 companies analysed, awarded Jungheinrich with a platinum rating (top 1 per cent) for the third consecutive time, making it one of the world's leading companies in the fields of environment, ethics, labour and human rights as well as sustainable procurement.\n\n#### CDP rating B\n\nCDP is a global non-governmental organisation that rates companies with regard to their environmental management in the categories of climate, forests and water security. Jungheinrich again received a rating of B (in a scale from A to F) for its transparency and commitment to climate protection.\n\n#### ISS ESG rating B-\n\nISS ESG Corporate Rating offers comprehensive ESG data and ratings. Jungheinrich again received the industry status Prime and improved its rating to B- (12-step scale from A+ to D-). This places Jungheinrich among the leading companies in its industry.\n\n#### MSCI ESG rating A\n\nMSCI ESG ratings measure a company's resilience with regard to long-term ESG risks. Jungheinrich again achieved an above-average rating of A (seven-step industry-specific scale from AAA to CCC).\n\n#### INITIATIVES AND MEMBERSHIPS IN 2023\n\nJungheinrich is active in various sustainability initiatives and networks with the aim of achieving international sustainability goals and cooperating across industries on relevant sustainability topics:\n\n- Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)\n- The Climate Pledge\n- UN Global Compact\n- Sustainability & Climate Leaders\n- econsense Forum Nachhaltige Entwicklung der Deutschen Wirtschaft e. V.\n- Bundesdeutscher Arbeitskreis für Umweltbewusstes Management (B.A.U.M.) e.V.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-59-0\"></span>Stakeholder dialogue\n\n#### Internal and external stakeholders of relevance for Jungheinrich\n\nAs part of the sustainability strategy development process at Jungheinrich, the material internal and external stakeholders were identified and prioritised by a team of experts from the Corporate Sustainability, Health & Safety, Marketing and Corporate Communications divisions. Stakeholders are weighted according to their importance for Jungheinrich, including direct contact with products, impacts on Jungheinrich plants and other connections to the company. The following stakeholder groups for Jungheinrich were identified in the analysis:\n\n- Employees\n- Management and executives\n- Customers\n- Job applicants\n- Suppliers\n- Investors and analysts\n\nThe dialogue with stakeholders takes a variety of different forms, such as direct conversations, exchanges over online platforms, and surveys.\n\n#### Engagement on sustainability through the new communication platform\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, Jungheinrich introduced a global communication platform on sustainability in order to actively include its workforce of more than 21,000 employees in the company's sustainability transformation. The platform promotes global networking among employees, self-sufficiency in terms of sustainability in a corporate context, and enables knowledge transfer. Best practice examples, guidelines and practical tips help with the implementation of the sustainability strategy. Thanks to interactive formats, the platform makes it possible to exchange information and get actively involved. By contributing their own ideas and through the intrinsically motivated implementation of measures, the resulting community represents a transformation from within.\n\n#### Six sustainability strategy initiatives\n\nThe aim of the corporate Strategy 2025+ is to create sustainable value. It contains six fields of action 1 . One field of action is sustainability, which has a decisive impact on corporate targets. The sustainability strategy in turn is divided into six strategic initiatives that apply to all of the company's divisions:\n\nThe sustainability strategy was based on the results derived from dialogue with relevant internal and external stakeholders, the analysis of existing business processes and management systems, and the existing materiality analysis. The materiality analysis identified topics that are highly relevant for Jungheinrich with regards to sustainability. These topics were evaluated by important stakeholders and internal experts and approved by the Board of Management. Of the 33 topics originally identified, 17 were classed as particularly relevant. The materiality analysis was examined in 2023 and it was confirmed that it is up to date. During preparation of the combined separate non-financial report in accordance with CSR-RUG, the material topics of the analysis were checked and prioritised with regard to both their relevance to the business and their degree of impact, in line with the principle of double materiality pursuant to Section 289c, Paragraph 3 of the German Commercial Code.\n\nThe following table shows the sustainability strategy's six initiatives, assigns them to material topics and shows the aims of the initiatives.\n\nImage /page/59/Figure/23 description: The image shows a list of six items. The first item is \"Climate neutrality²\", the second item is \"Eco efficiency and circular economy\", the third item is \"Employees and societies\", the fourth item is \"Governance\", the fifth item is \"Sustainable business models, products and services\", and the sixth item is \"Sustainability in the brand\".\n\n- 1 The fields of action are: automation, digitalisation, energy systems, efficiency, global footprint and sustainability. Further information on the corporate Strategy 2025+ can be found in the combined management report [ [page 23](#page-24-0) ].\n- 2 The term climate neutrality describes a state in which human activities have no net impact on the climate system. In addition to greenhouse gas emissions, such man-made impacts also include biogeophysical aspects, for example the contamination of soil and water, the consumption of raw materials or the loss of biodiversity. Jungheinrich pursues climate neutrality as its vision. The focus here is currently on achieving the target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions along the entire value chain.\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span

operations pursuant to Section 289c, Paragraph 3, Items 3 and 4 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) are reviewed and evaluated as part of the regular risk management. The detailed risk and opportunity report [ [page](#page-39-0) 38 ] can be found in the combined management report. Pursuant to Section 289c, Paragraph 3, Items 3 and 4 of the German Commercial Code, no material risks with highly likely serious negative impacts in the aspects outlined in CSR-RUG were identified for business operations, business relationships, products or services. No reportable correlations with the figures in the consolidated financial statements were discovered.\n\n#### Contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)\n\nThe SDG are a framework for social development from the UN that applies globally. As such, they enable companies to show how they contribute to sustainable development within their core business. Jungheinrich is committed to contributing to the achievement of the 17 SDG. With the focal points of its sustainability strategy, and as a sustainability enabler in intralogistics, Jungheinrich believes it can have a particular impact on the following SDG:\n\n| SDG                                                     | Definition                                                                                                 | Areas where Jungheinrich can make an impact                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Image: Good health and well-being SDG logo              | Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.                                           | Solutions and assistance systems to contain potential hazards and prevent accidents in warehouses (360-degree protection).

In order to keep making improvements in this regard, the company adopted a new sustainability organisation in the 2023 financial year, which came into force on 1 January 2024.\n\n#### Sustainability Team\n\nThe Sustainability Team coordinates the integration of the sustainability strategy in the company and reports directly to the Board of Management. In the reporting year, it was divided into the Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) and Sustainability Management & Performance departments. Since 2024, the Sustainability Team is composed of EHS and three new departments: Environmental Sustainability, Social Sustainability and Sustainability Governance. The EHS Coordinators will be responsible for EHS-related topics in the companies and will serve as multipliers for further sustainability topics. The EHS-related topics will be pooled in the local EHS teams and established in the Group organigram by 2025. The plan is to further standardise the global structural and procedural organisation and areas of responsibility.\n\nThese new departments will strengthen sustainability at Jungheinrich. The aim of this new organisation is a more focussed implementation of the sustainability strategy, which is based on the ESG structure.\n\n#### Sustainability organisation at Jungheinrich\n\nImage /page/62/Figure/15 description: The image shows an organizational chart for sustainability within a company. At the top is the \"Board of Management.\" Below and to the left is the \"Sustainability Team (coordination and consultation)\" which includes \"Corporate Sustainability, Health & Safety (Vice President Corporate Sustainability, Health & Safety)\", \"Business Continuity Manager\", \"Environment, Health & Safety (Head of Environment, Health & Safety)\", \"Environmental Sustainability (Head of Environmental Sustainability)\", \"Social Sustainability (Head of Social Sustainability)\", and \"Sustainability Governance (Head of Sustainability Governance)\". Below the \"Environment, Health & Safety\" block are \"EHS Coordinator Technics\" and \"EHS Coordinator Sales\". To the right of the \"Sustainability Team\" is the \"Sustainability Committee (strategy and implementation)\" which includes \"Chairmanship (Vice President Corporate Sustainability, Health & Safety)\", \"Representatives of (Central Group divisions, Regional companies, Sustainability Team)\", and \"Committees (Human Rights Council, Climate Council)\".\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\nSustainability strategy and organisation Environment\n\n#### <span id=\"page-63-0\"></span>Sustainability Committee\n\nThe Sustainability Committee was established in the 2022 financial year, and it meets every quarter. It consists of representatives from the central Group divisions, regional companies and the Sustainability Team. Major decisions are made by the Board of Management and confirmed by the Supervisory Board. The Committee plays a key role in passing sustainability decisions and directives throughout the organisation and is the platform for monitoring and managing project progress. The new Human Rights Council, a sub-committee of the Committee, plays a central role in implementing ethical goals. Its purpose is to help shape Jungheinrich's approach to respecting human rights. In addition, the Sustainability Committee along with the Climate Council, which was established in the reporting year, manages the implementation of the Group-wide measures to reduce GHG emissions.\n\n# Environment\n\n#### CLIMATE NEUTRALITY INITIATIVE\n\nThe term climate neutrality describes a state in which human activities have no net impact on the climate system. In addition to greenhouse gas emissions, such man-made impacts also include aspects like the contamination of soil and water, the consumption of raw materials or the loss of biodiversity. Jungheinrich contributes to climate neutrality by pursuing its net zero greenhouse gas emissions target<sup>1</sup>. Adapting to climate change is vital for Jungheinrich, too, in order to prepare for existing and future climate changes. For this purpose, Jungheinrich analyses potential climate risks and opportunities and derives the necessary measures.\n\n#### Jungheinrich's net zero targets\n\nIn the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, 195 nations committed to restrict the man-made global increase in temperatures2 to 1.5 degrees Celsius in comparison with pre-industrial levels. In turn, Jungheinrich committed itself to SBTi to support this target and as a company plans to achieve net zero Scope 1 to 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This target was\n\nofficially validated by SBTi in December 2023. Achieving the final target by 2050 will be accompanied by interim targets set for 2030 and 2040:\n\n| Target                                                                                               | Base year | Target year | Objective           |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|\n| 42-per-cent reduction in absolute Scope 1 emissions                                                  | 2021      | 2030        | SBTi                |\n| Increase in procurement of renewable electricity from 70 per cent to 100 per cent per year (Scope 2) | 2021      | 2030        | SBTi                |\n| 25-per-cent reduction in absolute Scope 3 emissions                                                  | 2021      | 2030        | SBTi                |\n| Net zero emissions in Scopes 1 and 2, including the neutralisation of emissions                      | 2021      | 2030        | Internal target     |\n| Net zero emissions in Scopes 1, 2 and 3, including the neutralisation of emissions                   | 2021      | 2040        | The Climate Pledge3 |\n| 90-per-cent reduction in absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions                                         | 2021      | 2050        | SBTi                |\n| Net zero emissions in Scopes 1, 2 and 3, including the neutralisation of residual emissions          | 2021      | 2050        | SBTi                |\n\n1 Jungheinrich understands net zero greenhouse gas emissions to mean balancing out emissions of the greenhouse gases CO₂, CH₄, N₂O, SF₆, HFCs, PFCs and NF₃, which are listed in the Kyoto Protocol. Jungheinrich will achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions initially by reducing directly and indirectly responsible emissions in Scopes 1, 2 and/or 3 through appropriate measures. The remaining unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions will then be balanced out in terms of volume through capital expenditure on carefully selected climate mitigation projects.\n\n2 cf. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2021): Sixth IPCC Assessment Report Working Group I Contribution: The Physical Science Basis.\n\n3 In contrast to SBTi, The Climate Pledge does not set any targets regarding the proportional composition of reduction and compensation measures in reaching the published target.\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Greenhouse gas management: Achieving net zero in four steps\n\nJungheinrich is pursuing a four-step management approach to achieve its net zero targets.\n\nThe basic prerequisite for achieving net zero is knowing the Group-wide greenhouse gas emissions, which Jungheinrich calculates annually using the (1) corporate carbon footprint. The ongoing creation of (2) product life cycle assessments [ [page](#page-68-0) 67 ] completes this data. The (3) Road to Zero Emissions is based on the data generated and continually updated. It contains important milestones and all central measures for systematically reducing Jungheinrich's emissions. In future, remaining emissions will be compensated for in the final step (4) to achieve net zero.\n\nGreenhouse gas management activity is coordinated centrally at Jungheinrich, and implemented in close cooperation with all relevant departments and Group companies. The majority of the greenhouse gas emissions are created in the value chain. In order to influence these greenhouse gas emissions, which are only indirectly caused by the Group, Jungheinrich remains in close contact with customers, suppliers and other partners.\n\n#### Corporate carbon footprint\n\nJungheinrich records its corporate carbon footprint in accordance with the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP). The control approach is used for this purpose. Scope 1 to 3 emissions are calculated separately and in detail for all companies in which Jungheinrich holds a voting and capital share of more than 50 per cent. All other companies are included in the statistics as investments (pursuant to Scope 3.15 GHGP). Scope 1 consists of all of Jungheinrich's direct emissions. Scope 2 contains emissions caused indirectly through the purchase of energy. Scope 3 covers all indirect emissions along the value chain.\n\n#### Structure of climate management at Jungheinrich\n\nImage /page/64/Figure/15 description: The image shows a diagram of four steps in a process, labeled 1 through 4. The first step is \"Corporate Carbon Footprint\", the second is \"Life Cycle Assessments\", the third is \"Road to Zero Emissions\", and the fourth is \"Voluntary Offsets of Residuals\". An arrow points from the top of the diagram, labeled \"Annual Update\", to the first step. Arrows connect each step to the next in the sequence.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-65-0\"></span>A schematic diagram illustrates the emission scopes according to GHGP that apply at Jungheinrich. Jungheinrich's corporate carbon footprint amounted to 2,733 thousand tonnes of CO2e in 2023. Of this figure, 1.9 per cent were\n\nScope 1 emissions, 0.3 per cent Scope 21 (market-based) and 97.8 per cent Scope 3. Based on Jungheinrich's Group revenue, the intensity of the greenhouse gas emissions was 0.49 thousand tonnes of CO2 e/€ million (2022: 0.62).\n\n#### Greenhouse gas emissions in the Jungheinrich Group according to the GHGP\n\nImage /page/65/Figure/10 description: The image shows a diagram of the different scopes of carbon emissions. At the top of the diagram, there is a cloud with the following gases: CO2, CH4, N2O, CO2e, PFCs, HFCs, SF6, and NF3. The diagram is divided into three sections: Scope 1 Direct, Scope 2 Indirect, and Scope 3 Indirect. Scope 3 Indirect is further divided into Upstream activities and Downstream activities. The Upstream activities include: Purchased goods and services (1), Capital goods (2), Fuel- and energy-related emissions (3), Transportation and distribution (4), Waste generated in operations (5), Business travel (6), Employee commuting (7), and Leased assets (8). Scope 1 Direct includes: Company facilities, Company vehicles, and Transportation and distribution (9). Scope 2 Indirect includes: Purchased energy for electricity and heat. The Downstream activities include: Transportation and distribution, Use of sold products (11), End of life treatment of sold products (12), Leased assets (13), and Investments (15).\n\n#### Greenhouse gas emissions\n\n| in thousand tonnes of CO2<br>e 2                         | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Scope 1                                                  | 51.3    | 51.2    | 55.7    |\n| Scope 2 market-based                                     | 7.7     | 7.8     | 9.3     |\n| Scope 2 location-based                                   | 26.7    | 26.7    | 24.6    |\n| Scope 3 total                                            | 2,674.2 | 2,886.8 | 2,555.9 |\n| Scope 3 upstream                                         | 1,127.1 | 1,215.7 | 1,209.9 |\n| Scope 3 downstream                                       | 1,547.1 | 1,671.1 | 1,346.0 |\n| Intensity of greenhouse gas<br>emissions (Scopes 1 to 3) | 0.49    | 0.62    | 0.62    |\n\nTotal greenhouse gas emissions declined by 7.2 per cent in 2023 against the previous year. Scope 1 CO2e emissions fell 7.9 per cent in comparison with 2021 and remained virtually on a par with the previous year with an increase of 0.2 per cent. While a more efficient use of fossil fuels helped to reduce emissions, the slight increase in comparison with the previous year is due partly to the acquisition of companies and the expansion of production capacities. A constant reduction in Scope 2 (market-based) greenhouse gas emissions can be seen in comparison with the previous years. The reason for this is the gradual, global switch of electricity supplies to renewable energy sources at the company's locations. Upstream and downstream CO2e emissions in\n\n1 Scope 2 emissions can be calculated using two methods: location-based and market-based. In the location-based method, energy consumption is calculated using average national emissions factors. In the market-based method, the CO2 e emissions are calculated using the individual emissions factors of the company's own energy provider. This method is therefore more specific, and thus more relevant to Jungheinrich.\n\n<sup>2</sup> The emissions factors used correspond to the usual sources (for example, International Energy Agency [IEA], Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [DEFRA], Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]). The key figures are partially based on commonly-used extrapolation logic. For example, some key figures were calculated pro rata using comparable companies or types of companies. Depending on the situation, information regarding full-time equivalents (FTE), revenue and /or surface area was used for this purpose.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-66-0\"></span>About Jungheinrich\n\nScope 3 decreased by 7.4 per cent against 2022, despite the positive business performance. This decline is also due to the improvement in emissions factors.\n\n#### Road to Zero Emissions\n\nJungheinrich takes systematic action to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions based on the findings of the corporate carbon footprint and the product life cycle assessments.\n\nWith regards to Scope 1 emissions, switching the vehicle fleet, both company cars and after-sales vehicles, to electric power is an important milestone on the road to achieving net zero. The transition of the after-sales fleet to fully electric vehicles began at the end of the 2023 financial year. The proportion of electric vehicles, including company cars, is constantly being expanded. Charging infrastructure is also being expanded step-by-step at company locations, and there are now more than 50 new charging points at the Group headquarters in Hamburg.\n\nAn important milestone for Scope 2 is the transition at all company locations to electricity that comes entirely from renewable energy sources. The German locations completed this transition back in the 2021 financial year. International locations are scheduled to transition by 2030 at the latest. The transition was completed in 28 countries by the end of the 2023 financial year. The Norderstedt plant has also been using CO2 e-neutral district heating since 2021, as has the Finnish marketing and sales office since 2023. In addition, Jungheinrich has been installing photovoltaic equipment at appropriate locations worldwide since 2022. Eight locations in Germany alone have photovoltaics equipment fitted to generate their own electricity or are in the process of having it fitted. In 2023, for instance, the roof of the car park at the Group headquarters in Hamburg was covered with 630 photovoltaic modules over the 1,100 square-metre surface.\n\nJungheinrich is also striving to reduce Scope 3 emissions. In the 2023 financial year, systematic measures were identified to reduce emissions from purchased products and services (Scopes 3.1/3.2), opportunities were developed to optimise the sustainability of packaging (Scopes 3.1/3.12), and awareness for the use of electricity from renewable sources was raised among initial important partners when using products (Scope 3.11) 1 . Jungheinrich has been manufacturing exclusively battery-powered trucks since March 2023. In comparison with forklift trucks with an internal combustion engine, emissions from battery-powered trucks are lower during product use (Scope 3.11). In addition, the aim is to continuously increase the efficiency of material handling equipment (Scope 3.11) and to ensure that these products are designed with ease of disassembly in mind from the outset (Scopes 3.1/3.12). By refining its requirements for eco design, Jungheinrich is also planning to advance the viability of circular economy or climate friendly alternative materials [ [page](#page-67-0) 66 ]. Further measures along the entire value chain are continually being evaluated and systematically implemented.\n\n#### Voluntary compensation and neutralisation of remaining GHG emissions\n\nIn order to reach the net zero targets from 2030, Jungheinrich has decided to compensate remaining CO2e emissions through voluntary capital expenditure in climate change mitigation projects. A comprehensive catalogue of criteria was developed to enable the identification of such climate change mitigation projects that fulfil recognised quality standards and Jungheinrich's own high standards when it comes to compensation. This catalogue was updated in 2023 due to the specific requirements of STBi regarding the neutralisation of greenhouse gas emissions. The quality and effectiveness of the projects and their regional connection to Jungheinrich are the characteristics looked for when choosing compensation projects.\n\n#### Adapting to climate change\n\nCompanies are subject to potential negative impacts from climate change, whereby it is differentiated between physical and transitory climate risks and opportunities. Physical climate risks include potential damage to buildings due to storms or heavy rainfall. Transitory climate risks can impact companies in the form of changes in demand for loweremission technology. In meeting the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation [ [page](#page-80-0) 79 ], Jungheinrich's first step was to analyse the physical climate risks at selected locations in a structured manner and examine existing solutions as well as potential solutions for adaptation. The focus was on plants where material handling equipment or lithiumion batteries are produced, the spare parts centre in Kaltenkirchen and the Group headquarters in Hamburg. In total, the analysis covered 14 locations in Germany, one in China and one in Czechia.\n\nThe guideline provided by the German Federal Environment Agency that substantiates the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation was used for the climate risk analysis. Software was deployed for the analysis at Jungheinrich that processes and prepares the climate risk data from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports. If a climate threat is relevant for a particular location, a risk analysis is performed for the actual threat based on historical data and for the future development of the climate threat based on optimistic and pessimistic IPCC climate scenarios2 up to 2050. The climate risks identified and evaluated by the software are validated according to their economic relevance together with employees at the location from the Production, Environment, Health & Safety and Facility Management divisions. The climate risks are then\n\n<sup>1</sup> Due to a lack of definitions in the GHGP, no separate figure for Scope 3.11 is presented in accordance with the market-based approach.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) lay out certain greenhouse gas concentration scenarios. Jungheinrich uses RCP 2.6 as the optimistic scenario and RCP 8.5 for the pessimistic scenario for its climate risk analysis.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-67-0\"></span>assigned to the qualitative categories of high, medium and low, without a financial assessment. High risks for some locations are storms, floods, heavy rainfall and drought/water stress. The same risks are classed as medium for other locations. Heatwaves and cold snaps are also medium risks. Then an evaluation is performed for all locations to see whether any adaptation measures are already in place for high and medium risks in order to reduce potential impacts. This has shown that all of the locations examined already fully protect themselves against current and future climate threats. Adaptation measures implemented against the threat of heatwaves include full air conditioning in office buildings with comprehensive insulation or targeted cooling of temperature-sensitive equipment. The threat of heavy rainfall or floods is countered through seepage reservoirs or mobile protection systems (for example, sand sacks). Adaptation plans are made if there are no or insufficient adaptation solutions for high climate risks. Adaptation plans must be designed in such a way that adaptation solutions that can significantly reduce high climate risks are implemented within five years. For medium risks, a list of adaptation solutions is created that must be taken into account for future projects at the site.\n\nThe Group intends to expand the physical climate risk analysis to more locations in 2024. In addition, there are plans to analyse the transitory climate risks and opportunities for Jungheinrich. The financial and strategic implications of the climate risks and opportunities will also be evaluated.\n\n#### ECO EFFICIENCY AND CIRCULAR ECONOMY INITIATIVE\n\nJungheinrich is aware of the environmental impact and the limited resources in light of the climbing global demand for resources. That is why the company has decided to further break its growth away from resource consumption. The targeted improvement of the products' ecological efficiency and promoting circular economies are therefore of vital importance to Jungheinrich. Considering the increasing scarcity of resources, a circular economy in which every single end product of a consumption or production process is the basis for further processes is gaining in importance. Ideally, this should result in no waste or emissions. The use and preservation of resources in a circular economy and the development of resource- and energy-efficient products also support the path to climate neutrality.\n\n#### Eco design and product life cycle assessments\n\n#### Eco design\n\nProduct design has an economic and ecological role to play as early as the development phase at Jungheinrich, as the largest share of the environmental impact of the product's life cycle is determined in this phase. Jungheinrich therefore integrates the principles of circular economies and the environmental efficiency of new trucks from the beginning using predetermined criteria for eco design.\n\nUsing product environmental compatibility assessments, Jungheinrich explores the potential to achieve energy and resource efficiency from the beginning. Defined milestones in the product development process ensure that the various eco design criteria are recorded, evaluated and implemented. Aspects of both resource efficiency and performance are taken into account. The Group plans to expand the existing eco design requirements to include the aspects illustrated in the image in close cooperation with the departments.\n\n#### Eco design criteria in product development\n\nImage /page/67/Figure/16 description: The image shows a diagram about eco design criteria. On the left, there is a green arrow pointing to the right. The top part of the arrow is yellow and labeled \"New products\". The bottom part of the arrow is gray and labeled \"Product improvements\". On the right, there is a table with two columns. The left column is titled \"Natural resources\" and lists the following criteria: Resource consumption/emissions, Energy consumption/efficiency, Material/raw material selection, Recycled material, Recyclable material, Hazardous and critical ingredients, and Packaging. The right column is titled \"Performance\" and lists the following criteria: Lifetime/durability, Recyclability/recoverability, Disassembly and assembly capability, Service capability/service efficiency, Procurement (global vs. local), and Design for refurbishment.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-68-0\"></span>About Jungheinrich\n\nThe design of new products is increasingly dependent on requirements relating to critical ingredients. Jungheinrich ensures material compliance by taking the following criteria into consideration:\n\n- Jungheinrich meets the legal requirements for regulated hazardous ingredients such as the REACH Regulation 1 (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) requirements or the RoHS Directive 2 (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) for relevant products.\n- Jungheinrich goes beyond the legal requirements and strives to exclude materials in its products that are controversial from a social or ecological point of view, even if they are not yet legally regulated.\n- Jungheinrich demands comprehensive material declarations from suppliers.\n\nIn a multi-stage material compliance project, launched in the financial year 2020, Jungheinrich created a central approach to take into account legal and internal requirements in the product development process for trucks, batteries and battery chargers. The intention is to safeguard the procurement, availability and evaluation of relevant information. Transparency regarding regulated substances is created by including the relevant suppliers of materials directly used in the production of the previously mentioned product groups. With this in mind, Jungheinrich developed a centralised IT system to document the material compliance status of these suppliers. The relevant requirements are provided in the Supplier Manual in order to include suppliers in the development process at an early stage. As a result, prohibited materials are not used in the supply chains and the procurement of restricted or hazardous materials is avoided. The recognition of material compliance requirements is systematically established for new suppliers in the supplier qualification.\n\n#### Product life cycle assessments\n\nJungheinrich has been working consistently on improving its products' ecological efficiency, and especially that of trucks. The company prepares life cycle assessments to evaluate and monitor the sustainability performance of its products, which are developed in accordance with its eco design requirements. These assessments help Jungheinrich to meet regulatory and customer requirements. As part of a software expansion, Jungheinrich plans to systematically create life cycle assessments for new developments and calculate CO2e emissions for all phases of the life cycle. This will enable the detection of emission reduction potential early on in the development process.\n\nComprehensive life cycle assessments have already been created for the following products: a forklift truck (ETV 216i), two batteries for material handling equipment (lithium-ion and lead-acid) and a stacker crane. These assessments were also performed and certified in accordance with the principles of DIN EN ISO 14040/14044. Other environmental factors besides CO2e emissions were included in the assessments and the product life cycle phases analysed more closely. The detailed analysis of all components and phases from raw material extraction to the end of the product life cycle has created transparency in the value chain and supplied important findings for future product development. The product life cycle assessments performed by Jungheinrich have shown that the majority of CO2e emissions for material handling equipment occur in the use phase, and that they are highly dependent on the energy requirements of the battery used as the drive technology. Jungheinrich has compared lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries using product life cycle assessments. 3 The lithium-ion battery caused around 20 per cent less CO2e emissions in total across its life cycle, and 15 per cent less\n\nImage /page/68/Figure/15 description: The image shows a diagram of the life cycle phases of trucks. The diagram is a circle with seven phases, numbered 1 through 7. Phase 1 is \"Raw materials\", phase 2 is \"Processing\", phase 3 is \"Production/refurbishment\", phase 4 is \"Transport and delivery\", phase 5 is \"Use\", phase 6 is \"Service\", and phase 7 is \"End of life\". From phase 7, there are two arrows pointing to \"Waste\" and \"Recycling\".\n\nemissions were caused during its use. This result confirms Jungheinrich's target of ensuring that 50 per cent of material handling equipment is equipped with lithium-ion batteries by 2025. Jungheinrich's POWERLiNE series, equipped with integrated lithium-ion batteries, makes an important contribution to achieving this target.\n\n3 The functional unit for this assessment was based on the average lifespan of the lithium-ion battery used in the ETV 216i truck (15,000 operating hours). Based on this functional unit, the comparable battery systems are defined as follows: a functional battery system with a lithium-ion battery and a functional battery system with 2.3 lead-acid batteries.\n\n<sup>1</sup> REACH Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 is an EU chemicals regulation that came into force on 1 June 2007.\n\n<sup>2</sup> The RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU relates to restrictions on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-69-0\"></span>About Jungheinrich\n\nDuring preparations to meet the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, Jungheinrich calculated the CO2e emissions of 19 reference trucks in the 2023 financial year from the highest revenue-generating models. The CO2e emissions saved over the entire life cycle of the trucks analysed were also calculated. Significantly reduced emissions were the result, particularly where lithium-ion batteries were used instead of lead-acid batteries as the drive technology.\n\nThe result of the product life cycle assessment comparison showed that an average reduction in CO2e emissions of 23 per cent was achieved with lithium-ion battery-powered trucks. The CO2e emissions were calculated using the ISO 14067 method and the result audited by an external auditor.\n\n#### Establishing a circular economy\n\nJungheinrich launched a process in the 2023 reporting year to develop a holistic strategy to advance the circular economy. Starting with the identification and definition of material circular economy terms, the relevant fields of action for Jungheinrich are determined and measures for expanding the circular economy in the relevant fields created. Companyand product-related programmes to support the breakaway from resources have also been implemented:\n\n- Truck rental models: Jungheinrich offers material handling equipment rental models that save resources and also keep ownership rights for raw materials and materials with the company. This enables Jungheinrich to ensure recyclability in the long term.\n- Used trucks: Jungheinrich has been refurbishing its own material handling equipment at the refurbishment plant in Dresden since 2006. The demand for reconditioned forklifts led to the opening of a plant in Ploiești, Romania,\n\nin 2022. In 2023, Jungheinrich industrially refurbished 7,491 trucks (2022: 5,588) with a reuse ratio of around 92.0 per cent (2022: 93.0 per cent). The proportion of older trucks in for refurbishing rose in comparison with the previous year, which required more parts to be changed. The reuse ratio decreased slightly for this reason. At the same time, customer requirements regarding the functional equipment of the used trucks impacted the refurbishment process. This resulted in a rise in the replaced and recyclable components to 7.3 per cent (2022: 6.1 per cent). A total of 99.3 per cent (2022: 99.1 per cent) of a truck's materials were returned to the loop in 2023. Through refurbishment, which saves raw materials and energy, Jungheinrich can extend the life cycle of material handling equipment and minimise the use of new parts.\n\n Optimised battery life cycles: Jungheinrich is aiming to extend battery life cycle phases. Lithium-ion batteries that have previously been used in new trucks are refurbished for use in a used truck. Battery cells with insufficient capacity for material handling equipment are used in stationary energy storage systems before they are recycled.\n\n#### Definition of environmental standards in environmental and energy programmes\n\nJungheinrich has made a collection of measures for environmentally friendly conduct available on the internal sustainability platform. These contain best practice examples and suggestions for sustainable transformation at the Jungheinrich locations. 17 companies had ISO 14001-certified environmental management systems in place in the 2023 financial year, and seven had ISO 50001-certified energy management systems.\n\nThe principles of energy efficiency and the sparing use of natural resources are implemented based on Jungheinrich's internal environmental standards, which go beyond the legal requirements in some cases. These environmental standards include but are not limited to the following principles:\n\n- improving energy efficiency\n- increasing the recyclability of resources\n- efficient water and effluent management\n- preserving and promoting biodiversity\n- active hazardous substance management\n\nThe key figures for 2021 presented in this report do not include all fully consolidated companies and therefore are only comparable with the figures for 2022 and 2023 to a limited extent. The key figures are partially based on commonly-used extrapolation logic. For example, some values have been extrapolated for the whole of the year under review based on actual figures available for part of the year. Additionally, some key figures have been calculated pro rata using comparable companies or types of companies.\n\n#### Energy management\n\nThe integration of sustainable energy solutions remains an important building block for future energy management. Energy management includes increasing security of supply, improving the energy efficiency of equipment, and reducing dependence on price fluctuations and supply bottlenecks through the use of a decentralised energy supply. Jungheinrich consistently focusses on the use of electricity from renewable sources and its own decentralised energy generation.\n\nEnergy consumption is optimised through targeted energysaving measures and the use of efficient technology. The continual improvement of energy management is reviewed in internal and external audits and ensured through measures derived from the audits.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-70-0\"></span>Measured against Group revenue, Jungheinrich's energy consumption of 295,113 MWh 1 (2022: 292,221 MWh) corresponded to an energy intensity of 53.3 MWh/€ million (2022: 61.3 MWh/€ million) in the reporting year. Consumption of electricity generated by the Group from renewable sources was recorded for the first time in 2023 and came to 488 MWh.\n\n#### The following table shows energy consumption in the Jungheinrich Group:\n\n|                                                                                       | 2023       | 2022       | 2021       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Natural gas in kWh2                                                                   | 51,407,555 | 52,099,655 | 50,393,583 |\n| Heating oil in kWh                                                                    | 1,288,111  | 1,346,004  | 1,514,197  |\n| Diesel in l                                                                           | 12,996,470 | 13,366,426 | 10,094,990 |\n| Petrol in l                                                                           | 3,900,233  | 2,815,367  | 450,141    |\n| Ethanol in l                                                                          | 68,416     | 75,457     | 48,365     |\n| LPG in kg                                                                             | 50,449     | 43,934     | –          |\n| Public electricity in kWh                                                             | 66,243,009 | 68,503,026 | 56,333,950 |\n| Consumption of electricity<br>generated by the Group from<br>renewable sources in kWh | 488,002    | –          | –          |\n| District heating in kWh                                                               | 12,519,820 | 12,784,725 | 11,563,197 |\n\n#### Waste and recycling management\n\nJungheinrich aims to continually increase its ability to recycle resources, and is guided by the principle of prevention before recycling, recycling before disposal. The targets in this context are:\n\n- no landfill waste at German plants by 2025\n- reducing the global landfill waste by a third by 2025 (base year: 2019)\n\n no landfill waste created by internal work processes at locations in countries with established recycling systems by 2030\n\nThe project team for introducing central waste management achieved the following in the reporting year:\n\n- transparency on waste streams at the plants\n- uniform internal waste statistics\n- comparison of recycle/disposal procedures\n- measures to optimise disposal channels\n\nThe waste statistics show that the majority of waste is recycled. Total waste in 2023 rose partially due to the expansion of production capacities and an increase in the volume of old batteries disposed.\n\n#### Total amount of waste\n\n| in tonnes                 | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total hazardous waste     | 10,704 | 7,696  | 5,239  |\n| Recycling of materials    | 8,876  | 6,087  | 3,791  |\n| Thermal recovery          | 735    | 812    | 353    |\n| Disposal                  | 1,093  | 797    | 1,095  |\n| Total non-hazardous waste | 13,310 | 13,473 | 11,036 |\n| Recycling of materials    | 11,463 | 11,527 | 8801   |\n| Thermal recovery          | 1,036  | 1,119  | 1,057  |\n| Disposal                  | 811    | 827    | 1,178  |\n\n#### Water and effluent management\n\nThe Group's environmental management system views water and effluent management as an important environmental aspect that it has a direct influence on. Jungheinrich is committed to handling water efficiently in order to reduce water consumption and the volume of effluent produced on an ongoing basis. Circular economy solutions are vital in this regard. A production water treatment facility is in operation at one production location with the aim of creating internal water cycles. An effluent pretreatment facility at another plant also allows for production effluent to be fed back into the sewage systems; this means effluent does not have to be picked up by a specialist disposal company. Ways of treating and feeding water back into the sewage system is also being examined for other plants. One action taken to reduce water consumption was the substitution of a wet chemical pretreatment process in a powder coating facility, meaning that this process will no longer require water in the future.\n\nThe Group withdraws a total of 293 megalitres of water (2022: 315 megalitres), of which 165 megalitres is groundwater and 128 megalitres water from third parties, such as municipal water companies. The remaining water withdrawal comes from surface water, seawater and own water sources. Groundwater is primarily withdrawn for the Moosburg and Degernpoint production plants' cooling systems, where the water is used in closed loops and returned.\n\n<sup>1</sup> The key figure provided is based on commonly-used conversion factors.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Including natural gas consumption for the production of electricity through the cogeneration unit at the Degernpoint plant.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe environment Society\n\n#### <span id=\"page-71-0\"></span>Preserving biodiversity\n\nTo promote the biodiversity of ecosystems and agricultural systems, Jungheinrich has launched local initiatives around the world and encourages all employees to get involved. Various measures to promote biodiversity are suggested on the internal sustainability platform that can be implemented at the sites: Opening up sealed surfaces, greening walls and roofs, planting easy-maintenance gardens for wild animals on unused outdoor areas, planting domestic and wildlife-friendly plants, setting up insect hotels and beehives and setting out drinking water for animals. Measures are also taken to promote biodiversity when new plants are\n\n# Society\n\n#### EMPLOYEE INITIATIVE\n\nAs a global enterprise with more than 21,000 employees, Jungheinrich has managed to combine growth with the values of a family-owned business and a management culture based on trust in the employees. In this financial year, Jungheinrich introduced Jellow Way, which outlines the attitude to management and cooperation. This mission statement outlines behaviours that support Jungheinrich's ongoing success. Jellow Way presents the corporate culture and serves as a foundation for discussions, feedback and development and as a guide.\n\nSome of the key figures in this chapter relating to employee numbers exclude temporary workers, apprentices and trainees. These figures exclude the companies MIAS USA,\n\nconstructed. The Chomutov plant in Czechia, for instance, is located on a 1.5-hectare green space with native bushes and trees and thus contributes to the promotion of local biodiversity.\n\n#### Hazardous substance management\n\nThe development, production and operation of material handling equipment currently requires the use of hazardous substances that can have an impact on the environment and the health of employees. Strict regulatory requirements must therefore be applied to the handling of hazardous substances. The Group has clear guidelines in place for the use of hazardous substances. There is a defined process for the approval of these substances that includes the double-check principle and the inclusion of work safety and environmental experts. Ongoing hazard assessments, including substitution evaluations, are performed as part of Jungheinrich's active hazardous substance management. During these assessments, possibilities for substituting hazardous substances or processes with alternatives are evaluated (substance, mixture, product or process). This leads to a lower endangerment of the workforce and the environment overall. The employees affected are regularly trained in the safe use of hazardous materials.\n\nMIAS Holding Asia, JFS United Kingdom, JFS Spain and JFS Italy as these companies have fewer than 10 employees. Magazino and Storage Solutions are also excluded as these were only fully consolidated in the current financial year. 98.4 per cent of FTEs at the Jungheinrich Group are covered by these figures. All other key figures relating to FTE employees at the Jungheinrich Group fully include apprentices at all companies.\n\n#### Low staff turnover and long periods of employment\n\nDemographic change and the associated labour shortage are posing significant challenges on the labour market in this decade. As an employer, Jungheinrich strives to retain employees and gain talented young people for the company. Various measures are in place to safeguard the stability of the workforce, such as promoting personal development, supporting a work-life balance, flexible working hours, company pensions and training offers. Indicators of the stability of the workforce is the average period of employment of 9.7 years 1 (2022: 9.8 years), and low staff turnover of 4.9 per cent worldwide 2 (2022: 6.6 per cent) which equates to 1,003 resignations (2022: 1,273). Overall, the number of employees has increased by 1,310 3 against the previous year (2022: 704). At 98.1 per cent 1, 3, a high number of employees have permanent employment contracts (2022: 97.9 per cent).\n\n2 Average number of employees.\n\n3 Employees in FTE.\n\n<sup>1</sup> Reporting date 1 December 2023.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\nSociety\n\n<span id=\"page-72-0\"></span>Jungheinrich cultivates a pleasant work atmosphere and a future-oriented, supportive feedback culture (feedforward) through a new structure for annual employee appraisals, which will be rolled out worldwide. It promotes trust between managers and employees and strengthens Jungheinrich's corporate culture. This exchange supports the development and common understanding of cooperation in the company. Jungheinrich's modern management approach is also defined here. The managers are responsible for creating an environment that promotes innovation, achieves results, has a focussed direction and encourages employees to act on their own initiative.\n\nJungheinrich again gained 22 talented young individuals from around the world this financial year for the Jungheinrich International Graduate Programme. Besides Germany, Italy, Spain and Thailand, the Group also welcomed its first trainees from Denmark, India, Singapore, the Netherlands and Belgium in 2023.\n\n#### Employees by region and gender\n\n|                 | FTE<br>20231,2 | FTE<br>20221,3 | Headcount<br>female<br>20231,2 | Headcount<br>female<br>20221,3 |\n|-----------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Germany         | 8,688          | 8,251          | 1,692                          | 1,587                          |\n| France          | 1,259          | 1,242          | 271                            | 273                            |\n| Italy           | 1,174          | 1,113          | 304                            | 287                            |\n| United Kingdom  | 836            | 781            | 133                            | 131                            |\n| Spain           | 649            | 533            | 147                            | 127                            |\n| Poland          | 621            | 618            | 150                            | 145                            |\n| Rest of Europe  | 4,840          | 4,482          | 1,022                          | 916                            |\n| China           | 840            | 919            | 196                            | 219                            |\n| Other countries | 2,210          | 1,868          | 411                            | 367                            |\n| Total           | 21,117         | 19,807         | 4,326                          | 4,052                          |\n\n#### Fair working conditions and promoting occupational health and safety\n\nJungheinrich has adopted numerous measures to achieve its overarching target of preserving and furthering employees' health and satisfaction. The employee health ratio reached 96.9 per cent in the financial year 2023 (2022: 96.5 per cent). The working conditions at Jungheinrich are flexible wherever possible, which is reflected in the range of offers such as working from home, working remotely and hybrid models. The following measures were taken in 2023:\n\n- Amending employment contracts to allow employees in suitable positions to permanently work remotely for up to 50 per cent of their contracted hours or up to 20 per cent from home.\n- Providing materials for remote working spaces, such as height-adjustable desks and chairs.\n- Equipping meeting rooms for hybrid meetings to enable virtual cooperation.\n- Launch of a Group-wide initiative for the future-oriented design and use of office space to promote both hybrid and analogue collaboration.\n\nMeasures to promote worker health include:\n\n- subsidised occupational health check-ups\n- vaccination advice and health checks\n- company sports programmes at different locations\n- regular, decentralised health awareness days on special topics and expert fitness and health advice\n- access to the \"Balloon\" app, which features a growing library of audio meditations on topics such as stress, sleep, calmness\n- promoting mental health through mindfulness training\n- continuing the series of \"Yes I Care\" workshops for managers to raise awareness of employee health issues\n- firmly integrated processes for employees returning to work\n- regular physical threat analyses with follow-up planning and optimisation measures\n- introduction of JobRad, a cooperation for subsidised bikes leases\n\nJungheinrich is currently working on a health offer for all employees and establishing global company health management. Protecting employees' health is Jungheinrich's top priority. Vision Zero underscores the importance placed on health with the target of zero accidents for employees in the Group, including temporary employees, staff from temping companies, trainees and apprentices. The health of every member of the workforce is decisive in preserving the individual's ability to work and thus Jungheinrich's ability to perform and be successful over the long term.\n\nJungheinrich has implemented overarching programmes in the field of safety and health management. Material work safety tools and processes were harmonised during the process. For instance, in 2023 the Group began standardising the processes for recording safety-relevant events. The integration of health and safety guidelines in workflows is being driven forward. Managers provide briefings on occupational health and safety topics annually. E-learning offers provide support for achieving work safety targets. In addition, special training courses on workspace conditions are carried out on site. This includes training safety officers, first aiders, and fire safety and evacuation assistants. The first training courses to raise awareness for health and safety were held for managers and individual departments in 2023. This series of training is scheduled to be continued and rolled out further\n\n<sup>1</sup> Employees in FTE.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Reporting date 1 December 2023.\n\n<sup>3</sup> Reporting date 1 December 2022.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-73-0\"></span>About Jungheinrich\n\nSociety\n\nin 2024. Jungheinrich's aim is to contribute to the overall strengthening of the social aspects of sustainability in the corporate culture.\n\nThe aim of conducting systematic analyses of accidents and their causes is to prevent such accidents and reduce downtimes. All safety-relevant events are included and a preventive approach is adopted. The measures taken in the 2023 financial year have led to an improvement in work safety. This is reflected in the key figures, whereby accidents in the workplace with at least one lost day are included in the statistic:\n\n- The LTIR in 2023 1 was 13.7 (2022: 13.8). The aim is to reduce this figure to 12.5 by 2025. LTIR is based on the frequency of work accidents per one million working hours.\n- There were 464 accidents in the workplace throughout the Group in the year under review 1 (2022: 471).\n- Each accident in the workplace resulted in an average of 14.8 lost days 1 (2022: 15.2).\n\nCommunication concepts to promote exchanges and synergies across locations are being developed. Jungheinrich is pushing forward with the digitalisation of EHS processes. Jungheinrich continued combining the documents and processes that have already been drawn up into an occupational safety management system in 2023. The system is to be certified according to DIN ISO 45001 in future.\n\n#### Employee personal development\n\nBoosting the company's adaptability is one of the success factors for the implementation of the corporate Strategy 2025+. Jungheinrich supports employee personal development with a comprehensive range of training. This can be seen in the various initiatives:\n\n- Training for managers, project leads and employees is as much a part of the portfolio as the establishment of an internal network of change facilitators who provide support during the design of change processes at Jungheinrich.\n- The Jungheinrich Academy offers qualifications that meet employees needs in the form of e-training and in-person courses. Special training courses for after-sales and sales employees are offered in the Group's own training centres worldwide. The range of offers also covers training courses in the field of HR, finance, IT and production as well as personal development. This range will be expanded to include target group-specific sustainability training from 2024. The range is completed with a comprehensive and international Train the Trainer programme. The range of training available is supplemented by Jungheinrich CAMPUS, an internal learning management portal with digital, modular training formats.\n- In the 2023 financial year, the internal Group-wide learning hours were recognised for the first time. They amounted to 813,053.6 hours 2 . That is equivalent to an average of 38.3 learning hours per employee. The amount of external learning hours will be recorded from 2024.\n- In their annual appraisals, employees agree on development measures together with their manager to safeguard their employability and personal development. Training managers and personal development professionals provide employees with advice regarding their training needs in order to guarantee long-term learning success.\n\n#### Equal opportunity and diversity form the foundation of the company's success\n\nThe diversity of the workforce is a major factor in Jungheinrich's success. Jungheinrich fosters a variety of perspectives, ideas and solutions in a team-oriented and tolerant environment. It is important to Jungheinrich that salaries are fair and competitive and in line with the employees' positions. Within Germany, the Jungheinrich Group employs people from 75 (2022: 76) countries, including people with disabilities.3\n\nIn order to establish the common values internationally, Jungheinrich regularly sends senior executives from Group headquarters to the subsidiaries. Jungheinrich's long-term goal is to fill senior management level posts in the subsidiaries with local managers, as they are familiar with the local conditions and the national culture. As part of the corporate Strategy 2025+, Jungheinrich plans to increase the share of international managers in the workforce. In 2023, 88.5 per cent of the managers abroad came from the country they were working in (2022: 89.6 per cent) 3. The share of female employees in the Jungheinrich Group in 2023 came to 20.8 per cent 4 worldwide (2022: 20.5 per cent) and 19.8 per cent 4 (2022: 19.4 per cent) in Germany and is thus higher than in the previous year. This exceeds the average in the German machine construction industry of 17.2 per cent. The share of women on the Board of Management is 25.0 per cent (2022: 25.0 per cent), while the Supervisory Board has a 41.7 per cent share of female members (2022: 41.7 per cent).\n\n- 3 The calculation method for the share of locally recruited managers abroad was adjusted from the previous year to exclude international managers at German locations. The previous year's figure was also recalculated and presented anew.\n- 4 Reporting date 1 December 2023.\n\n<sup>1</sup> Employees, excluding employees on parental leave, partial retirement (passive phase), employees who have been signed off as unfit for work.\n\n<sup>2</sup> This figure relates to all fully consolidated companies and includes employees from temping companies, apprentices and trainees. External people participating in Jungheinrich CAMPUS training are not included.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-74-0\"></span>About Jungheinrich\n\nSociety\n\nThe share of women in management positions was 15.1 per cent (2022: 15.3 per cent). In line with the Strategy 2025+, Jungheinrich is aiming for a share of female managers of 20.0 per cent. The CEO remuneration ratio was calculated for the first time in 2023. This figure amounted to 35.8<sup>1</sup>.\n\n#### SOCIAL INITIATIVE\n\nThe central aim of the corporate Strategy 2025+ is to create sustainable value. This also includes Jungheinrich's social responsibilities. The company is committed to supporting long-term cooperations and projects in the field of emergency humanitarian aid and education. The main initiatives are:\n\n- Partnership with [action medeor:](https://medeor.de/en/) For more than ten years, Jungheinrich has been working with action medeor, an organisation committed to improving the health of people living in the world's poorest regions. Jungheinrich provides financial support and its intralogistics expertise. Another project that the company supported in 2023 was a multiyear project to promote mother and child health in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Donations in kind were made to optimise the medication warehouse at action medeor's headquarters in Tönisvorst.\n- Internal Donate your pennies campaign: Jungheinrich employees collect donations for action medeor with the Donate your pennies campaign. The monthly penny amounts on the pay slips of employees participating in this campaign are given to select projects once a year. So far around €300 thousand has been raised. Some of the money raised through this campaign in 2022 was donated\n\nto the earthquake victims in Türkiye and Syria in the year under review. The rest of the money raised went to the WASH project in Nepal.\n\n The cooperation with ARCHE: Jungheinrich has been supporting ARCHE, a Christian child and youth charity in Hamburg-Jenfeld, for more than a decade. The charity's objective is to improve the learning opportunities and quality of life of children and youths in the local area. Jungheinrich regularly makes financial donations and donations in kind and volunteers time at events such as the 2023 summer festival.\n\nIn addition to its long-term partnerships, Jungheinrich also provides support in unexpected emergency situations. In 2023, the company rallied support for the earthquake victims in Türkiye and Syria as well as for people affected by the flooding catastrophe in Slovenia. In both cases, one of the things Jungheinrich did was double the donations collected by its employees.\n\nBesides centrally initiated donation campaigns, the Group units also get involved in local charity projects, like those below.\n\n Brazil – education: Jungheinrich Brazil is committed to supporting the expansion of environmental education. A children's book was published together with the organisation Copaíba, that teaches children about sustainability, protecting the environment and the Atlantic Forest. All proceeds go to Copaíba: A tree is planted in the Atlantic Forest for every book sold and two children from state schools are invited to visit the organisation. The 10,000 copies published can be obtained at private schools, through Copaíba and the Brazilian Jungheinrich online shop. Some copies were donated to children in state schools.\n\n- Romania education: Jungheinrich Romania taught pupils about sustainability, recycling, sustainable innovation and lithium-ion batteries over the course of two event days. Trees were also planted at the Virgil Madgearu Economic College (Bucharest) and the High School of Sports (Brașov) as part of the project.\n- Thailand social commitment: While visiting the Asia Center Foundation (ACF), Jungheinrich employees from the Asia-Pacific region built a playground on the organisation's premises and played a number of educational games with the children. Several donations in kind were also made, such as toys, teaching materials and building materials for the playground. ACF is committed to improving the lives of at-risk children in Thailand by offering them access to education, care, healthy food and the opportunity to learn life skills in a safe environment.\n\n<sup>1</sup> This figure represents the ratio of the Chairman of the Board of Management's annual total remuneration to the average total annual remuneration of all employees in Germany. All German companies were included with the exception of MIAS, Profishop, arculus, ISI and Magazino. To calculate the average total remuneration, all relevant elements of personnel costs such as wages and salaries, provisions and bonuses, other personnel costs and long-term incentives were included.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-75-0\"></span>Governance\n\n#### GOVERNANCE INITIATIVE\n\nJungheinrich is committed to value-oriented corporate governance that promotes efficiency, a sense of responsibility, sustainability and long-term corporate success at all levels. The company's understanding of corporate governance is orientated towards the regulatory frameworks relevant to the company and to best practices, including the German Corporate Governance Code that serves as a guideline for governance internally and externally.\n\nThe foundations of Jungheinrich's entrepreneurial activity also include the clear distribution of tasks, rights and responsibilities, transparent internal and external corporate communications and responsible risk management. Effective internal control and risk management and compliance management system (CMS) play a central role in governance. Responsible business practices cover Jungheinrich's entire value chain and especially include procurement processes. Jungheinrich strives to be viewed as a reliable partner by customers, suppliers, employees, shareholders and all other stakeholders. Further information about [corporate governance](https://www.jungheinrich.com/en/investor-relations/corporate-governance) at Jungheinrich, including nominations to the Board of Management, Supervisory Board and Committees and their working methods, and Board of Management and Supervisory Board remuneration are published on the company's webpage.\n\n#### Compliance, with clearly defined responsibilities\n\nJungheinrich understands compliance to mean complying with laws and internal guidelines and rules in a systematic manner. The Group's CMS, which sets out clear responsibilities within the company, covers all organisational structures and processes, which are themselves regularly adapted to changing circumstances. The CMS requires correct behaviour and integrity from employees in everyday business, based on the principle of prevention, detection and response. This means that Jungheinrich proactively prevents violations and risks, offers Group-wide ways to report any suspected violations and conducts fair and confidential investigations. Jungheinrich has followed these compliance principles and the existing structures for many years, meaning no significant official investigations or fines have been launched against the company or its managers/executive bodies.\n\nThe Jungheinrich Compliance Committee met on set dates in the 2023 financial year ensuring the further development of the CMS from a Group perspective. In addition, the Jungheinrich AG Supervisory Board was regularly informed of compliance-relevant issues. Corporate Compliance, Audit & Data Protection was subject to a quality audit performed by an external auditor in 2022 to ensure that the processes and structures still met the increasing regulatory requirements. The implementation of the agreed further developments began in 2023.\n\nVarious tools and measures for implementing internal rules and regulations are at the core of the CMS, including:\n\n- a uniform Code of Conduct that is mandatory for all employees, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board\n- clear reporting channels, for instance via Jungheinrich's compliance portal OpenLine\n- Group-wide compliance training for all employees, including members of the Board of Management\n- regular audits performed by the Corporate Compliance Audit & Data Protection division\n- compliance along the entire value chain, including external suppliers and sales partners\n\n#### Consistent Code of Conduct\n\nJungheinrich makes binding guidelines and standards, including a Group guideline for compliance with clearly defined responsibilities, processes and structures available to all employees. In addition, a new Group guideline on preventing corruption was adopted and communicated throughout the Group in the 2023 financial year. A Code of Conduct that covers ten different compliance topics and applies throughout the company is also part of the Jungheinrich Compliance Management Guideline:\n\n- avoiding conflicts of interest\n- dealing with external business partners\n- avoiding bribery and corruption\n- antitrust regulations\n- the environment\n- data protection and information security\n- confidentiality and non-disclosure\n- human resources compliance\n- financial compliance\n- capital market compliance\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-76-0\"></span>About Jungheinrich\n\nThe company is committed to transparency in its donations as well as sponsoring, and does not tolerate inappropriate structures designed for tax evasion. The company also declares it will not support any political parties or projects, or any organisations or persons with a political background. Jungheinrich follows the arm's-length principle, whereby taxes are paid in the country in which it has generated the earnings.\n\nCompliance with personal rights and protecting company secrets are of the utmost importance. An internal guideline that takes into account legal requirements stipulates how personal data is to be handled.\n\n#### Clear reporting channels for violations\n\nA process that has been clearly communicated and applies internationally is in place for compliance issue reports and the notification of suspected violations. The process stipulates three channels for reporting: to direct supervisors, local compliance officers or the central compliance team. The [Jungheinrich OpenLine portal](http://www.whistle-blow.org/JungheinrichAG/) was launched as a fourth option in the CMS in the 2017 financial year. Employees can ask questions or report violations with their name or anonymously using the portal. The portal has also been available for external notifications since 2019. Jungheinrich is currently expanding the number of languages that the portal is available in, in order to make the portal accessible to as many people who wish to make a report as possible.\n\n#### Raising awareness for compliance\n\nAwareness of compliance issues is raised among employees in order to encourage appropriate conduct. Jungheinrich has made various compliance e-learning modules available through the Jungheinrich learning platform CAMPUS. These include training sessions covering the Jungheinrich Code of Conduct, data protection and IT security. They were again rolled out as mandatory training courses in 2023 to all employees who have access to Jungheinrich CAMPUS. Alternatively, customised and updated training materials for in-person training and specific information events was made available and offered at plants and sales locations. In the 2023 financial year, there were 28 compliance briefings (2022: 24). Jungheinrich also organised additional training for relevant groups on topics such as anticorruption and antitrust via Jungheinrich CAMPUS in 2023. Jungheinrich CAMPUS has also been offering the option of training partners who have to meet compliance requirements since 2019. New Jungheinrich companies are always briefed on relevant compliance topics in a defined process.\n\n#### Ongoing audits\n\nTo inspect suspected cases of violations against legal or internal requirements fairly and confidentially, incoming reports are checked by the Head of Corporate Compliance, Audit & Data Protection – after the Chief Compliance Officer has been informed. Further steps are taken if necessary, such as receipt audits, interviews and disciplinary measures. Over the course of the reporting year, there were no reports of any incidents which, following an internal investigation, would have to be classified as significant cases of corruption (2022: 0). To prevent corruption, all Jungheinrich locations are regularly checked for risks by the Corporate Compliance and Audit & Data Protection division. The standard procedure includes reviewing receipts, financial transactions and internal controls. Donations made by the Group and sponsorships are also regularly examined. In 2023, 23 audits were conducted (2022: 20). Appropriate documentation and traceability of the audits performed are an important part of the compliance reporting process and meet all regulatory requirements. Jungheinrich's Finance and Audit Committee is also informed of the audits performed and their results every quarter.\n\n#### Compliance along the value chain\n\nJungheinrich also expects the same high compliance and data protection standards from its external suppliers and sales partners. The Group expects them to behave ethically and apply the same high standards as Jungheinrich does. This includes guaranteeing the basic principles of free and fair competition, ensuring data is protected, and preventing corruption. These standards and compliance with environmental requirements along with labour rights and working conditions are laid out in the Supplier Code of Conduct. Suppliers are also informed of the existing reporting channels at Jungheinrich via the Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\n#### Respecting human rights\n\nJungheinrich is firmly committed to respecting human rights. Human rights due diligence obligations are established both within the business processes at Jungheinrich's own locations and within the supply chains. In determining the nature of its obligations, the company follows international guidelines and standards such as the UN Human Rights Charter, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP), the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Business and the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. In accordance with these guidelines, Jungheinrich obliges its employees, customers and business partners worldwide to act in a responsible, ethical and legal manner.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-77-0\"></span>This includes the following protected legal positions:\n\n- the prohibition of child labour, including the worst forms of child labour\n- the prohibition of forced labour, human trafficking and slavery\n- occupational health and safety\n- freedom of association\n- prohibition of discrimination and harassment\n- appropriate pay\n- the prohibition of affecting human populations through environmental changes\n- the prohibition of forced evictions and expropriation of natural resources\n- making demands on private and state security forces\n- compliance environmental obligations\n- fair working conditions and working hours\n- the right to data protection and privacy\n\nWith the revision of the [Jungheinrich Code for Human Rights](https://media-live2.prod.scw.jungheinrichcloud.com/resource/blob/1405308/48a280476b2f6fa0bc7312acf8e74cf4/code-on-human-rights-occupational-safety-data.pdf) [and Occupational Health and Safety](https://media-live2.prod.scw.jungheinrichcloud.com/resource/blob/1405308/48a280476b2f6fa0bc7312acf8e74cf4/code-on-human-rights-occupational-safety-data.pdf), the adoption of a Group guideline on Corporate Due Diligence, and the publication of a [Policy Statement to Respect the Human Rights](https://media-live2.prod.scw.jungheinrichcloud.com/resource/blob/1405304/8b92c94f0ec750ed80787d0c4cde0326/policy-statement-to-respect-the-human-rights-data.pdf), Jungheinrich met further requirements of the Act on Corporate Due Diligence in Supply Chains (LkSG) in the reporting year. The Human Rights Council established in 2022 is a decisive sign of the Group's attitude with regards to respecting human rights.\n\nJungheinrich performs appropriate risk analyses relating to its human rights and environmental obligations in its own business and at direct suppliers at least once a year to recognise, evaluate and prevent potential or actual negative impacts. The priority human rights and environmental risks for Jungheinrich determined by the risk analyses are presented in the following:\n\n#### Own business\n\n- Appropriate pay, fair working conditions and working hours: Jungheinrich complies with the applicable minimum wages around the world. An analysis of the production locations also confirmed that Jungheinrich pays a living wage at least at these locations. Jungheinrich also complies with statutory regulations on working hours. Overtime may occasionally be required during working hours. However, this does not represent a systematic or structural deviation but rather one-off cases.\n- Discrimination: Jungheinrich employs more than 21,000 people worldwide. There may therefore be individual cases of discrimination within the workforce. However, Jungheinrich does not systematically or structurally discriminate against people or groups of people.\n- Occupational health and safety: Jungheinrich creates value through production, sales and after-sales services (maintenance, repair and spare parts service). In production and the after-sales service in particular, work safety risks can be higher, which is why EHS-related topics [ [page](#page-72-0) 71 ] are given high priority.\n- Freedom of association: Jungheinrich operates worldwide. This includes countries where the freedom of association is legally restricted.\n\n#### Direct suppliers\n\nThe risk analyses for direct suppliers were performed according to product groups. The following product groups with higher abstract human rights risks were identified: logistics, third-party assembly services, event marketing, facility management, printed circuit boards. The following abstract risks were determined and prioritised for these product groups:\n\n- Occupational health and safety: There is a latent risk in the field of work safety in particular when it comes to Jungheinrich suppliers' labour-intensive value creation and services. Depending on the precautions taken by the suppliers, varying levels of remaining occupational health and safety risks cannot be excluded.\n- Forced labour and slavery: Jungheinrich suppliers operate in different cultural, social, economic and political contexts around the world. This can result in varying levels of dependence on the part of the employees.\n- Discrimination: Jungheinrich's suppliers are at different stages of development when it comes to managing equal opportunities and operate in different cultural contexts. They have many employees and there may be discrimination in individual cases.\n\nIn the coming financial years, Jungheinrich will implement further measures relating to its human rights due diligence obligations, including:\n\n- annual publication of a Jungheinrich Human Rights Declaration\n- expanding and embedding the management approach\n- checking the efficacy of the measures and procedures introduced\n- creating a global organisational structure in the Group to implement the measures\n- raising awareness among Group employees, suppliers, customers and business partners regarding human rights and how to handle human rights issues in business practices\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-78-0\"></span>About Jungheinrich\n\nJungheinrich sees fulfilling its human rights due diligence obligations as an ongoing process. Regulatory developments, such as the LkSG and the planned EU Directive on human rights due diligence obligations will therefore be translated into appropriate internal measures.\n\n#### Establishing sustainable procurement\n\nSustainable procurement is an integral part of the Jungheinrich sustainability strategy. Including suppliers within a holistic supplier management process is of vital importance and contributes to stability of supply. The careful selection of suppliers that share Jungheinrich's approach to sustainability is an important prerequisite for sustainable supplier management. Potential suppliers must fulfil uniform approval criteria throughout the Group. The most important aspects are the Supplier Code of Conduct, the Supplier Manual and the sustainability self-assessments. The Supplier Manual was updated in the 2023 financial year. Suppliers are regularly classified for risk according to economic, ecological and social criteria. Appropriate measures are taken depending on the risk class.\n\nThe integration of sustainable procurement in internal processes and at suppliers, including the implementation of LkSG requirements, was continued in 2023. The management system for sustainable procurement was expanded to include preventative and remedial action. The preventative measures form part of a four-step model that stretches from the Supplier Code of Conduct to potentially on-site social audits. An internal workflow was designed for remedial action which enables a swift and appropriate response to any incident in Jungheinrich's supply chains.\n\nIn order to increase key-supplier transparency, they now undergo a sustainability self-assessment, which is carried out via the [Integrity Next](https://www.integritynext.com) platform. Currently, more than 750 of the potential approximately 1,500 key suppliers are participating, which equates to 74 per cent of the Group purchasing volume 1 . The management system was expanded to the Jungheinrich companies Profishop AG & Co. KG, Profishop AG, Profishop GmbH and MIAS Group in 2023 in order to formalise their sustainable procurement processes further. The sustainability self-assessment comprises the following topics:\n\n- anti-corruption and anti-bribery\n- occupational safety\n- energy management\n- conflicts of interest\n- human and labour rights\n- environmental protection\n- responsibility in the supply chains\n\nThe sustainability self-assessments form the basis for calculating the sustainable spend key figure. This figure was introduced in 2021 with the aim of classifying at least 80 per cent of the relevant purchasing volume as sustainable by 2025. Sustainable spend stood at 75 per cent in 2023 (2022: approximately 70 per cent).\n\nFuture sustainable procurement measures include procurement training for buyers and suppliers, direct supplier risk analysis, expansion of sustainability self-assessments and audits, and focussing on reducing CO2e emissions in the supply chains.\n\n#### SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODELS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INITIATIVE\n\nAs a sustainability enabler, Jungheinrich wants to support its stakeholders in achieving their sustainability targets and considers sustainability to be an opportunity. The company's sustainable orientation releases potential to increase the company's innovativeness, expand the portfolio of solutions and generate competitive advantages, for example. Sustainable business models, products and services are a decisive driver for Jungheinrich, as they support customers in particular in achieving their sustainability and climate targets and contribute to customer retention. Product quality and safety are also vital factors when it comes to customer satisfaction.\n\n#### Sustainability as a growth driver\n\nJungheinrich offers a broad range of products that support customers in their sustainability efforts:\n\n- Since March 2023, all of the trucks manufactured have been battery-powered. However, the electric ratio was almost 100 per cent in previous years, too.\n- The company offers lithium-ion solutions through its own research, development and production capacities. These provide customers with fully networked systems where the battery, charger and truck all perfectly complement one another.\n\n<sup>1</sup> Due to changes in business relationships, these figures are only a snapshot at a given point in time; they may fluctuate over time.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-79-0\"></span>About Jungheinrich\n\n- The POWERLiNE truck series, launched in 2022, consists of CO2e-neutral 1 lithium-ion trucks manufactured with renewable electricity and that consume around 20 per cent less energy during daily operation in comparison with lead-acid trucks.\n- A CO2 e-neutral after-sales 2 service had been introduced in five countries by the end of 2023, with plans to expand to more countries.\n- Jungheinrich operates two refurbishment plants and other refurbishment facilities for used trucks, and offers customers truck rental models. These actions support a circular economy.\n- The company enables improvements in energy efficiency and warehouse and material flow optimisation with its digitalisation and automation solutions and targeted customer consulting.\n- Jungheinrich's 360-degree protection programme also offers solutions and assistance systems that focus on customer safety.\n\nJungheinrich is also applying its energy skills to new application areas outside of warehouse logistics. For instance, Jungheinrich offers customised consulting and drive train components under the name Powertrain Solutions, from the engine to the control units and including lithium-ion batteries and battery chargers, for the agricultural and machine construction sectors.\n\n#### Product quality and customer safety\n\nJungheinrich has established ISO 9001 quality management systems in the majority of its plants in Germany and abroad in order to guarantee the quality of its products and customer safety. The Group's central quality organisation standardises processes and establishes uniform standards for suppliers. This guarantees that the product materials procured meet the highest quality standards. Active participation in standardisation processes and associations is important to Jungheinrich, as standards promote innovation through sustainable product optimisation and create the foundation for increasing the products' safety and reliability further. Standards also promote legal certainty, facilitate export and create competitive equality. Taking these aspects into consideration, Jungheinrich actively participates in these processes by sending experts to the standardisation and association process committees. These include DIN standardisation committees (German Institute for Standardisation), European standardisation bodies (CEN/CENELEC), and bodies of the globally active International Organization of Standardization (ISO), VDI working groups (Verein Deutscher Ingenieure), Verband Deutscher Maschinen- und Anlagenbau (VDMA) committees, and European Materials Handling Federation (FEM) committees. Jungheinrich also particularly observes competition law regulations when participating in standardisation processes and associations.\n\nJungheinrich's tight service network plays a decisive role when it comes to customer safety. It enables direct consultation on site and a fast response to product disruptions. The majority of the service reports prepared by after-sales service technicians is analysed with system support. Based on this data, measures are derived to improve safety and reduce product downtimes. In the event of product incidents, appropriate processes including direct contact are initiated.\n\n<sup>1</sup> This is achieved by reducing emissions during the manufacturing processes and investing in certified compensation projects to offset CO2 e emissions. The greenhouse gas emissions for the trucks up until the point of delivery is calculated using recurring life cycle assessments based on DIN EN ISO 14040 specifications.

In order to achieve these targets, the EU Commission created an action plan to redirect capital flows to a more sustainable economy. One material component of this action plan is the EU Taxonomy Regulation, which provides a classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities. For this purpose, economic activities are evaluated according to their contribution to one of the six environmental objectives.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements (see Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and Article 8 and Article 10 of the Delegated Act on reporting obligations under Article 8), the following section contains the required disclosures according to the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Here, amongst other figures, Jungheinrich presents the taxonomy-aligned, taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-non-eligible shares of Group turnover (turnover), as well as capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx) for the first and second environmental objectives of the Climate Delegated Act for the 2023 financial year.\n\n#### Environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy Regulation\n\nImage /page/80/Figure/13 description: The image is a circular diagram illustrating a cycle of environmental actions. The cycle is numbered from 1 to 6, with each number representing a different action. 1 is Climate Change Mitigation, 2 is Climate Change Adaptation, 3 is Sustainable Use and Protection of Water and Marine Resources, 4 is Transition to a Circular Economy, 5 is Pollution Prevention and Control, and 6 is Protection and Restoration of Biodiversity and Eco-systems. The cycle is connected by a yellow arrow, indicating the flow of actions.\n\nFor the third to sixth environmental objectives of the Environment Delegated Act, disclosures relate to the taxonomyeligible and taxonomy-non-eligible shares of Group turnover (turnover), as well as CapEx and OpEx. The key figures are differentiated according to the relevant economic activities.\n\n#### IMPLEMENTATION OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\nJungheinrich's business model as a solutions provider for intralogistics is relevant to the environmental objectives \"Climate Change Mitigation\" and \"Transition to a Circular Economy\". The manufacture of electric material handling equipment can contribute to climate change mitigation. Their repair and refurbishment as well as the rental and lease business can support the transition to a circular economy. The substantial contribution made to climate change mitigation can be proven for several lithium-ion battery-powered trucks.\n\nIn order to report on the taxonomy-aligned and taxonomyeligible economic activities in the 2023 financial year, Jungheinrich has taken the following steps:\n\n- established a project team, including experts from Corporate Controlling, Corporate Sustainability and Health & Safety, to implement the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, support the units to the fullest extent possible, and consolidate and verify the reported data\n- reviewed business activities and identified taxonomyeligible economic activities\n- evaluated taxonomy alignment of taxonomy-eligible economic activities and the associated turnover, CapEx and OpEx at central and decentral levels\n- performed a test run for the first half of 2023 to optimise the Group-wide implementation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and to try out the initial application of the Environment Delegated Act\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Assessment of taxonomy-eligible economic activities\n\nEconomic activities that are described in the Climate Delegated Act or Environment Delegated Act are taxonomyeligible. Jungheinrich examined relevant, taxonomy-eligible economic activities for machine and plant construction and discovered that the Group can make substantial contributions in particular to climate change mitigation and a circular economy. The taxonomy-eligible activities identified by Jungheinrich for environmental objective 1 are also taxonomy-eligible for environmental objective 2 due to the description of the activity. However, as no turnover from enabling activities and no separate CapEx or OpEx exist that specifically contribute to adapting to climate change, Jungheinrich has assigned the corresponding taxonomyeligible economic activities to the \"Climate Change Mitigation\" environmental objective. Economic activity 7.2. from environmental objective 1 is also taxonomy-eligible for environmental objective 4. This is assigned to the \"Climate Change Mitigation\" environmental objective as it does not contribute to a circular economy. Beyond this, Jungheinrich did not identify any taxonomy-eligible economic activities for the other environmental objectives.\n\n#### Taxonomy-eligible economic activities \"Climate Change Mitigation\"

The description of this activity in the Climate Delegated Act contains no clear definition of the term low carbon technologies and is therefore open to interpretation. Jungheinrich pools machine construction technologies in this economic activity, among other things, that aim to substantially lower direct greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 emissions) in other economic sectors:\n\n- Jungheinrich's electric material handling equipment makes a contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in logistics, retail and wholesale, among other sectors. This also encompasses mobile robots. Mobile robots include automated guided vehicles and autonomous mobile robots that are battery-powered.\n- Jungheinrich provides electric power train technology for the manufacture of zero-emission vehicles, particularly in the agricultural and machine construction industries. The use of electrified trucks results in lower greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWith the introduction of the Environment Delegated Act, Jungheinrich's activities in the field of circular economy became [ [page](#page-69-0) 68 ] taxonomy-eligible for the first time. These relate to the after-sales service, which extends the useful life of the products sold through repair and maintenance. The industrial refurbishment of used material handling equipment and the subsequent sale also lead to a longer service life and an increase in the use of recycled components. The truck rental models ensure that ownership rights to resources and materials remain with Jungheinrich and thus the rest of the material handling equipment's life cycle can be monitored and managed. Due to the new regulatory requirements, Jungheinrich will report the sale of used trucks under economic activity 5.4. and the rental and lease business under 5.5. of environmental objective 4 from the financial year 2023. These activities had previously been reported under economic activity 3.6. in environmental objective 1. From the reporting year, the acquisition and operation of after-sales service vehicles, which are necessary for performing repair services, will be reported under economic activity 5.1. of environmental objective 4. This was previously reported under economic activity 6.5. in environmental objective 1.\n\n#### Assessment of taxonomy-aligned economic activities\n\nFollowing the identification of taxonomy-eligible economic activities, it was examined whether they fulfilled the requirements pursuant to Article 3 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. In accordance with the requirements for the 2023 financial year, the review related to the \"Climate Change Mitigation\" environmental objective. An economic activity is considered taxonomy-aligned if\n\n- 1. it complies with the technical screening criteria for a substantial contribution to the \"Climate Change Mitigation\" environmental objective,\n- 2. it complies with the technical screening criteria for preventing substantial harm to the other environmental objectives (also known as Do No Significant Harm [DNSH] criteria), 3. guarantees the minimum safeguards.\n\nAs all of the criteria mentioned in Article 3 must be met pursuant to the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the examination is over as soon as one criterion is not met. The compliance with minimum safeguards was reviewed centrally. The DNSH criteria outlined in Annex A, B and D of the Climate Delegated Act were evaluated at the level of the locations relevant to the economic activity. The review of the substantial contribution, the specific DNSH criteria and the DNSH criteria in Annex C was performed at product level.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Compliance with minimum safeguards\n\nJungheinrich must ensure that minimum safeguards are adhered to in order to achieve taxonomy alignment. This requires processes to be implemented both within the company and in the value chain that ensure compliance with due diligence obligations that relate to the following issues: human rights, including labour and consumer rights, (anti-) corruption and bribery, taxation as well as fair competition. As part of the analysis of compliance with minimum safeguards, the criteria for each topic were analysed together with the parties responsible in the various areas.\n\nIn the [Policy Statement to Respect the Human Rights](https://media-live2.prod.scw.jungheinrichcloud.com/resource/blob/1405304/8b92c94f0ec750ed80787d0c4cde0326/policy-statement-to-respect-the-human-rights-data.pdf) Jungheinrich acknowledges the minimum safeguard standards set out in Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UNGP, the OECP Guidelines for Multinational Business and the ILO core labour standards. The processes for complying with human rights due diligence obligations are described in the Declaration of Principle on Respecting Human Rights.\n\nComplying with compliance regulations is important to the company and its committees. Jungheinrich has a CMS that ensures that legal provisions and corporate guidelines are complied with. This system undergoes continual development [ [page](#page-75-0) 74 ]. The development focusses on the prevention and discovery of corruption and compliance with applicable competition as well as tax laws and regulations. Corruption, antitrust, tax and other risks are integrated into the Group risk management system. Jungheinrich trains employees and managers according to target groups on anti-corruption, antitrust and tax law.\n\nThe analysis shows that Jungheinrich has implemented appropriate processes for complying with minimum safeguards on human rights, (anti-)corruption and bribery, taxation as well as fair competition, and that there have been no serious violations that suggest deficient procedures. Jungheinrich therefore meets the minimum safeguards requirements pursuant to Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\n#### Compliance with technical screening criteria\n\nCompliance with the technical screening criteria for a substantial contribution to the \"Climate Change Mitigation\" environmental objective and the avoidance of significant harm to other environmental objectives is based on the Climate Delegated Act.\n\nThe first step involves reviewing the alignment of the economic activity related to the development and manufacture of taxonomy-eligible products. In this context, the production of lithium-ion batteries (economic activity 3.4.) and electric material handling equipment (economic activity 3.6.) is relevant for Jungheinrich.\n\nJungheinrich fulfils the substantial contribution to economic activity 3.4. The lithium-ion batteries manufactured, which partly consist of secondary raw materials, are used in material handling equipment and lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions in intralogistics.\n\nTo attain the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation in economic activity 3.6., the Climate Delegated Act requires the following: Low carbon technologies must be proven to substantially reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions in other economic sectors. This must be in comparison with best performing alternative technologies available on the market. The reduction is considered substantial by Jungheinrich if greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by at least 5 per cent. Lead-acid batteries are a common means of electrochemical energy storage and are considered a mature technology. Lithium-ion batteries in contrast are gaining in importance and are primarily used in electric vehicles. They have a very high energy density and a longer service life than lead-acid batteries. Jungheinrich therefore views lead-acid batteries as the best performing alternative technology available on the market to lithium-ion batteries. A comparison of both battery systems performed internally using product life cycle assessments showed that the lithium-ion batteries are a low carbon alternative to lead-acid batteries as they emit less carbon during the use phase. All battery-powered material handling equipment fitted with a lithium-ion battery therefore aims to substantially reduce life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions. In order to prove the savings, Jungheinrich prepared product carbon footprints for 19 truck series in accordance with ISO 14067 and had the assessments audited externally [ [page](#page-68-0) 67 ]. The analyses compare the life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of lithium-ion trucks with lead-acid trucks. The results show that lithium-ion trucks emit 15 per cent less greenhouse gases during their life cycle. The products in the series analysed therefore make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout Jungheinrich\n\nThe next step will be examining the DNSH criteria for economic activities 3.4. and 3.6. To prevent significant harm to environmental objective 2, \"Climate Change Adaptation\", a climate risk and vulnerability assessment is required for all taxonomy-eligible activities in the Climate Delegated Act. These assessments were performed for all relevant locations to identify which economic activities could be affected by physical climate risks [ [page 65](#page-66-0) ]. The climate hazards defined in the Climate Delegated Act are taken into account. If a climate hazard is relevant for a particular location, a risk analysis is performed for the actual hazard based on historical data as well as for the future development. These are based on an optimistic and pessimistic IPCC scenario to 2050. An assessment of the regional natural hazards is performed for key suppliers. The analyses are performed with prepared climate risk data based on IPCC reports from an external software and data provider. Adaptation solutions for minimising risks are derived and implemented if necessary based on the findings of the risk analysis. Jungheinrich thus fulfils the DNSH criteria of environmental objective 2 for certain products for economic activities 3.4. and 3.6.\n\nThe DNSH criteria for environmental objective 3 define requirements for the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources. The requirements in Annex B of the Climate Delegated Act must be complied with for economic activities 3.4. and 3.6. Environmental management systems in line with ISO 14001 have been established at the relevant plants, and a Group-wide guideline outlines operating water and effluent management. Environmental impacts on water are regularly evaluated and remedial action is taken if necessary. Jungheinrich also strives to continually reduce water consumption. The analysis shows that Jungheinrich fulfils the DNSH criteria of environmental objective 3 for economic activities 3.4. and 3.6.\n\nThe review of DNSH criteria for environmental objective 4 \"Transition to a Circular Economy\" is performed at the level of economic activities 3.4. and 3.6. Measures to promote a circular economy are required, if applicable. Internally predetermined criteria relating to high durability, recyclability and easy disassembly apply for the development of lithium-ion batteries and electric material handling equipment. The products are also manufactured from secondary raw materials. The other criteria do not apply to the products. In line with internal guidelines, the Group strives to recycle waste to the fullest extent possible in the production process. Critical materials, defined by Jungheinrich in this context as substances of especially high concern pursuant to REACH Regulation, can be traced back over the product life cycle via a program. Jungheinrich implements the applicable measures for promoting a circular economy for economic activities 3.4. and 3.6. and thus fulfils the DNSH criteria for environmental objective 4.\n\nThe review of DNSH criteria for environmental objective 5 \"Pollution Prevention and Control\" pursuant to Annex C of the Climate Delegated Act is performed at the level of economic activities 3.4. and 3.6. The requirements relate to compliance with European chemical regulations and guidelines. Jungheinrich fulfils the legal requirements and takes into account prohibitions, restrictions, and declaration obligations for regulated hazardous substances through established processes for material compliance [ [page 67](#page-68-0) ]. In the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries, Jungheinrich adheres to the applicable European sustainability rules for bringing batteries onto the market. Group-wide hazardous substance management also applies to hazardous substances that are not prohibited according to the applicable legislation. Jungheinrich documents the use of such substances and follows rules regarding approval for hazardous substances and substitution checks. According to internal assessments, no considerable exposure risk for the user or environment results from the use of the substances mentioned. Overall, Jungheinrich fulfils the requirements to prevent significant harm to the fifth environmental objective for economic activities 3.4. and 3.6.\n\nThe criteria for preventing significant harm to environmental objective 6 \"Protection and Restoration of Biodiversity and Ecosystems\" are laid out in Annex D to the Climate Delegated Act. It remains to be examined whether economic activities 3.4. and 3.6. harbour considerable risk to sensitive biodiverse areas. For this purpose, areas around the plants are identified and potential impacts from the economic activities are defined. The likelihood of a significant impact on biodiversity was then qualitatively assessed, and no material risks were identified. Jungheinrich also performs environmental impact assessments or comparable assessments, if necessary. The analysis shows that Jungheinrich does no significant harm to environmental objective 6 and thus fulfils the corresponding DNSH criteria for economic activities 3.4. and 3.6.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout Jungheinrich\n\nThe taxonomy alignment assessment for the other economic activities, not directly associated with the development and manufacture of taxonomy-eligible products, was done separately.\n\nJungheinrich leased and used company cars in the 2023 financial year (economic activity 6.5.). The company classes this activity as a purchase of a taxonomy-eligible product from a third party. The alignment assessment must therefore be carried out by the third party. The supplier was either not able to provide proof of the taxonomy alignment of this activity or the vehicles are not taxonomy-aligned. This means that economic activity 6.5. is not taxonomy-aligned in the 2023 financial year.\n\nIn the reporting year, Jungheinrich opened a solar park on the Group headquarter's car park with 630 photovoltaic modules (economic activity 7.6.) and 52 e-charging points (economic activity 7.4.). In addition, photovoltaic facilities and e-charging points have been installed at further locations. To achieve taxonomy alignment, the DNSH criteria of environmental objective 2 must be met. A climate risk and vulnerability assessment was performed for the Group headquarters and the other locations which resulted in no high climate risks being discovered for either location [ [page](#page-66-0) 65 ]. Thus, significant harm to environmental objective 2 was prevented and the activities were taxonomy-aligned, taking into account the minimum safeguards analysis in the 2023 financial year.\n\nJungheinrich leases and operates buildings (economic activity 7.7.). The majority of the buildings do not fulfil overall energy efficiency requirements or there is insufficient evidence to check the technical screening criteria. One building occupied by the Swedish sales unit does fulfil the criteria for a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. In order to prevent significant harm to environmental objective 2, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment was performed. No high climate risks were discovered for the location. The building is thus taxonomyaligned, taking into account the minimum safeguards analysis in 2023.\n\nJungheinrich rents space in a computing centre for data processing purposes (economic activity 8.1.). There is currently no evidence that the landlord implements the processes required by the Climate Delegated Act. Accordingly, the technical screening criteria cannot be considered fulfilled, and economic activity 8.1 is reported as not taxonomy-aligned in the 2023 financial year.\n\nOther economic activities were not checked for taxonomy alignment, due to the cost-benefit aspects.\n\n#### Key performance indicators pursuant to EU Taxonomy Regulation\n\nThe key performance indicators (KPI) for the 2023 financial year include turnover, CapEx and OpEx. The definition of the KPI is in line with Annex 1 of the Delegated Act to the Reporting Obligations pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. The share of turnover generated from products or services associated with environmentally sustainable (taxonomy-aligned) economic activities must be provided for the economic activities of the Climate Delegated Act's objectives. The share of CapEx and OpEx in connection with assets or processes that are linked to environmentally sustainable economic activities must also be reported. The share of turnover, CapEx and OpEx that is taxonomy-eligible is reported among the economic activities of the Environmental Delegated Act's objectives. This is a new requirement in comparison with the previous reporting period and Jungheinrich is reporting it for the first time. The individual turnover, CapEx and OpEx sums are each assigned to a specific environmental objective in order to exclude duplication. Furthermore, double counting of turnover, CapEx and OpEx is prevented between the defined economic activities by applying appropriate demarcation logic when the data is recorded at the level of the units.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Key performance indicators for the 2023 financial year\n\nThe share of taxonomy-aligned turnover amounted to 9 per cent. Jungheinrich is reporting taxonomy-aligned turnover for the first time because the technical screening criteria and the minimum safeguards for products in economic activities 3.4. and 3.6. of environmental objective 1 were adhered to in the reporting year. At €483,713 thousand, the majority of the taxonomy-aligned turnover came from electric trucks with lithium-ion batteries (economic activity 3.6.) in the new business of the \"Intralogistics\" segment. Determining whether turnover from these activities is taxonomy-aligned was for a small number of companies based on incoming orders for trucks with lithium-ion batteries. The share of taxonomy-eligible turnover was 72 per cent (2022: 47 per cent). The increase is due to the application of the environmental objective \"Transition to a Circular Economy\". Due to Jungheinrich's business model, the repair and refurbishment of products (economic activity 5.1.), the sale of used products (economic activity 5.4.) and the rental and lease business (economic activity 5.5.) are relevant. The denominator of the turnover KPI is based on consolidated net turnover pursuant to IAS 1.82(a). Further details can be found in the consolidated statement of profit or loss [ [pages](#page-100-0) 99, [104](#page-105-0) and [122](#page-123-0) ].\n\nThe share of taxonomy-aligned CapEx amounted to 2 per cent. The first-time reporting of taxonomy-aligned CapEx is due to capital expenditure related to taxonomy-aligned economic activities of the \"Climate Change Mitigation\" objective. Of the €3,687 thousand of taxonomy-aligned CapEx in connection with the manufacture and development of trucks with lithium-ion batteries (economic activity 3.6.), €1,680 thousand is attributable to property, plant and equipment and €1,960 thousand to capitalised development costs. The remainder is attributable to licences. €5,645 thousand of CapEx was related to the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries (economic activity 3.4.). €757 thousand was attributable to property, plant and equipment and €4,888 thousand to capitalised development costs. The calculation of taxonomy-aligned CapEx for economic activity 3.6. was based on the proportion of the manufacture of material handling equipment with lithium-ion batteries at one plant. For the economic activities 7.4., 7.6. and 7.7. the taxonomy-aligned CapEx of €723 thousand, €1,689 thousand and €270 thousand were each attributable to additions to property, plant and equipment. The share of taxonomyeligible CapEx amounted to 22 per cent (2022: 13 per cent). The increase can be partially explained by improvements in the data collected for acquired buildings (economic activity 7.7.). The CapEx KPI denominator represents the sum of the additions to intangible assets [ [page](#page-129-0) 128 ] and property, plant and equipment [ [page](#page-133-0) 132 ] as presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe share of taxonomy-aligned OpEx amounted to 3 per cent. The taxonomy-aligned OpEx, reported for the first time, in the amount of €5,916 thousand, included €1,720 thousand related to research and development costs for taxonomy-aligned products in the economic activities 3.4. and 3.6., and €4,196 thousand to maintenance costs for their manufacture. The calculation of taxonomy-aligned OpEx for economic activity 3.6. was based on the proportion of the manufacture of material handling equipment with lithium-ion batteries at one plant. The share of taxonomy-eligible OpEx amounts to 66 per cent (2022: 49 per cent). This increase is due to the \"Transition to a Circular Economy\" environmental objective being taken into account and the detailed recording of data related to the maintenance of buildings (economic activity 7.7.). The OpEx KPI denominator consists of direct, non-capitalised expenses related to research and development as presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements pursuant to IAS 38.126 [ [page](#page-131-0) 130 ] as well as expenses for short-term leases pursuant to IFRS 16 as presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements [ [page](#page-135-0) 134 ]. Finally, expenses from building renovation measures, maintenance and repairs, and other direct expenses for the ongoing maintenance of property, plant and equipment form part of the denominator.\n\nSince Jungheinrich does not perform any of the activities in connection with natural gas or nuclear power (activities 4.26-4.31) pursuant to the notification form below, the company does not use the other notification forms from the supplemental Delegated Act for activities in certain energy sectors.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Template: Proportion of turnover from products or services associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities – disclosure covering year 2023\n\n| Financial year 2023                                                                                           |                     | 2023         |                                          | Substantial Contribution Criteria |                                  |                      |                      |                      |                      | DNSH criteria<br>(\"Does Not Significantly Harm\") |                                   |            |                |                       |                   |                            |                                                                                                         |                                          |                                              |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|----------------|-----------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Economic Activities (1)                                                                                       | Code(s) (2)         | Turnover (3) | Proportion of Turnover,<br>year 2023 (4) | Climate Change<br>Mitigation (5)  | Climate Change<br>Adaptation (6) | Water (7)            | Pollution (8)        | Circular Economy (9) | Biodiversity (10)    | Climate Change<br>Mitigation (11)                | Climate Change<br>Adaptation (12) | Water (13) | Pollution (14) | Circular Economy (15) | Biodiversity (16) | Minimum<br>Safeguards (17) | Proportion of<br>Taxonomy<br>aligned (A.1.)<br>or<br>-eligible (A.2.)<br>turnover,<br>year 2022<br>(18) | Category<br>enabling<br>activity<br>(19) | Category<br>transitional<br>activity<br>(20) |\n|                                                                                                               |                     | € thousand   | %                                        | Y; N;<br>EL;<br>N/EL              | Y; N;<br>EL;<br>N/EL             | Y; N;<br>EL;<br>N/EL | Y; N;<br>EL;<br>N/EL | Y; N;<br>EL;<br>N/EL | Y; N;<br>EL;<br>N/EL | Y/N                                              | Y/N                               | Y/N        | Y/N            | Y/N                   | Y/N               | Y/N                        | %                                                                                                       | E                                        | T                                            |\n| A.

PRACTITIONER'S REPORT ON A LIMITED ASSURANCE ENGAGEMENT ON NON-FINANCIAL REPORTING 1\n\nTo Jungheinrich Aktiengesellschaft, Hamburg\n\nWe have performed a limited assurance engagement on the combined separate non-financial report of Jungheinrich Aktiengesellschaft, Hamburg, (hereinafter the \"Company\") for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2023 (hereinafter the \"Combined Separate Non-financial Report\").\n\nNot subject to our assurance engagement are the external sources of documentation or expert opinions mentioned in the Combined Separate Non-financial Report.\n\n#### Responsibility of the Executive Directors\n\nThe executive directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the Combined Separate Non-financial Report in accordance with §§ (Articles) 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB (\"Handelsgesetzbuch\": \"German Commercial Code\") and Article 8 of REGULATION (EU) 2020/852 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 18. June 2020 on establishing a framework to facilitate sustainable investment and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereinafter the \"EU Taxonomy Regulation\") and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder, as well as for\n\nmaking their own interpretation of the wording and terms contained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder, as set out in section EU Taxonomy Regulation of the Combined Separate Non-financial Report.\n\nThis responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate non-financial reporting methods and making assumptions and estimates about individual non-financial disclosures of the Group that are reasonable in the circumstances. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for such internal controls as the executive directors consider necessary to enable the preparation of a Combined Separate Non-financial Report that is free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published in every case. Therefore, the executive directors have disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder in section EU Taxonomy Regulation of the Combined Separate Non-financial Report. They are responsible for the defensibility of this interpretation. Due to the immanent risk that indeterminate legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties.\n\n#### Audit Firm's Independence and Quality Management\n\nWe have complied with the German professional provisions regarding independence as well as other ethical requirements.\n\nOur audit firm applies the national legal requirements and professional standards – in particular the Professional Code for German Public Auditors and German Chartered Auditors (\"Berufssatzung für Wirtschaftsprüfer und vereidigte Buchprüfer\": \"BS WP/vBP\") as well as the Standard on Quality Management 1 published by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany; IDW): Requirements to quality management for audit firms (IDW Qualitätsmanagementstandard 1: Anforderungen an das Qualitätsmanagement in der Wirtschaftsprüferpraxis – IDW QMS 1 (09.2022)), which requires the audit firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management that complies with the applicable legal requirements and professional standards.\n\n#### Responsibility of the Assurance Practitioner\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion with limited assurance on the Combined Separate Non-financial Report based on our assurance engagement.\n\nWe conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan and\n\n<sup>1</sup> PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH has performed a limited assurance engagement on the German version of the combined separate non-financial report and issued an independent practitioner's report in German language, which is authoritative. The following text is a translation of the independent practitioner's report.\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\nIndependent auditor's report\n\nperform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the Company's Combined Separate Non-financial Report, other than the external sources of documentation or expert opinions mentioned in the Combined Separate Non-financial Report, are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder as well as the interpretation by the executive directors disclosed in section EU Taxonomy Regulation of the Combined Separate Non-financial Report.\n\nIn a limited assurance engagement the procedures performed are less extensive than in a reasonable assurance engagement, and accordingly a substantially lower level of assurance is obtained. The selection of the assurance procedures is subject to the professional judgement of the assurance practitioner.\n\nIn the course of our assurance engagement, we have, amongst other things, performed the following assurance procedures and other activities:\n\n- Gain an understanding of the structure of the Group's sustainability organisation and stakeholder engagement\n- Inquiries of the executive directors and relevant employees involved in the preparation of the Combined Separate Non-financial Report about the preparation process, about the internal control system relating to this process and about disclosures in the Combined Separate Non-financial Report\n- Identification of likely risks of material misstatement in the Combined Separate Non-financial Report\n- Analytical procedures on selected disclosures in the Combined Separate Non-financial Report\n- Reconciliation of selected disclosures with the corresponding data in the consolidated financial statements and group management report\n- Evaluation of the presentation of the Combined Separate Non-financial Report\n- Evaluation of the process to identify taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic activities and the corresponding disclosures in the Combined Separate Nonfinancial Report\n- Inquiries on the relevance of climate-risks\n- Assessment of CO2 compensation certificates solely in terms of their existence, but not in terms of their effect\n\nIn determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive directors are required to interpret undefined legal terms. Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties.\n\n#### Assurance Opinion\n\nBased on the assurance procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Combined Separate Non-financial Report of the Company for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2023 is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with §§ 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder as well as the interpretation by the executive directors disclosed in section EU Taxonomy Regulation of the Combined Separate Non-financial Report.\n\nWe do not express an assurance opinion on the external sources of documentation or expert opinions mentioned in the Combined Separate Non-financial Report.\n\n#### Restriction of Use\n\nWe draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was conducted for the Company's purposes and that the report is intended solely to inform the Company about the result of the assurance engagement. Consequently, it may not be suitable for any other purpose than the aforementioned. Accordingly, the report is not intended to be used by third parties for making (financial) decisions based on it. Our responsibility is to the Company. We do not accept any responsibility to third parties. Our assurance opinion is not modified in this respect.\n\nCologne, 12 March 2024\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nTheres Schäfer ppa.

Purpose of the company\n\nThe Jungheinrich corporation (Jungheinrich AG) is headquartered at Friedrich-Ebert-Damm 129 in Hamburg (Germany) and is registered with the commercial register kept at the Hamburg District court under HRB 44885.\n\nJungheinrich is one of the world's leading solutions providers for the intralogistics sector. With a comprehensive portfolio of material handling equipment, automated systems and services, Jungheinrich is able to offer customers solutions to the challenges posed by Industry 4.0.\n\nThe integrated business model encompasses the development, production and sale of new material handling equipment and the planning and realisation of automation projects, the short-term rental of new and used material handling equipment, the refurbishment and sale of used trucks and after-sales services. Jungheinrich also supplies stacker cranes and load handling equipment. In addition, customers receive their entire factory and office equipment from a single source. In addition to electric engines and drive controls, Jungheinrich also manufactures matching lithium-ion batteries and battery chargers. All trucks have an electric motor drive and almost all are available with a lithium-ion battery. Digital products based on the latest generation of the Jungheinrich Internet of Things platform in the cloud, complement the portfolio. Customers benefit from a comprehensive range of financial services. Jungheinrich's aim is to create sustainable value.\n\nMaterial handling equipment is manufactured at the production plants in Norderstedt, Moosburg, Degernpoint, Landsberg and Lüneburg (all in Germany) as well as at the production plant in Qingpu/Shanghai (China). In addition, the new plant in Chomutov (Czechia) has been manufacturing material handling equipment since 2023.\n\nStacker cranes and load handling equipment are manufactured in plants in Munich (Germany), Gyöngyös (Hungary) and Kunshan (China) and sold under the MIAS brand all over the world.\n\nUsed material handling equipment is refurbished in the used equipment centre in Klipphausen/ Dresden (Germany) and the used equipment plant in Ploiești (Romania).\n\nThe development of digital products is concentrated at the locations in Graz (Austria), Hamburg (Germany) and Madrid (Spain). Services that focus on software and hardware development are located in Zagreb (Croatia).\n\nJungheinrich has established a global direct sales and service network with locations in 42 countries to offer the best-possible customer service. The Jungheinrich Group is also represented in approximately 80 other countries through partner companies. The Group's core market is Europe, where 80 per cent of Group revenue is generated. Of the European revenue, 27 per cent is generated in Germany.\n\nThe distribution of Jungheinrich material handling equipment in North America is carried out by an exclusive distribution partner.\n\nWith the acquisition of Storage Solutions in the reporting year, Jungheinrich is now also covering the US market for warehouse equipment and automation.\n\n#### (2) Accounting principles\n\n#### Fundamentals\n\nJungheinrich AG prepared the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ending on 31 December 2023 in compliance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). All standards and interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee endorsed by the EU and effective as at the balance sheet date were applied. Regulations under commercial law pursuant to Section 315e of the German Commercial Code (HGB) were complementarily taken into account.\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements generally draws on the historical acquisition and manufacturing costs. Certain financial instruments measured at fair value as at the balance sheet date are an exception to this rule. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in euros (€). Unless indicated otherwise, disclosure is in thousands of euros. The statement of profit or loss has been prepared using the cost of sales accounting method.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2023 were approved for publication by the Board of Management on 12 March 2024.\n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Consolidation\n\nSubsidiaries, including structured entities over which Jungheinrich AG, Hamburg, can exercise direct or indirect control, are included in the consolidated financial statements. Control can be exercised if the parent company has control over the subsidiary on the basis of voting rights or other rights, participates in the variable returns and can use its control to influence these returns. Structured entities which are controlled are also included in the scope of consolidation. Structured entities are companies in which the voting rights or comparable rights are not definitive for the determination of control. For example, this is the case if the voting rights only pertain to the administrative responsibilities and the material activities are regulated by way of contractual agreements.\n\nJoint ventures and associated companies are reported using the equity method. A joint venture is a joint arrangement according to which Jungheinrich exercises control together with a partner company, and has rights in the net assets of the investment together with that partner. Associated companies are companies where Jungheinrich AG, Hamburg, has a significant direct or indirect influence on their finance and business policies. A significant influence is said to exist if Jungheinrich holds a share of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting rights.\n\nSubsidiaries, joint ventures and associated companies which are of subordinated importance to the Group and to the presentation of the actual assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss due to their dormancy or minimal business activity are accounted for at fair value.\n\nSubsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements starting from the point in time at which Jungheinrich AG obtains control over the company until the point in time at which control by Jungheinrich AG ends.\n\nThe financial statements of Jungheinrich AG as the parent company and of included subsidiaries that are to be consolidated are prepared using uniform accounting and valuation methods as at the balance sheet date of the parent company.\n\nThe same accounting and valuation methods are used to determine the pro rata shareholders' equity of companies accounted for using the equity method.\n\nBusiness combinations, or in other words, acquisitions of companies and business areas, are accounted for using the acquisition method in compliance with IFRS 3. Accordingly, the consideration transferred at the acquisition date is offset against the net assets measured at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. Transaction costs associated with business combinations are generally recognised in profit or loss. If the consideration transferred includes conditional consideration, the latter is measured at its fair value at the acquisition date. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are also measured at their fair values at the acquisition date. If the acquisition costs are higher than the fair value of the identified net asset, the positive balance is capitalised as goodwill. If the fair value of the acquired net asset is higher than the acquisition costs, the negative balance is recognised as negative goodwill. This is recognised immediately in profit or loss in the year of acquisition. If the fair values of the business combination can only be determined on a preliminary basis until their initial reporting date, the business combination is accounted for on the basis of these preliminary figures. In accordance with IFRS 3.45, initial accounting observes the twelve-month measurement period from the acquisition date. All necessary adjustments to the determined fair values are booked against the preliminary goodwill or negative goodwill within this measurement period. Non-controlling interests in shareholders' equity are reported under \"Non-controlling interests\" in shareholders' equity.\n\nAll receivables and liabilities, expenses and income as well as intragroup results within the scope of consolidation are eliminated within the consolidation.\n\nInvestments in companies accounted for using the equity method are recognised at their acquisition cost upon initial recognition. Changes in the pro rata shareholders' equity of the investments following acquisition are offset against the investments' carrying amount. The Jungheinrich Group's investments in companies accounted for using the equity method include goodwill arising at the time of their acquisition. Since this goodwill is not stated separately, it does not have to be separately tested for impairment pursuant to IAS 36. Instead, the investment's entire carrying amount is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 as soon as there are indications of the recoverable amount dropping below the investment's carrying amount. If the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount of a company accounted for using the equity method, an impairment loss in the amount of the difference is recognised. Reversal of impairment losses in subsequent reporting periods are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Currency translation\n\nCash and cash equivalents, receivables and liabilities in foreign currency in the Group companies' annual financial statements are translated at the exchange rate valid at the balance sheet date and any differences resulting from such translation are recognised in profit and loss.\n\n#### Key exchange rates for the Jungheinrich Group\n\n| Currency | Baseline 1€ | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 | 2023    | 2022    |\n|----------|-------------|------------|------------|---------|---------|\n| CHF      |             | 0.9260     | 0.9847     | 0.9717  | 1.0052  |\n| CNY      |             | 7.8509     | 7.3582     | 7.6591  | 7.0801  |\n| CZK      |             | 24.7240    | 24.1160    | 24.0007 | 24.5603 |\n| GBP      |             | 0.8691     | 0.8869     | 0.8699  | 0.8526  |\n| PLN      |             | 4.3395     | 4.6808     | 4.5421  | 4.6845  |\n| RUB      |             | 98.5052    | 77.9635    | 92.4333 | 74.2259 |\n| USD      |             | 1.1050     | 1.0666     | 1.0816  | 1.0539  |\n\nThe annual financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements are translated according to the functional currency concept. In each case, this is the local currency if the subsidiaries are integrated into the currency area of the country in which they are domiciled as commercially independent entities. As regards the companies of the Jungheinrich Group, the functional currency is the local currency.\n\nTo prepare the consolidated financial statements, assets and liabilities reported in local currency are converted to euros at the mean exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Changes during the year, the items on the statement of profit or loss, and the components of the other comprehensive income are translated at the annual average exchange rate for the financial year. Shareholders' equity is carried at historic exchange rates. Translation differences are recognised in shareholders' equity under \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (expense)\" with no effect on profit or loss until the subsidiary is removed from the scope of consolidation. The respective cumulative translation differences are reversed in profit or loss when Group companies are deconsolidated.\n\n#### Hyperinflation\n\nIf the functional currency of a subsidiary included in the consolidated financial statements is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy, the subsidiary will apply the requirements of IAS 29 \"Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies\" in preparing the annual financial statements.\n\nThe carrying amounts of non-monetary assets and liabilities, equity attributable to shareholders of Jungheinrich AG and all comprehensive income (expense) items will be adjusted to the value applicable on the balance sheet date. Under these circumstances, a general price index is applied that reflects the change in purchasing power.\n\nNon-monetary assets adjusted in accordance with IAS 29 remain subject to review for indications of impairment.\n\nThe gain or loss on net monetary position in the year under review is reported under other financial income (expense).\n\nAll items in the annual financial statement of an included subsidiary whose functional currency is a hyperinflationary economy currency are converted at the rate applicable as at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe impact of inflation on equity is offset against the currency translation effect with no effect on profit or loss and reported as other changes under the item \"currency translation\" in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.\n\nIn the first year for which IAS 29 is applied in the consolidated financial statement, the previous year's figures are not adjusted.\n\nTürkiye was classified as a hyperinflationary economy for the first time in 2022. The annual financial statements of the Turkish sales company, whose functional currency is the Turkish lira, included in the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2023, were prepared using the requirements of IAS 29 and is accounted for at cost. The consumer price index published by the Turkish national statistics office was used to adjust the annual financial statements to the value applicable as at the balance sheet date. As of 31 December 2023 the price index stood at 1,859.38 (31 December 2022: 1,128.45). The loss on net monetary position is reported under other financial income (expense) in 2023 and 2022.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue is recognised after deduction of bonuses, discounts or rebates when control of disposal over the goods or services has been transferred to the customer. In general, this is the case when the delivery has been made or the service has been rendered, when the selling price is fixed or determinable and when the receipt of payment is reasonably certain.\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers, particularly in relation to the sale of material handling equipment and the performance of after-sales services, is recognised in the Jungheinrich Group primarily on the basis of individual contracts. Revenue is recognised at the amount of the contractually agreed consideration as soon as the customer has obtained control of disposal over the goods or uses the services provided. Revenue from the sale of material handling equipment and the sale of spare parts by the after-sales service is generally recognised at a specific point in time. Revenue from the provision of customer services is generally recognised over a period of time. Significant financing components are not included in the contracts with customers as standard market payment targets are agreed as a general rule. A provision is set up for statutory and contractual warranty obligations.\n\nWith regard to automation projects, which are under the control of the ordering party during production and for which the Group has a legal right to payment for the work already performed, including an appropriate margin, Jungheinrich recognises revenue and the cost of sales in accordance with the degree of completion. This means that, for these projects, control is transferred and revenue is recognised over a specific period. The degree of completion results from the relation of the contract-related costs incurred as at the balance sheet date vis-à-vis the estimated total contract-related costs as at the balance sheet date and reflects, according to the management's assessment, the completion progress and the associated transfer of control over the project to the customer to an appropriate extent. If the earnings from a project contract cannot be determined reliably, revenue is only recognised in the amount of the costs incurred that are likely recoverable. The rules for revenue recognition set out above are also applied to the project business of Storage Solutions.\n\nRevenue from financial service transactions is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the contracts if the contract is classified as an \"operating lease\" in the amount of the lease payments. If the contract is deemed to be a \"finance lease\", revenue is recognised in the amount of the fair value of the leased item or the present value of the lease payments attributable to the lessor at the start of the contract, whichever is lower. The interest income is realised over the terms of the contracts using the effective interest method. If a leasing company or bank acts as an intermediary, the sales proceeds received, less the agreed residual values, from concluded sales contracts which contain repurchase obligations and are classified as an \"operating lease\", are recognised under deferred income. They are reversed with an effect on revenue on a straight-line basis over time until the repurchase date contractually agreed with the leasing company/bank. If the contracts are deemed to be \"finance leases\", revenue is recognised in the amount of the fair value of the leased item or the present value of the lease payments attributable to the lessor at the start of the contract, whichever is lower.\n\n#### Product-related expenses\n\nExpenses for advertising and sales promotion, as well as other sales-related expenses are recognised in profit or loss when they are incurred. Freight and dispatch costs are carried under the cost of sales.\n\nProduct-related expenses also include additions to provisions for warranty obligations as well as to provisions for onerous contracts.\n\n#### Research and development costs\n\nResearch costs and development expenses that cannot be capitalised are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nFrom the beginning of production, capitalised development expenditure is reduced by straight-line depreciation over the series production's expected duration.\n\nResearch costs and non-capitalisable development expenditure, as well as amortisation and impairment of capitalised development expenditure, are stated under research and development costs.\n\n#### Government grants\n\nInvestment grants and subsidies are recognised if there is sufficient certainty that Jungheinrich can satisfy the associated conditions and that the benefits are granted. Government grants related to income are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the corresponding claim arises. Government grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the functional costs, in which the expenses being compensated are also reported. Other government grants related to income are recognised as \"other operating income\".\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\nGovernment grants related to assets are deducted when determining the carrying amount of the asset and recognised in profit or loss over the useful life of the depreciable asset using a reduced depreciation amount.\n\nJungheinrich enters into contracts as a lessee for the use of property, plant and equipment, primarily properties and trucks. Government grants for related right-of-use assets recognised in property, plant and equipment are generally recognised as deferred income and distributed over the useful lives of the right-of-use assets. The reversals are recognised in profit or loss as other operating income on a pro rata temporis basis.\n\n#### Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share are calculated based on share of profit or loss attributable to the shareholders of Jungheinrich AG, and this in turn is based on the average number of the respective shares outstanding during a financial year. In the 2023 and 2022 financial years, no equity instruments diluted the earnings per share on the basis of the respective shares issued.\n\n#### Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\n\nPurchased intangible assets are measured at acquisition costs, and reduced by straight-line depreciation over their useful lives insofar as their useful lives are limited. The useful lives used as a basis for software licences are 3 to 8 years. Intangible assets with limited useful lives acquired as part of business combinations primarily relate to customer relationships, technologies and customer contracts. The economic useful lives determined are between 4 and 15 years for these customer relationships and technologies, and between 15 and 20 years for the customer contracts. Usage rights in land acquired in China and Singapore are limited to 50 and 36 years respectively.\n\nDevelopment expenses for material handling equipment, vehicle components and digital products are capitalised if the manufacturing of the developed products is expected to result in an economic benefit for the Jungheinrich Group and is technically feasible and if the costs can be determined reliably. Capitalised development expenditure comprises all costs directly allocable to the development process, including development-related overheads. From the beginning of production, capitalised development expenditure is amortised using the straight-line method over the series production's expected duration, which is normally between 4 and 7 years.\n\nAt initial recognition, goodwill from business combinations is measured at acquisition cost and classified as an intangible asset. Acquisition costs are the positive balance of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the acquired net asset. In subsequent periods, goodwill is accounted for at acquisition cost, less accumulated impairment losses where necessary. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least once a year or whenever there is an indication of a potential reduction in value. If the carrying amount of a cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss in the amount of the difference is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Impairment losses, including impairment losses recognised during the current financial year, will not be reversed in subsequent reporting periods. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the goodwill is allocated needs to be determined. The CGUs are generally identical to the legal sales companies. The MIAS Group is the designated CGU to which goodwill from the acquisition of the MIAS Group has been assigned. Storage Solutions is the designated CGU to which goodwill from the acquisition of Storage Solutions has been assigned. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less selling costs and the value in use. The impairment test is performed on the basis of the determined value in use of a CGU using the discounted cash flow method. As a rule, the cash flows budgeted for in the bottom-up five-year budget, made plausible by Jungheinrich AG management, are used. The parameters set are derived from historical information and mirrored by external sources of information. Forecasts for long-term revenue and returns form the basis for cash flows beyond the budget period. A pre-tax interest rate in line with the conditions prevailing on the market is used as the discount rate. The total cost of capital is based on the risk-free interest rate and risk premiums for equity and debt specific to the Group units and countries. If the value in use is lower than the carrying amount, the recoverable amount is also calculated on the basis of fair value less selling costs.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are measured at historical acquisition and manufacturing costs, less accumulated depreciation. Government grants are normally deducted from acquisition or manufacturing costs as from the beginning of the 2023 financial year. Deferred government grants related to property, plant and equipment totalling €4,427 thousand as of 31 December 2022 were derecognised from deferred income as of 1 January 2023 and recognised as a reduction in the acquisition and manufacturing costs of the property, plant and equipment to which the grants relate. The manufacturing costs for self-produced equipment contain not only the direct material and manufacturing expenses, but also attributable\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\nmaterial and production overheads as well as production-related administrative expenses and depreciation. Maintenance and repair expenses are stated as expenses. All costs for measures that lead to an extension of the useful life or a widening of the future possibilities for use of the assets are capitalised. Depreciable objects are reduced by straight-line depreciation. If objects are sold or scrapped, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are derecognised; any resulting profits or losses are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n#### Useful lives of property, plant and equipment\n\n| Buildings                                   | 10–50 years |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Land improvement, improvements in buildings | 10–50 years |\n| Plant facilities                            | 8–15 years  |\n| Technical equipment and machinery           | 5–10 years  |\n| Factory and office equipment                | 3–10 years  |\n\nIntangible assets and property, plant and equipment with indefinite useful lives are not reduced using depreciation or amortisation.\n\nJungheinrich enters into contracts as a lessee for the use of property, plant and equipment, primarily properties and trucks. The right-of-use assets reported under property, plant and equipment are measured at acquisition cost, less cumulated depreciation and any necessary impairment, taking into account any remeasurements of the lease liability. The acquisition cost of the right-of-use asset is the present value of contractually agreed lease payments plus initial direct costs, less all lease incentives received. If there is an obligation to restore the underlying asset of the lease to its original state, then these costs are considered part of the acquisition cost. Jungheinrich makes use of the option in property lease contracts to consider payments for non-lease components as lease payments, and in so doing to recognise every lease component and all associated non-lease components as a single lease component. For all other leases, lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately.\n\nIf ownership of the leased item is transferred to Jungheinrich at the end of the contract's term as a result of the exercise of an option or a contractual agreement, the item is depreciated over its economic useful life. Otherwise, the right-of-use asset is reduced by straight-line depreciation over the lease term.\n\nFor leases with a maximum term of twelve months and leases of low-value assets, the rental and lease payments made by Jungheinrich are recognised by Jungheinrich using the straightline method as an expense over the term of the contract under functional costs. Low-value leases consist of assets whose individual acquisition costs at original value do not exceed €5 thousand.\n\n#### Trucks for short-term rental\n\nJungheinrich rents trucks to customers on the basis of short-term agreements. These trucks for short-term rental are capitalised at historical acquisition or manufacturing costs and depreciated over their economic useful lives, which are set at six and nine years respectively according to product group. Depending on the product group, they are depreciated at 30 or 20 per cent of their cost in each of the first two years, after which they are reduced using the straight-line method until the end of their useful lives.\n\n#### Impairments of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and trucks for short-term rental\n\nThe impairment test for goodwill is explained in the section headed \"Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\".\n\nAll other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and trucks for short-term rental are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication of a potential reduction in value. Besides qualitative criteria, particularly macroeconomic indicators, quantitative criteria are also used to furnish indications that a cash-generating unit (CGU) may be impaired. The CGUs are generally identical to the legal sales companies. The assets and contributions to profit of the other Group companies are allocated to the CGUs according to a revenue formula. As its quantitative criterion for assessing the impact of crises on recognised assets, Jungheinrich uses the ratio between the EBIT coverage ratio based on the CGU's current annual forecast and the current total carrying amounts of its fixed assets and net current assets. If the ratio falls below 3 per cent, the relevant CGU's intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and trucks for short-term rental are tested for impairment.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\nIn such cases, the recoverable amount of the asset is compared with its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is determined for each individual asset unless an asset generates cash flows that are not largely independent of those of other assets or other groups of assets (cash-generating units). The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value of the asset less selling costs and value in use, which is the estimated discounted future cash flow. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount of the asset, an impairment is performed.\n\nIf the reason for a recognised impairment in previous years no longer exists, a write-up to amortised acquisition and manufacturing costs is performed.\n\n#### Leasing and financial services\n\nWithin the framework of their financial services business, Jungheinrich Group companies conclude contracts with customers either directly or with a leasing company or bank acting as an intermediary.\n\nThe classification of the leases, and thus the way they are reported in the accounts, depends on the attribution of the economic ownership of the lease object. In the case of \"finance lease\" contracts, essentially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset are transferred so that the economic ownership lies with the lessee. At the Jungheinrich Group companies, as the lessor, this leads to identification of such assets as receivables from financial services in the amount of their net investment value. If the contract is deemed to be a \"finance lease\", revenue is recognised in the amount of the fair value of the leased item or the present value of the lease payments attributable to the lessor at the start of the contract, whichever is lower. Interest income realised in instalments over the term to maturity ensures that a stable return on outstanding net investments is achieved.\n\nIf economic ownership is attributed to Jungheinrich as the lessor, the agreement is classified as an \"operating lease\".The trucks are then capitalised as \"trucks for lease from financial services\" at cost and then depreciated over their economic useful lives. Underlying assets acquired before 1 January 2021 are depreciated over an economic useful life of six or nine years, depending on product group. Depending on the product group, they are depreciated at 30 or 20 per cent of their cost in each of the first two years, after which they are reduced using the straight-line method until the end of their useful lives. Underlying assets acquired from 1 January 2021 onwards is reduced by straight-line depreciation during the term of the customer contract down to the residual value. Lease income is recognised in profit or loss over the terms of the contracts using the straight-line method. Upon termination of the customer lease contract, the trucks are transferred to inventories at their carrying amounts.\n\nThese long-term customer contracts (\"finance leases\" and \"operating leases\") are financed by loans with maturities as identical as possible to those of the contracts. They are recognised under liabilities from financing as part of the item \"liabilities from financial services\". In addition to truck-related loan financing, proceeds from the sale of future lease instalments from intragroup usage right agreements in the Jungheinrich Group are deferred as liabilities from financing and released over the period of the usage right using the effective interest method. In addition, Jungheinrich finances itself via Elbe River Capital S.A., Luxembourg, an affiliated company established exclusively for this purpose. This refinancing company buys all lease instalments from intragroup usage right agreements – and, in Germany and the United Kingdom, from customer contracts, too – that mature in the future, and refinances itself through the issuance of promissory notes.\n\nIn addition, the underlying trucks in long-term customer contracts are refinanced using the sale and leaseback method. For sale and leaseback transactions completed prior to the first application of IFRS 16 (\"Leases\") there was no reassessment regarding the transfer of control to the leasing companies/banks, and the distribution of the profit from the sale from these contracts over the term of the contract is continued in accordance with the transition rules of IFRS 16. For sale and leaseback transactions signed after 1 January 2019, assessments are performed to see if control of the trucks has been transferred to the refinancing partner. As this is usually not the case, the trucks are not considered to have been sold, and are derecognised. They are recognised and measured as either trucks for lease from financial services (operating lease) or receivables from financial services (finance lease) depending on how the customer contract is classified. Refinancing liabilities in the amount of the revenue from the transfer are accounted for as financial liabilities and recognised as liabilities from financial services.\n\nIn the case of customer contracts with a leasing company or bank acting as an intermediary, Jungheinrich concludes sales contracts with the leasing companies/banks for the assets provided to the customer. Jungheinrich is frequently required under these contracts to repurchase the trucks from the leasing company/bank for an agreed residual value when the customer contracts expire. As a result, these contracts satisfy the definition of a lease contract and are classified as an \"operating lease\" or \"finance lease\" in accordance with the classification criteria which are used to classify lease contracts concluded directly with customers. If economic ownership is held by the Jungheinrich Group companies, the trucks sold to leasing companies/banks continue to be recognised in Jungheinrich's statement of financial position in accordance with IFRS. When they are capitalised as \"trucks for lease from financial services\", sales proceeds less the agreed residual value are recorded as \"deferred revenue from\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\nfinancial services\" under deferred income. Trucks for lease are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the term of the underlying leases between the leasing companies/banks and the end customer. The sales proceeds recognised as part of deferred income are reversed with an effect on revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract until payment of the agreed residual value is due. The repurchase obligations are reported in the amount of the contractually agreed residual values under the item \"liabilities from financial services\".\n\n#### Financial instruments\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, financial instruments are defined as contracts that at the same time lead to financial assets in one company and financial liabilities or equity instruments in the other.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, financial assets must be assigned to one of the following three measurement categories:\n\n- At amortised cost\n- At fair value through other comprehensive income (expense)\n- At fair value through profit or loss\n\nThe financial assets are classified based on the Jungheinrich Group's business model for managing financial assets and on the characteristics of the contractually agreed cash flows.\n\nFinancial liabilities must be assigned to one of the following three measurement categories:\n\n- At amortised cost\n- At fair value through profit or loss\n- Other financial liabilities\n\nFinancial instruments carried at amortised cost are primary non-derivative financial instruments such as trade accounts receivable and payable, contract assets, other receivables and financial assets, other financial liabilities, receivables and liabilities from financial services, as well as financial liabilities.\n\nNon-derivative financial instruments are recognised at the settlement date, i.e. the time at which the asset is delivered to or by Jungheinrich.\n\n#### Trade accounts receivable and contract assets\n\nTrade accounts receivable and contract assets are held by the Jungheinrich Group primarily for the purpose of realising their nominal value. The contractual conditions result in cash flows at agreed times which exclusively constitute repayments and, if applicable, interest payments on the outstanding receivable amount. As a rule, the Jungheinrich Group's trade accounts receivable and contract assets have contractually agreed short-term payment terms. They are categorised as \"at amortised cost\" and measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, whereby the amortised cost corresponds to the nominal value less loss allowances.\n\nFurther information on receivables from financial services can be found in the notes on the treatment of leases.\n\n#### Non-consolidated investments in affiliated companies and joint ventures\n\nNon-consolidated investments in affiliated companies and joint ventures are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. Non-consolidated investments in affiliated companies and joint ventures are reported under \"Other financial assets\" in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n#### Other investments\n\nInvestments in companies that are neither affiliated companies, associated companies nor joint ventures are recognised under other non-current financial assets. These investments are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss and reported under \"Other financial assets\" in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Securities\n\nSecurities which are held for the purpose of holding them to maturity and realising their contractual cash flows are categorised as \"at amortised cost\" and measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. These securities are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs. Differences between the original amount and the amount repayable at maturity are distributed over their terms and recognised in financial income (expense). With these securities, the amortised cost corresponds to the nominal value less (plus) any discounts (premiums) and less loss allowances for expected credit losses.\n\nSecurities which are held for the purpose of selling or holding in order to realise contractual cash flows but which cannot be assigned to the category \"fair value through other comprehensive income (expense)\" are categorised as \"at fair value through profit or loss\". These securities are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the purchase of the financial instrument. The fair value corresponds to the market prices quoted on active markets. Gains and losses from these securities resulting from measurement at fair value are recognised directly in profit or loss.\n\nJungheinrich does not have any securities categorised as \"at fair value through other comprehensive income (expense)\".\n\n#### Other financial assets\n\nOther financial assets are categorised as \"at amortised cost\" and carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method, in other words at the nominal value less loss allowances for expected credit losses.\n\n#### Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents are available at short notice and have an original maturity of up to three months. They also include short-term deposits with an original contractual term of up to twelve months. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortised cost; in other words, at the nominal amount less valuation allowances for expected credit losses.\n\n#### Liabilities\n\nLiabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The interest cost is recognised in accordance with the effective interest rate.\n\nLease liabilities are recognised at the beginning of the lease at present value of the outstanding lease payments using the maturity- and country-specific incremental borrowing rate and finally measured using the effective interest method at amortised cost. The lease liability's carrying amount increases by accrued interest and decreases by lease payments made. Changes to the carrying amount from remeasurement of the lease liability due to reassessments or adjustments to the lease are also taken into account.\n\n#### Impairment of financial instruments\n\nFor financial instruments in the category \"at amortised cost\", impairment losses are calculated for expected credit losses and recognised immediately in profit or loss as loss allowances.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, loss allowances for expected credit losses must be recognised at the time of initial recognition of financial assets.\n\nJungheinrich uses the simplified approach (two-level model) to measure loss allowances recognised for trade accounts receivable and contract assets. Due to the predominantly short-term maturity of these financial assets, the expected credit losses resulting from potential defaults relates to the remaining term of the trade accounts receivable and contract assets (level 2). A transfer from level 1 to level 2, as envisaged in the general impairment model (three-level model), is thus not relevant for these financial instruments.\n\nThe Jungheinrich Group has established standardised risk categories for ranges of credit rating indices. To measure the loss allowances in the consolidated financial statements, the upper limit of the range has been specified for each risk group as the Group probability of default for a twelve-month term to maturity. Trade accounts receivable and contract assets existing as at the balance sheet date are assigned to these risk categories in accordance with the individual customer rating. The loss allowances for expected credit losses are determined by applying the Group probability of default to the portfolio of receivables of the individual risk groups, while taking account of the average payment targets agreed by the respective Group companies. In the case of portfolios of receivables for which there is loan insurance, only the contractually agreed deductible is subject to a credit risk. The individual customer ratings contain forward-looking information.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\nTrade accounts receivable and contract assets are transferred to Level 3 as soon as there are objective indications of impairment affecting these financial instruments. These indications include a clear deterioration in the customer rating, registered insolvencies and a clear increase in the debtor's overdue payments. Individual event-based loss allowances are recognised for these doubtful trade accounts receivable and contract assets with an impaired credit rating.\n\nInsofar as the objective indications of impairment no longer apply and the trade accounts receivable and contract assets no longer have an impaired credit rating, the impairment losses are reversed. The financial instruments are included again in the measurement of expected credit loss allowances at Level 2.\n\nIf it can no longer be assumed, based on an appropriate evaluation, that trade accounts receivable or assets are recoverable in whole or in part, they are derecognised in line with local regulations.\n\nJungheinrich uses the three-level model to calculate potential future impairment losses for all other financial instruments in the category \"at amortised cost\". At the time of initial recognition, these financial assets are assigned to level 1, and loss allowances equal to the expected twelve-month credit losses are recognised. The probabilities of default for a twelvemonth period are based on CDS prices containing forward-looking information and the expected loss given default ratio. Parameters for loss given default ratios (LGD) reflect an assumed recoverability rate of 40 to 45 per cent. In this case, the estimated loss is calculated based on the current market price of the financial instruments and the remaining term to maturity. If the credit risk rate increases significantly in subsequent periods, these financial instruments would have to be transferred to level 2, and loss allowances equal to the expected credit loss for the remaining term to maturity would have to be recognised. Were contractual payments to become more than 30 days overdue, this would not by itself signal a significant increase in the credit risk, but it would indicate that a significant increase in the credit risk might have occurred. Jungheinrich's risk management system treats a downgrading of the counterparty's external rating below investment grade as a criterion for a significant increase in the credit risk. However, in line with Jungheinrich's risk management strategy, all other financial instruments are immediately liquidated if there is a significant increase in the creditworthiness risk.\n\nIFRS 9 requires that loss allowances be recognised for expected credit losses. These loss allowances are calculated based on estimated probabilities of default. The credit losses that actually occur in the future may deviate from the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Derivative financial instruments\n\nAt Jungheinrich, derivative financial instruments are mainly used for hedging purposes.\n\nJungheinrich has opted to continue to apply the provisions of IAS 39 when accounting for hedges, as permitted by IFRS 9.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognised at the trade date, i.e. the time the obligation to buy or sell the asset was entered into.\n\nIAS 39 requires all derivative financial instruments to be accounted for at fair value as assets or liabilities. Depending on whether the derivative is a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge, gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised in profit or loss or are otherwise recognised in shareholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income (expense)), with no effect on profit or loss. In the case of a fair value hedge, the results from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in profit or loss. The changes in the fair value of derivatives that are to be classified as cash flow hedges are initially recognised with no effect on profit or loss under shareholders' equity in the amount of the hedge-effective part. These amounts are transferred to the statement of profit or loss at the same time as the effect on the result of the underlying transaction. The hedgeineffective part is recognised directly in financial income (expense).\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\nDerivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments are categorised as \"at fair value through profit or loss\". Gains and losses from these derivative financial instruments resulting from measurement at fair value are recognised directly in profit or loss.\n\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value are classified and assigned to measurement categories according to the significance of the factors considered in their measurement. Financial instruments are assigned to levels depending on the significance their input factors have on their overall measurement. Assignments are based on the lowest level of substantial or main relevance for the measurement. The fair value hierarchy is based on the input factors used:\n\nLevel 1 – (unchanged) market prices quoted on active markets for identical assets or liabilities,\n\nLevel 2 – input data other than listed market prices, which can be observed either directly (as a price) or indirectly (derived from prices) for the asset or liability,\n\nLevel 3 – referenced input factors used for the measurement of the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.\n\nJungheinrich records reclassifications between these different measurement levels at the end of the reporting period in which the change occurred.\n\n#### Inventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of acquisition or manufacturing cost and net realisable value. Manufacturing costs include not only the direct material and manufacturing expenses, but also the attributable material and production overhead costs as well as production-related administrative expenses and depreciation. The average cost method is applied to calculate the acquisition and manufacturing costs of inventories of the same type.\n\nUtilisation risks resulting from storage time are taken into account by way of value reductions on the basis of historical usage. Once the reason for the write-downs ceases to exist, a reversal of the write-down is carried out.\n\n#### Income tax expense\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in accordance with the balance-sheetorientated method for all temporary differences between Group and tax-based valuation. This procedure is generally applicable for all assets and liabilities with the exception of goodwill from the consolidation of investments. In addition, deferred tax assets are stated on the statement of financial position to carry forward unused tax losses and unused tax credits if it is probable that they can be utilised. Deferred taxes are valued at the current rates of taxation. If it is expected that the differences will be offset in years with different rates of taxation, then the latter rates valid at that time are applied. If there are any changes in the tax rates, these changes are taken into account in the year in which the relevant changes in tax rates are approved. Actual income tax expense is recorded on the statement of financial position as of the time it was incurred. It is calculated taking into account the respective local tax legislation and current case law. The complexity of these regulations and the resulting potential for them to be interpreted in different ways means that there is uncertainty as to how individual transactions are to be treated for tax purposes. Uncertain tax positions are assessed regularly at the end of the year. These uncertain tax items are measured in accordance with IFRIC 23 by using the most likely amount. Material judgements are made in the measurement of intragroup service flows and the impairment analysis of deferred tax assets.\n\nA loss allowance is recognised for deferred tax assets, the recovery of which is improbable.\n\n#### Accumulated other comprehensive income (expense)\n\nStated in this item are changes in the shareholders' equity with no effect on profit or loss insofar as these are not based on capital transactions with shareholders. These include the currency translation adjustment, including the impact of inflation on equity that arises as a result of applying the provisions of IAS 29, as well as differences resulting from the remeasurement of defined benefit pension plans. This item also includes the unrealised gains from derivative financial instruments with a hedging relationship. Changes in the year under review are presented in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\n#### Provisions\n\nProvisions for pensions and similar obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial calculations in accordance with IAS 19 by applying the projected unit credit method for defined benefit obligations from pensions. This method takes into account pensions and vested future benefits known as at the balance sheet date, expected increases in salaries and pensions as well as demographic calculation principles. Remeasurements relating to actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets at Jungheinrich (excluding amounts included in the net interest on the net defined benefit liability) are recognised in other comprehensive income (expense) as soon as they occur and are thus disclosed directly on the statement of financial position. Remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income (expense) are a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (expense) and are not transferred to the statement of profit or loss in subsequent periods. The cost component \"service cost\" is recognised in profit or loss in the personnel costs of the corresponding functional areas. Net interest on the net liability from defined benefit pension plans is recognised in profit or loss in financial income (expense). Pension obligations and similar obligations of some foreign companies are financed by pension funds. These pension funds are qualifying plan assets pursuant to IAS 19.\n\nThe defined benefit obligation stated on the consolidated statement of financial position represents the current funding gap of the Jungheinrich Group's defined benefit pension plans.\n\nTermination benefits are recognised if the employee's employment contract is terminated before reaching the normal pension age or if an employee volunteers to terminate the employment contract in exchange for severance benefits. The Group recognises such benefits only if Jungheinrich is obliged to terminate the employment contract and provide the benefits due to a detailed formal plan, which cannot be revised, or if there is an individual agreement. Termination benefits are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19.\n\nFurthermore, provisions have been accrued to cover employee benefits due pursuant to local statutory regulations in the event of their departure, as well as to cover other employee benefits due over the short or long term. These obligations are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19.\n\nThe measurement of the long-term incentive (LTI) as a share-based performance-related component of the Board of Management's remuneration with a long-term incentive effect is carried out at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation. The obligations are recorded as personnel provisions under other provisions.\n\nOther provisions are accrued in accordance with IAS 37 if a past event results in a present obligation to third parties, it is probable that resources will be used to meet this obligation and the anticipated amount of the required provision can be reliably estimated. Other provisions are accounted for based on the best possible estimate of costs required to meet the present obligation as at the balance sheet date. If the amount of the necessary provision can only be determined within a certain bandwidth, the most probable value is stated. If all amounts are of equal probability, the mean value is stated.\n\nProvisions for restructuring measures are accrued pursuant to IAS 37 if a detailed, formal plan has been established and all the parties involved have been informed of said plan. The measures are implemented without undue delay.\n\nNon-current provisions are discounted and recognised at the present value of the expected expense. Provisions are not offset against claims under rights of recourse.\n\n#### Classification of accounts\n\nCurrent and non-current assets, as well as current and non-current liabilities, are recognised on the statement of financial position as separate classification groups. Assets and liabilities are classified as being current if their realisation or repayment is expected within twelve months from the balance sheet date. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are classified as being non-current if they have a remaining term to maturity of more than one year. Pension provisions are recognised in line with their nature under non-current liabilities as benefits due to employees in the long term. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and non-current liabilities.\n\nIndividual items in the statement of profit or loss and in the statement of financial position are summarised. They are shown separately in the notes.\n\n#### Estimates\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements, it is necessary to a certain degree to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the level and recognition of assets and liabilities stated on the statement of financial position as at the balance sheet date and of income and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions must be made primarily to determine the economic useful lives of property, plant and equipment, trucks for short-term rental and leased equipment uniformly throughout the Group, to conduct impairment tests on assets and to account for and measure provisions, including those for pensions, guarantee\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\nand disposal obligations or legal disputes. Further estimates and assumptions about the expected residual values at the end of the term of long-term customer leases must be made to measure the underlying assets. Assumptions and estimates are also necessary when determining the intrinsic value of deferred tax assets, especially on loss carryforwards, and when recognising tax items that are still uncertain. Estimates and assumptions are made on the basis of the latest knowledge available and historical experience as well as additional factors such as future expectations.\n\nThe amounts which actually materialise may deviate from the estimates. When the actual course of events deviates from the expectations, the premises and, if necessary, the carrying amounts of the affected assets and liabilities, are adjusted accordingly.\n\nTo identify any impairment of goodwill, it is necessary to calculate the recoverable value of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the goodwill has been allocated. Calculating the recoverable amount involves estimating future cash flows from the CGU, a sustainable growth rate and an appropriate discount rate for the calculation of the net present value. Any change in these and other influential factors may lead to impairment losses. Goodwill is tested for impairment once a year and also if there is any indication for impairment.\n\nAll other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and trucks for short-term rental are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication for impairment. Besides qualitative criteria, particularly macroeconomic indicators, quantitative criteria are also used to furnish indications that an impairment may occur in individual cash-generating units (CGU).\n\nJungheinrich reclassified the CGUs with effect from 1 January 2023. Previously, each legal company generally constituted a CGU. Due to changes in the long-term earnings management, particularly in the production plants, the legal companies no longer fulfil the definition of a CGU pursuant to IAS 36. The legal sales companies are usually deemed to be the new CGUs. The assets and contributions to profit of the other Group companies are allocated to the new CGUs according to a revenue formula.\n\nAt the time the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2023 were prepared, Jungheinrich assumed that Jungheinrich companies in Russia and Ukraine would continue to operate.\n\nAs a result, for the Russian CGU the carrying amounts of the intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and trucks for short-term rental were tested for impairment as at the balance sheet date. The probability of various scenarios was weighted to estimate the expected cash flows. There was no need to record an impairment for the Russian CGU as of 31 December 2023.\n\nFor the Ukrainian CGU, impairment losses on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and trucks for short-term rental were recognised in the previous year. Furthermore, the test of the property, plant and equipment and trucks for short-term rental capitalised in 2023 revealed no need for impairment or reversal of impairment.\n\nEstimates of future costs for legal disputes, warranty and disposal obligations are subject to a number of uncertainties.\n\nIt is often impossible to predict the outcome of individual lawsuits with certainty. It cannot be ruled out that, due to the final ruling on some of the outstanding lawsuits, Jungheinrich may be faced with costs that exceed the provisions accrued for this purpose and whose timing and extent cannot be predicted with certainty.\n\nWarranty and disposal obligations are subject to uncertainties surrounding the enactment of new laws and regulations, the number of affected trucks and the nature of measures to be initiated. It cannot be ruled out that the expenses actually incurred for these measures may exceed the provisions accrued for them to an unpredictable extent. Further information can be found in note (26) [ [page](#page-150-0) 149 ].\n\nAlthough expenses resulting from a necessary adjustment in provisions in the reporting period can have a significant impact on Jungheinrich's results, it is expected that any potentially ensuing obligations will not have a material effect on the Group's economic situation, particularly in light of the provisions already accrued for this purpose.\n\nAll significant risks known at the time the consolidated financial statements were prepared and affecting the assets and liabilities stated on the statement of financial position as of 31 December 2023 have been taken into consideration in preparing the statements.\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-118-0\"></span>IFRS published, adopted by the EU, and applied for the first time in the 2023 financial year\n\nAs of 1 January 2023, Jungheinrich was required to apply for the first time the amendments to IAS 12 \"Income Taxes\" published by the IASB in May 2023 and adopted by the EU in November 2023 with regard to the Pillar 2 model rules for the reform of international business taxation. The amendments contain a temporary mandatory exemption from the obligation to recognise deferred taxes resulting from the implementation of the Pillar 2 rules. In this context additional disclosures have been introduced, which Jungheinrich reports under note (11) [ [page](#page-127-0) 126 ].\n\nJungheinrich was required to apply the amendments to IAS 1 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\", published by the IASB in February 2021 and adopted by the EU in March 2022, for the first time from 1 January 2023. These amendments clarify that an entity must disclose all \"material\" accounting policy information. Previously, the standard referred to \"significant\" accounting policies. The amendments also define what is meant by \"material accounting policy information\" and how this is identified. The application of this amended standard had no material impact on the Jungheinrich consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2023.\n\nJungheinrich was required to apply the amendments to IAS 8 \"Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors\", published by the IASB in February 2021 and adopted by the EU in March 2022, for the first time from 1 January 2023. These amendments clarify how to distinguish between changes in accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates. The application of this amended standard had no material impact on the Jungheinrich consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2023.\n\nJungheinrich was required to apply the IFRS 17 \"Insurance Contracts\", published by the IASB in June 2020 and adopted by the EU in November 2021, for the first time as of 1 January 2023. This standard determines the accounting and disclosure of insurance contracts. Through another mandatory amendment published by the IASB in December 2021 and adopted by the EU in September 2022, a transition option relating to the comparative period was added. The application of this amended standard had no impact on the Jungheinrich consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2023.\n\nJungheinrich was required to apply for the first time, the amendments to IAS 12 \"Income Taxes\" published by the IASB in May 2021 and adopted by the EU in August 2022 for the first time as of 1 January 2023. These amendments require companies to recognise deferred tax assets and tax liabilities for transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences on initial recognition. The application of this amended standard had no material impact on the Jungheinrich consolidated financial statement as of December 2023.\n\n#### Published IFRS adopted by the EU and not yet applied\n\nIn September 2022, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 16 \"Leases\" regarding the measurement of the lease liability from sale and leaseback transactions. These amendments stipulate that the seller/lessee must determine \"lease payments\" and \"revised lease payments\" in the subsequent measurement of the lease liability in a manner that prevents the recognition of a gain or loss in relation to the retained right-of-use asset. No material impacts are currently expected on the consolidated financial statements. The amendments published by the IASB were adopted by the EU in November 2023 and become effective for the first time for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024.\n\nThe IASB first published amendments to IAS 1 \"Presentation of Financial Statements\" in January 2020 regarding the classification of liabilities as current or non-current. These amendments clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current is based on the rights available to the entity at the balance sheet date. No material impacts are currently expected on the consolidated financial statements. The amendments published by the IASB were adopted by the EU in December 2023 and become effective for the first time for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024.\n\n#### Published IFRS that are yet to be adopted by the EU and have not yet been applied\n\nThe other standards that have been published but not yet adopted by the EU, and not yet applied by Jungheinrich are not expected to have a material impact on the Jungheinrich Group's assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss. Jungheinrich does not currently plan to apply these standards, when these have been endorsed by the EU, until they become mandatory in later financial years.\n\n#### Scope of consolidation\n\nIn addition to the parent company, Jungheinrich AG, Hamburg, the consolidated financial statements included 89 (previous year: 82) foreign and 28 (previous year: 28) domestic (German-based) companies. The scope of consolidation comprised 101 (previous year: 93) fully consolidated subsidiaries, including one structured entity, which were directly or indirectly controlled by Jungheinrich AG. Fifteen joint ventures (previous year: 15) and one associated company (previous year: two) were accounted for using the equity method.\n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\nUniversal-FORMICA-Fonds, Frankfurt / Main, in which Jungheinrich AG holds 100 per cent of the shares, was included in the scope of consolidation as a structured entity. On the basis of contractual agreements, Jungheinrich is able to steer the activities of the special fund and thus influence the amount of return. The purpose of investments in the fund is to take advantage of opportunities to earn returns on the capital market while limiting risk. The special fund is managed to maintain value in order to limit risks.\n\nAll of the shareholdings of Jungheinrich AG, Hamburg, are disclosed in note (44) [ [page](#page-175-0) 174 ].\n\n#### Changes in the scope of consolidation\n\n#### Development of the scope of consolidation\n\n|                       | Jungheinrich AG | Subsidiaries |                 |         | Joint ventures  |         | Associated companies |  |  |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|---------|-----------------|---------|----------------------|--|--|\n|                       | Germany         | Germany      | Outside Germany | Germany | Outside Germany | Germany | Total                |  |  |\n| Balance on 01/01/2023 | 1               | 21           | 72              | 5       | 10              | 2       | 111                  |  |  |\n| Additions             | –               | 1            | 8               | –       | –               | –       | 9                    |  |  |\n| Disposals             | –               | –            | 1               | –       | –               | 1       | 2                    |  |  |\n| Balance on 31/12/2023 | 1               | 22           | 79              | 5       | 10              | 1       | 118                  |  |  |\n| Balance on 01/01/2022 | 1               | 22           | 70              | 4       | 8               | 1       | 106                  |  |  |\n| Additions             | –               | –            | 2               | 1       | 2               | 1       | 6                    |  |  |\n| Disposals             | –               | 1            | –               | –       | –               | –       | 1                    |  |  |\n| Balance on 31/12/2022 | 1               | 21           | 72              | 5       | 10              | 2       | 111                  |  |  |\n\n#### Significant acquisitions\n\nIn order to expand direct sales for racking systems and warehouse automation in North America, Jungheinrich gained control of the Storage Solutions Group (Storage Solutions) in return for a purchase price of €325.4 million on 15 March 2023 and has since held 100 per cent of the voting rights and capital shares of SSI Acquisition LLC, Westfield/Indiana (USA) and its subsidiaries. This has enlarged the scope of consolidation by seven companies, based in the USA:\n\n- SSI Acquisition LLC, Westfield/Indiana\n- SSI Holdings Inc., Westfield/Indiana\n- Storage Solutions Inc., Westfield/Indiana\n- Warehouse Solutions Inc., Westfield/Indiana\n- Logistics Handling Solutions LLC, Westfield/Indiana\n- SSI-SNC Solutions, LLC, Rancho Cucamonga/California\n- Electronic Mechanical Integration Technologies Inc., Nashville/Tennessee\n\nStorage Solutions, one of the USA's leading providers of racking and warehouse automation solutions, has been allocated to the \"Intralogistics\" segment. The purchase price was provided in the form of cash and cash equivalents.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe table below shows the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired.\n\n#### Purchase price allocation at the date of acquisition\n\n| in € million                                  | Fair values |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Assets                                        |             |\n| Intangible assets                             | 64.8        |\n| Property, plant and equipment                 | 10.0        |\n| Inventories                                   | 18.1        |\n| Trade accounts receivable and contract assets | 20.0        |\n| Other receivables and other assets            | 5.5         |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                     | 17.9        |\n|                                               | 136.3       |\n| Liabilities                                   |             |\n| Other provisions                              | 7.2         |\n| Financial liabilities                         | 38.5        |\n| Trade accounts payable                        | 13.9        |\n| Contract liabilities                          | 15.8        |\n| Income tax liabilities                        | 2.9         |\n| Other liabilities                             | 3.2         |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                      | 16.5        |\n|                                               | 98.0        |\n| Net assets acquired                           | 38.3        |\n| Consideration transferred                     | 325.4       |\n| Differential amount                           | 287.1       |\n\nIntangible assets in the amount of €64.8 million and goodwill totalling €287.1 million were identified as part of the purchase price allocation. The identified recognisable intangible assets primarily related to acquired customer relationships, and had a fair value of €57.4 million with an assumed useful life of 8 years. The goodwill was mainly based on the fact that the consideration transferred included amounts for the well-trained workforce acquired and the anticipated exploitation of synergies and future potential in the field of warehouse automation in the USA. Storage Solutions will form the strategic base for this future, fast-growing market in the US. With access to important logistics hubs, there is also an opportunity for Jungheinrich to support existing European customers in the US. These anticipated benefits were not recognised separately from goodwill as they do not fulfil the criteria for the recognition of intangible assets. A portion of the goodwill amounting to €56.7 million is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill of €287.1 million was allocated to Storage Solutions.\n\nThe receivables acquired were solely comprised of receivables which are expected to be recoverable. The fair values determined take into account the credit risk for expected credit losses, which was rated very low.\n\nJungheinrich measured the acquired lease liabilities at the present value of the remaining lease payments at the time of acquisition. The right-of-use assets were measured at the same amount as the lease liabilities.\n\nSince the date of acquisition, Storage Solutions has contributed revenue of €219.4 million to the revenue reported in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Its share of consolidated earnings after taxes for the same period was €13.7 million, including the effects of the purchase price allocation.\n\nIf the acquisition date of the business combination had been 1 January 2023, Group revenue and consolidated earnings after taxes for 2023 would have been approximately €5,592 million and approximately €299.9 million, respectively. When determining these figures, Jungheinrich assumed that the determined fair value adjustments made as of the date of acquisition would also have been valid in the event of an acquisition on 1 January 2023.\n\nWith a payment of €30.8 million, Jungheinrich repaid Storage Solutions' bank liabilities at the time of the acquisition.\n\nIn connection with the acquisition, an agreement was made that former shareholders who were also employees of Storage Solutions would receive further, variable payments in the coming years. The amount of these payments depends on the fulfilment of key figures laid out in the purchase agreement for the 2023, 2024 and 2025 financial years (earn-out payments). The employees included in this scheme only have a right to payment if they are still employed by Storage Solutions at the end of the respective financial year. Jungheinrich expects contingent payments of €26 million, which would be due in part for payment in 2024, 2025 and 2026.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\nThe repayment of bank liabilities and the agreed, expected future performance-related payments in 2024 to 2026 are not part of the consideration transferred in accordance with IFRS 3.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, the total costs associated with the business combination totalled approximately €10 million. These included acquisition-related costs of approximately €8 million, incurred in the reporting year and recognised in profit or loss in other operating expenses.\n\nJungheinrich has wholly acquired the Munich-based robotics specialist Magazino GmbH in order to expand and strengthen its automation expertise. Jungheinrich acquired the remaining 74.5 per cent of shares in Magazino GmbH, Munich (Germany) on 23 August 2023 for a purchase price of €20.0 million and since that date has held 100 per cent of the voting rights and capital shares in the company, which was previously classified as an associate. The company, previously recognised using the equity method, was included in the scope of consolidation as a fully consolidated company for the first time at the time of acquisition. As of 23 August 2023, the carrying amount calculated using the equity method was €8.4 million. The 25.5 per cent shares held in Magazino GmbH prior to 23 August 2023 were remeasured at the fair value applicable on that date. A loss of €2.2 million resulting from the market valuation was recognised through profit or loss in other financial income (expense) for 2023.\n\nMagazino GmbH, based in Munich, is a technology company active in the field of autonomous mobile robots and has one of Europe's largest development teams in mobile robotics. The company has a high-performance technology platform that allows the operation of logistics robots even in a mixed human-machine environment. Jungheinrich has thus added highly innovative hardware and software solutions in the rapidly growing autonomous mobile robots market to its existing portfolio of automation systems. Magazino GmbH, Munich, is allocated to the \"Intralogistics\" segment.\n\nThe purchase price for the remaining shares was provided in the form of cash and cash equivalents in the reporting year.\n\nThe consideration transferred in the amount of €26.2 million for 100 per cent of the shares in Magazino GmbH, Munich (Germany), included €20.0 million for the purchase price for the acquisition of the 74.5 per cent of the shares and €6.2 million for the fair value of the previously held 25.5 per cent of the shares in the acquired company.\n\nThe table below shows the allocation to the net assets acquired of the consideration transferred.\n\n#### Purchase price allocation at the date of acquisition\n\n| in € million                                  | Fair values |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Assets                                        |             |\n| Intangible assets                             | 25.1        |\n| Property, plant and equipment                 | 0.5         |\n| Inventories                                   | 3.0         |\n| Trade accounts receivable and contract assets | 1.6         |\n| Other receivables and other assets            | 0.2         |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                     | 1.5         |\n|                                               | 31.9        |\n| Liabilities                                   |             |\n| Other provisions                              | 0.7         |\n| Financial liabilities                         | 8.3         |\n| Trade accounts payable                        | 0.2         |\n| Contract liabilities                          | 0.2         |\n| Other liabilities                             | 4.2         |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                      | 7.5         |\n|                                               | 21.1        |\n| Net assets acquired                           | 10.8        |\n| Consideration transferred                     | 26.2        |\n| Differential amount                           | 15.4        |\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\nNon-financial report\n\nAdditional information\n\nIntangible assets in the amount of €25.1 million and goodwill totalling €15.4 million were identified as part of the purchase price allocation. The recognisable intangible assets identified as part of the purchase price allocation primarily related to acquired technologies with a fair value of €22.8 million and an assumed useful life of ten years. The goodwill was mainly based on the fact that the consideration transferred included amounts reflecting the expectation of being able to harness potential synergy effects as well as a very well qualified workforce. These benefits were not recognised separately from goodwill as they do not meet the criteria for the recognition of intangible assets. No part of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill of €15.4 million that was recorded when Magazino GmbH, Munich, was combined with the business was allocated to the sales companies in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Sweden, Poland and Spain.\n\nThe receivables acquired were solely comprised of receivables which are expected to be recoverable. The fair values determined take into account the credit risk for expected credit losses, which was rated very low.\n\nSince the date of acquisition, Magazino GmbH, Munich, has contributed revenue of €0.6 million to the revenue reported in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Its share of consolidated earnings after taxes for the same period was €– 4.5 million, including the effects of the purchase price allocation.\n\nIf the acquisition date of the business combination had been 1 January 2023, Group revenue and consolidated earnings after taxes for 2023 would have been approximately €5,548 million and approximately €293.9 million, respectively.\n\nIn connection with the acquisition of the company, it was agreed that the sellers of the shares and the employees of Magazino GmbH, Munich, at the time of acquisition would receive further variable payments in subsequent years, provided that the conditions set out in the purchase agreement were met (referred to as long-term incentive payments). The beneficiaries are only entitled to payment upon fulfilment of the performance-related key figures if they are employed by Magazino GmbH, Munich, at the contractually agreed time. Jungheinrich expects contingent payments totalling €5.0 million, which would be due for payment in 2024, 2025 and 2026. These payments are not part of the consideration transferred in accordance with IFRS 3.\n\nThe acquisition-related costs of €0.5 million were recorded in profit or loss under general administrative expenses in 2023.\n\n#### Other changes in the scope of consolidation\n\nJungheinrich Financial Services B.V., Alphen a.d. Rijn (Netherlands) took over all the assets and liabilities of the absorbed Jungheinrich Finance B.V., Alphen a.d. Rijn (Netherlands) by way of a merger by absorption as of 1 January 2023.\n\nJungheinrich Digital Solutions s.l., Madrid (Spain) was included in the scope of consolidation for the first time as of 1 January 2023. Jungheinrich established this company as an internal service provider for the development of digital products in 2018 and has since held all of the shares in the company. The net assets of €0.4 million included in the scope of consolidation for the first time at the beginning of the financial year primarily consisted of financial assets and liabilities. The first-time consolidation resulted in a negative difference of €0.4 million, which was the result of the accumulated earnings from invoices for services provided to Jungheinrich Group companies in previous years. The difference was recognised in profit or loss under other operating income for the year 2023.\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-123-0\"></span>NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF PROFIT OR LOSS\n\n#### (3) Revenue\n\nJungheinrich generates revenue from contracts with customers by providing goods and services, both at a specific point in time and over time. The Group also generates revenue from short-term rental and lease agreements, in respect of which Jungheinrich is the lessor.\n\n#### Composition of revenue\n\n|

Income from derivatives includes all income from derivative financial instruments that do not relate to supplies and services, are not held in the special fund and were not designated as hedges as at the balance sheet date. These primarily include derivative financial instruments used to hedge foreign exchange rates when concluding intragroup financial transactions. Income from derivatives also includes changes in currency exchange rates pertaining to financing.\n\nThe loss on net monetary positions of €–3,682 thousand (previous year: €–3,826 thousand) was in connection with the annual financial statements of the Turkish sales company included in the consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in line with the provisions of IAS 29. For further details, please refer to the note on hyperinflation.\n\nIn August 2023, Jungheinrich acquired the remaining shares in Magazino GmbH, Munich. The other financial income (expense) for the year under review included €–2,190 thousand from the measurement of the shares previously held in Magazino GmbH, Munich (Germany) at fair value at the time of acquisition. Please see the notes for more details on changes to the scope of consolidation.\n\nOther financial income (expense) included earnings of €94 thousand (previous year: €11 thousand) from changes in loss allowances recognised in profit or loss for expected credit losses on securities, cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets, and €884 thousand (previous year: €1,048 thousand) in income from accrued interest and changes to discount rates on non-current provisions for personnel.\n\n#### (11) Income taxes\n\n#### Composition of tax expense\n\n| in € thousand   | 2023    | 2022   |\n|-----------------|---------|--------|\n| Current taxes   |         |        |\n| Germany         | 42,303  | 13,164 |\n| Outside Germany | 68,805  | 55,569 |\n| Deferred taxes  |         |        |\n| Germany         | 2,374   | 10,248 |\n| Outside Germany | -13,629 | -1,155 |\n| Tax expense     | 99,853  | 77,826 |\n\nThe current tax expense in Germany was higher than in the previous year due to higher earnings. Taxes in the previous year resulted in an expense of €3.7 million (previous year: tax income of €0.6 million).\n\nThe current tax expense outside Germany was higher than in the previous year due to higher earnings, higher tax rates and higher permanent effects. Taxes in the previous year resulted in income of €0.8 million (previous year: tax income of €0.5 million).\n\n€2.4 million (previous year: tax expense of €10.2 million) of deferred tax expense pertaining to Germany was mainly attributable to higher deferred tax liabilities for intangible assets. The deferred tax income pertaining to business outside Germany, amounting to €13.6 million (previous year: tax income of €1.1 million), was primarily caused by the reversal of deferred tax assets in connection with US loss carryforwards from the acquisition of Storage Solutions and the reduction of deferred tax liabilities on temporary differences. The Jungheinrich Group's deferred tax income in 2023 of €11.3 million (previous year: tax expense of €9.1 million) was attributable to tax income of €6.4 million (previous year: tax income of €0.3 million) from changes in loss carryforwards and tax income of €4.9 million (previous year: tax expense of €9.4 million) arising from changes in temporary differences.\n\nThe domestic (German) corporate income tax rate for the 2023 financial year was 30.6 per cent (previous year: 30.5 per cent). It continues to comprise the corporate income tax burden of 15.0 per cent along with the solidarity surcharge of 5.5 per cent of the corporate income tax burden and a trade tax rate of 14.7 per cent (previous year: 14.6 per cent).\n\nThe applied local income tax rates for foreign companies varied between 9.0 per cent (previous year: 9.0 per cent) and 35.0 per cent (previous year: 34.0 per cent).\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Group had approximately €70 million in corporate tax loss carryforwards (previous year: €73 million). Of this amount, €26 million (previous year: €46 million) related to the US loss carryforward. The loss carryforwards accrued in or before 2014 can be utilised subject to a specific time limit; those accrued later have no such limit on when they can be used.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Group had €70.3 million in utilisable corporate tax loss carryforwards (previous year: €26.2 million). The increase is largely due to the fact that the US loss carryforwards have now been classified as utilisable following the acquisition of Storage Solutions, whereas in previous years they were generally reported as non-utilisable. Loss\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\ncarryforwards also increased as a result of the full consolidation of Magazino GmbH, Munich (Germany). Valuation allowances of €6.3 million (previous year: €4.0 million) were recognised for deferred tax assets in connection with corporate income tax loss carryforwards. Of this amount, €3.5 million is attributable to loss carryforwards of German companies (previous year: €1.0 million) and €2.4 million (previous year: €2.4 million) is related to the loss carryforward in Australia. As of 31 December 2023, trade tax loss carryforwards also amounted to €29.0 million (previous year: €12.1 million). Valuation allowances of €3.2 million (previous year: €0.8 million) was recognised for deferred tax assets in connection with these loss carryforwards.\n\nIncome tax receivables and liabilities are recognised in the amount of an expected reimbursement from or payment to tax authorities based on the estimated tax rates valid as at the balance sheet date.\n\nSeveral years have not yet been conclusively assessed with regard to the Group's taxation. Jungheinrich believes that it has provided sufficiently for these outstanding tax assessment years.\n\n#### Pillar 2\n\nThe Group falls within the scope of the OECD Pillar 2 model rules. The Pillar 2 legislation has been adopted in Germany. As the new tax law only came into force in Germany from 1 January 2024, there was no impact on the actual tax expense for the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe Group applied the temporary, mandatory exemption rule with regard to the recognition of deferred taxes, which was the subject of the amendments to IAS 12 published in May 2023.\n\nThe Group has assessed the potential risk for the Group with regard to income taxes in accordance with Pillar 2.\n\nThe potential risk of income taxes under Pillar 2 was assessed on the basis of country-bycountry reporting (CbCR) and the Group's IFRS separate financial statements. Based on this assessment, the effective tax rates in most of the countries in which the Group operates are above 15 per cent. However, there are a limited number of countries where the effective tax rate under Pillar 2 is close to 15 per cent. The Group does not anticipate any material income tax charge under Pillar 2 in these countries.\n\nWhen stating deferred tax assets on the statement of financial position, the extent to which future effective tax relief might result from existing tax loss carryforwards and the differences in accounting and valuation must be assessed. In this context, all factors that could have a positive or negative influence have been taken into account. The current assessment in this regard may alter depending on changes to the earnings position in future years and may therefore result in a higher or lower impairment loss.\n\n#### Composition of deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\n|                                                            | Deferred tax assets |            | Deferred tax liabilities |            |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------|--------------------------|------------|\n| in € thousand                                              | 31/12/2023          | 31/12/2022 | 31/12/2023               | 31/12/2022 |\n| Property, plant and equipment<br>and intangible assets     | 357,058             | 337,723    | 142,310                  | 118,346    |\n| Inventories                                                | 19,897              | 13,981     | 12,294                   | 9,591      |\n| Receivables and other assets                               | 43,749              | 33,809     | 573,241                  | 512,427    |\n| Tax loss carryforwards                                     | 18,183              | 7,140      | –                        | –          |\n| Provisions for pensions<br>and similar obligations         | 21,867              | 15,920     | 726                      | 1,837      |\n| Other provisions                                           | 38,816              | 20,879     | 12,602                   | 9,648      |\n| Liabilities                                                | 520,187             | 463,740    | 192,095                  | 149,755    |\n| Deferred income                                            | 4,413               | 4,223      | –                        | –          |\n| Valuation allowances                                       | -12,596             | -7,111     | –                        | –          |\n| Other                                                      | 29,638              | 23,774     | 44,704                   | 48,748     |\n| Deferred taxes prior to offsetting                         | 1,041,212           | 914,078    | 977,972                  | 850,352    |\n| of which relating to non-current<br>assets and liabilities | 843,202             | 776,098    | 831,075                  | 677,425    |\n| Offsetting                                                 | -920,902            | -806,457   | -920,902                 | -806,457   |\n| Balance sheet recognition                                  | 120,310             | 107,621    | 57,070                   | 43,895     |\n\n€25,478 thousand (previous year: €14,360 thousand) of the net amount of the deferred taxes of €63,240 thousand (previous year: €63,726 thousand) was recognised directly in shareholders' equity.

This is because Jungheinrich is able to manage the timing of the reversal of temporary differences, and no turnaround is expected with regard to the temporary differences in the near future.\n\nThe following table shows the reconciliation of the expected amount with the disclosed tax expense. The expected tax expense reported represents the amount that results from applying the total tax rate of 30.6 per cent (previous year: 30.5 per cent) applicable to the parent company to consolidated earnings before income taxes. The figure for \"Change in taxes from the previous year\" arose as a result of deviations in assessments and company audits and an adjustment of deferred taxes. The change in valuation allowances is mainly attributable to the fact that loss carryforwards could be made utilisable following the acquisitions of Storage Solutions and Magazino GmbH, Munich (Germany) in 2023.\n\n#### Reconciliation of the expected tax expense to the disclosed tax expense\n\n| in € thousand                                        | 2023    | 2022

Please see the notes for more details on changes to the scope of consolidation.\n\nAn event-driven impairment test as of 31 December 2023 of the intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and trucks for short-term rental acquired revealed impairment losses on acquired intangible assets in the total amount of €379 thousand at the sales company in Ecuador resulting from a reduction in the future expected cash flows of the CGU. The estimate of the value in use for the Ecuador CGU, of €6,325 thousand, was calculated using a pre-tax discount rate of 23.8 per cent (previous year: 25.4 per cent). The impairment losses were recognised in selling expenses for 2023.\n\nJungheinrich Systemlösungen Deutschland AG & Co. KG (formerly: ISI Automation GmbH & Co.

The residual carrying amounts for the customer contracts acquired as part of the business combination totalling €953 thousand were derecognised through profit or loss in the year under review. The impairment losses were recognised in cost of sales for 2023.\n\nInternally generated intangible assets include the Jungheinrich Group's capitalised development expenditure. In the reporting year, €44,632 thousand in incurred development expenditure (previous year: €30,422 thousand) met the capitalisation criteria under IFRS.\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-131-0\"></span>Research and development costs in the consolidated statement of profit or loss\n\n| in € thousand                                                         | 2023    | 2022    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Research costs and uncapitalised development expenditure              | 107,160 | 97,443  |\n| Amortisation of capitalised development expenditure                   | 10,904  | 12,313  |\n| Impairment loss of capitalised development expenditure                | 4,163   | 3,347   |\n| Reversal of impairment loss of<br>capitalised development expenditure | 1,554   | –       |\n| Research and development costs                                        | 120,673 | 113,103 |\n\nJungheinrich decided in the year under review to discontinue the development of a technology. Development expenditure of €3,240 thousand already capitalised for this development project was recognised as an impairment in profit or loss under the 2023 research and development costs.\n\nAn event-driven impairment test as of 31 December 2023 of the intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and trucks for short-term rental acquired revealed impairment losses in the total amount of €923 thousand at six sales companies, primarily due to an increase in pre-tax discount rates in the sales region as of 31 December 2023, which were fully allocated to the capitalised development expenditure allocated to these CGUs. All impairment losses were recognised in the research and development costs for 2023.\n\nA need for an impairment reversal totalling €1,554 thousand as of 31 December 2023 was identified in seventeen sales companies. The reversals related to capitalised development services allocated to these sales companies from the plant in Qingpu/Shanghai (China) and resulted from the expansion of the plant's sales regions. The reversals were fully assigned to the capitalised development expenditure carrying amounts for products already in series production, and were reported as reversals of impairment losses in the amount of €1,554 thousand in profit or loss under the 2023 research and development costs.\n\nThe table below shows the allocation of goodwill to CGUs.\n\n#### Allocation of goodwill to the cash-generating units (CGUs)\n\n| in € thousand                                                                                                             | 31/12/2022 | Additions due to business combinations | Reallocation | Changes in currency exchange rates | 31/12/2023 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------|------------|\n| Storage Solutions                                                                                                         | –          | 287,148                                | –            | -13,019                            | 274,129    |\n| MIAS Group                                                                                                                | 24,109     | –                                      | –            | –                                  | 24,109     |\n| Sales company in:                                                                                                         |            |                                        |              |                                    |            |\n| Germany                                                                                                                   | 27,702     | 7,767                                  | 487          | –                                  | 35,956     |\n| France                                                                                                                    | 6,664      | 1,868                                  | 117          | –                                  | 8,649      |\n| United Kingdom                                                                                                            | 5,009      | 1,474                                  | 93           | 86                                 | 6,662      |\n| Italy                                                                                                                     | 5,194      | 1,456                                  | 91           | –                                  | 6,741      |\n| Sweden                                                                                                                    | 3,536      | 1,110                                  | 70           | 80                                 | 4,796      |\n| Poland                                                                                                                    | 3,061      | 838                                    | 53           | 255                                | 4,207      |\n| Spain                                                                                                                     | 2,984      | 837                                    | 53           | –                                  | 3,874      |\n| Serbia                                                                                                                    | 1,831      | –                                      | –            | 5                                  | 1,836      |\n| Austria                                                                                                                   | 1,771      | –                                      | –            | –                                  | 1,771      |\n| Jungheinrich Systemlösungen<br>GmbH, Graz (Austria)                                                                       | 102        | –                                      | -102         | –                                  | –          |\n| Jungheinrich Systemlösungen<br>Deutschland AG & Co.

Please see the notes for more details on changes to the scope of consolidation.\n\nThe goodwill acquired as part of the business combination with Magazino in 2023 was allocated to the sales companies in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Sweden, Poland and Spain. Please see the notes for more details on changes to the scope of consolidation.\n\nAs at the previous year's balance sheet date, goodwill totalling €862 thousand and €102 thousand was allocated to the CGUs Jungheinrich Systemlösungen Deutschland AG & Co. KG, Extertal (Germany) and Jungheinrich Systemlösungen GmbH, Graz (Austria). Jungheinrich reclassified the CGUs with effect from 1 January 2023. This goodwill was reallocated to seven sales companies as a result at the same time. The review of this goodwill as of 31 December 2022 did not result in any impairment losses.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Jungheinrich performed annual impairment tests on the goodwill assigned to CGUs. The review of goodwill did not result in any impairment losses.\n\nThe main assumptions on which the calculation of the value in use of a CGU was based were free cash flows, the discount rate and the long-term growth rate.\n\n| Financial assumptions for the purposes of calculating the value in use of the CGUs

Receivables from financial services\n\nWithin the framework of the financial services business in which Jungheinrich Group companies act as lessors, the net investment values of customer leases classified as \"finance leases\" in accordance with IFRS are capitalised as receivables from financial services from the beginning of the lease onwards. If the agreed residual value in the long-term customer contract is above the truck's expected market value at the end of the contract term, this risk is reflected by immediately reducing receivables from financial services recognised in profit or loss. Furthermore, the receivables from financial services reported as at the balance sheet date only include lease payments due in the future, and the carrying amounts are 100 per cent secured by the fair values of the trucks underlying the leases. This is why loss allowances for expected credit losses are not taken into account.\n\nLoss allowances for expected credit losses are determined for the amounts transferred to trade accounts receivable when the lease payments fall due, and they are recognised in note (19) [ [page](#page-141-0) 140 ].\n\nIn relation to the \"finance lease\" customer contracts valid as at the balance sheet date, the future lease payments to be paid to Jungheinrich are presented in the following table, broken down by maturity.\n\n#### Receivables from financial services: Maturity analysis and reconciliation of total outstanding lease payments with their net investment value\n\n| in € thousand                              | 31/12/2023       | 31/12/2022       |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Due in the following year                  | 513,163          | 457,324          |\n| Due in the second year                     | 415,079          | 368,697          |\n| Due in the third year                      | 326,281          | 281,189          |\n| Due in the fourth year                     | 237,015          | 195,433          |\n| Due in the fifth year                      | 143,997          | 110,375          |\n| Due in more than five years                | 109,175          | 72,647           |\n| <b>Total outstanding lease payments</b>    | <b>1,744,710</b> | <b>1,485,665</b> |\n| Plus unguaranteed residual value           | 189,683          | 172,259          |\n| Less unrealised interest income            | 283,007          | 195,217          |\n| <b>Receivables from financial services</b> | <b>1,651,386</b> | <b>1,462,707</b> |\n\nIn the reporting year, Jungheinrich realised income of around €148 million (previous year: around €100 million) from the difference between additions to \"finance lease\" customer contracts and the carrying amounts of the underlying assets.\n\nReceivables from financial services with carrying amounts of €824,967 thousand (previous year: €741,486) were pledged as collateral for liabilities from financial services as at the balance sheet date.\n\n#### (21) Other receivables and other assets\n\n#### Composition of other receivables and other assets\n\n| in € thousand                                       | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Receivables from other taxes                        | 41,467     | 41,632     |\n| Assets from the measurement of funded pension plans | 2,614      | 6,784      |\n| Prepaid expenses                                    | 19,858     | 16,309     |\n| Other financial assets                              | 14,367     | 18,000     |\n| Miscellaneous other assets                          | 19,649     | 19,593     |\n\nPrepaid expenses primarily consisted of deferred prepayments for software usage fees and insurance premiums.\n\nOther financial assets included receivables from joint ventures of €12,931 thousand (previous year: €15,364 thousand).

With this in mind, Jungheinrich absorbed the additional expenses incurred by the suppliers when purchasing electronic parts as a result of price increases. The suppliers use these electronic parts to make electronic components. As regards parts still in supplier inventories as of 31 December 2022, claims vis-à-vis suppliers of €2,091 thousand were recorded in miscellaneous other assets as of 31 December 2022. Jungheinrich ordered electronic components from suppliers in line with its incoming orders, which reduced receivables in 2023 by €1,187 thousand. The remaining claims vis-à-vis suppliers amounting to €904 thousand were derecognised through profit or loss in the year under review, as Jungheinrich will no longer have any significant consumption of these electronic components in future due to a redesign of the control units.\n\nThe credit risk for all other financial assets was rated as very low. As at the balance sheet date, loss allowances totalling €4 thousand were recognised for expected credit losses (previous year: €15 thousand). Details on the development of loss allowances can be found in note (33) [ [page](#page-155-0) 154 ].\n\nNo other receivables and other assets were either past due or impaired. As at the balance sheet date, there was no indication that the debtors could not meet their payment obligations.\n\n#### (22) Securities\n\n#### Composition of securities\n\n| in € thousand                                | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Commercial papers, bonds and debenture bonds | 87,897     | 131,736    |\n| Investment funds                             | 26,936     | 20,000     |\n| Promissory notes                             | 20,000     | 8,641      |\n| Covered bonds                                | 15,614     | 27,992     |\n| Shares                                       | –          | 9,751      |\n| Valuation allowances                         | -11        | -129       |\n| Securities                                   | 150,436    | 197,991    |\n\nThe total portfolio of securities included €28,999 thousand (previous year: €53,055 thousand) in financial instruments assigned to the measurement category \"at amortised cost\" as of 31 December 2023. These securities were held by Jungheinrich for the purpose of holding them to maturity and realising their contractual cash flows. Jungheinrich's securities as of 31 December 2023 will mature in the years 2024 and 2025. All of Jungheinrich's securities as of 31 December 2022 that were due to mature in 2023 were redeemed when they matured, as contractually agreed. The credit risk for securities measured at amortised cost was rated as low, with the result that the loss allowances were calculated based on the expected twelve-month credit losses. As at the balance sheet date, loss allowances in the amount of €11 thousand were recognised for expected credit losses in relation to these securities (previous year: €129 thousand). Details on the development of loss allowances can be found in note (33).\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, the total portfolio of securities also included €121,448 thousand (previous year: €145,065 thousand) in financial instruments assigned to the measurement category \"at fair value through profit or loss\". €94,512 thousand (previous year: €119,151 thousand) of the carrying amount of these financial instruments is attributable to securities held in the special fund.\n\n#### (23) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents are available at short notice and have an original maturity of up to three months. They also include fixed-term deposits with an original contractual term of up to twelve months. As at the balance sheet date, cash and cash equivalents included bank balances of €35,386 thousand (previous year: €6,814 thousand) held in the special fund, of which €23,500 thousand (previous year: €-thousand) related to term deposits with an original term of over three months and without the option of termination at no cost at short notice. €9,051 thousand (previous year: €9,368 thousand) in bank balances were pledged to banks as of 31 December 2023. As at the balance sheet date, loss allowances in the amount of €48 thousand were recognised for expected credit losses (previous year: €13 thousand).

As in the previous year, it was divided among 54,000,000 ordinary shares and 48,000,000 preferred shares, each accounting for an imputed €1.00 share of the subscribed capital. All of the shares had been issued as at the balance sheet date.\n\nHolders of no-par-value preferred shares will receive a preferential share of the profit of €0.04 per preferred share from the distributable profit that is distributed. On payment of a €0.04 share of the profit per ordinary share, the distributable profit remaining for distribution will be distributed among ordinary and preferred shareholders in line with the pro rata share of subscribed capital attributable to their shares, although unlike ordinary shareholders, preferred shareholders are entitled to an additional dividend of €0.02 per preferred share.\n\n#### Capital reserve\n\nThe capital reserve includes premiums from the issuance of shares and additional income from the sale of own shares in previous years.\n\n#### Retained earnings\n\nRetained earnings include undistributed earnings generated by Jungheinrich AG and consolidated subsidiaries in previous years, as well as profit or loss attributable to shareholders of Jungheinrich AG for the reporting period.\n\nIn the reporting year, a dividend for the 2022 financial year of €0.66 per ordinary share and €0.68 per preferred share was paid to the shareholders of Jungheinrich AG.\n\n#### Dividend proposal\n\nJungheinrich AG pays its dividend from the distributable profit stated in the annual financial statements of Jungheinrich AG, which are prepared in accordance with the German Commercial Code. The Board of Management of Jungheinrich AG proposes to use the €124,425 thousand distributable profit for the 2023 financial year to make a total dividend payment of €75,420 thousand, corresponding to a dividend of €0.73 per ordinary share and €0.75 per preferred share, as well as to transfer €49,005 thousand to other retained earnings.\n\n#### Accumulated other comprehensive income (expense)\n\n=\n\n🔍\n\n>\n\n<\n\n<<\n\nChanges in equity not recognised through profit or loss are reported in this item, provided they are not based on capital transactions with shareholders. The development of other changes in equity in the reportijng year and the previous year are recognised as other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income after taxes was exclusivly attributable to the shareholders of Jungheinrich AG.\n\nOther changes in equity in the amount of €– 64,866 thousand (previous year: €– 42,732 thousand) were attributable to the accumulated profit or loss recognised in other comprehensive income from the remeasurement of defined benefit pension plans. Details on the composition of the unrealised income of the reporting year can be found in note (25) [ [page](#page-146-0) 145 ]. As at the balance sheet date, other changes in equity included €–47,267 thousand (previous year: €–21,882 thousand) from the currency translation adjustment, including the impact of inflation on equity that arises as a result of applying the provisions of IAS 29.\n\nIn addition, other comprehensive income of €1,955 thousand (previous year: €13,866 thousand) related to the accumulated profit or loss recognised in other comprehensive income arising from the measurement at fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments as at the balance sheet date.

Please see the notes for the definition and calculation of ROCE in the combined management report for the 2023 financial year.\n\nROCE in the year under review was 15.9 per cent (previous year: 16.3 per cent).\n\n#### EBIT return on capital employed (ROCE) for the \"Intralogistics\" segment\n\n| in € thousand                  | 2023      | 2022      |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Average capital employed 31/12 | 2,563,471 | 2,084,951 |\n| EBIT                           | 407,063   | 340,113   |\n| ROCE in %                      | 15.9      | 16.3      |\n\nJungheinrich determines the key figure when preparing its quarterly financial statements. The statements are reported to the Board of Management once a quarter in order to enable it to take action as necessary.\n\n#### Non-controlling interests\n\nAs of 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, there were no non-controlling interests in equity.\n\n#### (25) Provisions for pensions and similar obligations\n\n#### Pension plans\n\nJungheinrich Group company pension schemes are either defined contribution or defined benefit plans. In defined contribution plans, Jungheinrich does not assume any obligation in addition to the contributions made to state-owned or private pension insurers. In the reporting year, expenses of €14,648 thousand for defined contribution plans (previous year: €16,432 thousand) were recognised in functional costs.\n\nIn Germany, major obligations have been assumed for defined benefit pension commitments regulated in individual and collective agreements for members of the Board of Management, managing directors and employees of Jungheinrich AG and its German subsidiaries. When pension benefits are committed to within the framework of collective agreements, the amount of the pension claim depends on the individual's number of eligible years of service when pension payments are scheduled to start, as well as on the monthly average salary of the beneficiary. German pension plans are funded by provisions. The company pension plans of Jungheinrich AG and of Jungheinrich Moosburg AG & Co. KG have been closed to managing directors and employees since 1 July 1987 and 14 April 1994 respectively.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, major obligations have been assumed to fulfil defined benefit pension commitments regulated in collective agreements and due to employees of Jungheinrich UK Ltd. and former employees of the Boss Manufacturing Ltd. production plant, which was closed in 2004. The pension plans of these companies were merged in 2003. The level of the benefit commitment depends on the average compensation received by the beneficiaries during their years of service. The pension plan is funded by an outsourced fund and has been closed to new employees of the two companies since 1 October 2002 and 18 January 2003 respectively. The pension plan was closed to current employees with effect from 31 July 2020. As a result, since 1 August 2020 employees have not been able to accrue any additional benefit claims by completing more years of service. The benefit claims accrued up until the plan was closed will continue to be adjusted in line with changes in the basis for calculating them.\n\nIn other countries outside of Germany, several companies have pension plans for managing directors and employees. The principle pension claims outside Germany are covered by insurance contracts.\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Balance sheet development of the net defined benefit

The net interest and the plan administration costs were included in financial income (expense).\n\n#### Significant financial assumptions (weighted average) for determining the present value of defined benefit obligations\n\n|                                      | Germany    |            | United Kingdom |            | Other countries |            |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|----------------|------------|-----------------|------------|\n| in %                                 | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 | 31/12/2023     | 31/12/2022 | 31/12/2023      | 31/12/2022 |\n| Discount rate                        | 3.5        | 4.2        | 4.8            | 5.0        | 2.3             | 3.0        |\n| Expected rate of<br>pension increase | 2.0        | 2.0        | 2.9            | 3.0        | 0.2             | 0.1        |\n\nThe demographic assumptions for Germany in the 2023 and 2022 financial years were based on Prof. Klaus Heubeck's 2018G mortality tables. In addition to the long-term pension trend of 2.0 per cent, adjustments of 5.3 per cent and 3.0 per cent were assumed for Germany for 2024 and 2025, in order to adequately account for the accumulated inflation for the upcoming adjustment dates.\n\nIn the reporting year, the valuation of pension plans in the United Kingdom was based on the SAPS S3PxA CMI 2022 mortality table (1.25 per cent) (previous year: SAPS S3PxA CMI 2021 (1.25 per cent)). The application of the new mortality table in the United Kingdom resulted in a reduction in the present value of defined benefit obligations of €3,799 thousand (previous year: €185 thousand) as at the balance sheet date. The life expectancies used to measure plans in other countries were based on local mortality tables.\n\nJungheinrich primarily derives the interest rate risk, the pension increase risk and the longevity risk from the pension plans. The sensitivity analyses presented below were performed on the basis of reasonable potential changes in the assumptions as at the balance sheet date, while the other assumptions remained unchanged.\n\n#### Sensitivity analysis of the significant financial assumptions: impact on the present value of defined benefit obligations\n\n| in € thousand                                 | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Discount rate 0.5% higher                     | -21,631    | -19,753    |\n| Discount rate 0.5% lower                      | 23,876     | 22,034     |\n| Expected rate of pension increase 0.5% higher | 15,621     | 11,477     |\n| Expected rate of pension increase 0.5% lower  | -12,607    | -10,287    |\n\nA one-year increase in life expectancy would cause the present value of the defined benefit obligations in Germany and the United Kingdom to rise by approximately 4.6 per cent (previous year: 4.2 per cent) and 2.8 per cent (previous year: 2.8 per cent), respectively.\n\nThe actual change in the present value of defined benefit obligations cannot be derived from the aforementioned sensitivity analysis. It is not expected that the deviations will occur in isolation from one another as some of the assumptions are related to each other.\n\nFurthermore, Jungheinrich is not exposed to any material risks arising from pension obligations.\n\nThe weighted average duration of defined benefit obligations on the balance sheet date was around 10 years in Germany (previous year: 10 years), around 14 years in the United Kingdom (previous year: 13 years) and around 13 years in other countries (previous year: 9 years).\n\nJungheinrich expects to make approximately €10.1 million (previous year: €9.7 million) in pension payments using company assets in the 2024 financial year.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\n#### Plan assets\n\nIn the year under review, the actual return on plan assets amounted to €7,439 thousand (previous year: €– 97,249 thousand). As in the previous year, there were no effects from a limitation to the asset ceiling.\n\nPlan assets largely comprised the outsourced fund set up to cover pension obligations in the UK. The assets and income from the pension fund are intended exclusively for the payment of benefits and administrative expenses for the pension plan. Jungheinrich works with an external asset manager to invest in the plan assets. Our long-term investment strategy complies with, among other things, minimum capital cover requirements and the goal of maximising income from the plan assets while keeping volatility at a reasonable level in order to minimise the long-term costs of defined benefit pension plans. Plan asset investments are made while ensuring that cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to cover benefits that fall due.\n\n#### Composition of the fair value of the plan assets in the United Kingdom\n\n| in € thousand                                              | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                  | 1,420      | 1,494      |\n| Equity instruments                                         | 32,028     | 34,903     |\n| Stock index funds in the United Kingdom                    | 19,113     | 20,614     |\n| Stock index funds in Europe (excluding the United Kingdom) | 12,915     | 14,289     |\n| Debt instruments                                           | 132,503    | 130,037    |\n| United Kingdom government bonds                            | 116,673    | 111,592    |\n| Corporate bonds                                            | 15,830     | 18,445     |\n| Miscellaneous                                              | 2,100      | –          |\n| Fair value on 31/12                                        | 168,051    | 166,434    |\n\nThe fair values of the aforementioned equity and debt instruments were determined on the basis of prices quoted on active markets.\n\nThe fair value of plan assets in the other countries totalled €61,864 thousand (previous year: €54,582 thousand) and cannot be broken down into asset classes as these plan assets are qualifying insurance policies.\n\nAs in the previous year, the outsourced pension funds did not include any own financial instruments or property used by Group companies as at the balance sheet date.\n\nJungheinrich expects to make cash-effective employer contributions totalling approximately €4.7 million for the 2024 financial year (previous year: €4.2 million) in order to comply with minimum statutory and contractual requirements.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-150-0\"></span>(26) Other provisions\n\n#### Development of other provisions\n\n| in € thousand                       | Balance as of<br>01/01/2023 | Changes<br>in currency<br>exchange rates | Additions from<br>business<br>combinations | Additions | Utilisations | Releases | Balance as<br>of 31/12/2023 |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|----------|-----------------------------|\n| Provisions for personnel            | 185,561                     | –1,774                                   | 7,529                                      | 198,193   | 141,061      | 5,221    | 243,227                     |\n| Provisions for warranty obligations | 63,500                      | –401                                     | 4                                          | 97,805    | 89,566       | 3,024    | 68,318                      |\n| Provisions for onerous contracts    | 54,969                      | –258                                     | –                                          | 21,897    | 22,683       | 2,034    | 51,891                      |\n| Other provisions                    | 54,307                      | –875                                     | 365                                        | 31,735    | 11,707       | 4,472    | 69,353                      |\n| Other provisions                    | 358,337                     | –3,308                                   | 7,898                                      | 349,630   | 265,017      | 14,751   | 432,789                     |\n\nProvisions for personnel as of 31 December 2023 primarily related to provisions for obligations arising from phased retirement agreements, anniversary obligations, performance-related remuneration and holiday entitlements.\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, obligations arising from phased retirement agreements amounted to €28,339 thousand (previous year: €25,937 thousand), which were netted against €15,656 thousand in financial assets (previous year: €12,956 thousand). Cash and cash equivalents and securities were transferred to an external trust in order to finance these obligations. These trust assets are being exclusively held to secure long-term benefits due to employees within the scope of phased retirement agreements and qualify as plan assets in accordance with IAS 19. The cash and cash equivalents and securities are not freely available due to the hedging role they play for these agreements. Furthermore, €1,523 thousand in provisions were accrued to cover the claims of candidates potentially qualifying for future phased retirement work arrangements commensurate to their probability of occurrence (previous year: €3,300 thousand).\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, there were also obligations related to performance-based payments totalling €21,858 thousand (previous year: €7,389 thousand), which were agreed in connection with business combinations. These earn-out payments are accumulated under personnel provisions until the individual tranches are due.\n\nAdditions to provisions for personnel included a total of €884 thousand in interest accretions and changes in discount rates (previous year: €–1,048 thousand), which were recognised in the other financial income (expense) for the year under review. €42,237 thousand (previous year: €32,271 thousand) of the provisions for personnel had a remaining maturity of more than one year. The increase in the non-current item was primarily due to additions to performance-based payment obligations in connection with business combinations.\n\nThe Group recognises provisions for warranty obligations based on past experience when products are sold or when new warranty measures are initiated. These provisions relate to the assessment of the extent to which warranty obligations must be met in the future, and to the cost involved. Provisions for warranty obligations contain the expected expense of statutory and contractual warranty claims as well as the expected expense of voluntary concessions and recall actions. Additions to warranty obligations cover the product-related warranty expenses for the 2023 financial year for material handling equipment sold in the year under review.\n\nThe provisions for onerous contracts primarily related to impending losses from contracts with customers. Impending losses from cancellations of contracts and other contractual risks were also recognised.\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, €6,923 thousand (previous year: €4,647 thousand) of the provisions for onerous contracts had a remaining term to maturity of more than one year.\n\nOther provisions contained provisions for disposal obligations, legal disputes, environmental risks and other obligations. €40,832 thousand (previous year: €29,714 thousand) of the other provisions had a remaining term to maturity of more than one year as at the balance sheet date. The increase in non-current other provisions related primarily to further additions to provisions for disposal obligations.\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### (27)

In such cases, due to the contractually agreed repurchase obligations, Jungheinrich Group companies had commercial ownership despite the sale of the trucks to the leasing company/bank. The resultant IFRS obligation to capitalise this ownership led to the deferral of the sales proceeds that have already been received from the leasing company. This deferred income is reversed using the straight-line method with an effect on revenue until the agreed residual value is paid.\n\nDeferred profit from financial services related to sale and leaseback transactions for refinancing trucks for lease that were concluded before the initial application of IFRS 16 \"Leases\". Deferred profit is reversed over the remaining terms of the leases.\n\nOther deferrals as of 31 December 2023 included €707 thousand (previous year: €5,363 thousand) in government grants. Deferred government grants for acquired property, plant and equipment totalling €4,427 thousand as of 31 December 2022 were derecognised from other deferrals at the beginning of the 2023 financial year and recognised as a reduction in the acquisition and manufacturing costs of the property, plant and equipment on which the grants are based.\n\n#### (32) Other liabilities\n\n#### Composition of

was determined in line with generally acknowledged valuation models based on discounted cash flow analyses and using observable current market prices for similar instruments. The fair value of currency forwards is determined using the mean spot rate as at the balance sheet date, adjusted up or down to reflect the remaining term of the futures contract. The fair value of interest rate derivatives is determined on the basis of the market interest rates and interest rate curves on the balance sheet date, taking their maturities into account. Jungheinrich has taken counterparty risks into consideration when measuring fair value.\n\nThe fair value of Level 3 financial instruments related to other financial assets.

The fair value for these shares was calculated based on amortised cost as at the balance sheet date.\n\nNo transfers between Levels 1 and 2 took place in the reporting period.\n\nFurther information on measurement levels is provided in the chapter on accounting principles.\n\nCurrent interest rates at which comparable loans with identical maturities as at the balance sheet date could have been taken out were used to determine the fair values of liabilities due to banks, promissory notes and commercial papers, as well as of receivables and liabilities from financial services.\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\nThe fair values of interest-bearing securities with maturities categorised as \"at amortised cost\" corresponded to the fair values available as at the balance sheet date.\n\nCash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable primarily have short terms of maturity. Their carrying amounts as at the balance sheet date therefore roughly corresponded to their fair values.\n\nFor non-current other financial assets with variable interest rates, it was assumed for reasons of simplicity that their fair values correspond to their carrying amounts since the interest rates contractually agreed and realisable on the market were virtually at the same level. For the current other financial assets, their carrying amounts as at the balance sheet date approximated their fair values.\n\nOther financial assets comprise investments in non-consolidated affiliated companies, joint ventures and other investments and were measured at fair value in the consolidated financial statements. The shares did not have a quoted market price. The fair value for these shares was calculated based on amortised cost as at the balance sheet date.\n\n#### Development of the fair value of Level 3 financial instruments\n\n| in € thousand

was assumed that the fair values of trade accounts payable and other financial liabilities corresponded to the carrying amounts of these financial instruments owing to their short remaining terms to maturity.\n\nAs regards liabilities from financing trucks for short-term rental with variable interest rates, it was assumed for reasons of simplicity that their fair values corresponded to their carrying amounts since the interest rates agreed and realisable on the market were almost identical.\n\nThe carrying amounts of current, interest-bearing financial liabilities corresponded almost exactly to their fair values.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Hierarchy levels for financial instruments which are not measured at fair value and for which the

statement of cash flows\n\nCash flows have been presented in the statement of cash flows independently of the structure of the statement of financial position and are broken down into cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash flows from investing and financing activities were directly attributed to corresponding cash flows. Cash flow from operating activities was derived indirectly.\n\nCash flow from operating activities was derived from profit or loss, which was adjusted to exclude non-cash income and expenses, mainly consisting of depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses, along with monetary profit or loss resulting from the application of IAS 29. Changes in working capital are also taken into account. Cash flow from operating activities also included changes in the carrying amounts of trucks for short-term rental and trucks for lease as well as liabilities and deferred revenue and profit stemming from the financing of these assets. Changes to carrying amounts for right-of-use assets on property, plant and equipment, and non-cash changes and the interest portion of lease payments for the corresponding lease liabilities are also reported under cash flow from operating activities.\n\nCash flow from investing activities included disposals and additions on property, plant and equipment without right-of-use assets capitalised and intangible assets and in particular additions in capitalised development expenditure. In addition, the cash flow from investing activities includes: purchases and sales of securities; inflows and outflows from time deposits with an original term of more than three months and without a short-term, cost-free termination option; inflows and outflows for loans granted to related parties; purchase price payments for business combinations, and payments for investments in companies accounted for using the equity method and other financial assets, as well as inflows from the sale of other financial assets. Cash flow from investing activities of €–325.7 million in 2023 was affected by the purchase price for the acquisition of Storage Solutions and Magazino GmbH, Munich (Germany), less acquired cash and cash equivalents.\n\nCash flow from financing activities included capital-related transactions, dividend payments, cash flow from obtaining and repaying long-term financial loans including promissory notes and commercial papers, and changes in short-term liabilities due to banks. In addition, the repayment portion of the lease payments were reported under cash flow from financing activities in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 16 \"Leases\". Cash flow from financing activities of €300.0 million in 2023 related to the purchase price financing for the acquisition of Storage Solutions, which was reported under changes in short-term liabilities to banks.\n\nThe changes to the balance sheet items shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows cannot be traced directly back to the consolidated statement of financial position, because non-cash effects resulting from currency translations and changes to the scope of consolidation are calculated out.\n\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the year correspond to the amount disclosed for cash and cash equivalents on the statement of financial position, less the cash and cash equivalents not freely available to Jungheinrich. The way the balance sheet item for cash and cash equivalents reconciles in respect of the figures for cash and cash equivalents according to the consolidated statement of cash flows can be seen in the table below.\n\n#### Derivation of cash and cash equivalents according to the consolidated statement of cash flows:\n\n| in € thousand

companies are involved in ongoing legal or arbitration proceedings that could have a considerable impact on the Group's economic situation, are likely to become involved in such litigation, or had done so within the last two years.\n\nThe respective Group companies have accrued provisions sufficient to cover financial burdens potentially resulting from other legal or arbitration proceedings.\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, Jungheinrich had issued letters of comfort for joint ventures and associated companies to secure €10,920 thousand in credit lines (previous year: €19,988 thousand). Against the backdrop of the companies' appropriate funding, it was assumed that the underlying obligations would be met; no withdrawals were anticipated.\n\n#### (36) Other financial obligations\n\nPurchase commitments for capital expenditure exclusively on property, plant and equipment totalled €6,755 thousand as at the balance sheet date (previous year: €22,882 thousand).\n\nGroup companies have entered into leases and service agreements for vehicles at their various locations. As at the balance sheet date, payment obligations for the non-lease components of these contracts amounted to €22,957 thousand (previous year: €20,659 thousand).\n\nIn addition, the Jungheinrich Group incurred payment obligations totalling €108,636 thousand (previous year: €76,460 thousand) for long-term software use and maintenance contracts and leases for low-value assets as at the balance sheet date, as well as other service contracts.\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\n#### (37) Risk management and financial instruments\n\n#### Risk management principles\n\nThe Jungheinrich Group's risk management system is designed to enable the company to identify developments in financial price risks – resulting primarily from interest rate and currency risks – early on and react to them via systematic courses of action both rapidly and effectively. Furthermore, it ensures that the Group only concludes financial transactions for which it possesses the necessary expertise and technical preconditions.\n\nFinancial markets present the opportunity to transfer risks to other market participants who have a comparative advantage or a higher capacity for accepting risks. The Jungheinrich Group makes use of these opportunities solely to hedge risks arising from underlying operating transactions and to invest or raise liquidity. Group guidelines do not allow the conclusion of financial transactions that are speculative in nature. As a rule, the Jungheinrich Group's financial transactions may only be concluded with banks or leasing companies as contractual partners.\n\nThe Board of Management as a whole bears responsibility for the initiation of organisational measures required to limit financial price risks. Jungheinrich has established a risk controlling and risk management system that enables it to identify, measure, monitor and control its risk positions. Risk management encompasses the development and determination of methods to measure risk and performance, monitor established risk limits and set up the associated reporting system.\n\nJungheinrich controls financial risks arising from its core business centrally as part of the Group strategy. Risks stemming from the Jungheinrich Group's financial services operations are subject to a separate risk management system.\n\nRisks specific to the financial services business are determined by residual value risks, refinancing risks and counterparty credit risks.\n\nA material element of risk management in the financial service business is a contract database based on SAP-ERP and the Global Lease Center (GLC), which is used by smaller sales companies, that allows uniform recording, risk analysis and risk evaluation of financial service agreements throughout the Group.\n\nThe contractually agreed residual values are calculated on the basis of a conservative uniform Group standard for maximum permissible residual values. The residual values of all individual contracts are subjected to a quarterly evaluation using the central financial services contracts database on the basis of their current fair value. If the originally calculated residual value is higher than the actual fair value at the end of the respective contract's term, the risk is taken into consideration depending on the classification of the long-term customer contract through a reduction of the carrying amounts \"Trucks for lease from financial services\" or \"Receivables from financial services\" with effect on profit or loss.\n\nFinancial service agreements are wherever possible refinanced in accordance with the principle of matching maturities and interest rates for customer and refinancing contracts.\n\nReference is made to the commentary on credit risks as regards general creditworthiness and contingent loss risks in connection with customers.\n\nBreak clauses agreed on in customer contracts are limited by central parameters and linked to risk-minimising performance targets. The earnings risk potentially resulting from break clauses is covered by accruing suitable provisions.\n\n#### Market price risks\n\nMarket price risks are risks arising from changes in an item's realisable income or value, with the item being defined as an item on the assets or liabilities side of the statement of financial position. These risks result from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, share prices and other items and factors affecting the formation of prices. These parameters are used to determine the interest rate risk, the currency risk and the share price risk exposure of the Jungheinrich Group. There were no noteworthy risk concentrations in the year under review, as was the case in the previous year.\n\n#### Interest rate risks\n\nInterest rate risks result from the Group's financing and cash investment activity. Fixed and variable-interest items are regarded separately in order to determine this risk. Net positions are formed from interest-bearing instruments on the assets and liabilities sides and hedges are concluded to cover these net positions, if necessary. Interest rate swaps were used to hedge interest rates in the reporting period.\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\nThe interest rate risk from investments is composed of the shares accounted for at fair value through profit or loss, pension futures and pension funds amounting to €132,946 thousand (previous year: €112,791 thousand), which are largely held in a special fund. If going interest rates as at the balance sheet date had been 100 basis points higher (lower), this would have led to a change in the fair value in the amount of €486 thousand (previous year: €1,027 thousand).\n\nThe Jungheinrich Group's interest rate risks include cash flow risks arising from variableinterest financial instruments for which no interest rate hedges have been concluded. These financial instruments were analysed as follows based on the assumption that the amount of liabilities outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the full year.\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, the net exposure of variable-interest financial instruments was at €492,942 thousand (previous year: €158,516 thousand). If going interest rates had been 100 basis points higher on 31 December 2023, income would have been €4,929 thousand (previous year: €1,589 thousand) lower. If going interest rates had been 100 basis points lower, income would have been €4,929 thousand (previous year: €1,589 thousand) higher.\n\nFor interest rate swaps designated as a hedging instrument as at the balance sheet date, such an increase (decrease) in the market interest level would have resulted in a change in fair value of €+5,685 thousand (€–5,886 thousand) recognised in other comprehensive income with no effect on profit or loss.\n\n#### Currency risks\n\nWhen calculating this risk position, the Jungheinrich Group considers foreign currency inflows and outflows, primarily from revenue and purchases based on fixed and flexible contracts. This risk position reflects the net currency exposure resulting from balancing counteracting cash flows in individual currencies while taking hedges already concluded for the period in question into account. Jungheinrich used currency forwards and currency swaps to manage risks during the reporting period. In accordance with the Jungheinrich Group's risk management principles, a maximum of 75 per cent of the volumes to be hedged are designated as underlying transactions. These, in turn, can be fully hedged.\n\nThe Jungheinrich Group applies the value-at-risk approach to quantify its risk position. The value-at-risk indicates the maximum loss that may not be exceeded before the end of a predetermined holding period with a certain probability (confidence level). Parameters and market volatility, which are used to quantify risk, are calculated based on the standard deviation of logarithmic changes in the last 180 trading days and converted to a one-day holding period with a one-sided confidence level of 95 per cent.\n\nTo manage risk, a maximum loss limit for the entire Group is determined based on the company's planning. Furthermore, corresponding lower limits are determined at the individual Group company level. These limits are compared to the current value-at-risk for all open positions as part of monthly reporting.\n\nBy applying the value-at-risk method as of 31 December 2023, the maximum risk did not exceed €1,414 thousand (previous year: €2,345 thousand) based on a holding period of one day and a confidence level of 95 per cent. In the reporting period, the value-at-risk was between a minimum of €1,414 thousand (previous year: €1,342 thousand) and a maximum of €2,492 thousand (previous year: €2,370 thousand). The average for the year was €2,058 thousand (previous year: €2,012 thousand).\n\nAdditionally, hedging of foreign currency risks takes place in the Jungheinrich Group with matching amounts and identical maturities from intragroup financing via currency swaps.\n\n#### Share price risks\n\nJungheinrich has invested €125,000 thousand (previous year: €125,000 thousand) in cash and cash equivalents in a special fund. Shares, stock index funds and share derivatives held in this fund and directly held equity funds expose the Jungheinrich Group to a significant share price risk. On 31 December 2023, the total share price risk exposure of Jungheinrich Group amounted to €18,185 thousand (previous year: €8,944 thousand). If the share price level had been 10 per cent higher (lower) on 31 December 2023, this would have led to additional income (losses) in other financial income (expense) of €1,819 thousand (previous year: €894 thousand).\n\nThe special fund is managed to maintain value in order to limit share price risks. The lower value limit specified for the reporting year was not reached at any time.\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\n#### Credit risks\n\nJungheinrich's exposure to credit risks stems almost exclusively from its core business. Trade accounts receivable from operations are constantly monitored by the business units responsible for them. Loss allowances for expected credit losses are recognised in order to offset the credit risks.\n\nThe entire business is continuously subjected to creditworthiness checks. Given the overall exposure to credit risks, accounts receivable from major customers are not substantial enough to give rise to extraordinary risk concentrations. Agreements made with customers and measures taken within the scope of risk management that minimise the creditworthiness risk largely consist of agreements on prepayments made by customers, the sharing of risks with financing partners and the permanent monitoring of customers via information portals. In addition, selected operating trade accounts receivable are collateralised by federal government credit insurance and private credit insurance covering 90 per cent of the respective receivable amount. Letters of credit are also used for collateral and generally cover 100 per cent of the receivable amount. There were no significant changes to the quality of the collateral during the reporting periods.\n\nNotwithstanding existing collateral securities, in principle the carrying amounts of the financial assets in the balance sheet represent the maximum credit risk. As at the balance sheet date, there were no major agreements that reduced the maximum credit risk such as offsetting arrangements.\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss had carrying amounts totalling €128,569 thousand (previous year: €149,464 thousand) as of 31 December 2023 in the balance sheet. The carrying amounts reflect the maximum credit risk of these financial instruments.\n\n#### Liquidity risks\n\nA liquidity reserve consisting of lines of credit and of cash is kept in order to ensure that the Jungheinrich Group can meet its payment obligations and maintain its financial flexibility at all times. Medium-term credit lines have been granted by the Group's principal banks and are supplemented by short-term credit lines of individual Group companies awarded by local banks.\n\n#### Counterparty risks\n\nThe Group is exposed to counterparty risks that arise from the non-fulfilment of contractual agreements by counterparties. To mitigate these risks, such contracts are only concluded with selected financial institutions, which meet the internal demands placed on the creditworthiness of business partners. The creditworthiness of contractual partners is constantly monitored on the basis of their credit rating, which is determined by reputable rating agencies, as well as on the basis of additional risk indicators. No major risks ensued for Jungheinrich from its dependence on individual counterparties as at the balance sheet date. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are adjusted by the risk values calculated using analytical tools (credit value adjustment/debit value adjustment).\n\nWith regard to cash and cash equivalents and investments in securities, the Group monitors changes to the credit risk by tracking published ratings. To determine whether there are material increases in credit risks as at the balance sheet date which are not reflected in published ratings, the Group also monitors price changes for credit default swaps (CDSs) as well as press releases and regulatory information about the issuer. In accordance with Group investment policies, capital expenditure is only made in financial assets if they have an investment grade rating. Impairment losses for expected credit losses are calculated based on the three-level model in IFRS 9. Potential future impairment losses are calculated for all cash and cash equivalents and securities for the expected 12-month credit loss (Level 1). They are reclassified to Level 2 if the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly compared to its initial recognition. Were contractual payments to become more than 30 days overdue, this would not by itself signal a significant increase in the credit risk, but it would indicate that a significant increase in the credit risk might have occurred. Jungheinrich's risk management system treats a downgrading of the counterparty's external rating below investment grade as a criterion for a significant increase in the credit risk. There were no reclassifications from Level 1 to Level 2 in the 2023 and 2022 financial years.\n\nThe general liquidity risk from the financial instruments used, which arises if a counterparty fails to meet its payment obligations or only meets them to a limited extent, is considered to be negligible.\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\n#### Hedging relationships\n\nThe Jungheinrich Group concludes cash flow hedges to secure, among other things, future variable cash flows resulting from revenue and purchases of materials that are partially realised and partially forecasted, but highly probable. Comprehensive documentation ensures the clear assignment of hedges and underlying transactions. A maximum of 75 per cent of the volumes to be hedged are designated as underlying transactions. These, in turn, can be fully hedged.\n\nIn order to hedge against interest rate risks, cash flows from tranches of a promissory note with variable interest rates are hedged with a matching maturity and an identical payment schedule by means of suitable interest rate swaps.\n\nFurthermore, the variable-interest liabilities existing for the purpose of financing the financial services business via the Group's financing company Elbe River Capital S.A., Luxembourg, are hedged against interest rate risks via interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.\n\nThe hedging ratio for all risk types is generally 1:1.\n\nThe effectiveness of hedging relationships is determined in each case at the beginning of the hedging relationship and through regular prospective assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.\n\nThe hedging relationships can prospectively be classified as highly effective. An assessment of the retrospective effectiveness of hedging relationships is conducted at the end of every quarter using the dollar-offset method together with the hypothetical-derivative method.\n\nHedging can become ineffective if the counterparty's credit risk changes.\n\n#### Nominal values of derivative financial instruments\n\n#### Nominal volume of derivative financial instruments\n\n|                                    | Nominal volume of hedging<br>instruments for cash flow hedges |                    | Nominal volume of<br>other derivatives |        |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|--------|\n| in € thousand                      | Currency<br>hedges                                            | Interest<br>hedges | Currency<br>hedges                     | Other  |\n| 31/12/2023                         |                                                               |                    |                                        |        |\n| Total nominal volume               | 249,594                                                       | 336,074            | 477,224                                | 29,631 |\n| Maturities of up to one year       | 208,935                                                       | 83,286             | 477,224                                | 29,631 |\n| Maturities of one to five years    | 40,659                                                        | 220,576            | –                                      | –      |\n| Maturities of more than five years | –                                                             | 32,212             | –                                      | –      |\n\n#### 31/12/2022\n\n| Total nominal volume               | 209,940 | 344,226 | 312,062 | 26,212 |\n|------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Maturities of up to one year       | 182,960 | 83,841  | 312,062 | 26,212 |\n| Maturities of one to five years    | 26,980  | 213,937 | –       | –      |\n| Maturities of more than five years | –       | 46,448  | –       | –      |\n\nThe nominal values of the currency hedging contracts primarily contain currency forwards that are used to hedge against rolling twelve-month exposure in individual currencies.

As at the balance sheet date the average hedging rate was 0.85 per cent (previous year: 1.23 per cent) for interest rate hedges in EUR and 2.30 per cent (previous year: 3.41 per cent) for interest rate hedges in GBP.\n\n#### Interest hedges: future cash flows that are not discounted\n\n| in € thousand                          | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|----------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Due within one year                    | 5,759      | 6,020      |\n| Due in one to five years               | -948       | 9,614      |\n| Due in more than five years            | -40        | 365        |\n| Total future non-discounted cash flows | 4,771      | 15,999     |\n\nThe nominal volume of the other derivative financial instruments included listed futures and options in special funds.\n\nThe transactions underlying the cash flow hedges are expected to be realised in line with the maturities of the hedges shown in the table.\n\nThe fair values of the underlying transactions and hedging instruments are used to measure effectiveness. Hedging measures were not associated with any material ineffectiveness until the balance sheet date.\n\nFor the currency forwards from cash flow hedges existing as at the balance sheet date, the change in the fair values of the hedging transactions amounted to €–2,124 thousand (previous year: €2,674 thousand). The change in the fair values of the underlying transactions amounted to €2,118 thousand (previous year: €–2,674 thousand).\n\nFor the interest rate hedging contracts existing as at the balance sheet date, the change in the fair values of the hedging transactions as at the balance sheet date was €4,587 thousand (previous year: €15,106 thousand). The change in the fair values of the underlying transactions amounted to €– 4,586 thousand (previous year: €–15,066 thousand).\n\n#### Fair values of derivative financial instruments\n\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument is the price at which the instrument could have been sold on the market as at the balance sheet date. Fair values were calculated on the basis of market-related information available as at the balance sheet date and on the basis of measurement methods stated in note (33) [ [page](#page-155-0) 154 ] that are based on specific prices. In view of the varying influencing factors, the values stated here may differ from the values realised later on the market.\n\n#### Fair values of derivative financial instruments\n\n| in € thousand                              | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Derivative financial assets                | 13,852     | 22,974     |\n| Derivatives with a hedging relationship    | 7,729      | 19,353     |\n| Currency forwards/currency swaps           | 604        | 3,884      |\n| Interest rate swaps                        | 7,125      | 15,469     |\n| Derivatives without a hedging relationship | 6,123      | 3,621      |\n| Currency forwards/currency swaps           | 5,564      | 2,736      |\n| Futures                                    | 559        | 885        |\n| Derivative financial liabilities           | 7,830      | 4,374      |\n| Derivatives with a hedging relationship    | 4,992      | 1,553      |\n| Currency forwards/currency swaps           | 3,098      | 1,520      |\n| Interest rate swaps                        | 1,894      | 33         |\n| Derivatives without a hedging relationship | 2,838      | 2,821      |\n| Currency forwards/currency swaps           | 2,822      | 2,779      |\n| Futures                                    | 16         | 42         |\n\nDetails regarding the development of the fair value of derivatives in hedging relationships in the reporting year and previous year can be found in note (24) [ [page](#page-145-0) 144 ].\n\n#### Offsetting of derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Group concludes derivative transactions according to a German framework agreement and similar national framework agreements. These agreements do not fulfil the criteria for offsetting to take place in the consolidated statement of financial position, since they only grant the right to offsetting if future events occur, such as the default or insolvency of the Group or the counterparty. All currency and interest rate hedging contracts belonging to the Jungheinrich Group fall under existing global netting agreements, meaning that, taking into account the counterparty structure, the offsetting potential as of 31 December 2023 would amount to €5,373 thousand (previous year: €3,518 thousand).\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information\n\nAs at the balance sheet date, the gross value of derivative financial assets from currency and interest rate hedging contracts amounted to €13,293 thousand (previous year: €22,089 thousand), and the gross amount of derivative financial liabilities from currency and interest rate hedging contracts was €7,814 thousand (previous year: €4,332 thousand). After netting, this would result in receivables in the amount of €7,920 thousand (previous year: €18,571 thousand) and liabilities in the amount of €2,441 thousand (previous year: €814 thousand).\n\n#### (38) Segment information\n\nJungheinrich is one of the world's leading solutions providers for the intralogistics sector. With a comprehensive portfolio of material handling equipment, automated systems and services, Jungheinrich is able to offer customers solutions to the challenges posed by Industry 4.0.\n\nThe integrated business model encompasses the development, production and sale of new material handling equipment and the planning and realisation of automation projects, the short-term rental of new and used material handling equipment, the refurbishment and sale of used trucks and after-sales services. Jungheinrich also supplies stacker cranes and load handling equipment.\n\nIn addition, customers receive their entire factory and office equipment from a single source. In addition to electric engines and drive controls, Jungheinrich also manufactures matching lithium-ion batteries and battery chargers. Digital products based on the latest generation of the Jungheinrich Internet of Things platform in the cloud, complement the portfolio. Customers also have access to a comprehensive range of financial services.\n\nThe Board of Management of Jungheinrich AG acts and makes decisions with overall responsibility for all the Group's business areas. Jungheinrich's business model is designed to serve customers from a single source over a product's entire life cycle.\n\nSegment reporting is in line with the internal organisational and reporting structure, thus encompassing the reportable segments \"Intralogistics\" and \"Financial Services\".\n\nThe \"Intralogistics\" segment encompasses the development, production, sale and short-term rental of new material handling equipment and warehousing equipment products including automation as well as the sale and short-term leasing of used trucks and after-sales services, consisting of maintenance, repair and spare parts.\n\nActivities undertaken by the \"Financial Services\" segment encompass the sales financing and usage transfer of material handling equipment and warehousing equipment products. In line with Jungheinrich's business model, this independent business area supports the operating sales units of the \"Intralogistics\" segment. In this context, the \"Financial Services\" segment finances itself autonomously.\n\nSegment information is generally subject to the disclosure and measurement methods applied in the consolidated financial statements. One exception is that the segments do not determine or record impairments for expected credit losses pursuant to IFRS 9 \"Financial instruments\" for intragroup receivables. Business segments were not aggregated.\n\nThe segment income (expense) is presented as earnings before taxes (EBT). Income tax expense is not reported and managed by segment at Jungheinrich. Income tax expense is therefore only stated as a summarised item at the Group level. Accordingly, profit or loss is only stated for the Jungheinrich Group.\n\nCapital expenditure, depreciation and amortisation, impairment losses as well as reversal of impairments concern property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, excluding capitalised development expenditure and excluding capitalised usage rights on property, plant and equipment. Segment assets and segment liabilities encompass all assets and liabilities allocable to the segment in question. All items on the statement of financial position relating to effective and deferred income tax expense are therefore also included.\n\nThe \"Intralogistics\" segment acquires products from long-term customer lease agreements at the end of the term of these agreements at contractually agreed residual values from the \"Financial Services\" segment. If the contractually agreed residual value is above the current fair value at the end of an agreement's term, the \"Intralogistics\" segment will take this residual value risk into consideration by forming appropriate reserves for onerous contracts. Within the Jungheinrich Group, these residual value risks are represented as reductions in either the carrying amounts of trucks for lease from financial services, receivables from financial services and/or the inventories affected, depending on the classification of long-term customer contracts. The figures from this cross-segment offsetting were included in the reconciliation items for 2023 and 2022.\n\nThe reconciliation items in the reporting year and 2022 also included the intragroup revenue, interest, interim profits and receivables and liabilities eliminated within the scope of consolidation.\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Segment information

All transactions with these companies are conducted on arm's length terms.\n\nInformation about the remuneration of the Supervisory Board and Board of Management can be found in note (43).\n\n#### (43) Total remuneration of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board\n\nTotal remuneration of the active members of the Board of Management pursuant to Section 314, Paragraph 1, Item 6a HGB amounted to €7,281 thousand in 2023 (previous year: €4,930 thousand). In addition to basic remuneration, this included remuneration in kind and fringe benefits, the short-term incentive (STI) and long-term incentive (LTI – a share-based performance-related component with a long-term incentive effect). The appropriateness requirement was taken into consideration when determining the individual variable remuneration.\n\nThe LTI has a term of three years and is allocated annually in the form of virtual performance share (VPS) tranches. Settlement occurs exclusively in cash at the end of the relevant performance period. The target amount forms the basis for the allocation and amounts to 55 per cent of the basic remuneration for each member of the Board of Management. At the start of the term, the target amount is divided by Jungheinrich AG's average share price (the arithmetical mean of the closing prices in the last 120 trading days before the start of the performance period) to calculate the number of virtual shares (VPS) assigned conditionally. The target values for the performance criteria are set by the Supervisory Board, and the degree to which they have been achieved is decided by the Supervisory Board after the end of the performance period. The number of final VPS is always limited to 150 per cent of the originally allocated VPS.\n\nBased on the currently applicable remuneration system, a total of 78,852.69 VPS were granted in 2023 for the last financial year's LTI (previous year: 43,046.19). The fair value determined by Monte Carlo simulation at the time when they were granted was €1,630 thousand (previous year: €1,624 thousand).\n\nThe tranches for 2021–2023, 2022–2024 and 2023–2025 have been recognised as cash-settled share-based payment transactions pursuant to IFRS 2. The fair value is calculated at every balance sheet date and recognised as a personnel expense, distributed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and as a provision in the same amount. As of 31 December 2023, provisions had been made for the LTI amounting to €3,366 thousand (previous year: €794 thousand), of which €1,684 thousand was for the 2021 – 2023 LTI tranche.\n\nThe LTI calculation is based on the financial performance criteria of \"return on capital employed (ROCE)\" and \"relative total shareholder return\", and on the sustainability-related non-financial performance criterion of \"lithium-ion equipment ratio\".\n\nThe entitlements for the LTI for the 2021 financial year (2021 – 2023 tranche) were fully awarded with the activities in the 2023 financial year. In this regard, the actual payment will be measured based on target achievement determined by the Supervisory Board according to the currently applicable remuneration system and paid in April 2024. The payment of LTI is dependent on the weighted degree of overall target achievement, which is determined using the above performance criteria, and the performance of the reference share price.\n\nProvisions of €2,019 thousand (previous year: €1,486 thousand) were reported as of 31 December 2023 for the STI for active members of the Board of Management. The entitlements were fully awarded with the activities in the 2023 financial year. In this regard, the actual payment will be measured based on target achievement determined by the Supervisory Board according to the currently applicable remuneration system and paid in April 2024. The payment of STI is dependent on the weighted degree of overall target achievement, which is determined using \"Group EBT return on sales\", \"increase in Group revenue\" and \"equipment ratio of lithium-ion\".\n\nThere were pension commitments for all active members of the Board of Management; the corresponding provisions amount to €3,613 thousand (previous year: €2,812 thousand). The pensions will be paid out at the end of the 63rd year as lifelong monthly pensions as long as there is no active employment relationship with Jungheinrich AG at this point. The provision for dependants for spouses or partners and children entitled to maintenance is restricted to a maximum of 100 per cent of the regular pension claim.\n\nThe disclosure of the remuneration of management staff in key positions in the Jungheinrich Group pursuant to IAS 24 includes the remuneration of active members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\n\n{174}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Remuneration of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board\n\n|                          | Board of Management |       | Supervisory Board |       |\n|--------------------------|---------------------|-------|-------------------|-------|\n| in € thousand            | 2023                | 2022  | 2023              | 2022  |\n| Short-term benefits due  | 5,651               | 4,856 | 1,175             | 1,140 |\n| Termination benefits     | 1,138               | –     | –                 | –     |\n| Post-employment benefits | 263                 | 709   | –                 | –     |\n| Share-based payments     | 2,573               | 74    | –                 | –     |\n| Total                    | 9,625               | 5,639 | 1,175             | 1,140 |\n\nIn the reporting year, the Supervisory Board made arrangements for succession planning for the Board of Management. The employment contracts of Mr Christian Erlach and Dr Volker Hues were extended until 31 December 2024 (Mr Erlach) and 31 March 2027 (Dr Hues) respectively. A provision for early termination was added to the contracts. Accordingly, in the event of early resignation from office with the agreement of the Supervisory Board after 30 June 2024 (Mr Erlach) or after 1 July 2025 (Dr Hues), the basic and variable remuneration as well as the fringe benefits and pension commitment will continue to be paid until the regular end of the respective employment contract. A termination agreement was concluded with Ms Sabine Neuß in the reporting year, according to which Ms Neuß will resign from office by mutual agreement by 30 June 2024. The basic and variable remuneration as well as the fringe benefits and pension commitment will continue to be paid until the regular end of the employment contract on 31 December 2025. Ms Neuß is entitled to terminate the employment contract by mutual agreement by resigning from office on 30 April 2024 at the earliest. In this case, she will receive a compensatory payment equal to half of the outstanding remuneration from the date of termination instead of the continued remuneration payment. A provision for termination benefits for Ms Neuß of €1,138 thousand was recognised as of 31 December 2023. The early termination agreement with Dr Hues and individual provisions of the agreement with Ms Neuß are subject to the approval by the Annual General Meeting in May 2024 of a selectively amended remuneration system.\n\nPost-employment benefits include the current service cost resulting from the defined benefit obligations to the members of the Board of Management. As share-based payments, expenses from share-based payments in the 2023 financial year are reported.\n\nThe Supervisory Board remuneration includes basic annual remuneration and fixed annual remuneration for sitting on Supervisory Board committees. The full Supervisory Board remuneration is only due after the end of the financial year. As of 31 December 2023, provisions for Supervisory Board remuneration totalled €1,175 thousand (previous year: €1,140 thousand). These will be disbursed early in the next financial year. Employee representatives on the Supervisory Board receive a regular salary from their employment in the Group; the amount represents appropriate remuneration for their role and/or work within the Group.\n\nAs in the previous year, no advances or loans to members of the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board of Jungheinrich AG existed on 31 December 2023.

In addition, we have audited the group management report of Jungheinrich Aktiengesellschaft, which is combined with the Company's management report, for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the disclosures marked as unaudited in section \"Internal control and risk management system\" of the group management report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § [Article] 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and\n- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion\n\non the group management report does not cover the content of the disclosures in section \"Internal control and risk management system\" of the group management report referred to above.\n\nPursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n#### Basis for the Audit Opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\n#### Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\n{181}------------------------------------------------\n\nNon-financial report\n\nAuditor's Report\n\nIn our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows:\n\n- Recoverability of goodwill\n- Recoverability of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and trucks for short-term rental\n- Accounting of lessor contracts in the sales area\n- First-time consolidation of Storage-Solutions (SSI)-Group\n\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows:\n\n- Matter and issue\n- Audit approach and findings\n- Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter we present the key audit matters:\n\n#### Recoverability of goodwill\n\n In the Company's consolidated financial statements goodwill amounting in total to EUR 372.7 million (5.4% of total assets or 16,8% of equity) is reported under the \"Intangible assets\" balance sheet item. Goodwill is tested for impairment by the Company once a year or when there are indications of impairment to determine any possible need for writedowns. The impairment test is carried out at the level of the cash-generating units to which the relevant goodwill is allocated. The carrying amount of the relevant cash-generating units, including goodwill, is compared with the corresponding recoverable amount in the context of the impairment test. The recoverable amount is generally determined using the value in use. The present value of the future cash flows from the respective cash-generating units normally serves as the basis of valuation. Present values are calculated using discounted cash flow models. For this purpose, the adopted medium-term business plan of the Group forms the starting point which is extrapolated based on assumptions about long-term rates of growth. Expectations relating to future market developments and assumptions about the development of macroeconomic factors on the business activities of the Group are also taken into account. The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital for the respective cash-generating units. The impairment test determined that no write-downs were necessary.\n\n The outcome of this valuation is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the executive directors with respect to the future cash inflows from the respective cash-generating units, the discount rate used, the rate of growth and other assumptions, and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background and due to the complex nature of the valuation, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n As part of our audit, we assessed the methodology used for the purposes of performing the impairment test, among other things. After matching the future cash inflows used for the calculation against the adopted medium-term business plan of the Group, we assessed the appropriateness of the calculation, in particular by reconciling it with general and sector-specific market expectations. In addition, we assessed the appropriate consideration of the costs of Group functions. In the knowledge that even relatively small changes in the discount rate applied can have a material impact on the value of the entity calculated in this way, we focused our testing in particular on the parameters used to determine the discount rate applied, and assessed the calculation model. In order to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the projections, we evaluated the sensitivity analyses performed by the Company. Taking into account the information available, we determined that the carrying amounts of the cash-generating units, including the allocated goodwill, were adequately covered by the discounted future cash flows. We also satisfied ourselves that the necessary disclosures were made in the notes.\n\n Overall, the valuation parameters and assumptions used by the executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also within the ranges considered by us to be reasonable.\n\n The Company's disclosures on goodwill are contained in number 6 and 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{182}------------------------------------------------\n\nNon-financial report\n\n#### Recoverability of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and trucks for shortterm rental\n\n In the Company's consolidated financial statements, an amount in total to EUR 1,824.8 million is reported under the balance sheet items \"Intangible assets\", \"Property, plant and equipment\", and \"trucks for short-term rental\". The recoverability of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and trucks for short-term rental was assessed as of the balance sheet date by means of impairment tests in accordance with IAS 36. The present value of the future cash flows from the respective cash-generating units normally serves as the basis of valuation. Present values are calculated using discounted cash flow models. For this purpose, the adopted medium-term business plan of the Group forms the starting point which is extrapolated based on assumptions about, for example, long-term growth rates to reflect a sustainable situation (so-called \"perpetual annuity\"). Expectations relating to future market developments and assumptions about the development of macroeconomic factors on the business activities of the Group are also taken into account. The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital for the respective cash-generating units. The impairment test determined that even after taking into account the fair value less costs of disposal, it was necessary to recognize write-downs amounting to a total of EUR 1.3 million with respect to the cash-generating units Ecuador, Denmark, Finland, Sputh Africa, Australia, Malaysia and Peru, In addition, reversals of write-downs amounting to a total of EUR 1.6 million were identified for the cash-generating unit China.\n\n The outcome of this valuation is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the executive directors with respect to the future cash inflows from the respective cashgenerating units, the discount rate used, the rate of growth and other assumptions, and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background and due to the complexity of the methodological requirements, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n As part of our audit, we assessed the methodology used for the purposes of performing the impairment test and the determination of the weighted average costs of capital, among other things. After matching the future cash inflows used for the calculation against the adopted medium-term business plan of the Group, we assessed the appropriateness of the calculation, in particular by reconciling it with general and sector-specific market expectations. In addition, we assessed the appropriate consideration of the costs of Group functions in the impairment tests of the respective cash-generating units. In the knowledge that even relatively small changes in the discount rate applied can have a material impact on the value of the entity calculated in this way, we focused our testing in particular on the parameters used to determine the discount rate and growth rates applied, and assessed the calculation model. With regard to the cash-generating units for which the need for writedowns and reversal of write downs, respectively, was identified, we assessed whether the write-downs were appropriately determined and recognized. We also satisfied ourselves that the necessary disclosures were made in the notes. Overall, the valuation parameters and assumptions used by the executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also within the ranges considered by us to be reasonable.\n\n The Company's disclosures on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and trucks for short-term rental are contained in section \"Accounting principles\" and numbers 6, 12, 13 and 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Accounting of lessor contracts in the sales area\n\n In the Company's consolidated financial statements, carrying amounts in total to EUR 1,651.4 million (23.9% of total assets) are reported under the balance sheet item \"'Receivables from financial services\" and carrying amounts in total to EUR 1,038.1 million (15.0% of total assets) are reported under the balance sheet items \"Trucks for short-term rental\" and \"Trucks for lease from financial services\". Jungheinrich makes extensive use of leases as a sales instrument in the \"Financial Services\" operating segment. The corresponding agreements include both contracts in which Jungheinrich Group companies are contracting parties and those in which the leased asset was sold to external financial partners. Monetization mainly takes place through the long-term leasing of new trucks as leased assets to the end customer, the sale of the leased asset to a financial partner and subsequent leaseback as well as the leasing of the leased asset to the end customer at the same time (sale-and-leaseback) and the sale of the (leased) asset to a financial partner, who leases it to the end customer (vendor leasing).\n\n Leases directly to the end customer are classified as finance leases or operating leases as defined by IFRS 16. In the case of sale and leaseback agreements concluded, the transaction is classified as a financing agreement and therefore a liability from financial services is recognized in addition to an asset. Vendor leases are classified uniformly as leases within the meaning of IFRS 16 in accordance with IFRS 15.\n\n{183}------------------------------------------------\n\nNon-financial report\n\n Leasing applications used throughout the Group have been set up to ensure the complete and correct recognition, categorization and classification of the various contract types in accordance with IFRS. The updating, programming, and administration of the classification and booking routines of the leasing applications are performed centrally in Germany, while contract recording is decentralized to the sales units or the Group's own financial services companies. The definition of criteria and parameters in the leasing applications requires discretionary decisions by the executive directors. Due to the high volume of transactions in connection with the different types of contracts, errors in this area can have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. Against this background, the assessment of the accounting treatment of leases in the sales area was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n As part of the audit, we first obtained an understanding of the process for accounting for leases in the sales area, including an understanding of the existing types of contracts as well as the company's internal controls in the leasing area. With the knowledge of the organizational structure and the overall process, the audit focused on the leasing application used and on the completeness and accuracy of the data input in the individual sub-areas. In a further step, we assessed whether the criteria and parameters defined in the leasing applications used were appropriate for accounting for the lease and whether the automatic booking and classification routines stored complied with the relevant IFRS. To this we examined the Jungheinrich Group Accounting Manual, as the basis for programming the routines, for compliance with IFRS. Furthermore, we assessed the appropriateness of the accounting and classification routines. Our assessment was based on a selected sample of contracts. Based on the data inputs, we verified for each selected contract whether the results of the leasing applications are in compliance with the relevant IFRS. We assessed the data inputs in the financial year in the individual sub-areas on a sample basis. In this context, we verified the accuracy, proper accrual and completeness of the data input using the original contracts.\n\n We were able to satisfy ourselves that the criteria and parameters defined by the executive directors in the leasing application are appropriate overall for the accounting of leases in the sales area.\n\n The Company's disclosures on accounting of lessor contracts in the sales area are contained in sections \"Revenue recognition\" and \"Leasing and financial services\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### First-time consolidation of Storage-Solutions (SSI)-Group\n\n With effect as at 15 March 2023, Jungheinrich Group acquired via Jungheinrich Lift Truck Corp., Houston/Texas, USA, 100% of the shares in Storage-Solutions (SSI)-Group and since then has held 100 percent of the shares in SSI Acquisition LLC, Westfield/Indiana (USA), and its subsidiaries.The total purchase price for the acquisition was EUR 325.4 million.The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3. In the context of the purchase price allocation, the identified assets and assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities of the company acquired were generally recognized at their fair values. After taking into account the revalued aquired assets of EUR 38.3 million, the resulting purchased goodwill amounts in total to EUR 287.1 million.\n\n Due to the uncertainties in the estimations made in connection with the measurement of assets and liabilities as part of the purchase price allocation, and the overall material impact of the amounts involved in the acquisition on the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Jungheinrich Group, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n In auditing the acquisition of Storage-Solutions (SSI)-Group, we initially inspected and assessed the corresponding contractual agreements and reconciled the purchase price paid as consideration for the acquired business operations received with the supporting payment documentation provided to us. In doing so, we assessed the delineation of the components included in the consideration transferred. Based on that, we evaluated the balance sheet underlying the acquisition based on the fair values at the time of first-time consolidation. This involved assessing the appropriateness of, among other things, the models on which the valuations were based as well as the valuation parameters and assumptions used. Given the special features relating to the calculation of the fair values within the context of the purchase price allocation, we received support in our assessment from our valuation specialists. We also checked the notes to the financial statements that are required under IFRS 3.\n\n{184}------------------------------------------------\n\nNon-financial report\n\nIndependent Auditor's Report\n\n Overall, we were able to satisfy ourselves that this acquisition was presented appropriately in the financial statements and that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors are comprehensible and adequately substantiated.\n\n The Company's disclosures on the first-time consolidation are contained in section \"Significant aquisitions\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Other Information\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the disclosures marked as unaudited in section \"Internal control and risk management system\" of the group management report as an unaudited part of the group management report.\n\nThe other information comprises further\n\n- the statement on corporate governance pursuant to § 289f HGB and § 315d HGB\n- the separate non-financial report to comply with §§ 289b to 289e HGB and with §§ 315b to 315c HGB\n- all remaining parts of the annual report excluding cross-references to external information – with the exception of the audited consolidated financial statements, the audited group management report and our auditor's report\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information mentioned above and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information\n\n- is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report disclosures audited in terms of content or with our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\n#### Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n{185}------------------------------------------------\n\nNon-financial report\n\nIndependent Auditor's Report\n\n#### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\n{186}------------------------------------------------\n\nNon-financial report\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n#### OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\nReport on the Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB\n\n#### Assurance Opinion\n\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report (hereinafter the \"ESEF documents\") contained in the electronic file Jungheinrich\\_KA\\_KLB\\_ESEF-2023-12-31.zip and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of § 328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format (\"ESEF format\").

We were engaged by the supervisory board on 11 May 2023. We have been the group auditor of the Jungheinrich Aktiengesellschaft, Hamburg, without interruption since the financial year 2020.\n\nWe declare that the audit opinions expressed in this auditor's report are consistent with the additional report to the audit committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report).\n\n#### Reference to an other matter – use of the Auditor's Report\n\nOur auditor's report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited group management report as well as the assured ESEF documents. The consolidated financial statements and the group management report converted to the ESEF format – including the versions to be filed in the company register – are merely electronic renderings of the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited group management report and do not take their place. In particular, the \"Report on the Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with § 317 Abs. 3a HGB\" and our assurance opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the assured ESEF documents made available in electronic form.\n\n#### German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement\n\nThe German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement is Alexander Fernis.\n\nHamburg, 12 March 2024\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nAlexander Fernis ppa.
