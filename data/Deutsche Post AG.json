The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font, also in red. The background of the image is yellow.\n\nIn the meeting in June, we discussed in particular the acquisition of the Turkish parcel service provider MNG Kargo. In addition, the agenda included the change of the Group name from Deutsche Post DHL Group to DHL Group and the approval of the adjustment of business responsibilities on the Board of Management. The allocation of business responsibilities was adjusted so that the Group Brand Marketing function was transferred to the responsibility of John Pearson. John Pearson is already responsible for the Customer Solutions & Innovation function and the Global Commercial Board. With the additional responsibility for the Group Brand Marketing function, significant commercial functions of the Group are now bundled under one umbrella.\n\nIn September, our focus was on the reform of the Postal Act and the potential impact on the financial position and results of operations of the company. Without the presence of the Board of Management, we discussed at length the effectiveness and efficiency of our activities in the plenary meetings and in the committees. The subject of our analysis included collaboration within the Supervisory Board and with the members of the Board of Management, the work in the committees, the involvement of the Supervisory Board in the strategic direction of the company and the skills profile of the Supervisory Board. In preparation for this agenda item, the members of the Supervisory Board had completed a detailed questionnaire with selected questions on various topics, for example their satisfaction with the information provided and the frequency and structure of the Supervisory Board meetings. According to the results of our discussions, the Supervisory Board performed its monitoring and advisory duties effectively and efficiently. We will continue to include suggestions made by individual members of the Supervisory Board in our discussions between the annual efficiency reviews.\n\nIn our final Supervisory Board meeting of the year in December, we approved the Group's business plan for 2024 after intense discussion, defined the annual bonus targets for the Board of Management members and addressed the topics of digitalization and the energy transition. We resolved to comply without limitation with the suggestions and recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the year under review.\n\n#### Material topics of the committee meetings\n\nThe six committees of the Supervisory Board prepare the plenary discussions and decisions and meet in advance of the plenary meetings. The committees have also been tasked with making the final decisions regarding a few matters, including Executive Committee approval for secondary activities of Board of Management members or Finance and Audit Committee approval of nonaudit services to be provided by the auditor. In the plenary meetings, the committee chairs provide the members of the Supervisory Board with comprehensive information on the work of the committees and are available for questions and further discussion. The **[Annual Corporate Governance Statement](#page-116-0)** provides information on the tasks of the committees and their members.\n\nThe Executive Committee met four times in 2023 and dealt primarily with Board of Management matters, such as succession planning on the Board of Management, the discussion of the remuneration report to the Annual General Meeting, target achievement for annual bonus calculation for the previous year and the target agreements for the following year.\n\nThe Finance and Audit Committee met seven times. Following the election of Deloitte as auditor by the Annual General Meeting, the Finance and Audit Committee commissioned the audit firm with the audit of the annual and consolidated financial statements and the audit review of the 2023 half-yearly report. The committee also commissioned Deloitte with the audit of the nonfinancial statement contained in the management report to obtain limited assurance and reasonable assurance regarding selected indicators and discussed the audit strategy, planning, results and quality with the auditors. The committee also discussed the halfyearly financial report following the review by the auditor and the quarterly financial statements with the CEO and the Board member for finance prior to publication, in the presence of the auditors. The committee monitored the independence of the auditor and had the auditor's nonaudit services submitted for approval. It also had reports submitted on the nonaudit services rendered in general as well as the status of the utilization of the statutory budget provided for this purpose. As the committee chair, Stefan Schulte was also in regular dialog with the auditor outside of the meetings regarding the progress of the audits and reported on this to the committee. Also covered at the meetings were the accounting process, risk management and the findings of internal audits. Moreover, the committee dealt intensively with the planned reform of the Postal Act and the impact on the financial situation and results of operations of the company. It obtained detailed reports from the Chief Compliance Officer on meaningful aspects of compliance and on updates to the compliance organization and compliance management. The effectiveness and development of the internal control and risk management system was also regularly presented and discussed in the presence of the responsible department head.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines to the left. The word \"Group\" is in red and is located to the right and below the DHL part of the logo. The background is yellow.\n\nThe Strategy and Sustainability Committee met five times, primarily addressing the strategic positioning of the individual business units in their respective market segments and the implementation of our Strategy 2025. In addition, the committee dealt with the company's sustainability strategy and its implementation in detail and on an ongoing basis. The meetings also focused on the acquisition and disposal of equity interest in companies, such as the establishment of a joint venture between DHL Supply Chain and Saudi Aramco.\n\nThe Nomination Committee met once during the reporting period. In preparation for the 2024 Annual General Meeting, the committee recommended to the Supervisory Board at the end of 2023 that it nominate Ann-Kristin Achleitner and Hans-Ulrich Engel for election to the Supervisory Board as successors to Simone Menne and Stefan Schulte, as well as Heinrich Hiesinger for reelection. The term of office for each is to be four years.\n\nThe Mediation Committee did not meet in the year under review.\n\nThe Personnel Committee held four meetings and dealt with, among other topics, the safety of employees, the status of collective bargaining negotiations, the promotion of women in executive positions, the results of the Employee Opinion Survey, the Groupwide corporate strategy for HR development, and the recruitment, retention and development of talents.\n\n#### Support of the members of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe company supports the members of the Supervisory Board in their activities on an ongoing basis. New members are provided with a diverse and comprehensive range of offers that ensure quick and specific onboarding. In addition to the opportunity for thorough discussions with the members of the Board of Management, the chair and, if necessary, other members of the Supervisory Board, they are given a broad array of information on relevant subjects, primarily via access to the digital data room specifically designed for the Supervisory Board, which also contains the minutes from prior Supervisory Board meetings. The costs for attending selected external training events as well as those for subscribing to industry publications are also reimbursed. Along with visits to important operating sites of the Group in conjunction with a Supervisory Board meeting, the members of the Board of Management also offer tours of individual operating units that give the Supervisory Board members the opportunity to develop a full understanding of the operating processes by providing them with in-depth insights into the conditions at the sites. In June, for instance, the Supervisory Board toured the DHL hub in Leipzig, where – following an introductory lecture – it was led through the expansive premises during the busy evening hours and introduced to individual work processes and responsibilities. Various executives from the Express division, some of whom work on-site, were available to answer questions and to make recommendations. Directors' Day, which takes place twice per year, also enables the members of the Supervisory Board to deepen their understanding of current topics and developments that are relevant to the company. In 2023, the agenda consisted of the topics of regulation of the postal market, ESG key performance indicators as a basis for corporate governance and Board of Management remuneration, as well as updates on supply chain legislation, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and the EU Taxonomy.\n\n#### Changes to the Board of Management\n\nWith Frank Appel's resignation after more than 20 years on the Board of Management, Tobias Meyer assumed the role of CEO upon the conclusion of the 2023 Annual General Meeting. He has been a member of the Board of Management since 2019 and was previously responsible for Post & Parcel Germany and Global Business Services. There were no other personnel changes during the reporting period.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters \"DHL\" is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Changes to the Supervisory Board\n\nWith regard to shareholder representatives, Katja Windt resigned from the Supervisory Board after twelve years of membership effective upon conclusion of the Annual General Meeting on May 4, 2023. Her successor is Katrin Suder, a freelance corporate consultant. Mario Daberkow, a member of the Supervisory Board since 2018 and responsible for Global IT Infrastructure & Services at Volkswagen AG, was reelected by the Annual General Meeting. Katrin Suder and Mario Daberkow were each elected for a term of four years.\n\nThe terms of office for Simone Menne, Heinrich Hiesinger and Stefan Schulte end as scheduled following the Annual General Meeting planned for May 3, 2024. In light of the rules of the German Corporate Governance Code, Simone Menne and Stefan Schulte are no longer eligible for reelection following their many years of membership on the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board recommends to the Annual General Meeting the election of Ann-Kristin Achleitner and Hans-Ulrich Engel and the reelection of Heinrich Hiesinger, each for a four-year term of office. Both candidates to be newly elected have extensive knowledge in the field of accounting and reporting in particular. The intention is to elect Hans-Ulrich Engel as the Chair of the Finance and Audit Committee, provided he is elected to the Board. The main skills of the members of the Supervisory Board can also be found in the qualification matrix in the **[Annual Corporate Governance Statement.](#page-115-0)**\n\nThe term of office for the employee representatives on the Supervisory Board ended as scheduled at the end of the 2023 Annual General Meeting. Nearly all members were reelected for another term of office. Silke Busch was elected as a new member to succeed Gabriele Gülzau. The Supervisory Board confirmed Andrea Kocsis as Deputy Chair of the Supervisory Board and the reelected employee representatives in their committee positions.\n\nAn overview of current Supervisory Board members is provided in **[Boards and committees.](#page-7-0)**\n\n#### Managing conflicts of interest\n\nSupervisory Board members neither hold positions on the governing bodies of, nor provide consultancy services to, the Group's main competitors, nor do they maintain personal relationships with them. No conflicts of interest were reported to the Supervisory Board in the year under review.\n\n#### Company in compliance with all recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code\n\nIn December 2023, the members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board issued a statement declaring that, since the issue of the declaration of conformity in December 2022, all recommendations of the Government Commission German Corporate Governance Code as amended on April 28, 2022, and published in the *Bundesanzeiger* (Federal Gazette) on June 27, 2022, had been complied with, and that all recommendations are to be complied with going forward. The statements from past years can be accessed on the company's website. Further information regarding corporate governance within the company can be found in the **[Annual Corporate Governance Statement.](#page-111-0)**\n\n#### 2023 annual and consolidated financial statements examined\n\nThe auditors elected by the 2022 Annual General Meeting for 2023 for the first time, Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (Deloitte), Munich, audited the annual and consolidated financial statements for the 2023 fiscal year, including the combined management report, and issued unqualified audit opinions. Deloitte also audited the combined nonfinancial statement for the 2023 fiscal year separately in a limited and, for certain indicators, reasonable assurance engagement and raised no objections. Deloitte also conducted the voluntary review of the half-yearly financial report. No objections were raised. The joint remuneration report for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board for the 2023 fiscal year was subjected to a formal audit and given a corresponding audit opinion in accordance with Section 162(3) AktG.\n\nAfter prior examination by the Finance and Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board in its meeting today went through the annual and consolidated financial statements, including the Board of Management's proposal on the appropriation of the net retained profit and the combined management report including the combined nonfinancial statement for the 2023 fiscal year, and discussed them in depth with the Board of Management. Deloitte reported on the results of the audit before the Finance and Audit Committee and plenary meeting and was available to answer questions. The Supervisory Board concurred with the results of the audit and approved the annual and consolidated financial statements for the 2023 fiscal year, as recommended by the Finance and\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

No objections were raised on the basis of the final outcome of the examination by the Finance and Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board of the annual and consolidated financial statements, the combined management report including the combined nonfinancial statement, and the proposal for the appropriation of the net retained profit.\n\nThe Supervisory Board endorsed the Board of Management's proposal for the appropriation of net retained profit and the payment of a dividend of €1.85 per share.\n\nThe Supervisory Board would like to expressly thank all employees and Board of Management members for their dedicated efforts.\n\nBonn, March 5, 2024 The Supervisory Board\n\nDr. Nikolaus von Bomhard Chairman\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-17-0\"></span>Image /page/17/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n### Preliminary Remarks\n\n#### Applied reporting standards\n\nAs a listed company, Deutsche Post AG has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with Section 315e Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB – German Commercial Code) in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and the corresponding Interpretations of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted in the European Union.\n\nThe combined management report comprises the Group Management Report of DHL Group and the Management Report of Deutsche Post AG. Unless otherwise noted, the information presented refers to the Group. Information pertaining solely to Deutsche Post AG is identified as such.\n\nThe combined management report also includes the combined **[nonfinancial statement](#page-58-0)** for Deutsche Post AG and for the Group in accordance with Sections 289b(1) and 315b(1) HGB. The **[nonfinancial key performance indicators](#page-33-0)** used for steering the Group were determined on the basis of their materiality in accordance with the German Commercial Code and the German Accounting Standards (GASs). Determining the report contents and the material topics is guided by the GRI Standards (core option) as a framework, supplemented by HGB requirements. The nonfinancial statement also includes information aimed at facilitating sustainable investment (EU Taxonomy) in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the European Council, as well as Delegated Regulations 2021/2178 and 2023/2486 of the European Commission. In the interest of avoiding repetition, we refer to other sections of the combined management report for reporting on mandatory disclosures, provided that they already are explained in greater detail there. Information regarding employees applies to all of the Group's staff; exceptions are noted as such.\n\n#### Independent audit\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Deutsche Post AG and its subsidiaries and the combined management report for the fiscal year from January 1 to December 31, 2023, were audited by Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (Deloitte), Munich, in a reasonable assurance engagement, **[auditor's report.](#page-223-0)** This excludes quarterly figures during the year.\n\nThe combined nonfinancial statement was audited separately by Deloitte on behalf of the Supervisory Board in a limited and, for certain indicators, reasonable assurance engagement, **[practitioner's report.](#page-231-0)**\n\nThe contents of the **[Annual Corporate Governance Statement](#page-111-0)** pursuant to Section 289f and 315d HGB have not been audited.\n\n#### Forward-looking statements\n\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that are not historical facts. They also include statements concerning assumptions and expectations that are based upon current plans, estimates and projections and the information available to Deutsche Post AG at the time this report was completed. They should not be considered to be assurances of future performance and results contained therein. Instead, they depend on a number of factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties (particularly those described in the \"Expected developments, opportunities and risks\" section) and are based on assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. It is possible that actual performance and results may differ from the forward-looking statements made in this report. Deutsche Post AG undertakes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements contained in this report except as required by applicable law. If Deutsche Post AG updates one or more forward-looking statements, no assumption can be made that the statement(s) in question or other forward-looking statements will be updated regularly.\n\n#### Disclosures unrelated to the management report\n\nThe German Corporate Governance Code stipulates disclosures related to the internal control and risk management system that go beyond the legal requirements for the management report and are therefore excepted from the auditor's review of the contents of the management report. These disclosures are set apart from those to be audited in separate paragraphs and marked accordingly\n\n.\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-18-0\"></span>Image /page/18/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters. There are three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. The word \"Group\" is in red and is located below the letters. The background is yellow.\n\n#### Additional information\n\nIn the annual report available digitally and as a PDF, we refer to – and link to – additional information online. This information is not a part of the report and is therefore excepted from the auditor's review of the contents.\n\n#### Translation\n\nThe English version of the 2023 Annual Report of DHL Group constitutes a translation of the original German version. Only the German version is legally binding, insofar as this does not conflict with legal provisions in other countries.\n\n## GENERAL INFORMATION\n\n#### Business model\n\n#### An international service portfolio\n\nDeutsche Post AG, as the parent company of DHL Group, is a listed German corporation domiciled in Bonn. Under the DHL and Deutsche Post brands, DHL Group provides a wide-ranging portfolio of services comprising international express shipping, freight transport, supply chain management, e-commerce and post and parcel services. The Group is organized into five operating divisions: Express; Global Forwarding, Freight; Supply Chain; eCommerce; and Post & Parcel Germany. Each of the divisions is managed by its own divisional headquarters and subdivided into functions, business units or regions for reporting purposes.\n\nGroup management functions are centralized in the Corporate Center. The internal services that support the entire Group are consolidated in our Global Business Services (GBS) unit. Customer Solutions & Innovation (CSI) is DHL's cross-divisional account management and innovation unit.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-57-0\"></span>Image /page/57/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of a stylized font with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nLiabilities decreased by €1,315 million to €20,195 million. The liabilities arising from bonds remain unchanged. Liabilities to banks declined by €96 million. Trade payables decreased by €115 million, liabilities to investees by €62 million and other liabilities by €107 million. The decrease in liabilities to affiliated companies amounting to €935 million resulted largely from intra-Group cash management.\n\n#### Decline in cash funds\n\nDeutsche Post AG's cash funds fell by €745 million to €1,281 million in the 2023 fiscal year.\n\n#### Decrease in debt\n\nDeutsche Post AG's debt (provisions and liabilities) fell by €1,177 million to €26,200 million compared with the previous year. The decrease was due chiefly to a decrease in liabilities to affiliated companies (€935 million).\n\n#### Expected developments, opportunities and risks\n\nThe international strategy and associated performance forecast of DHL Group also reflect the expectations for Deutsche Post AG as the parent company. Since Deutsche Post AG is interconnected with the companies of DHL Group through arrangements, including financing and guarantee commitments and direct and indirect investments in its investees, Deutsche Post AG's opportunities and risks fundamentally align with those of the Group. The section titled **[expected developments, opportunities and risks](#page-93-0)** therefore also covers expected developments, opportunities and risks with respect to Deutsche Post AG as the parent company. The Post & Parcel Germany division reflects Deutsche Post AG's core business in material respects. The subsidiaries have an indirect influence on Deutsche Post AG through net investment income from profit transfer agreements. Earnings development in 2023 corresponded with the forecast from the previous year and enables the planned dividend distribution in 2024 from the net profit for 2023.\n\nIn addition to its own operations, the subsidiaries' future operating results influence the future results of Deutsche Post AG. The HGB financial statements are material to calculating the dividend. Without one-off effects from the financial result, we anticipate for the 2024 fiscal year a result for Deutsche Post AG at the level of the previous year, which should enable a dividend payment compatible with our financial strategy.\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-58-0\"></span>Image /page/58/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n## NONFINANCIAL STATEMENT\n\npursuant to Sections 289b to 289e and 315b, 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB with respect to Deutsche Post AG and DHL Group.\n\n### General information\n\n#### Report boundary and framework\n\nAll disclosures in the nonfinancial statement relate to the **[entire consolidated group](#page-128-0)** of the company, as used as the basis for the consolidated financial statements. Any deviations from this rule are indicated accordingly. The report contents and the material topics are guided by the GRI Standards (core option) as a framework, supplemented by HGB requirements. The performance indicators used for managing the Group were determined in accordance with the HGB and German Accounting Standard 20 was applied. We illustrate the definition of the performance indicators in the **[steering metrics](#page-33-0)** chapter. The nonfinancial statement also includes information aimed at facilitating sustainable investment (EU Taxonomy). In the interest of avoiding repetition, we refer to other sections of the management report for reporting on mandatory disclosures, provided that they already are explained in greater detail there. Information regarding employees applies to all of the Group's staff; exceptions are noted as such.\n\n#### Report contents and material topics\n\nSix topics were derived from the materiality analysis for 2021 (pursuant to GRI Standards core option and HGB) that our business has a material influence on and that, conversely, can affect our business: climate and environmental protection, employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, occupational health and safety, compliance and cybersecurity. These topics also form the foundation for our ESG Roadmap. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board reviewed and confirmed the direction for the 2023 fiscal year.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/59/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. The word \"Group\" is in black and is located to the right and below the DHL part of the logo. The background is yellow.\n\n#### Sustainability anchored in strategy and remuneration\n\nFor us, sustainability and sustainable business practices are above all an opportunity that we recognize as a meaningful factor in differentiating ourselves from the competition, which is also reflected in our purpose of \"Connecting people, improving lives.\" The long-term success of our company is determined by the degree to which we meet the needs of our key stakeholder groups, minimize the environmental impact of our business, act as trustworthy business partners and increase our contributions to society.\n\nWith our **ESG Roadmap**, we have geared our climate and environmental protection activities (**e**nvironment) more toward decarbonization to minimize our environmental footprint. The strategic approaches toward social responsibility (**s**ocial) and corporate governance (**g**overnance) were more clearly defined with the objective of providing a safe and motivating working environment and ensuring transparent, legally compliant business practices throughout the Group. In this way, we also take our potential for opportunities and risks into account within the context of sustainability.\n\nImage /page/60/Picture/6 description: The image is a circular diagram outlining sustainability commitments. The central text reads \"OUR SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENTS\" in bold, stacked text. The diagram is divided into three colored sections: green, red, and yellow. The green section, located at the top left, contains the text \"Clean operations for climate protection\" along with a leaf icon. The red section, at the top right, states \"Great company to work for all\" and includes an icon of two people. The yellow section, at the bottom, reads \"Highly trusted company\" and features a globe icon. Encircling the entire diagram is the text \"Lasting impact in communities through our Go programs\".\n\nSustainability is factored into the annual bonus of Board of Management members in the form of the three ESG performance indicators Realized Decarbonization Effects, Employee Engagement\n\nand cybersecurity rating, each of which is weighted at 10%. The details are provided in a separate statutory **remuneration report.** In the year under review, these ESG performance indicators were also included in the annual bonus calculation for executives in upper management.\n\n#### Supporting sustainability initiatives\n\nWe participate in numerous United Nations (UN) initiatives and support its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our commitment is most closely aligned with the goals of Quality Education (SDG 4), Gender Equality (SDG 5), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11), Climate Action (SDG 13) and Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17).\n\nIn addition, we take part in various **sustainability initiatives**, for example to promote the development of sustainable fuels and technologies, and are working with our transport partners on reducing fuel consumption and the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG). In addition, we are involved in committees of the EFRAG and the International Sustainability Standards Board to develop European and global reporting standards for sustainability. In the year under review, DHL Group became a member of Transparency International Germany.\n\n#### Guidelines define implementation of ESG standards throughout the Group\n\nWe conduct our business in accordance with applicable law and pursuant to our own ESG standards. DHL Group signed the UN Global Compact in 2006. The ten principles of this compact – as well as the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the principle of social partnership – are anchored in the Group through our Code of Conduct for Employees and our Human Rights Policy Statement; additional internal guidelines provide further specificity on these principles.\n\nWe provide for compliance with our ethical, social and environmental values in the supply chain by means of our Code of Conduct for Suppliers (Supplier Code of Conduct). The Supplier Code of Conduct is a binding component of the Group's relationships with our suppliers, including subcontractors. By signing, they commit to complying with our standards and implementing them in their own supply chains.\n\nOur Code of Conduct, along with the internal policy on anti-corruption and standards for business ethics derived from it, provides all employees and managers with clear rules and standards for complying with laws and regulations while contributing to the success of the Group within the scope of their jobs and responsibilities. All our employees, but in particular our managers, play a key role when it comes to implementing our values and objectives, so we have made the Code of Conduct an integral component of their employment contracts.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/61/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nThe codes of conduct and the Group guidelines are reviewed annually to ensure that they are complete and up to date.\n\n#### Steering and planning\n\nOur performance indicators, key figures and targets are completely integrated in our financial systems and reporting and planning processes, as well as in the internal control system and the opportunity and risk management process. The development of actual versus planned performance indicators is presented to the Board of Management along with financial KPIs and discussed monthly; the Employee Engagement performance indicator is determined and discussed once per year. Approaches to solutions are discussed and resolved in the event of deviations from plan; in the year under review, the focus in this regard was on managing the procurement of sustainable fuels.\n\n#### Nonfinancial risks\n\nOpportunity and risk management takes place in Group Controlling and covers sustainability-related aspects. Opportunities and risks arising from climate change are assessed using a scenario analysis according to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which also takes the provisions of the EU Taxonomy into account. This involves discussing and assessing both transitory and physical **[risks stemming from climate change](#page-64-0)** using various scenarios.\n\nIn the reporting period, the **[ESG risks](#page-99-0)** identified in the previous year in the material issues of climate change (risk categories: operational, market- and customer-specific and from regulation) and information technology were confirmed. These risks are assessed as being of medium significance for the Group.\n\n#### Organization of sustainability\n\nThe Board of Management is the central decision-maker on Group-wide sustainability focus, whereas the divisions are responsible for implementation of the measures. The progress achieved is regularly discussed by the **[Board of Management](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/board-of-management.html)**. The ESG topics are also regularly dealt with in the meetings of the Supervisory Board as well as its Strategy and Sustainability Committee and Finance and Audit Committee. The perspective of external stakeholder groups is included through the **[Sustainability Advisory Council.](https://group.dhl.com/en/sustainability/sustainability-roadmap/sustainability-advisory-council.html)**\n\n- Department Chief Executive Officer: Responsible for strategic orientation, stakeholder dialogue and implementation of the ESG programs. The ESG topics are developed further in the Group strategy and regularly reviewed by the Sustainability Steering Board. The Sustainability Steering Board comprises the CEO, the CFO and the Board member for Human Resources, as well as managers from central and divisional functions. As of January 1, 2024, responsibility for the Group-wide cybersecurity standards was shifted from the Department Global Business Services to the Department Chief Executive Officer.\n- Department Human Resources: Develops Group-wide concepts for leadership and corporate culture, for the promotion of talents and skills, specifications related to HR processes and services as well as for maintaining relationships with the employee representatives and for respecting human rights in our workforce.\n- Department Finance: Responsible for ESG reporting and controlling, opportunity and risk assessment, integration of the internal control system and the financial systems, compliance management and data protection. In the year under review, responsibility for the materiality analysis was moved from the Department Chief Executive Officer to the Department Finance.\n- Department Global Business Services: Among other topics, responsible for determining the Group-wide standards for sustainable procurement and the process for selecting suppliers, as well as the specifications for Insurance & Risk Management and Corporate Real Estate.\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-62-0\"></span>Image /page/62/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. Below the DHL part, the word \"Group\" is written in red.\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT DECISION-MAKING BODIES FOR SUSTAINABILITY\n\nImage /page/62/Figure/4 description: The image is an organizational chart showing the structure of a company's management and its focus on sustainability. At the top is the \"BOARD OF MANAGEMENT\" with the description \"Central decision-making and sustainability focus.\" Below this are three sections: \"Strategy and management,\" \"Responsibility for topics,\" and \"Reporting and controlling.\" Under \"Strategy and management\" are the \"Sustainability Advisory Council\" (described as an independent external body with experts from scientific, political, and business communities), and the \"Sustainability Steering Board\" (focused on ongoing monitoring of the sustainability agenda, chaired by the CEO, CFO, and CHRO). Under \"Responsibility for topics\" are several boards: \"Operations Board\" (climate protection and occupational safety, chaired by the CEO), \"Global Commercial Board\" (sustainable product portfolio, chaired by Express), \"HR Board\" (employee matters and human rights, chaired by the CHRO), \"Global Business Services Board\" (compliance, procurement, real estate, insurance & risk management, chaired by the CEO), and \"IT Board\" (cyber-security, data protection, and IT systems, chaired by the CEO). Under \"Reporting and controlling\" is the \"Finance Board\" (key figures, planning, opportunity and risk assessment, reporting, and materiality analysis, chaired by the CFO). To the right of the \"BOARD OF MANAGEMENT\" is the \"Supervisory Board\" (control and consultation), with sub-committees for \"Strategy and Sustainability Committee\" and \"Finance and Audit Committee.\" At the bottom, it mentions \"Divisions\" and \"Operational management of sustainability.\"\n\n1 CEO = Chief Executive Officer, Board of Management members responsible for Finance (CFO), HR (CHRO), Express.\n\n#### Focus areas in the reporting period\n\nIn June 2023, the first sustainability-linked bond was placed with an issue volume of €500 million and a term through 2033. The interest rate of the bond is linked to our medium-term target of significantly reducing GHG emissions by 2030.\n\nThe focus throughout the year was on the interpretation and application of the European Union's (EU) new requirements of sustainability reporting that have to be applied starting in the 2024 fiscal year. The materiality analysis was conceptualized and carried out in consideration of the new requirements of materiality. As part of this, the effects, risks and opportunities were evaluated during internal expert meetings and in-depth assessments were carried out. This also included a comprehensive location-based analysis of aspects related to biodiversity. The results were discussed with internal as well as external stakeholders. According to our current assessment, we classify the ESRS topics of climate protection, own workforce, workers in the value chain and business conduct, as well as cybersecurity as a company-specific topic, as material. In addition, ESG metrics, responsibilities and internal collection and reporting systems were reviewed for necessary adjustments or expansions; moreover, the additional requirements of the EU Taxonomy were implemented.\n\n#### Environment\n\n#### Climate protection in the focus of our operations\n\nThe main environmental impact of our business activities is caused by logistics-related greenhouse gases (GHG), which contribute to climate change. The EU also classifies the transport sector as energy-intensive **[\\(high climate impact sector\\)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L_202302772)**. Within the framework of our ESG Roadmap, we have defined measures and ambitious targets to minimize these effects, to realize opportunities and to avoid risks.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/63/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n**Medium-term target:** We have set ourselves a target of reducing our logistics-related GHG emissions to below 29 million metric tons of CO₂e by the year 2030. In addition to our own GHG emissions in Scope 1 and Scope 2, we also include the Scope 3 emissions from upstream transportation and distribution (category 4), fuel- and energy-related activities (category 3) and business travel (category 6) in this target.\n\nThis target was developed based on the requirements of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and supports global efforts to limit global warming in accordance with the Paris Agreement of the United Nations. The SBTi verified the following subtargets in this regard and assessed them as aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius: using 2021 as the base year, DHL Group has committed to reducing its direct net GHG emissions from the use of fuels and the indirect emissions from purchased energy (Scopes 1 and 2) by 42% by the year 2030. Logistics-related Scope 3 emissions from fuel- and energy-related activities, upstream transportation and distribution and business travel are to be reduced by 25% by 2030. The interest rate of our first sustainability-linked bond is linked to these subtargets.\n\nThe use of sustainable fuels is a significant focus of our climate protection activities. The reduction effects generated through these measures offer us the opportunity to implement climate protection directly in the transport sector and in our supply chain in a targeted manner. As part of this, fossil fuels are replaced by either the direct use of certified sustainable fuels or the documented use thereof (book and claim). This makes a positive impact on our target calculation. To calculate the market-based effects, we use the guidelines of the Voluntary Market Based Measures Framework for Logistics Emissions Accounting and Reporting published by the Smart Freight Centre.\n\n**Long-term target:** We want to reduce the GHG emissions of our logistics services to net zero by 2050. That means we will use active reduction measures to reduce these emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) down to an unavoidable minimum, which is to be fully compensated for with recognized countermeasures (excluding offsetting).\n\n#### DECARBONIZATION TARGETS\n\n**Million metric tons of CO2e** \n\nImage /page/63/Figure/9 description: The image is a bar graph showing the reduction of CO2e emissions over time. The y-axis is labeled \"Million metric tons of CO2e\". The x-axis shows the years 2021, 2023, Target 2024, 2030, Target 2030, and Target 2050. The bar for 2021 is at 40. The bar for 2023 is at 33, with a target of 39. The bar for Target 2024 is at 35. The bar for 2030 without decarbonization measures is not labeled. The bar for Target 2030 after decarbonization measures is at 29. The target for 2050 is Net 0. A box on the right side of the graph states \"-42% Scopes 1, 22\" and \"-25% Scope 33\".\n\n1 Includes the effect from the acquisition of the Hillebrand Group in the 2022 fiscal year, recognized starting in the **[2022 Annual Report.](https://www.dpdhl.com/content/dam/dpdhl/en/media-center/investors/documents/annual-reports/DPDHL-2022-Annual-Report.pdf#Page=54)**\n\n2 Market-based method.\n\n3 Includes the Scope 3 categories 4 (upstream transportation and distribution), 3 (fuel- and energy-related activities) and 6 (business travel).\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/81/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters \"DHL\" is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### EU Taxonomy\n\nPursuant to Article 8 of Regulation 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council as well as Delegated Regulations 2021/2178 and 2023/2486 of the European Commission.\n\n#### Contribution to the climate and environmental objectives of the European Union\n\nWe report our contribution to the European Union's (EU) six environmental objectives according to the guidelines laid down in the EU Taxonomy regulation and report the taxonomy-aligned (aligned) and taxonomy-eligible shares of revenue, capital expenditure (capex) and operating expenditure (opex).\n\nTaxonomy-eligible economic activities (activities) are considered environmentally sustainable and therefore aligned if they make a substantial contribution to one of the six EU environmental objectives and are not associated with significant harm to one or more other environmental objectives (do-no-significant-harm (DNSH) criteria). In addition, for all activities, the Group complies with required frameworks for minimum safeguards that relate to respecting human rights and social and labor standards, as well as anti-corruption fair competition and taxation.\n\nAligned activities exclusively make a substantial contribution to EU environmental objective 1. No aligned activities were identified in conjunction with EU environmental objective 2 that make a substantial contribution to risk avoidance or the reduction of the risk of adverse effects of the current and projected climate on the activity itself or on people, nature or assets without increasing the risk of adverse effects on people, nature or assets. The activities in the area of construction and real estate make no substantial contribution to EU environmental objective 4.\n\n#### SIX EU ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES\n\n- 1 Climate change mitigation\n- 2 Climate change adaptation\n- 3 Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- 4 Transition to a circular economy\n- 5 Pollution prevention and control\n- 6 Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nThe requirements of the EU Taxonomy were expanded in the year under review: new activities in the air freight sector were added to the first EU environmental objective, and further activities were added to the EU environmental objectives 3 to 6. The taxonomy eligibility was determined and reported for these new activities. In accordance with this, we primarily carry out activities in EU environmental objectives 1 and 2; with regard to EU environmental objective 4, two activities fall under the area of construction and real estate.\n\nThe Group policy for implementing the requirements of the EU Taxonomy includes the guidelines for determining the aligned shares of revenue, capex and opex. The data is collected accordingly in the Group-wide finance and controlling systems. In the year under review, the Group policy and the Group-wide finance and controlling systems were adapted with regard to the additional requirements. For the first time, we can now report the taxonomy-eligible shares of our air freight operations.\n\n#### Development of the Taxonomy KPIs\n\nThe taxonomy-eligible and -aligned shares increased compared with the previous year. The expansion of the taxonomy requirements in the area of air freight in particular played a significant role in the increase in taxonomy eligibility. The increase in taxonomy alignment results from our decarbonization measures in the pickup and delivery fleet and the improved identification of taxonomy-aligned activities.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-83-0\"></span>Image /page/83/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Revenue from operating warehouses (Supply Chain division) in particular is therefore not reported as taxonomy-eligible.\n\nCapex generated by the addition of assets can be assigned directly to individual activities, while revenue and opex can generally not be directly assigned. In these cases, we primarily use a cost-based allocation logic that reflects the business models of the divisions. We avoid double counting by assigning revenue, capex and opex to only one activity respectively and taking intra-Group relationships into account on a consolidated basis. Property, plant and equipment from business combinations were primarily allocated to the \"Construction and real estate\" and \"Transport\" sectors; intangible assets from business combinations were classified as not taxonomy-eligible.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-84-0\"></span>Image /page/84/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Compliance with regard to recyclability (DNSH 4) and emissions thresholds (DNSH 5) is a basic requirement for approval of electric vehicles in Europe, which is why we considered these to be met. In addition, the simultaneous meeting of the criteria for fuel efficiency and rolling noise of tires represents a substantial requirement of DNSH 5. For this reason, we have determined the respective vehicle- and use-specific requirements of the tires, including the load-capacity index, and identified the highest class containing some products in the EPREL2 database for each specification as well as checked the tire classification under DNSH 5 for each vehicle. |\n| 6.6 Freight transport services by road3: Heavy-duty vehicles4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Method is analogous to 6.5.

The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n## EXPECTED DEVELOPMENTS, OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS\n\n#### Forecast period\n\nThe information contained in the report on expected developments generally refers to the 2024 fiscal year.\n\n#### Future economic prospects\n\n#### Geopolitical instability restrains global economic recovery\n\nThe ongoing geopolitical dislocations will likely continue to dampen global demand and trade in 2024. The easing tensions in global energy markets seen in 2023 could persist in 2024, thus supporting the current declining trend for inflation. However, the associated increase in real purchasing power will provide only a partial offset to the prevailing unsettledness among investors and consumers. Overall, global annual average GDP growth should weaken modestly once again from 2.7% in 2023 to 2.3% in 2024.\n\nFor the most important countries and regions, S&P Global Market Intelligence predicts the following GDP growth rates in 2024: growth in China and the United States is expected to weaken to 4.7% and 1.7%, respectively, and to remain roughly steady at a very subdued 0.4% in the eurozone. The German economy should see mild GDP growth of 0.3%, reflecting a gradual strengthening of growth momentum throughout the year following the recession experienced during the second half of 2023.\n\n#### Highly cyclical international express market\n\nGrowth in the international express market, particularly in the B2B segment, is highly dependent upon the economic situation. For 2024, we still expect only moderate growth, depending on economic development.\n\n#### Freight business influenced by demand and geopolitical developments\n\nDevelopments in freight logistics are also heavily dependent upon the economic situation and are difficult to predict in light of the uncertain market situation. However, in air and ocean freight, we expect a cautious revival in terms of demand due to the economic conditions and anticipate moderate growth for 2024. In addition, for the ocean freight market especially, the speed with which the capacity bottleneck tensions ease on the Red Sea is of importance.\n\nIn light of rather moderate economic development, we also expect only restrained volume growth in the European road transport market in 2024, but we are also still faced with high prices.\n\n#### Contract logistics market continues to grow\n\nGrowth in omnichannel e-commerce as well as geopolitical challenges will continue to increase the complexity of supply chains. This, together with the apparent vulnerability of traditional supply chains and the increasing complexity of global trade relations, will increase the demand for flexible and agile solutions, further driving outsourcing. Furthermore, in the current phase of the economic cycle, many companies are reviewing their structures and cost situations, which could result in a slightly increased willingness to outsource logistics. Therefore, the market for contract logistics is likely to continue growing, yet inflation, general economic conditions and labor shortages represent both an opportunity and a threat.\n\n#### Stable growth prospects for eCommerce\n\nIt is to be expected that the share of e-commerce in total retail revenue will continue to grow. In line with the implementation of our plans for expansion, we will continue to invest in our network, efficient workflows for the last mile and infrastructure so that we remain reliable and affordable for our customers. We also see additional opportunities for growth thanks to our entry into the Turkish market as well.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-94-0\"></span>Image /page/94/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Stable trends in the relevant post and parcel markets\n\nThe German market for paper-based mail communication will decline further as digital communication increases. We will continue to adapt the Post & Parcel Germany product portfolio to reflect this development.\n\nThe German advertising market should rise slightly in 2024. However, the shift from paper-based advertising to online marketing will continue, so that the volumes in the physical advertising market – and thus for our Dialogue Marketing services – are expected to be in decline.\n\nAccording to current predictions, the rising number of goods shipments will partially compensate for significantly declining volumes of documents in international business. Intra-European and international e-commerce could once again grow significantly.\n\nWe expect development in e-commerce to stabilize and the German parcel market to grow slightly again in 2024 and are therefore expanding our parcel network and our network of Pack- and Poststations. We are also expanding our range of electronic communications services, securing our standing as a quality leader and, where possible, making our transport and delivery costs more flexible.\n\n#### Expected developments\n\n#### Result well over the pre-pandemic level, even in face of persistent economic situation\n\nThe first half of the 2024 fiscal year will foreseeably still be shaped by the lack of any broad upward trend in the economy. The comparison with the first half of the previous year, when freight rates were still extraordinarily high in some cases, could be negative. If the economic forecasts currently available prove to be largely accurate, the result in the second half of the year should come in above the level of the comparable prior-year period. With undiminished focus on cost and price management, however, we still expect Group profit to be well above the level of the pre-pandemic years, even with a continuation of weak economic development.\n\n#### Expectations for consolidated EBIT\n\nIn the 2024 fiscal year, we anticipate consolidated EBIT between €6.0 billion and €6.6 billion. The DHL divisions are projected to generate total EBIT of more than €5.7 billion. In the Post & Parcel Germany division, EBIT is forecast to come in at more than €0.8 billion. Group Functions is anticipated to contribute around €–0.45 billion to earnings.\n\n#### Dividend proposal: €1.85 per share\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose to the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on May 3, 2024, a **[dividend](#page-39-0)** of €1.85 per share for the 2023 fiscal year (previous year: €1.85).\n\n#### Group's credit rating remains the same\n\nAs of the reporting date, our credit rating was still at \"A2\" with a stable outlook according to Moody's Investor Service and was classified as \"BBB+\" with a positive outlook by Fitch Ratings. As part of our finance strategy, we still strive for a stand-alone target rating between \"Baa1\" and \"A3\" and \"BBB+\" and \"A–,\" respectively.\n\n#### Liquidity remains solid\n\nDue to the dividend payment for the 2023 fiscal year in May 2024, our liquidity is expected to decrease up to mid-year 2024. Due to the usually good business development in the second half of the year, the liquidity situation should improve again toward the end of the year.\n\n#### Investments of €3.0 billion to €3.6 billion\n\nAs in the previous year, we want to manage investments in our strategic goals and further growth in a balanced way, in line with the challenging economic environment. We plan for capital expenditure (excluding leases) to range between €3.0 billion and €3.6 billion in 2024, while focusing on the same areas as in previous years.\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-95-0\"></span>Image /page/95/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of a stylized, bold font with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the DHL part of the logo, the word \"Group\" is written in red.\n\n#### Expected EAC and free cash flow\n\nIn view of the expected EBIT development in combination with a predicted increase in the asset charge, we expect the EAC to be down slightly year over year. Free cash flow is projected at around €2.75 billion, including a €250 million overall budget for M&A expenses.\n\n#### Limiting greenhouse gas emissions\n\nThe development of GHG emissions in the 2024 fiscal year will also depend on the development of the global economy. If transport volumes undergo weaker development, we expect logistics-related GHG emissions to remain approximately at the prior-year level; if the economy proves to be more dynamic, we aim to limit GHG emissions to a maximum of 34.9 million tons of CO₂e. This includes decarbonization effects of 1.5 million tons of CO₂e. We continue to expect a significant reduction to not come until the second half of the decade.\n\n#### Continued strong employee engagement\n\nEmployee Engagement should amount to more than 80% across the Group in the 2024 fiscal year as well; this figure is expected to remain steady at least this high level through 2025.\n\n#### Increase share of female executives\n\nIn the 2024 fiscal year, 28.8% of the positions in middle and upper management should be held by women; the share of women should rise to at least 30% by 2025.\n\n#### Keep LTIFR stable\n\nThe LTIFR per 200,000 working hours should be kept at a maximum of 3.3 in the 2024 fiscal year; by 2025, this figure should be reduced to less than 3.1. Beginning in the 2024 reporting period, we will adjust the performance indicator to one million working hours, which means the target then corresponds to 16.5 and 15.5 in the year 2025.\n\n#### Conduct compliance-relevant training\n\nIn the reporting year, the share of valid training certificates among middle and upper management should remain at the high level and amount to 98%.\n\n#### External cybersecurity rating\n\nThe cybersecurity rating from BitSight should be within the upper quartile of the comparison group and amount to at least 690 points. If BitSight once again changes its rating scale, we will adjust this figure in line with the change.\n\n#### Opportunity and risk management\n\n#### Uniform reporting standard\n\nAs an internationally operating logistics company, we are facing numerous changes. Our aim is to identify the resulting opportunities and risks at an early stage and take the necessary measures in the specific areas affected in due time, to ensure that we achieve a sustained increase in enterprise value. Our Group-wide opportunity and risk management system (RMS) facilitates this aim. Each quarter, executives estimate the impact of future scenarios, evaluate opportunities and risks in their departments and present planned measures as well as those already taken. Queries are made and approvals given on a hierarchical basis to ensure that different managerial levels are involved in the process. Opportunities and risks can also be reported at any time on an ad hoc basis.\n\nWe implemented the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as well as the provisions of the EU Taxonomy also in 2023. This involves discussing and assessing both transitory and physical risks stemming from climate change using various scenarios. The material risks identified during this process are explained in \"Opportunity and risk categories.\"\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/96/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo is red and consists of the letters \"DHL\" in a stylized font, with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller, sans-serif font. The background is yellow.\n\nOur early-identification process intertwines the RMS throughout the Group into a uniform reporting standard using a proprietary IT application that is constantly updated. Furthermore, we use a Monte Carlo simulation for the purpose of aggregating opportunities and risks in standard evaluations.\n\nThe simulation is a stochastic model that takes the probability of occurrence of the underlying risks and opportunities into consideration and is based upon the law of large numbers. Randomly selected scenarios – one for each opportunity and risk – are combined on the basis of the distribution functions for each individual opportunity and risk.\n\nThe most important steps in our opportunity and risk management process are:\n\nImage /page/96/Figure/6 description: The image shows a diagram of an opportunity and risk management process. The diagram is a cycle with five stages: 1. Identify and Assess (Assess, Define measures, Analyse, Identify), 2. Aggregate and Report (Review, Supplement and change, Aggregate, Report), 3. Overall Strategy/Risk Management/Compliance (Determine, Manage), 4. Operating Measures (Plan, Implement), and 5. Control (Review results, Review measures, Monitor early warning indicators). In the center of the cycle, it says \"Corporate Audit Reviews Processes\". The cycle is color-coded to indicate the different groups involved in each stage: Divisions (yellow), Opportunity and risk-controlling processes (red), Board of Management (gray), and Corporate Audit (black).\n\n**1. Identify and assess:** Managers in all divisions and regions evaluate the opportunity and risk situation on a quarterly basis and document the actions taken. They use scenarios to assess best, expected and worst cases. The measurement period usually corresponds to the planning period, but it can also be long term or latent. Each identified risk is assigned to at least one risk owner who assesses and monitors the risk, specifies possible procedures for going forward and then files a report. The same applies to opportunities. At least one management process used to measure net risk exposure must be reported for each opportunity or risk. In isolated cases where it is not initially possible to make a quantitative assessment, risks may be assessed on a qualitative basis to ensure that the full scope of all risks is captured. The results are compiled in a database. We also conduct an annual risk workshop for each division with the Divisional Boards, as supplements to the quarterly process. Workshop discussion focuses on opportunities and risks of significance to the whole division. At the same time, newly identified opportunities and risks are subsequently integrated into the quarterly process.\n\n**2. Aggregate and report:** The controlling units collect the results, evaluate them and review them for plausibility. If individual financial effects overlap, this is noted in our database and taken into account in the compilation process. After being approved by the division risk owners, all results are passed on to the next level in the hierarchy. The last step is complete when Corporate Controlling reports to the Group Board of Management and the Supervisory Board on significant opportunities and risks as well as on the potential overall impact each division might experience. For this purpose, opportunities and risks are aggregated for the key organizational levels. We use two methods for this. In the first method, we calculate a possible spectrum of results for the divisions\n\n{231}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-231-0\"></span>Image /page/231/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n(hereafter \"the indicators\") and performed a limited assurance engagement on all disclosures other than the indicators contained in the combined nonfinancial statement.\n\nNot subject to our assurance engagement are the external sources of documentation and expert opinions as well as prior-year key ratios mentioned in the combined nonfinancial statement.\n\n#### Responsibilities of the Executive Directors\n\nThe executive directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the combined nonfinancial statement in accordance with the requirements of Sections 289c to 289e German Commercial Code (HGB), Section 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB and Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on establishing a framework to facilitate sustainable investment and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (\"EU Taxonomy Regulation\") and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder, as well as for making their own interpretation of the wording and terms contained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder, as set out in the section \"EU Taxonomy\" of the combined nonfinancial statement (hereafter \"interpretation\").\n\nThese responsibilities of the executive directors of the Company include the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the combined nonfinancial statement and the use of assumptions and estimates for individual disclosures which are reasonable under the given circumstances. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of a combined nonfinancial statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published in every case. Therefore, the executive directors have disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder in the section \"EU Taxonomy\" of the combined nonfinancial statement. They are responsible for the defensibility of this interpretation. Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties.\n\nThe preciseness and completeness of the environmental data in the combined nonfinancial statement, which include the indicators, is subject to inherent existing limitations associated with the manner in which the data was collected and calculated as well as assumptions made.\n\n#### Responsibilities of the Independent Practitioner\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion with reasonable assurance on the indicators disclosed in the combined nonfinancial statement and a conclusion with limited assurance on all disclosures other than the indicators in the combined nonfinancial statement in each case based on our work performed within our assurance engagement.\n\nOur audit firm applies the IDW Quality Assurance Standard issued by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW): Quality Assurance Requirements in Audit Practices (IDW QS 1). We have complied with the German Public Auditor Act (WPO) and the Professional Charter for German Public Auditors and German Sworn Auditors (BS WP/vBP), including the requirements on independence.\n\nWe conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement so that we\n\n• can conclude with reasonable assurance whether the indicators disclosed in the combined nonfinancial statement of the Company for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2023 have been presented, in all material respects, in accordance with Section 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB by the executive directors, and\n\n{233}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/233/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of three horizontal lines on the left, followed by the letters D, H, and L. To the right and below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n• can conclude with limited assurance whether matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that all disclosures other than the indicators in the combined nonfinancial statement of the Company have in their entirety not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Sections 289c to 289e HGB, Section 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder.\n\nThe procedures performed in the limited assurance part of our engagement are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. The choice of assurance work is subject to the practitioner's professional judgement.\n\nWithin the scope of our limited assurance engagement, we notably performed the following activities:\n\n- Gaining an understanding of the structure of the Group's sustainability organization and stakeholder engagement,\n- Inquiries of relevant employees involved in the preparation of the consolidated nonfinancial statement about the preparation process, about the internal control system related to this process and about disclosures in the combined nonfinancial statement,\n- Identification of likely risks of material misstatements in the combined nonfinancial statement,\n- Analytical evaluation of selected disclosures in the combined nonfinancial statement,\n- Reconciliation of selected disclosures with the corresponding data in the consolidated and annual financial statements and combined management report,\n- Assessment of the presentation of the combined nonfinancial statement,\n- Assessment of the process to identify taxonomy eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic activities and the corresponding disclosures in the combined non-financial statement.\n\nIn the course of our reasonable assurance engagement part on the indicators disclosed in the Company's combined nonfinancial statement, we have performed the following assurance procedures and other activities in addition to those described above:\n\n- Assessment of the concept and implementation of the systems and processes for determining, processing and monitoring the disclosures on the indicators,\n- Assessment of the risks,\n\n• Tests of details on the basis of samples.\n\nIn determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive directors are required to interpret undefined legal terms. Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties. In particular, these uncertainties also relate to quantifying performance indicators when they are measured or evaluated.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.\n\n{234}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/234/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Practitioner's Conclusion\n\nIn our view, the indicators disclosed in the combined nonfinancial statement of the Company for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2023 have been presented, in all material respects, in accordance with Section 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB by the executive directors.\n\nBased on the work performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that all disclosures other than the indicators in the combined nonfinancial statement of the Company for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023 do not comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of Sections 289c to 289e HGB, Section 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder as well as the interpretation by the executive directors as disclosed in the section \"EU Taxonomy and its implementation at Deutsche Post AG\" of the combined nonfinancial statement.\n\nNot subject to our assurance engagement are the external sources of documentation and expert opinions as well as prior-year key ratios mentioned in the combined nonfinancial statement.\n\n#### Restriction of Use and Reference to Limitation of Liability\n\nWe issue this report as stipulated in the engagement letter agreed with the Company (including the \"General Engagement Terms for Wirtschaftsprüfer und Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaften [German Public Auditors and Public Audit Firms]\" dated 1 January 2017 of the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany). We draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was conducted for the Company's purposes and that the report is intended solely to inform the Company about the result of the assurance engagement. Consequently, it may not be suitable for any other purpose than the aforementioned. Accordingly, the report is not intended to be used by third parties for making (financial) decisions based on it.\n\nOur responsibility is to the Company alone. We assume no responsibility with regard to any third parties. Our conclusion is not modified in this respect.\n\nMunich/Germany, 16 February 2024\n\nDeloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nProf. Dr Frank Beine Sebastian Dingel *Wirtschaftsprüfer*  (German Public Auditor)\n\nebastian Dingel\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-235-0\"></span>Image /page/235/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The numbers prove it: we are\nhighly profitable, even in the economically weakest market environment of the last 15 years.\n\nThis is thanks to the fact that we not only had good responses to the challenges, but we were also prepared:\nwe planned our capacities with a view to the future, kept our eye on costs and increased our efficiency on\nan ongoing basis. The investments of recent years resulted in structural improvements to our profitability.\nWe benefit from this even in phases of weak economic momentum. In addition, we adjusted prices in line\nwith the market and passed on inflationary cost developments to our customers.\n\nThe past fiscal year makes it once again clear: our logistics portfolio, which is unique around the world,\nis productive and robust. No other company in the industry boasts such a broad, diversified and global\nstructure. And our network is very well suited for online retail, which remains a strong and fundamental\ndriver of growth. As a company, we have been on board with the e-commerce trend since the early days\nand have used it to our advantage. It has been contributing to our success for many years – and will\ncontinue to do so in the coming years.\n\nDHL Group also pursues ambitious goals with regard to the environment, social responsibility and sound\ncorporate governance in line with our ESG Roadmap. Our ESG measures contribute to us remaining a\nmarket leader in the future as well.\n\nOur particular priority along the way is that we remain steadfast on the path to decarbonization of logistics.\nIn the year under review, we increased our investments in the reduction of greenhouse gases by 56% and\nsaved 1.3 million metric tons of CO2e. In addition, we successfully placed our first sustainability-linked\nbond on the capital market with a volume of €500 million. We will not ease up in our dedication to more\nenvironmentally friendly logistics. Climate change remains the greatest problem that humanity is faced\nwith. And the clock keeps on ticking.\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/5/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and is to the left of the word \"Group\", which is also in red. The background is yellow.\n\nMy particular thanks go to our more than 590,000 employees worldwide – for their tireless efforts in\nyet another challenging year. Without their motivation and passion, we would not have been able to so\nsuccessfully accomplish many things. We are pleased that we again exceeded the target of more than\n80% in Employee Engagement in the year under review, with the figure coming in at 83%. And, going\nforward, we plan to offer our employees more opportunities to directly take part in the success\nof the company. To this end, we are piloting a program in 12 countries that allows employees\nto acquire our shares at a discounted price. The program is intended to further strengthen\nthe connection between the workforce and the company.\n\nAnd what can we look forward to over the remainder of 2024? Although global trade\ncontinues to find itself in a challenging environment, I see a year of opportunity –\nalso because competitors are withdrawing or appear to be distracted. For our part, we\nare definitely focused and in a position to continue delivering excellent quality. We\nare continuing to work on our status as an employer, provider and investment of choice.\nIn doing so, we want to take advantage of the many opportunities for DHL Group to\ncontinue to grow.\n\nAnd I thank you, Dear Shareholders, for the trust you have placed in me since I was named\nCEO of DHL Group. Leading a company that keeps the world running, day in and day out, and\nthat enables trade in more than 220 countries and territories is an inspiring and special responsi-\nbility. A company that connects people and improves lives. DHL Group has evolved from a national\npostal service provider to a leader in the global logistics market. I look forward to writing the upcoming\nchapters of this success story together with my colleagues on the Board of Management and the highly\ndedicated workforce.\n\n**TOBIAS MEYER**\nChief Executive Officer\n\nTobias Meyer\nChief Executive Officer\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-6-0\"></span>Image /page/6/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The Board of Management's clear strategic focus and the contributions of all employees in operational implementation made this possible.\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board worked together in a trusting and successful manner in the year under review. The Board of Management involved the Supervisory Board early on in all decisions of material significance for the company and regularly informed the Supervisory Board on further developments.\n\n#### Attendance at plenary and committee meetings\n\nThe four plenary meetings and 17 of the 21 committee meetings in the 2023 fiscal year took place in person, with individual members joining virtually depending on the situation.\n\n#### ATTENDANCE AT PLENARY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS 2023\n\n| Supervisory Board members                      | Supervisory Board meetings |                 | Committee meetings      |                 |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|\n|                                                | Attendance/<br>meetings    | Attendance<br>% | Attendance/<br>meetings | Attendance<br>% |\n| Dr. Nikolaus von Bomhard (Chair)               | 4/4                        | 100             | 14/14                   | 100             |\n| Andrea Kocsis (Deputy Chair)                   | 4/4                        | 100             | 10/13                   | 77              |\n| Silke Busch (since May 4, 2023)                | 3/3                        | 100             | –                       |                 |\n| Dr. Mario Daberkow                             | 4/4                        | 100             | –                       |                 |\n| Ingrid Deltenre                                | 4/4                        | 100             | 8/9                     | 89              |\n| Jörg von Dosky                                 | 4/4                        | 100             | 7/7                     | 100             |\n| Gabriele Gülzau (until May 4, 2023)            | 1/1                        | 100             | –                       |                 |\n| Thomas Held                                    | 4/4                        | 100             | 9/9                     | 100             |\n| Dr. Heinrich Hiesinger                         | 4/4                        | 100             | 5/5                     | 100             |\n| Prof. Dr. Luise Hölscher                       | 4/4                        | 100             | 9/12                    | 75              |\n| Mario Jacubasch                                | 4/4                        | 100             | 4/4                     | 100             |\n| Thorsten Kühn                                  | 4/4                        | 100             | 4/4                     | 100             |\n| Ulrike Lennartz-Pipenbacher                    | 4/4                        | 100             | –                       |                 |\n| Simone Menne                                   | 3/4                        | 75              | 6/7                     | 86              |\n| Yusuf Özdemir                                  | 4/4                        | 100             | 7/7                     | 100             |\n| Lawrence Rosen                                 | 4/4                        | 100             | 6/7                     | 86              |\n| Dr. Stefan Schulte                             | 4/4                        | 100             | 7/7                     | 100             |\n| Dr. Katrin Suder (since May 4, 2023)           | 3/3                        | 100             | –                       |                 |\n| Stephan Teuscher                               | 4/4                        | 100             | 12/12                   | 100             |\n| Stefanie Weckesser                             | 4/4                        | 100             | 7/7                     | 100             |\n| Prof. Dr.-Ing.

The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font, also in red. The background of the image is yellow.\n\nOnly one extraordinary meeting of the Strategy and Sustainability Committee, along with three meetings of the Finance and Audit Committee to discuss the financial figures ahead of the quarterly reporting, took place as videoconferences. All members of the Supervisory Board took part in the plenary meetings; only Simone Menne was excused from one meeting. Attendance at plenary and committee meetings in 2023 is shown individually in the table. No member took part in fewer than three-fourths of the meetings. Meetings of the Supervisory Board were held regularly without the Board of Management members, for example on matters regarding the Board of Management and to review the efficiency of the Supervisory Board's work.\n\nThe members of the Board of Management participated in all plenary meetings and reported on the business performance in the divisions for which they are responsible. The CEO and the members of the Board of Management responsible for the respective committee attended the committee meetings. Executives from the tier immediately below the Board of Management and the auditors were also invited to attend for individual agenda items. The members of the Financial and Audit Committee discussed individual matters with the auditors, also without the Board of Management members being present.\n\n#### Discussions with investors\n\nIn the autumn of the past year, I held talks with several investors and proxies on topics that fall under the responsibility of the Supervisory Board. The talks focused on, among other topics, the ESG Roadmap of DHL Group, in particular governance aspects, and the anchoring of ESG criteria in the short- and long-term Board of Management remuneration, as well as the qualifications of the individual members of the Supervisory Board, which are shown in the curriculum vitae of the Supervisory Board members on the company's website and in table form in the **[Annual Corporate Governance Statement.](#page-115-0)** The professional experience and expertise of the new Supervisory Board members proposed by the Supervisory Board to the 2024 Annual General Meeting were discussed in detail, in consideration of their independence and the future composition of the committees. The Board of Management's intention to convene the 2024 Annual General Meeting once again as an in-person meeting was also positively received by the investors.\n\n#### Key topics addressed in plenary meetings\n\nAll meetings centered on reporting and discussion of the Group's and its divisions' financial position and business performance, as well as information on the discussions of the committee meetings.\n\nFurthermore, the risks and opportunities for the company associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects were of importance, as well as the environmental and social impact of the company's current operations and the implementation of the sustainability strategy. There was also regular exchange with the Board of Management on digitalization, including the developments in the field of artificial intelligence. In addition to the strategic direction of the product portfolio in the Group as a whole, the impact of new regulatory parameters on the business in the Post & Parcel Germany division was also a material topic in the year under review.\n\nIn March 2023, we discussed the annual and consolidated financial statements, including the management report and the nonfinancial statement. At the recommendation of the Finance and Audit Committee, we approved the financial statements that had been given an unqualified opinion by the audit firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). We concurred with the Board of Management's proposed resolution on the appropriation of the net retained profit and therefore a dividend distribution in the amount of €1.85 per share. In line with the finance strategy, 41.1% of net profit was thus distributed to the shareholders last year. Following many years of having our financial statements audited by PwC, the annual and consolidated financial statements for the 2023 fiscal year were audited by the audit firm Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (Deloitte), Munich, as resolved by the Annual General Meeting. The responsible auditors were Prof. Dr. Frank Beine and Dr. Hendrik Nardmann.\n\nApproval of the remuneration report, the report of the Supervisory Board to the Annual General Meeting and the proposed resolutions on the agenda items of the Annual General Meeting, including the (re-)election of Katrin Suder and Mario Daberkow to the Supervisory Board, were also the subject of the March meeting, as well as the determination of the annual bonus of Board of Management members on the basis of the respective degree of target achievement and corresponding recommendations of the Executive Committee. Our discussions also focused on the status of collective bargaining negotiations and the expansion of the volume of the current share program to as much as €3 billion in conjunction with the approval of a potential collection of up to 55 million further repurchased shares. Moreover, in this meeting, the Supervisory Board approved the establishment of a joint venture with Saudi Aramco.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### CORPORATE STRUCTURE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2023\n\nImage /page/19/Figure/4 description: The image is a diagram illustrating the divisions and group functions of DHL Group. The diagram is divided into two main sections: Divisions and Group Functions. The Divisions section includes five divisions: Express, Global Forwarding, Freight, Supply Chain, E-commerce, and Post & Parcel Germany. Each division is represented by an image and a brief description of its services. Express provides transport of urgent documents and goods, primarily as time-definite international shipments. Global Forwarding, Freight offers international forwarding services for air, ocean, and overland freight. Supply Chain provides tailor-made logistics services and supply chain solutions based on globally standardized modules such as warehousing, transport, and value-added services. E-commerce provides domestic parcel transport in selected countries in Europe, the USA, and Asia, as well as deferred cross-border services to, from, and within Europe, and from the United States. Post & Parcel Germany transports, sorts, and delivers documents and goods in Germany and exports to the rest of the world. A pie chart shows the share of consolidated revenue for 2023, with the following percentages: 22.1%, 29.7%, 20.6%, 7.6%, and 20.1%. The Group Functions section includes Corporate Center, Global Business Services, and Customer Solutions & Innovation. Below these functions are CEO, Finance, and Human Resources. A note at the bottom indicates that '1' refers to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Organizational changes\n\nAfter more than 15 years as CEO, Frank Appel's term of office as a member of the Board of Management expired at the end of the Annual General Meeting on May 4, 2023. Tobias Meyer, who has been a member of the Board of Management since April 2019, has been the CEO since that date.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-20-0\"></span>Image /page/20/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nAs of July 1, 2023, the Group changed its name from Deutsche Post DHL Group to DHL Group and, since then, the exchange symbol has been DHL. This does not impact the services offered by the divisions. The DHL and Deutsche Post brands will continue to be used as before. The change of name does not have any impact on the names or characteristics of the Group's legal entities, particularly Deutsche Post AG, or on the internal and external relations with these entities.\n\n#### Worldwide presence\n\nOur locations can be found in the **[list of shareholdings.](https://group.dhl.com/content/dam/deutschepostdhl/en/media-center/investors/documents/annual-reports/DHL-Group-list-of-shareholdings-2023-12-31.pdf)** The following description of the divisions shows market shares and market volumes – where available and useful – in the most important regions.\n\n#### Express division\n\nImage /page/20/Figure/7 description: The image displays DHL's global express network statistics. It states that DHL operates in over 220 countries, has over 295 dedicated aircraft, and services over 500 airports. DHL also has around 115,000 service points, 3 million customers, around 3,800 facilities, 22 hubs, and around 116,000 employees.\n\n#### Time-definite international shipments\n\nIn the Express division, we transport urgent documents and goods reliably and on time from door to door. International timedefinite shipments are our core business. The division's main product is Time Definite International (TDI), a cross-border transport and delivery service with predefined, standardized transit times. Our expertise in customs clearance keeps shipments moving as a prerequisite in ensuring fast and reliable door-to-door service. We also provide industry-specific services to round out our TDI product. For example, our Medical Express transport solution, which is tailored specifically to companies in the life sciences and healthcare sectors, offers various types of thermal packaging for temperature-controlled, chilled and frozen contents.\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/21/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in a bold, red font, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters, the word \"Group\" is written in a smaller, red font. The background of the logo is yellow.\n\nAround 288 million TDI shipments were transported worldwide in 2023. We estimate our global market share at around 43% on the basis of a survey from 2021.\n\n#### Our virtual airline\n\nOur global air freight network is operated by multiple airlines, some of which are wholly owned by the Group. The combination of our own and purchased capacities allows us to respond flexibly to fluctuating demand. The following graphic illustrates how our available freight capacity is organized and offered on the market. Most of the freight capacity is used for TDI, our main product. If any cargo space remains on our own flights, we sell it to customers in the air freight sector. The largest buyer of remaining capacity is the DHL Global Forwarding business unit.\n\n#### AVAILABLE CAPACITY\n\nImage /page/21/Figure/7 description: The image shows a yellow and red DHL cargo plane with three cargo containers labeled 1, 2, and 3. Below the plane, there are descriptions of each container. Container 1 is labeled \"Core\" and is described as \"Express TDI core product - capacity based upon average utilization, adjusted on a daily basis.\" Container 2 is labeled \"BSA\" and is described as \"Block Space Agreement - guaranteed air cargo product.\" Container 3 is labeled \"ACS\" and is described as \"Air Capacity Sales, average total spare capacity that is not slated to be utilized for BSA or TDI core volumes.\"\n\n#### Keeping our customer service promise and standards\n\nIn order to verify the keeping of our service promise as a global network operator and to further improve it, we monitor the satisfaction and changing requirements of our customers, for example through our Insanely Customer Centric Culture program and with the Net Promoter Approach.\n\nAt our quality control centers, we track shipments across the globe and adjust the processes dynamically as required. All premium products are tracked until they are delivered.\n\nWe conduct regular reviews of operational safety, compliance with standards and quality of service at our facilities in cooperation with government authorities. Approximately 450 locations have been certified by the Transported Asset Protection Association (TAPA).\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-22-0\"></span>Image /page/22/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n[The Company](#page-2-0)  [Combined Management Report](#page-17-0) [Further Information](#page-222-0)\n\n[Consolidated Financial Statements](#page-122-0) \n\n### Global Forwarding, Freight division\n\nImage /page/22/Figure/4 description: The image shows a graphic with the text \"AIR, OCEAN AND OVERLAND FREIGHT\" at the top. Below this, there are three circular sections containing information. The first section on the left states \"Around 200 freight terminals\". The middle section says \"Around 47,000 employees\". The section on the right says \"250,000+ customers\". In between the middle and right sections, it says \"120+ countries\".\n\n#### Air, ocean and overland freight forwarding services\n\nAir, ocean and overland freight forwarding services are the core business of the Global Forwarding, Freight division. They include standardized transports as well as multimodal and sector-specific solutions, together with customized industrial projects and customs services. Our business model is based upon brokering transport services between customers and freight carriers. The global reach of our network allows us to offer efficient routing and multimodal transport options. Compared with the Group's other divisions, our operational business model is asset light. Global Forwarding, Freight is among the top three global freight forwarding companies in a market that remains fragmented.\n\n#### Declining volumes in freight markets due to overall normalization\n\nAs expected, the overall situation on the freight markets returned to normal in 2023. In this environment, we reached around 1.7 million tons (previous year: around 1.9 million tons) of export air freight transported. In ocean freight, volumes decreased by 6.2% to around 3.1 million (previous year: around 3.3 million) 20-foot container units transported.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/23/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters.

Increased labor costs, toll charges and persistently high diesel prices caused constant cost pressure.\n\n#### Satisfied customers and high security standards\n\nWe aim to design our services to be as user-friendly as possible in the Global Forwarding, Freight division. To do so, we systematically record customer feedback by calculating Net Promoter Scores and conducting annual satisfaction surveys. Based upon the information received, we define initiatives and actions aimed at steadily improving our products and services.\n\nWith an ISO-certified business continuity management program, our global network meets the highest sector-specific safety standards, including TAPA and the US initiative C-TPAT.\n\nWith a global Transport Management System, we laid the foundation for further scaling of applications and processes in the Global Forwarding business unit. In the Freight business unit, we also have a standardized Transport Management System along with customer interaction tools such as the myDHLFreight portal, which is already running in eight countries, and Saloodo!, our digital marketplace for road freight.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-24-0\"></span>Image /page/24/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo is red and consists of the letters \"DHL\" in a stylized font, with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller, sans-serif font. The background is yellow.\n\n### Supply Chain division\n\nImage /page/24/Figure/4 description: The image shows information about DHL. The text at the top says \"SOLUTIONS TO REDUCE SUPPLY CHAIN COMPLEXITY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS\". There are four sections with information. The first section says \"Around 188,000 employees\" and shows a DHL truck and a woman in a safety vest. The second section says \"Around 8,500 vehicles\". The third section says \"Around 17 million m² of warehousing and operational space¹\" and shows a warehouse. The fourth section says \"Active in 50+ countries\".\n\n1 Includes owned and leased warehouses only and not customer-owned facilities operated by DHL.\n\n#### Tailor-made supply chain solutions\n\nOur core business comprises tailor-made logistics services and supply chain solutions to reduce complexity for our customers and to add sustainable value. We offer a broad product portfolio including warehouse operations and transport as well as value-added services such as eFulfillment, omnichannel solutions and returns management, Lead Logistics Partner (LLP), Real Estate Solutions, Service Logistics and packaging solutions targeted to our customer's needs across all strategic industry sectors. We offer modular solutions that allow our customers' operations to be more agile and more flexible to respond to changing supply chain needs and requirements.\n\n#### Standardization and use of innovative technologies\n\nWe are constantly striving to increase speed and agility along the entire supply chain through modular standardization and the use of new technologies. State-of-the-art digital solutions are already used at more than 91% of our locations, for example with some 6,000 collaborative robots and some 46,000 smart wearables deployed. In addition, we leverage data analytics to drive operational efficiencies and to enhance the customer experience. We are integrating physical and digital supply chain solutions.\n\n#### Leading position in contract logistics\n\nThe global contract logistics market is estimated to have totaled around €275 billion for the year 2022. DHL is the global market leader in the fragmented market of contract logistics, with a market share of 6.0% (2022) and operations in more than 50 countries. The market share of the next leading provider is approximately half as large.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/25/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters. There are three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. The word \"Group\" is in red and is located below the letters.\n\n#### Meeting or exceeding customers' expectations\n\nWith the globally consistent operating standards of our \"Operations Management System First Choice,\" we want to ensure that we consistently either meet or exceed our customers' quality expectations and continuously improve.\n\nThanks to our systematic follow-up on customer feedback, our satisfaction values (Net Promoter Approach) continue to rise from their already high level.\n\n#### CONTRACT LOGISTICS MARKET 20221\n\n| € billion          | Asia Pacific | Americas | Middle<br>East/Africa | Europe | Global |\n|--------------------|--------------|----------|-----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Contract logistics | 95           | 88       | 9                     | 83     | 275    |\n\n1 Own company estimate; rounded.\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-26-0\"></span>Image /page/26/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo is red and consists of the letters \"DHL\" in a stylized font, with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller, sans-serif font. The background is yellow.\n\n### eCommerce division\n\nImage /page/26/Figure/4 description: The image is a graphic with a yellow background and white text boxes. The text at the top reads \"DOMESTIC PARCEL TRANSPORT AND DEFERRED CROSS-BORDER SERVICES\". There are three text boxes with statistics. The first text box says \"20+\" and \"countries\". The second text box says \"More than 1.5 billion parcels\". The third text box says \"Around 28,500 vehicles\". There is also a text box that says \"110,000+ service points\". There are also cartoon images of a man, a package, and a cell phone.\n\n#### Domestic and international parcel transport\n\nOur core business is domestic parcel transport in selected countries in Europe, in the United States, in certain countries in Asia, in particular in India, and deferred cross-border services primarily to, from and within Europe, as well as to and from the United States. Because of the broad range of business activities, no mention of individual market shares can be made.\n\nThe deferred domestic parcel delivery service is provided via our own and partner networks, serving a mix of B2C and B2B customers across all sectors. Our deferred cross-border service provides worldwide shipping solutions to enable our customers to capitalize on strong growth in cross-border trade, while meeting their expectations for speed, reliability, price and sustainability. Since the pre-pandemic year of 2019, we have increased our global cross-border volume by an average of 9% every year. The DHL Parcel Connect platform is our delivery and returns solution developed especially for e-commerce in Europe, catering to both B2B and B2C, which simplifies panEuropean cross-border shipping with a harmonized label, common IT systems, core features and local services.\n\nThe B2C volume had increased tangibly in the pandemic years. In the year under review, the expected pattern of normalization from the previous year continued. We are experiencing volumes well above the level from before the pandemic in 2019 in nearly all markets. The geographic presence of DHL eCommerce was expanded in the year under review through the acquisition of the Turkish company MNG Kargo.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-27-0\"></span>Image /page/27/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Satisfied customers and a high level of delivery reliability\n\nWe focus on delivering industry-leading performance as well as quality and service excellence. With this focus, we succeeded in achieving an overall global delivery quality of 96% (previous year: 95.5%). Moreover, by expanding our offering to more than 110,000 service points in Europe with 24,000 parcel lockers, we are closer to the customer and enable more sustainable last-mile delivery.\n\n### Post & Parcel Germany division\n\nImage /page/27/Figure/6 description: The image shows two figures with statistics about the nationwide post and parcel network in Germany. The first figure on the left shows that there are around 187,000 employees, around 25,000 sales points, and around 108,200 postboxes. The second figure on the right shows that there are around 6.3 million parcels per working day, around 46 million letters per working day, 38 parcel centers, 82 mail centers, and more than 13,000 Pack-and Poststations.\n\n#### The postal service for Germany\n\nThe core business of the Post & Parcel Germany division is the transport, sorting and delivery of documents and goods shipments. We maintain a nationwide post and parcel network in Germany, which we continually expand in consideration of digitalization and sustainability.\n\nOur products and services in the mail communication segment are targeted toward both private and business customers and range from physical and hybrid letters to additional services such as registered mail, cash on delivery and insured items.\n\nIn the year under review, the German market for mail communication for business customers was worth around €4.0 billion (previous year: around €4.3 billion). The downward trend in market development is due primarily to the continued substitution of traditional letter mail with electronic communication. This competitive market is made up of both alternative delivery service providers as well as consolidation service providers who deliver their mail volumes to Deutsche Post AG. Our market share increased to 63.2% compared with the prior year (62.1%), primarily due to competitors exiting the market.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/28/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters \"DHL\" is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### GERMAN MAIL COMMUNICATION MARKET, BUSINESS CUSTOMERS, 2023\n\n#### Market volume: around €4.0 billion\n\n| Deutsche Post | 63.2% |\n|---------------|-------|\n| Competition   | 36.8% |\n\nSource: own company estimate.\n\n#### Cross-channel dialogue\n\nOn request, Post & Parcel Germany offers advertisers end-to-end solutions in the Dialogue Marketing segment, ranging from address services and tools for design and creation to printing, delivery and evaluation. This supports cross-channel, personalized and automated dialogue to deliver digital and physical items with interrelated content according to a coordinated timetable and without any coverage waste.\n\nThe German advertising market increased by 1.3% in 2023 to come in at €29.0 billion, growing less than in the previous year. The market was burdened by heavily increased paper prices and the general economic development. Our share of the highly fragmented German advertising market amounted to 5.7% (previous year: 6.0%).\n\n#### GERMAN ADVERTISING MARKET1 2023\n\n#### Market volume: €29.0 billion\n\n| Competition   | 94.3% |\n|---------------|-------|\n| Deutsche Post | 5.7%  |\n\n1 Includes all advertising media with external distribution costs; the placement costs are shown as ratios. Source: own company estimate.\n\n#### DHL Parcel for companies and private individuals\n\nWe maintain the densest network of parcel acceptance and drop-off points in Germany, which was expanded further and digitalized in the reporting year.\n\nWe offer support to businesses to grow their online retail business. Along with the Supply Chain division, we are able to cover the entire logistics chain through to returns management on request.\n\nVarious services enable individualized parcel delivery for private customers: parcels can be delivered to an alternative address, a specific retail outlet, a Paketshop or a Packstation at short notice. This ability to individually select delivery options and notifications makes receiving a parcel more convenient and more transparent.\n\nThe German parcel market continues to be subject to competition-driven structural changes, with established as well as new companies offering their services. In e-commerce, the delivery of a portion of shipments is handled by the merchant's own distribution networks.\n\nThere has been no interruption in the growth trend in the number of online orders, despite the dynamic slowing down compared to previous years. In light of this as well, we are continuously expanding our network. By increasing the number of Pack- and Poststations in the coming years, we plan to make it even more convenient for customers all over Germany to send and receive parcels and to create an environmentally friendly, traffic-reduced parcel supply system.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-29-0\"></span>Image /page/29/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Reliable delivery in a challenging environment\n\nAccording to surveys conducted by Quotas, a quality research institute, around 86% of all domestic letters posted in Germany during daily business hours at our retail outlets or before final collection were delivered the very next day in the year under review. Around 96% were delivered within two days. This puts us above the legally required levels of 80% (D+1) and 95% (D+2).\n\nThese figures can be deemed very positive in light of the challenging environment in which they were achieved. The beginning of 2023, for instance, was impacted by collective bargaining negotiations and the associated strikes. In addition, the situation on the German labor market remained tense overall in spite of the new collective bargaining agreement for employees of Deutsche Post AG.\n\nOur approximately 25,000 person-operated sales points were open for an average of 55 hours per week in the year under review, as was the case in the previous year. Consumers who use the products and services offered by Deutsche Post retail outlets operated mostly by retailers are surveyed annually regarding customer satisfaction by \"Kundenmonitor Deutschland.\" This study attested to the high level of approval enjoyed by Deutsche Post retail outlets: a total of 94.6% of the persons surveyed were satisfied with the quality and service (previous year: 94.2%). The fixed-location acceptance and sales network has grown to around 38,000 sites (previous year: around 36,300) thanks to the expansion of our Pack- and Poststation network. Deutsche Post and DHL are thus easier to reach and closer to consumers in Germany than ever before in recent decades.\n\n#### Strategy\n\n#### Navigating safely through a volatile, fast-changing environment\n\nThe DHL Group's strategy draws on the elements of Strategy 2015 and 2020, which established us as the world's leading logistics company. Building on this foundation, Strategy 2025, which we presented to the public at the end of 2019, has helped us to cement and grow that leading position.\n\nWe defined our strategic goals in a comprehensive process in which we worked with our relevant stakeholders including employees, customers, suppliers and investors. The \"Strategy House\" graphic of DHL Group illustrates the most important elements of our strategy and how they are connected.\n\nSo far, Strategy 2025 has guided us safely through the volatile, fast-changing environment. As part of a yearly assessment, we undertook a detailed review of our corporate strategy and found it not only to be fundamentally sound, but that it had also made DHL Group more resilient. Focusing on our core business has helped us to make the necessary adjustments quickly, in particular in the volatile environment of recent years, so that we could not only keep our promise to the customers under these challenging circumstances, but also ensure the financial stability of the company and do justice to the investors by sticking to our financial strategy. That resilience is the result of the disciplined and consistent execution of our Group strategy, with each and every element playing a key role.\n\n#### Strategic triad of purpose, vision and values\n\nOur purpose of \"Connecting people, improving lives\" has never been more important than it is today. In keeping with our vision of being THE logistics company for the world, DHL Group strives to continue leading the industry – and doing so in an increasingly digital and sustainability-oriented world. Our core values \"Respect and Results\" are just as much a part of our strategy today as they have been in the past.\n\nThe triad of purpose, vision and values underpins the three building blocks of Strategy 2025: sustained execution excellence along the three bottom lines; becoming an employer, provider and investment of choice; and a focus on our profitable core business and digital transformation. We have also cemented sustainability in the business strategy with our purpose and our own values. Respect and Results mean that we are committed to each other and, together, make a positive social contribution. Our purpose \"Connecting people, improving lives\" guides our efforts and sense of responsibility.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/30/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n[The Company](#page-2-0) \n\n#### STRATEGY HOUSE\n\nImage /page/30/Figure/4 description: The image shows a red abstract design. It consists of a series of interconnected diamond shapes, arranged in a pattern that resembles a stylized tree or branching structure. The diamonds vary in size and are connected by short lines, creating a network of geometric shapes. The overall impression is modern and somewhat minimalist.\n\nConnecting people, improving lives\n\nWe are the logistics company for the world\n\n**Respect & Results**\n\nImage /page/30/Picture/12 description: The image shows two sections with text and graphics. The top section features a triangular graphic divided into three parts: red (Employer of Choice), yellow (Provider of Choice), and green (Investment of Choice). In the center of the triangle is an icon with the text \"CONNECTING PEOPLE, IMPROVING LIVES\". To the right of the triangle is the text \"Our Mission\", followed by \"Excellence. Simply delivered.\", \"Along the three bottom lines in a sustainable way\", and \"Enabled by Common DNA\". The bottom section contains a graphic of three overlapping circles in yellow, gray, and white. The text \"PROFITABLE CORE\" is in the center of the circles. To the right of the circles is the text \"Our Business Unit focus\", followed by \"Strengthening the profitable core\" and \"Supported by Group functions\". At the bottom of the image is the word \"Digitalization\".\n\n#### Execution excellence along the three bottom lines\n\nOur mission of \"Excellence. Simply delivered.\" is defined by the three bottom lines of becoming the employer, provider and investment of choice. We believe having motivated and skilled employees is the key to providing excellent service quality and achieving profitable growth.\n\nAt DHL Group, when we speak of our Common DNA, we mean the set of behaviors, tools and programs that we put into practice throughout the Group. Group-wide programs such as Certified, First Choice and Safety First play an important part in building the Common DNA by influencing what we do on a day-to-day basis. Irrespective of division, geographical region or function, our Common DNA is an expression of who we are and how we do things at DHL Group.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-31-0\"></span>Image /page/31/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font size, also in red. The background of the image is yellow.\n\nAs an integral part of our strategy, sustainability is anchored along our three bottom lines. New policies and regulations across industries, increasingly changing buying habits and the growing interest in topics related to sustainability have motivated us to serve as a sustainability role model in our industry and to set ourselves ambitious targets. We therefore made sustainability a cornerstone of Strategy 2025 and an essential element of our mission.\n\nWith our ESG Roadmap, we build on our past achievements and plot a course for future success. The road map serves as guidance in the three areas of environment, social responsibility and corporate governance. Clear objectives were set for each of these areas. We strive for environmentally friendly logistics and aim to be a great place to work for all and a trustworthy company and partner.\n\nWe set transparent, time-bound targets and KPIs with which we make sustainability an integral component in the yearly planning and strategic cycle, with targets integrated into our decision-making process. One key target is to increase the pace of our company's planned decarbonization, **[nonfinancial statement.](#page-64-0)**\n\n#### Divisions focus on profitable core business\n\nOur divisions continue to focus relentlessly on their profitable core. In so doing, they ensure that our services and solutions can be provided reliably, even in unusual circumstances.\n\n#### Digital transformation as a key lever\n\nRepresenting a significant lever for sustainable business growth, digital transformation plays a crucial role in our strategy. We therefore invest in initiatives designed to improve the experiences our customers and employees have with the company and to increase operational efficiency. In our divisions, we have several initiatives and programs in place to upgrade the IT backbone, ensure our future agility and increase IT efficiency. In particular in the fields of automation and robotics, data science, API and the Internet of Things, we are continuously building up centralized know-how and scaling digital solutions for the divisions.\n\n#### Research and development\n\nAs a service provider, DHL Group does not engage in research and development activities in the narrower sense and therefore has no significant expenses to report in this connection.\n\n#### Steering metrics\n\n#### Financial and nonfinancial key performance indicators\n\nDHL Group uses both financial and nonfinancial performance indicators in its management of the Group. The monthly, quarterly and annual changes in these indicators are compared with prior-year data and forecast data to assist in making management decisions. The year-to-year changes in the financial and nonfinancial performance indicators described here also play a role in the calculation of management remuneration. The Group's financial performance indicators are intended to preserve a balance between profitability, the efficient use of resources and adequate liquidity. How these metrics are computed is illustrated in **[calculations.](#page-33-0)** The performance of the financial key figures in the reporting year is described in the **[report on economic position.](#page-35-0)**\n\nTo date, the progress of our ESG Roadmap has been measured using six steering-relevant performance indicators: logistics-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, Realized Decarbonization Effects, Employee Engagement, the share of women in middle and upper management, the lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) per 200,000 working hours and the share of valid compliancerelevant training certificates in middle and upper management. As planned, a seventh performance indicator – the cybersecurity rating – was introduced in corporate governance during the year under review. In addition, the performance indicators Realized Decarbonization Effects, Employee Engagement and cybersecurity rating are incorporated into – and account for 10%, respectively, of – the target portfolio for annual bonus calculation of the Board of Management. Since this reporting period, these performance indicators have also been included in the bonus calculation for executives in upper management. The targets and results of these key figures can be found in the **[report on economic position,](#page-36-0)** development is provided in the **[nonfinancial statement](#page-58-0)** and the outlook for the 2024 fiscal year is provided in the **[expected developments, opportunities and risks](#page-95-0)** chapter.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/32/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### EBIT and EAC (EBIT after asset charge)\n\nThe profitability of the Group's operating divisions is measured as profit from operating activities (EBIT).\n\nEBIT after asset charge (EAC) is another key performance indicator used by the Group. EAC is calculated by subtracting the asset charge, a cost-of-capital component, from EBIT. Making the asset charge a part of business decisions encourages the efficient use of resources and ensures that our operational business is geared toward increasing value sustainably while improving cash flow.\n\nThe asset charge is calculated on the basis of the weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, which is defined as the weighted average net cost of interest-bearing liabilities and equity, taking into account company-specific risk factors in accordance with the Capital Asset Pricing Model.\n\nA standard WACC of 8.5% is applied across the divisions. That figure also represents the minimum target for projects and investments within the Group. The WACC is generally reviewed once annually on the basis of the current situation on the financial markets. To ensure better comparability of the asset charge with previous figures, in 2023 the WACC used here was maintained at a constant level compared with the previous years.\n\nThe asset charge is calculated each month so that fluctuations in the net asset base can also be taken into account during the year. The composition of the net asset base is shown in the **[calculations.](#page-33-0)**\n\n#### Free cash flow facilitates liquidity management\n\nAlong with EBIT and EAC, cash flow is another key performance metric used by Group management. The goal is to maintain sufficient liquidity to cover all of the Group's financial obligations from debt repayment and dividends, in addition to meeting payment commitments arising from the Group's operations and investments. Cash flow is calculated using the cash flow statement.\n\nOperating cash flow (OCF) includes all items that are related directly to operating value creation. Another key parameter impacting OCF is net working capital. Effective management of net working capital is an important way for the Group to improve cash flow in the short to medium term.\n\nFree cash flow (FCF) is a management indicator derived from OCF. It is used as an indicator of how much cash is available to the company for paying out dividends or repaying debt at the end of a reporting period.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-33-0\"></span>Image /page/33/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The background is yellow.\n\n#### CALCULATIONS\n\nImage /page/33/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram of the calculation of EBIT and Revenue. On the left side, under the title REVENUE, \"Other operating income\" is added, \"Changes in inventories and work performed and capitalized\" is added, \"Materials expense\" is subtracted, \"Staff costs\" is subtracted, \"Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses\" is subtracted, \"Other operating expenses\" is subtracted, and \"Net income/loss from investments accounted for using the equity method\" is added or subtracted. The result is EBIT, or Profit from operating activities. On the right side, under the title EBIT, \"Asset charge\" is subtracted from EBIT. \"Net asset base\" is multiplied by \"Weighted average cost of capital (WACC)\". The result is EAC, or EBIT after Asset Charge. Below that, Operating assets include \"Intangible assets\", \"Property, plant and equipment\", \"Goodwill\", \"Trade receivables (included in net working capital)¹\", and \"Other noncurrent operating assets²\". Operating liabilities include \"Operating provisions (excluding provisions for pensions and similar obligations)\", \"Trade payables (included in net working capital)¹\", and \"Other noncurrent operating liabilities²\". The result is Net asset base.\n\n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n\n= **FCF**\nFree cash flow\n\n1 Includes EBIT-related current assets and liabilities. Not included are assets and liabilities related to taxes, financing and cash and cash equivalents, for example.\n\n2 Includes EBIT-related other noncurrent assets and liabilities. Not included are assets and liabilities related to taxes or bonds, for example.\n\n#### Steering and reducing greenhouse gas emissions\n\nWe aim to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by our operations, as well as our dependency on fossil fuels, in order to mitigate the impact of our operations on the global climate.\n\nWe use the **[logistics-related GHG emissions](#page-64-0)** as a medium- and long-term target. We use a second performance indicator – **[the Realized](#page-64-0)  [Decarbonization Effects](#page-64-0)** – to measure the emissions that we were able to avoid through the use of energy from renewable sources and sustainable technologies compared with conventional energy and technologies.\n\nThe calculation methodology for GHG emissions is based on recognized international standards such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, EN 16258 (replaced by ISO 14083 as of the 2024 fiscal year) and the Global Logistics Emissions Council Framework. To calculate the market-based effects, we use the guidelines of the Voluntary Market Based Measures Framework for Logistics Emissions Accounting and Reporting published by the Smart Freight Centre. Reductions in emissions through offsetting are not factored into our GHG emissions calculation.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/34/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nAs part of our steering, we consider the logistics-related GHG emissions including the upstream chain from fuel production (wellto-wheel) and include the GHG emissions caused or avoided by our transport subcontractors (Scope 3). We record the GHG emissions from categories 3 (\"Fuel- and Energy-Related Activities\"), 4 (\"Upstream Transportation and Distribution\") and 6 (\"Business Travel\"), which are also included in our targets, in the calculation of Scope 3 emissions. The use of sustainable fuels is a significant focus of our climate protection measures. The savings generated through these measures offer us the opportunity to implement climate protection in our own supply chain in a targeted manner. As part of this, fossil fuels are replaced by either the direct use of certified sustainable fuels or the documented use thereof (book and claim). This makes a positive impact on our target calculation.\n\n#### Employee engagement as a factor for success\n\nMotivated and committed employees contribute to the success of the company. In the annual Group-wide survey, all employees have the opportunity to anonymously rate the company's strategy and values as well as their working conditions. The **[Employee](#page-72-0)  [Engagement](#page-72-0)** key performance indicator represents the aggregated and weighted results of five statements in the annual Groupwide survey of employees.\n\n#### Promote diversity by focusing on share of women\n\nWe use the performance indicator of the share of women in middle and upper management to measure the success of our **[diversity](#page-73-0)  [measures.](#page-73-0)** As part of this measurement, executives working part-time are counted on a per-person basis.\n\n#### Occupational health and safety as a focus\n\nWe measure the effect of workplace accidents based on the **[lost time injury frequency rate \\(LTIFR\\),](#page-74-0)** which is determined using the number of work-related accidents per 200,000 working hours that lead to at least one day of missed work for the affected person following the day of the accident. Since the year under review, this has also included accident-related injuries to external employees who are subject to instruction.\n\n#### Subject cybersecurity to independent external assessment\n\nOur cybersecurity undergoes independent assessment by the external rating agency BitSight. This cybersecurity rating is based on the technical analysis of any weak points and brings potential security risks to the attention of the rated company. Assessment of the security situation is carried out by an automated service on a daily basis. Unlike with a self-assessment, a cybersecurity rating offers greater transparency and enables comparison with other companies thanks to standardization. We compare our performance with DAX 40 companies as well as major customers and logistics companies that are not a part of the DAX. The cybersecurity rating KPI has been steering-relevant since this reporting period and is also included in the calculation of the annual bonus for the Board of Management.\n\n#### Conduct compliance-relevant training\n\nOur aspiration is to be a reliable and trustworthy partner in all business relationships. When conducting day-to-day business, our managers serve an important function as role models to the employees and business partners, which is why corresponding training is of such importance for executives. We measure success in this area on the basis of the share of valid training certificates in middle and upper management. This performance indicator has been replaced by the cybersecurity rating since this reporting period in the calculation of the annual bonus for the Board of Management.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-35-0\"></span>Image /page/35/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller, less stylized font. The background is yellow.\n\n## REPORT ON ECONOMIC POSITION\n\n### Overall assessment of the Board of Management\n\nIn the first year without direct effects from the pandemic, the Group managed to maintain results of operations at a level well above that from the years before the pandemic, in spite of the absence of a thorough economic recovery. The 2023 fiscal year was shaped by the lack of global economic recovery and the normalization of freight transport following the pandemic-related volatility of the years 2021 and 2022. As expected, profit from operating activities (EBIT) of €6.3 billion did not reach the level of the prior-year figure. Lower freight volumes and significantly decreased freight rates, as well as negative currency effects, were a burden on the business of the DHL divisions. The results of the Post & Parcel Germany division reflect cost increases and regulatory framework conditions for the German letter mail business. Nevertheless, the Group achieved a free cash flow of €2.9 billion, including acquisitions and divestitures, in the past fiscal year. DHL Group thus underscores its structurally improved ability to perform and financial strength, even in a weak economic environment.\n\nIn the year under review, the divisions continued to focus on their profitable core business and ensured that the services and products could be provided reliably. On the one hand, DHL Group kept a close eye on costs and, on the other, invested further in growth areas of global operations as well as in the quality of its services. Representing a significant lever for sustainable business growth, digital transformation plays a crucial role in the DHL Group strategy. DHL Group therefore invests in initiatives designed to improve the experiences its customers and employees have with the company and to increase operational efficiency. Overall, we believe that e-commerce and globalization – along with omnishoring – and increasingly sustainability as well, are megatrends that will provide for growth in the future.\n\nDHL Group has a wealth of experience in dealing with various economic cycles and crises around the world. Thanks to its global presence and the broad portfolio of transport and logistics services, there were also areas of business growth in the year under review. DHL Group is well positioned to not only manage the current challenges, but also to take advantage of an upward trend in the global economy as soon as it arises.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-36-0\"></span>Image /page/36/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

These effects contributed to the high rates of inflation along with the loosening of fiscal and monetary policies during the coronavirus pandemic. The tightening of monetary policy up until the third quarter had a lasting weakening effect on the economy and global trade and is a significant factor in the caution seen in investments and consumer behavior. Although the energy markets settled down to a certain extent compared with the previous year, gas and electricity prices – especially in Germany and the rest of Europe – remained well above the level from before the war in Ukraine and thus impeded any thorough recovery of the global economy following the pandemic. Even though the key interest rates of leading central banks could have reached their peak in the fall of 2023, a loosening of monetary policy is not likely until the middle of 2024.\n\nThe data mentioned in the following paragraph describing the economic conditions stem from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nGlobal GDP growth continued to weaken from 3.1% in 2022 to 2.7% in 2023. GDP growth in industrialized companies fell from 2.6% to 1.6%, primarily due to the eurozone, which was impacted by the war in Ukraine and whose growth downright collapsed from 3.5% to 0.5%. Following growth of 1.9% in the previous year, Germany even fell into the slightly negative growth (–0.2%) in the year under review. By contrast, the United States bolstered economic activity from 1.9% to 2.4% with a very expansive fiscal policy. At the same time, emerging markets experienced a recovery from 3.7% to 4.2%, with a significant rise in China from 3.0% in 2022 to 5.4% in 2023 being a major contributor.\n\n#### Growth in global industrial production and global trade significantly hampered\n\nIn 2023, growth in global industrial production and global trade remained significantly hampered. Following growth of 7.0% and 2.8% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, industrial production grew by only 0.7% in 2023. The figures for global trade reflect this slowdown, with exports growing by a mere 1.1% compared with 10.9% in 2021 and 5.6% in 2022. For the logistics sector, this cooling comes with more moderate demand and declining volumes. In the B2B segment, challenges from partly excess inventories and dwindling demand persisted, which resulted in a sustained alignment of freight rates and transport capacities. Even toward the end of 2023, there was no significant recovery in demand, which underscores the ongoing global economic recession. For DHL Group, these developments manifested themselves in the form of a decline in revenue and earnings figures.\n\n#### E-commerce with structural growth dynamic\n\nIn spite of the overall uncertainty of the economy, continuing inflation and the slowdown in global trade, the e-commerce sector confirmed its structural growth dynamic. Following a preliminary normalization in 2022, e-commerce-based business once again experienced growth in 2023, which confirms the long-term change in consumer behaviors. DHL Group is making use of this dynamic to expand and improve its e-commerce logistics services.\n\n#### Legal environment\n\nThe Group provides some of its services in regulated markets. Many of the postal services rendered by Deutsche Post AG and its subsidiaries (particularly the Post & Parcel Germany division) are subject to sector-specific regulation under the Postgesetz (PostG – German Postal Act). Information regarding this issue and legal risks is contained in **[note 45 to the consolidated financial statements.](#page-213-0)** \n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-38-0\"></span>Image /page/38/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n## Significant events\n\nAs part of the completed second and third tranches and the initiated fourth tranche of the 2022–2024 share buyback program, we had repurchased a total of 22.0 million shares in the amount of €925 million over the course of the year through December 31, 2023. Since the beginning of the share buyback program, we have repurchased a total of 50.0 million shares with a value of €1,940 million. On February 12, 2024, the Board of Management resolved to expand the current share buyback program so that a total of up to 130 million treasury shares are to be purchased at a price of now up to €4 billion through the end of 2025.\n\nOn June 26, 2023, we placed a sustainability-linked bond with an issue volume of €500 million and a term through 2033. The interest rate from 2031 onward is linked to the achievement of DHL Group's targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nOn October 5, 2023, we acquired 100% of shares in the Turkish parcel service provider MNG Kargo following successful approval by the antitrust authorities. In the eCommerce division, the company should contribute to the ability to benefit from the growth potential of the Turkish market.\n\nOn December 7, 2023, we acquired the remaining shares in Danzas AEI Emirates, consolidated the company, which had previously been held as a joint venture, fully into the Group and renamed it DHL Logistics. With this acquisition, our customers in the Middle East and Africa region will benefit from more efficient logistics and transport services in the Global Forwarding, Freight division.\n\nThere were no further noteworthy changes to the portfolio.\n\n#### Results of operations\n\n#### SELECTED INDICATORS FOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n|                                         |    | 2022   | 2023   | Q4 2022 | Q4 2023 |\n|-----------------------------------------|----|--------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Revenue                                 | €m | 94,436 | 81,758 | 23,776  | 21,348  |\n| Profit from operating activities (EBIT) | €m | 8,436  | 6,345  | 1,922   | 1,642   |\n| Return on sales1                        | %  | 8.9    | 7.8    | 8.1     | 7.7     |\n| EBIT after asset charge (EAC)2          | €m | 5,117  | 2,860  | 1,065   | 752     |\n| Consolidated net profit for the period3 | €m | 5,359  | 3,677  | 1,335   | 981     |\n| Earnings per share4                     | €  | 4.41   | 3.09   | 1.11    | 0.83    |\n| Dividend per share                      | €  | 1.85   | 1.855  | –       | –       |\n\n1 EBIT/revenue.\n\n2 Prior-year figure adjusted.\n\n3 After deduction of noncontrolling interests.\n\n4 Basic earnings per share.\n\n5 Proposal.\n\n#### Group revenue falls by 13.4%\n\nDue to the economic environment, Group revenue fell by €12,678 million to €81,758 million in the 2023 fiscal year. Above all, the normalization of freight rates in the Global Forwarding, Freight division and negative currency effects in the amount of €2,684 million also contributed to this development. The proportion of revenue generated abroad changed from 76.8% to 74.4%. In the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue was down from the prior-year period (€23,776 million) to €21,348 million; negative currency effects in the amount of €770 million contributed to this. At €2,787 million, other operating income fell short of the prior-year period (€2,925 million).\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-39-0\"></span>Image /page/39/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Significantly lower material expense\n\nMaterial expense decreased significantly from €53,473 million to €41,663 million, largely due to lower transport costs in the Global Forwarding, Freight division in particular as a result of lower volumes and freight rates. In addition, kerosine prices fell markedly year over year. Wage and salary increases and a slightly higher number of employees raised staff costs by €942 million to €26,977 million. Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses were up by €300 million to €4,477 million due to investment activity. At €5,409 million, other operating expenses were below the prior-year period (€5,712 million). In addition to decreased expenses from currency translation, lower expenses from impairment losses and remeasurements of receivables and liabilities were incurred in the year under review. Net income/expenses from investments accounted for using the equity method changed from €–39 million in the previous year to €161 million. In the year under review, this included, in particular, remeasurement income as a result of the increased shareholding in DHL Logistics in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n#### Consolidated EBIT down\n\nTotaling €6,345 million in the year under review, profit from operating activities (EBIT) came in €2,091 million lower than the prior-year figure. This figure declined from €1,922 million to €1,642 million in the fourth quarter. Primarily because the interest expenses for provisions and lease liabilities rose, net finance costs were €829 million and therefore above the level of the previous year (net finance costs of €525 million). Profit before income taxes fell by €2,395 million to €5,516 million. As a result, income taxes decreased by €613 million to €1,581 million in spite of a slightly higher tax rate.\n\n#### Consolidated net profit in line with EBIT\n\nConsolidated net profit showed a decline in the 2023 fiscal year from €5,717 million to €3,935 million. Of this amount, €3,677 million is attributable to Deutsche Post AG shareholders and €258 million to noncontrolling interest holders. Basic earnings per share fell from €4.41 to €3.09 and diluted earnings per share from €4.33 to €3.04.\n\n#### Dividend of €1.85 per share proposed\n\nOur finance strategy calls for paying out 40% to 60% of net profit as dividends as a general rule. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will therefore propose to the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on May 3, 2024, a dividend of €1.85 per share for the 2023 fiscal year (previous year: €1.85). The payout ratio in relation to the consolidated net profit attributable to Deutsche Post AG shareholders amounts to 59.0%. The dividend yield based on the year-end closing price for shares is 4.1%. The dividend will be disbursed on May 8, 2024.\n\nImage /page/39/Figure/11 description: The image shows a bar graph with a line graph overlayed on top of it. The y axis is labeled '€m'.

Within the context of the high levels of economic uncertainty around the world and consumer reluctance, both the B2B and the B2C volumes were down year over year. In this environment, our virtual airline model ensured high network flexibility, enabling us to constantly adapt our capacity to volume expectations.\n\n#### Express: effective yield and cost management\n\nRevenue in the Express division decreased by 10.0% to €24,846 million in the 2023 fiscal year. This includes negative currency effects amounting to €1,196 million, as well as lower fuel surcharges. Excluding currency effects and fuel surcharges, revenue in the reporting period was down 4.8%. Reflective of the continued softer market conditions, TDI daily shipment volumes declined by 2.5%.\n\nOver the course of 2023, benefits were seen from the drive to enhance productivity, optimize the utilization of capacity in our network and effectively manage costs. We addressed the ongoing effects of inflation with general price increases that were systematically implemented. In the 2023 fiscal year, EBIT in the Express division was €3,229 million, 19.8% below the prior-year figure. The return on sales was 13.0%.

By the end of 2023, 22 of the aircraft ordered entered service. The remaining six aircraft will be delivered in 2024 and 2025. Furthermore, over the course of 2023, we continued to expand our air network with the addition of new direct services, for example between Guangzhou and the United States. Singapore Airlines now operates five B777s under the crew and maintenance agreement signed in 2022.\n\nDHL Air UK expanded its B777 operations from three to seven freighters. DHL Air Austria added two B767-300 to its operations. European Air Transport (EAT) continues to strengthen DHL's network by providing intercontinental services to Asia and the United States. In the Americas region, our regional hub located in Atlanta, USA, which opened in the previous year, bolstered our capabilities. The dedicated flights from Miami to São Paulo (VCP), Brazil, were extended to include Argentina as well. We are continuing to invest in our global hub in Cincinnati, USA, and constructed a state-of-the-art aviation maintenance facility there for our aircraft fleet. In the Asia Pacific region, three additional converted Airbus 330-300s were added by Air Hong Kong to its fleet. The fleet replacement and modernization program will continue in 2024. The extension of the hub in Hong Kong – one of DHL's three global hubs – was officially opened in 2023. In the MEA region, we invested in our infrastructure by modernizing the Bahrain hub. We also increased our fleet of B767-300s from seven to ten converted freighters, of which the last was added in June 2023. The increase in the number of aircraft has allowed us to link east to west as well as strengthen the regional network. In sub-Saharan Africa, four converted ATR 72-500s replaced older aircraft.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-42-0\"></span>Image /page/42/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Due to the weak demand, market volumes were below that of the previous year, but they stabilized over the course of the year. With regard to air freight rates, normalization continued as expected and there were no major fluctuations. This trend was also observed for ocean freight, with a rise in rates setting in toward the end of the year as carriers began to pass on higher costs for freight rerouting on the Red Sea.\n\nIn the European road freight market, the decline in demand due to economic circumstances continued in the year under review and worsened in the third quarter of 2023, in particular. However, costs remained at a high level due to rising diesel, driver and vehicle prices, among other factors.\n\n#### Global Forwarding, Freight: lower revenue in air and ocean freight as anticipated\n\nRevenue in the Global Forwarding, Freight division fell significantly in the year under review by 36.1% to €19,305 million due to lower volumes and significantly decreased freight rates. Excluding negative currency effects of €871 million, revenue was 33.2% below the level of the previous year. In the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue in the Global Forwarding, Freight division amounted to €4,565 million and fell short of the prior-year figure by 32.9%.\n\nRevenue in the Global Forwarding business unit decreased by 42.9% to €14,259 million in the year under review against the backdrop of the general normalization of freight markets. Without taking negative currency effects of €756 million into account, the decrease was 39.9%. Gross profit in the reporting period in the Global Forwarding business unit was down from the previous year by 25.5% to €3,685 million.\n\nWe registered a decrease of 12.1% in air freight volumes in 2023 that impacted all significant trade lanes. Air freight revenues dropped by 42.2% and gross profit by 41.5% year over year due to lower volumes and selling rates. In the fourth quarter of 2023, air freight revenue declined by 32.5% and gross profit by 45.4%. The volumes transported in ocean freight declined by 6.2% in 2023 compared with the previous year, with the decline caused by the development on trade lanes from Asia and Europe to North America. Ocean freight revenue in the reporting period dropped by 51.0% and gross profit by 24.8%. In the fourth quarter of 2023, our ocean freight revenue was 52.6% and gross profit 31.7% below the previous year.\n\nIn the year under review, revenue in the Freight business unit amounted to €5,162 million and was thus 3.9% below the previous year, with negative currency effects totaling €119 million. Volumes were down by 9.2%. Gross profit in the reporting period for the business unit fell slightly by 0.2% to €1,328 million. In the fourth quarter, revenue was 6.2% below the previous year; excluding negative currency effects of €28 million, the decline was 4.2%.\n\nEBIT in the Global Forwarding, Freight division fell in the year under review, from €2,311 million to €1,423 million. The EBIT margin was 7.4%. EBIT in the division thus corresponds to 28.4% of gross profit and 34.6% for the Global Forwarding business unit. At €340 million, division EBIT in the fourth quarter of 2023 was below the prior-year level of €402 million. The conclusion of the acquisition of the remaining shares in DHL Logistics in the United Arab Emirates led to an earnings contribution of €114 million in the fourth quarter.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-43-0\"></span>Image /page/43/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

High flexibility, standardized processes and targeted data analyses made a contribution to the management of our customers' supply chains.\n\n#### Supply Chain: continued growth of revenue and earnings\n\nRevenue in the Supply Chain division was up by 3.2% to €16,958 million in the year under review. Excluding negative currency effects of €462 million, the increase was 6.0%. All regions and sectors recorded revenue growth that was bolstered by new business, contract renewals and expanding e-commerce business. Revenue remained flat in the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding negative currency effects of €121 million, the increase was 2.7% in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn the reporting period, the Supply Chain division concluded additional contracts with a volume of €7,378 million. The Consumer, Retail and Technology sectors accounted for the majority of the new business, which is, in a large part, attributable to e-commercebased solutions. The contract renewal rate remained at a consistently high level.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-44-0\"></span>Image /page/44/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller, sans-serif font. The background is yellow.\n\nEBIT in the Supply Chain division increased to €961 million in the year under review (previous year: €893 million). In addition to the positive development of revenue, earnings growth was spurred by productivity improvements thanks to digitalization and standardization. The EBIT margin was 5.7% in the year under review. EBIT in the Supply Chain division decreased minimally from €225 million to €220 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, which is attributable primarily to negative currency effects.\n\n#### KEY FIGURES, SUPPLY CHAIN\n\n| €m                                             | 2022   | 2023   | +/-% | Q4 2022 | Q4 2023 | +/-%  |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------|---------|---------|-------|\n| Revenue                                        | 16,431 | 16,958 | 3.2  | 4,363   | 4,361   | 0.0   |\n| of which EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) | 7,252  | 7,481  | 3.2  | 1,946   | 1,935   | -0.6  |\n| Americas                                       | 6,832  | 7,003  | 2.5  | 1,787   | 1,797   | 0.6   |\n| Asia Pacific                                   | 2,419  | 2,542  | 5.1  | 649     | 654     | 0.8   |\n| Consolidation/Other                            | -72    | -68    | 5.6  | -19     | -25     | -31.6 |\n| Profit from operating activities (EBIT)        | 893    | 961    | 7.6  | 225     | 220     | -2.2  |\n| Return on sales (%)1                           | 5.4    | 5.7    | –    | 5.2     | 5.0     | –     |\n| Operating cash flow                            | 1,433  | 1,726  | 20.4 | 820     | 779     | -5.0  |\n\n1 EBIT/revenue.\n\nImage /page/44/Figure/7 description: The image contains two pie charts showing the supply chain revenue by sector and region in 2023.

Europe/Middle East/Africa accounts for 44% of the revenue, Americas accounts for 41%, and Asia Pacific accounts for 15%.\n\n### eCommerce division\n\n#### Impacts of external factors on our business\n\nGeopolitical conflicts and the marked increase in the cost of living led to a slight decrease in parcel volumes in some regions. Thanks to our diversified portfolio, however, our business remained resilient, and we are experiencing volumes well above the level from before the pandemic in 2019 in nearly all markets.\n\n#### eCommerce: Revenue above prior-year level\n\nThe revenue generated in the eCommerce division in the year under review totaled €6,315 million, 2.8% above the level of the previous year. Excluding negative currency effects of €174 million, revenue was 5.6% above the prior-year figure. In the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue for the eCommerce division improved by 7.6% to €1,825 million.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-45-0\"></span>Image /page/45/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nEBIT in the eCommerce division declined from €389 million to €292 million in the year under review. This was attributable mainly to higher costs as well as continuous investment in the expansion of the networks. The EBIT margin was 4.6% for the reporting period. EBIT in the eCommerce division amounted to €78 million (previous year: €91 million) in the fourth quarter of 2023 with an EBIT margin of 4.3%.\n\n#### KEY FIGURES, ECOMMERCE\n\n| €m                                      | 2022  | 2023  | +/-%  | Q4 2022 | Q4 2023 | +/-%  |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|---------|---------|-------|\n| Revenue                                 | 6,142 | 6,315 | 2.8   | 1,696   | 1,825   | 7.6   |\n| of which Americas                       | 2,188 | 2,190 | 0.1   | 636     | 637     | 0.2   |\n| Europe                                  | 3,235 | 3,465 | 7.1   | 884     | 1,013   | 14.6  |\n| Asia                                    | 720   | 659   | -8.5  | 177     | 175     | -1.1  |\n| Consolidation/Other                     | -1    | 1     | >100  | -1      | 0       | 100.0 |\n| Profit from operating activities (EBIT) | 389   | 292   | -24.9 | 91      | 78      | -14.3 |\n| Return on sales (%)1                    | 6.3   | 4.6   | –     | 5.4     | 4.3     | –     |\n| Operating cash flow                     | 582   | 504   | -13.4 | 113     | 150     | 32.7  |\n\n1 EBIT/revenue.\n\n#### Post & Parcel Germany division\n\n#### Impacts of external factors on our business\n\nThe structural transformation in letter mail business continues: as conventional letter mail volumes containing documents continue to decline, volumes of goods shipments in the mail and parcel network are growing. The Dialogue Marketing business unit underwent negative development, with the advertising spend for physical mail declining compared with the previous year due to inflation, reluctance to buy and customer insolvencies. In the German parcel market, the war in Ukraine and the increased cost of living dampened the mood in online shopping and caused parcel volumes to stagnate.\n\n#### Post & Parcel Germany: ongoing structural change shapes business performance\n\nRevenue in the Post & Parcel Germany division amounted to €16,892 million in the year under review and slightly exceeded the prior-year figure by 0.7%. The main reasons for this development were the higher prices for business customers starting in the second half of the year and increased volumes in national and international business with goods shipments. This was countered by a volume decline in national and international postal business caused by sustained structural change in mail and communication business as well as declining sales of advertising mail. Furthermore, decisions to discontinue sales territories for the EINKAUFAKTUELL product in 2023 and the overall discontinuation in 2024 had a negative impact on sales in the Dialogue Marketing segment. Parcel Germany performed well, contrary to the general market trend. Revenue in the Post & Parcel Germany division for the fourth quarter of 2023 was up by 2.5% versus the prior year.\n\nEBIT in the Post & Parcel Germany division in 2023 amounted to €870 million and was below of the prior-year figure by 31.5%. With revenue above the prior year especially in the parcel business, this was driven by higher material costs brought on by inflation and pressure from collective bargaining agreements. The costs also include €30 million in expenses for an early-retirement program established in the fourth quarter of 2023. Return on sales in the reporting period was 5.2%. EBIT in the Post & Parcel Germany division amounted to €402 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and was thus 4.7% above the prior-year period.

The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Financial management is a centralized function in the Group\n\nThe Group's financial management activities include managing liquidity along with hedging against fluctuations in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices, arranging Group financing, issuing guarantees and letters of comfort and liaising with rating agencies. Responsibility for these activities rests with Corporate Finance at Group headquarters in Bonn, which is supported by three Regional Treasury Centers in Bonn (Germany), Weston (Florida, USA) and Singapore. The regional centers act as interfaces between Group headquarters and the operating companies, advise the companies on financial management issues and ensure compliance with Group-wide requirements. Corporate Finance's main task is to minimize financial risk and the cost of capital in addition to preserving the Group's financial stability and flexibility over the long term.\n\n#### Creating value through transparent and effective capital allocation\n\nBuilding on the principles and objectives of financial management, and in light of the Group's strong financial position, the Corporate Board most recently updated the finance strategy in January 2022. It takes into account the shareholders' interests and the lenders' requirements, focusing on value creation through a transparent and effective allocation of capital. It also aims to maintain financial flexibility and a low cost of capital for the Group with a high degree of continuity and predictability for investors, and to support the Group's ESG Roadmap. One key component of the strategy is a stand-alone target rating between \"Baa1\" and \"A3\" and \"BBB+\" and \"A–,\" respectively. The strategy also sets clear priorities on how available liquidity is allocated. It will first be used to fund business operations, finance organic investments and make regular dividend payments. Thereafter, additional dividend payments or share buybacks as well as inorganic growth will be considered.\n\n#### FINANCE STRATEGY\n\nImage /page/47/Figure/8 description: The image shows a diagram outlining priorities for available liquidity, credit rating, regular dividend policy, debt portfolio, investors, and group. Under \"Priorities for Available Liquidity\" is \"Free Cash Flow Generation\" which includes \"Fund Business Operations\", \"Finance Organic Investments\", and \"Pay Regular Dividend\". Below that is \"Shareholder Distribution Beyond Regular Dividend\" and \"Fund Inorganic Growth\". Below that is \"Balance Sheet Strength\". Under \"Credit Rating\" is \"Maintain stand-alone ratings between 'Baa1' and 'A3' and 'BBB+' and 'A-', respectively\". Under \"Regular Dividend Policy\" is \"Pay 40% to 60% of net profit\" and \"Consider cash flow and continuity\". Under \"Debt Portfolio\" is \"Syndicated credit facility as a liquidity reserve\" and \"Sustainability-linked finance framework as option for future funding\". Under \"Investors\" is \"Value creation through transparent and effective capital allocation\", \"Transparent and reliable information from the company\", and \"Predictability of expected shareholders distribution\". Under \"Group\" is \"Preserve financial and strategic flexibility\", \"Commitment to the Group's ESG Roadmap\", and \"Assure access to debt capital markets and low cost of capital\".\n\n#### Cash and liquidity managed centrally\n\nThe cash and liquidity of our globally operating subsidiaries is managed centrally by Corporate Treasury. Approximately 80% of the Group's external revenue is consolidated in cash pools and used to balance internal liquidity needs. In countries where this practice is ruled out for legal reasons, internal and external borrowing and investment are managed centrally by Corporate Treasury. In this context, we observe a balanced banking policy in order to remain independent of individual banks. Our subsidiaries' intra-Group revenue is also pooled and managed by our in-house bank (intercompany clearing) in order to avoid paying external bank charges and margins. Payment transactions are executed in accordance with uniform guidelines using standardized processes and IT systems. Many Group companies pool their external payment transactions in the intra-Group Payment Factory, which executes payments on behalf of the respective companies via Deutsche Post AG's central bank accounts.\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-48-0\"></span>Image /page/48/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Limiting market risks\n\nTo limit market risks, the Group makes use of primary and derivative financial instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge against interest rate risks, and forward transactions are used for currency risks. We pass on most of the risk arising from commodity price fluctuations to our customers and, to some extent, use commodity swaps to manage the remaining risk. The parameters, responsibilities and controls governing the use of derivatives are laid down in internal guidelines.\n\n#### Flexible and stable financing\n\nThe Group covers its long-term financing requirements by means of equity and debt. This ensures our financial stability and also provides adequate flexibility. Our most important source of funds is net cash from operating activities.\n\nWe also have a syndicated credit facility in a total volume of €2 billion that creates a secure, long-term liquidity reserve. The term of the syndicated credit facility is through 2025, it does not contain any further covenants concerning the Group's financial indicators and, thanks to our solid liquidity situation, it was not drawn down during the year under review.\n\nAs part of our banking policy, we spread our business volume widely and maintain long-term relationships with the financial institutions we entrust with our business. We meet our borrowing requirements primarily through independent sources of financing, such as bonds and leases. Most debt is taken out centrally in order to leverage economies of scale and specialization benefits and hence minimize borrowing costs.\n\nIn June 2023, we placed a sustainability-linked bond with an issue volume of €500 million and a term through 2033. Moreover, a promissory note loan in the amount of €100 million was repaid in September 2023 and one bond in the amount of €500 million was repaid in October 2023. Information on bonds is contained in **[note 39 to the consolidated financial statements.](#page-189-0)**\n\n#### Group's credit rating unchanged\n\nAs of the reporting date, our credit rating was still at \"BBB+\" with a positive outlook according to Fitch Ratings and was classified as \"A2\" with a stable outlook by Moody's Investor Service. The solid investment-grade ratings ensure unfettered access to the capital market. The following table shows the ratings as of the reporting date and the underlying factors. The complete and current analyses by the rating agencies and the rating categories can be found under **[creditor relations.](https://group.dhl.com/en/investors/creditor-relations.html)**\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/49/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

For Fitch Ratings, the long-term rating is BBB+, the short-term rating is F2, and the outlook is positive. Under \"Rating factors\" are the following bullet points: Company size and geographic diversification, Broad portfolio of services and customers, Market leadership, Balanced business risk profile between the parcel and express segments, which are growing due to online retail, contract logistics business and the cyclical freight forwarding business, and Solid credit metrics and liquidity. Under \"Rating factors\" with a minus sign are the following bullet points: Structural volume decline in letter mail business, and Increased capital expenditure and dividends to shareholders. For Moody's Investors Service, the long-term rating is A2, the short-term rating is P-1, and the outlook is stable. Under \"Rating factors\" are the following bullet points: Strong business profile and large scale, supported by the company's global leadership positions in express and logistics services, and its large German mail business, Support related to its government-related issuer (GRI) status because of the German government's 21% indirect ownership of the company and the importance of the company's services to the German economy, and Solid financial profile. Under \"Rating factors\" with a minus sign is the following bullet point: Muted economic conditions, which impair volumes.\n\n- \n- \n- \n\n#### Liquidity and sources of funds\n\nAs of the reporting date, the Group reported centrally available liquidity in the amount of €1.3 billion (previous year: €2.0 billion), which is comprised of cash and cash equivalents as well as current financial assets. Due to our solid liquidity situation, the syndicated credit line in the amount of €2 billion was not drawn. In addition, unused bilateral credit lines totaling €1.6 billion were available to the Group as of the reporting date. The following table gives a breakdown of the financial liabilities reported in the balance sheet.

Continuous maintenance and renewal of our intercontinental air fleet represented an additional focus of investment spending. Some of these investments were attributable to rights of use. In the Global Forwarding, Freight division, we invested in warehouses, office buildings and IT. In the Supply Chain division, the majority of funds were invested to support customer implementations in all regions, above all in the\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/51/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font size, also in red. The background of the image is yellow.\n\nAmericas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. In the eCommerce division, most of the investments were attributable to network expansion in the Netherlands, the United States, Poland and the United Kingdom. In the Post & Parcel Germany division, the largest capex portion was attributable to the expansion of our infrastructure. The acquisition and development of property were continued in the year under review. An additional key focus was expanding Pack- and Poststations. At Group Functions, investments in the reporting year were mainly in the vehicle fleet and IT solutions.\n\n#### Decline in net cash from operating activities\n\nNet cash from operating activities fell from €10,965 million to €9,258 million. All noncash income and expenses, including the income from the increase in the shareholding in DHL Logistics, were eliminated based upon EBIT, which at €6,345 million was down substantially on the prior-year figure. The lower EBIT was partially compensated for by the higher cash inflow from the change in the working capital. The cash inflow was €536 million in the year under review, compared with an inflow of €215 million in the previous year. Income taxes paid declined by €157 million to €1,625 million.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased from €3,179 million to €2,181 million. In the previous year, this was primarily shaped by the purchase price payment for the acquisition of the Hillebrand Group in the net amount of €1,379 million. Cash paid to acquire property, plant and equipment and intangible assets fell from €3,912 million to €3,381 million and related primarily to the expansion and renewal of our air fleet as well as network infrastructure. The cash inflow from the change in current financial assets decreased from €1,664 million to €963 million. In the previous year, we sold money market funds to enable the purchase of subsidiaries and other business units in the amount of €1,613 million, in addition to the payment of the dividend.\n\nFree cash flow fell from €3,067 million to €2,942 million. In the previous year, this figure was significantly characterized by the purchase price payment for Hillebrand. Excluding the payments for acquisitions and divestitures, it decreased by €1,284 million.\n\n| €m                                                                                     | 2022   | 2023   | Q4 2022 | Q4 2023 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Net cash from operating activities                                                     | 10,965 | 9,258  | 3,090   | 2,480   |\n| Sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets                            | 112    | 153    | 36      | 48      |\n| Acquisition of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets                     | –3,912 | –3,381 | –1,507  | –933    |\n| Cash outflow from change in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets        | –3,800 | –3,228 | –1,471  | –885    |\n| Disposals of subsidiaries and other business units                                     | 69     | –1     | 0       | –1      |\n| Disposals of investments accounted for using the equity method and other investments   | 4      | 78     | 0       | 48      |\n| Acquisition of subsidiaries and other business units                                   | –1,613 | –424   | –99     | –423    |\n| Acquisition of investments accounted for using the equity method and other investments | 0      | –34    | 0       | –13     |\n| Cash outflow from acquisitions/divestitures                                            | –1,540 | –381   | –99     | –389    |\n| Proceeds from lease receivables                                                        | 179    | 195    | 45      | 49      |\n| Interest from lease receivables                                                        | 21     | 29     | 6       | 8       |\n| Repayment of lease liabilities                                                         | –2,283 | –2,445 | –631    | –631    |\n| Interest on lease liabilities                                                          | –452   | –540   | –123    | –152    |\n| Cash outflow for leases                                                                | –2,535 | –2,761 | –703    | –726    |\n| Interest received (without leasing)                                                    | 159    | 224    | 46      | 49      |\n| Interest paid (without leasing)                                                        | –182   | –170   | –81     | –94     |\n| Net interest paid/received                                                             | –23    | 54     | –35     | –45     |\n| Free cash flow                                                                         | 3,067  | 2,942  | 782     | 435     |\n\n#### CALCULATION OF FREE CASH FLOW\n\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased from €7,411 million to €6,898 million. The placement of the sustainability-linked bond is reflected in the assumption of noncurrent financial liabilities in the amount of €501 million. Despite an increased dividend per share, the dividend distribution of €2,205 million remained unchanged year over year due to the share buyback program. Payments for the acquisition of treasury shares in the amount of €986 million (previous year: €1,099 million) were incurred in\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-52-0\"></span>Image /page/52/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

In particular, the acquisition of MNG Kargo and the shareholding increase in DHL Logistics caused an increase in goodwill. Property, plant and equipment grew from €28,688 million to €29,958 million, as investments exceeded disposals, depreciation, amortization and impairment losses and negative currency effects. Current financial assets dropped considerably from €1,799 million to €833 million, due mainly to the liquidation of shortterm investments. Trade receivables decreased by €1,716 million to €10,537 million. Other current assets declined from €3,107 million to €2,415 million, primarily because prepaid expenses for transport costs fell.\n\nAt €22,477 million, equity attributable to Deutsche Post AG shareholders was lower than on December 31, 2022 (€23,236 million). The consolidated net profit for the period increased this figure, while the dividend distribution, currency effects, share buybacks and the remeasurement of pension obligations decreased it. In particular, remeasurements resulted in a significant increase of €583 million in provisions for pensions and similar obligations to €2,519 million. Financial liabilities increased from €22,166 million to €22,718 million, primarily because lease liabilities increased on account of investments. Trade payables declined from €9,933 million to €8,479 million. Also, because tax liabilities fell, other current liabilities decreased by €652 million to €5,536 million.\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-53-0\"></span>Image /page/53/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The assets chart includes intangible assets (21% in 2022, 22% in 2023), property, plant, and equipment (42% in 2022, 45% in 2023), trade receivables (18% in 2022, 16% in 2023), and other assets (19% in 2022, 17% in 2023). The equity and liabilities chart includes equity (35% in 2022, 34% in 2023), noncurrent provisions and liabilities (33% in 2022, 35% in 2023), and current provisions and liabilities (32% in 2022, 31% in 2023). The total assets and equity and liabilities are 68,476 million euros in 2022 and 66,814 million euros in 2023.\n\n1 Prior-year figures adjusted, **[note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.](#page-133-0)** \n\n#### Higher net debt\n\nOur net debt increased from €15,856 million as of December 31, 2022, to €17,739 million as of December 31, 2023. At 34.3%, the equity ratio was in line with the figure as of December 31, 2022 (34.6%). The net interest cover ratio indicates the extent to which net interest expenses are covered by EBIT. At 13.9, it was considerably below the prior-year level (18.6). Net gearing expresses the ratio of net debt to the total of equity and net debt. This figure was 43.7% as of December 31, 2023.\n\n#### NET DEBT\n\n| €m                                               | Dec. 31, 2022 | Dec. 31, 2023 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Noncurrent financial liabilities                 | 17,616        | 17,882        |\n| + Current financial liabilities                  | 3,486         | 3,897         |\n| = Financial liabilities1                         | 21,102        | 21,779        |\n| – Cash and cash equivalents                      | 3,790         | 3,649         |\n| – Current financial assets1                      | 1,355         | 364           |\n| – Positive fair value of noncurrent derivatives2 | 101           | 27            |\n| = Financial assets                               | 5,246         | 4,040         |\n| Net debt                                         | 15,856        | 17,739        |\n\n1 Less operating financial liabilities and/or operating financial assets.\n\n2 Recognized in noncurrent financial assets in the balance sheet.\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-54-0\"></span>Image /page/54/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

For this reason, the following presentation focuses in particular on the annual results under the HGB.\n\n#### Employees\n\nThe number of full-time equivalents at Deutsche Post AG as of the reporting date was 159,265 (previous year: 161,772).\n\n#### Results of operations\n\nRevenue rose by a total of €416 million (2.6%) year over year.\n\nRevenue from the German letter mail business was €7,193 million in the year under review and thus 4.6% below the prior-year level of €7,537 million. Of this revenue, €4,569 million (previous year: €4,861 million) was attributable to Mail Communication, €1,653 million (previous year: €1,711 million) to Dialogue Marketing and €971 million (previous year: €965 million) to other services. Revenue in the German parcel business in the reporting year was €6,452 million, exceeding the prior-year figure of €5,820 million by 10.9%. This is primarily attributable to higher intra-Group remuneration. Revenue of €2,153 million (previous year: €2,049 million) was reported for our International business unit in the reporting period. Other revenue amounted to €750 million (previous year: €726 million) and included mainly income from service level agreements, rental agreements and leases and reimbursements for employee leasing.\n\n#### INCOME STATEMENT FOR DEUTSCHE POST AG (HGB) – JANUARY 1 TO DECEMBER 31\n\n| €m                                                                                  | 2022    | 2023    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Revenue                                                                             | 16,132  | 16,548  |\n| Other own work capitalized                                                          | 96      | 101     |\n| Other operating income                                                              | 1,265   | 1,034   |\n|                                                                                     | 17,493  | 17,683  |\n| Material expense                                                                    | -5,887  | -5,988  |\n| Staff costs                                                                         | -8,740  | -9,090  |\n| Amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of property, plant and equipment | -338    | -352    |\n| Other operating expenses                                                            | -2,636  | -2,528  |\n|                                                                                     | -17,601 | -17,958 |\n| Financial result                                                                    | 3,078   | 3,403   |\n| Taxes on income                                                                     | -369    | -342    |\n| Result after tax/Net profit for the period                                          | 2,601   | 2,786   |\n| Retained profits brought forward from previous year                                 | 8,034   | 6,430   |\n| Net retained profit                                                                 | 10,635  | 9,216   |\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-55-0\"></span>Image /page/55/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The background of the logo is yellow.\n\nOther operating income registered a year-over-year decrease of €231 million, or 18.3%, driven mainly by lower income from currency translation (€176 million lower) and lower income from the reversal of provisions (€67 million lower).\n\nDue to higher costs on account of inflation, material expense rose by €101 million on account of an increase in the cost of transport services for letters and parcels as well as an increase for leases and rents.\n\nStaff costs were up by €350 million. In the year under review, inflation compensation payments in the amount of €387 million were made.\n\nThe decrease in other operating expenses by €108 million stemmed mainly from lower expenses from currency translation (€165 million).\n\nThe financial result in the amount of €3,403 million mainly comprises net investment income of €2,864 million (previous year: €3,739 million) and a net interest income of €541 million (previous year: expense of €657 million). The change in net investment income is due to the €874 million decrease in income from profit transfer agreements attributable to Deutsche Post Beteiligungen Holding GmbH, whose earnings were the result of higher intra-Group interest expenses and lower income from investments. Income from the discounting of provisions and higher intra-Group interest income due to increased interest rates in the market environment led to the improvement in net interest income of Deutsche Post AG.\n\nAfter accounting for taxes on income of €–342 million, net profit for the period totaled €2,786 million. Including retained profits carried forward, net retained profit for the period amounted to €9,216 million.\n\n### Net assets and financial position\n\n#### Total assets down\n\nTotal assets declined to €45,425 million as of the reporting date.\n\nFixed assets increased from €17,882 million to €18,103 million. Investments in property, plant and equipment totaled €526 million (previous year: €828 million) and related to land and buildings (€178 million), technical equipment (€164 million), other equipment and operating and office equipment (€65 million), as well as assets under development (€119 million). Investments were made mainly in mail and parcel centers, conveyor and sorting systems, Pack- and Poststations and real estate for network expansion. Noncurrent financial assets were down by €68 million, due primarily to lower loans to affiliated companies.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/56/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Cash and cash equivalents decreased by €745 million, due primarily to money market investments being €1,104 million lower.\n\nEquity was down from €19,224 million in the previous year to €19,033 million. Net profit for 2023 of €2,786 million exceeded the dividend paid to shareholders of €2,205 million in 2023. Earnings reserves rose by €1,243 million, in particular due to the transfer of €2,000 million to earnings reserves and the issue of shares primarily for executive remuneration plans in the amount of €209 million. The decline of €966 million in earnings reserves had the opposite effect and was due to the offsetting of share buybacks. The equity ratio increased slightly from 41.1% to 41.9%. For the disclosures pursuant to Section 160(1), no. 2, of the Aktiengesetz (German Stock Corporation Act), please refer to notes 26 and 27 to the financial statements of Deutsche Post AG, as well as appendix 5, for the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nProvisions were up by €138 million in the reporting period. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations decreased by €179 million due to discounting effects from the higher overall interest rates and higher fair values of the plan assets. The change in provisions for taxes of €266 million is primarily attributable to the increase in provisions for income taxes (€262 million).\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-64-0\"></span>Image /page/64/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Implementing climate objectives\n\nFor achieving our goals by 2030, we plan to **[spend up to an additional](https://group.dhl.com/en/sustainability/environment.html)** €7 billion to expand the proportion of sustainable fuels and technologies in our fleets and buildings. We round out this package of measures with a range of specifically environmentally friendly products: GoGreen Plus enables our customers to make a conscious decision for sustainable transport solutions or the use of sustainable fuels. This approach allows us to uphold our responsibility to the climate and the environment.\n\nThe central climate protection activities are developed in the Department Chief Executive Officer and Group guidelines are adapted accordingly or drafted and implemented throughout the Group. The Department Finance collects environmental data, monitors progress toward goals, assesses opportunities and risks and carries out internal and external reporting, embedded in the internal control system.\n\nOur orientation with regard to climate and environmental protection is set out in Group policies: in the Code of Conduct and the Supplier Code of Conduct, in the Environmental and Energy Policy and the internal policies for sustainable fuels and procurement processes. In the year under review, the Environmental and Energy Policy was completely revised and adapted in line with the ESG Roadmap.\n\nIn addition, together with our subcontractors, we work as part of a wide range of initiatives to develop sustainable fuels and technologies in order to reduce fuel consumption and lower GHG emissions. This also enables us to procure the consumption and emissions data necessary for subcontractor management. The Clean Cargo Initiative of the global shipping industry and our internal **[Green Carrier Certification](https://www.dhl.com/de-en/home/global-forwarding/products-and-solutions/gogreen-solutions.html)** for road freight are examples of this.\n\n#### Risks arising from climate change\n\nOpportunities and risks arising from climate change were assessed using a scenario analysis according to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This involved applying the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change including average warming of the planet by less than 2, more than 2 or more than 4 degrees Celsius through the year 2100 to assess physical risks that could result from a rise in ocean levels, for instance. For transitory risks, we used the sustainable development scenario of the International Energy Agency.\n\nTogether with the respective Board of Management members responsible for the divisions, as part of the financial and nonfinancial **[risk assessment](#page-101-0)**, we also analyzed and evaluated the possible effects of climate change on our business models, strategy and operational business as well as our mission of achieving net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Moreover, the assessment of locations with increased physical risk was confirmed.\n\nThis results mainly in transitory risks for the Group, particularly with regard to GHG emissions: operational limitations due to stricter regulation (carbon taxes and levies) as well as the lack of availability of sustainable fuels for air transport (sustainable aviation fuels) and energy from renewable sources.\n\n#### Progress in decarbonization\n\nThe management of our measures is focused on the development of net logistics-related GHG emissions (GHG emissions) and the GHG emissions avoided by the company's own decarbonization measures. Our calculation for this includes the entire process chain for generating and supplying energy for transport with the Scope 3 categories 4 (upstream transportation distribution), 3 (fueland energy-related activities) and 6 (business travel) of the GHG Protocol (well-to-wheel). The other Scope 3 categories not directly related to logistics are not taken into account as part of our medium-term target.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/65/Figure/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nThe calculation of Scope 1 GHG emissions takes the use of sustainable fuels into consideration on the basis of amounts purchased. For calculating Scope 3 emissions, we use an activity-based calculation model that also accounts for fuel amounts and reduction measures documented by transport companies. In the Scope 1 and 3 GHG emissions, reduction effects from market-based processes are also included that represent a substitution of fossil fuels – without direct physical procurement of the fuels – documented by means of certificates (book and claim).\n\nThe GHG emissions are the result of the modes of transport and are broken down as follows: 68% air, 24% land and 7% ocean (previous year: 69% air, 22% land and 8% ocean); buildings still contribute 1%. In the year under review, GHG emissions fell by 9.1% to 33.27 million metric tons of CO2e. The Scope 1 net and Scope 2 (market-based method) GHG emissions decreased by 0.8% to 8.30 million metric tons of CO2e; the net Scope 3 emissions decreased by 11.5% to 24.97 million metric tons of CO2e.\n\nThe decrease in GHG emissions is primarily influenced by the declining development of shipment volumes. Realized Decarbonization Effects from our measures of 1.3 million metric tons of CO2e (previous year: 1 million metric tons of CO2e) made a reduction contribution, meaning we achieved our target for the year under review. As part of this, the use of electricity from renewable sources, the electrification of our pickup and delivery fleet and fueling with sustainable fuels and/or the voluntary blending in the distribution networks used had an emissions-reducing effect.\n\nAn additional reduction of 128 metric kilotons of CO₂e results from the statutorily mandated blending of biofuels (previous year adjusted: 140 metric kilotons of CO2e) that is not included in our Realized Decarbonization Effects. The burning of biomass (biological material made up of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen) resulted in emissions in the amount of 787 metric kilotons of CO2e (previous year: 538 metric kilotons of CO2e) that are not attributable to Scopes 1, 2 and 3 under the GHG Protocol. In the year under review, GHG intensity was 407 grams of CO2e per € of revenue (previous year adjusted: 387 grams of CO2e per € of revenue).\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/66/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

We also invest in technologies to design our own new buildings to be climate-neutral. The share of sustainable fuels is to top 30% in air and ocean freight as well as land transport by 2030. In pickups and deliveries, 60% of vehicles used are to be electric vehicles. We want to design all of our new buildings to be climate-neutral.\n\nSustainable technologies and fuels are often more expensive than conventional technologies and fossil fuels. In the year under review, the additional expenses for decarbonization measures as a result of this increased by 55.6% to €442 million. This enables a reduction of around 1.3 million metric tons of CO2e (previous year: 1 million metric tons of CO2e), including 127 metric kilotons of CO2e from market-based mechanisms. The share of sustainable fuels increased by 1.1 percentage points to 2.8% (previous year: 1.7%). In pickups and deliveries, we increased the share of e-vehicles used in the reporting period to 37.6%; the number of evehicles was around 35,200 (previous year: 27,800). We therefore made significant progress toward achieving our goal of reaching a share of 60% by 2030. At 97%, the share of electricity from renewable sources used was well above the level of the previous year (previous year: 94%).\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/67/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

We enable our customers to make a conscious decision for sustainable transport solutions or the use of sustainable fuels. We already offer sustainable alternatives for around two-thirds of our classic product range. We also launched the DHL GoGreen Dashboard, a digital reporting platform for our customers that enables them to consolidate their GHG emissions across all modes of transport, with various options for displaying and breaking down the data.\n\nAs a supplement to GoGreen Plus, we still offer our customers offsetting products to compensate for their GHG emissions. However, in accordance with the GHG Protocol and for the presentation of the Realized Decarbonization Effects, this offsetting is not taken into account as an emissions reduction for the calculation of our own GHG footprint. In the year under review, **[certificates](https://group.dhl.com/content/dam/deutschepostdhl/en/media-center/responsibility/dpdhl-group-sgs-verification-statement-gogreen-offsetting-052023.pdf)** in the amount of 1.0 million metric tons of CO2e were retired for the 2022 fiscal year.\n\n#### Divisions drive decarbonization\n\nExpress was able to conclude further delivery contracts for sustainable aircraft fuels. Moreover, the modernization of the aircraft fleet for use on intercontinental and regional routes was continued and the network of partnerships with transport subcontractors was expanded further. Furthermore, Express continued with the expansion of its fleet of e-vehicles.\n\nGlobal Forwarding, Freight concluded additional partnerships for insetting with sustainable fuels. Our Green Carrier Certification for transport partners creates transparency regarding the sustainability of our subcontractors. Around 1,000 Freight users already receive emissions reports; via myDHLi, we offer Global Forwarding users reports containing real-time data on air and ocean freight. Our customers are thus supported in achieving their own sustainability goals.\n\nSupply Chain is driving the decarbonization of its supply chains with a portfolio of state-of-the-art, sustainable products for carbonneutral storage, transport and packaging. In the year under review, a guideline for sustainable transports for relevant subsidiaries was introduced that describes the effective use of sustainable drive technologies and fuels in consideration of economic aspects. In addition, the focus was on the further expansion of carbon-neutral warehouses and sustainable transport. Some of our fueling stations in the Great Britain were converted from diesel to HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil). In Ireland, biogas production is being expanded by partners to enable fueling trucks with sustainably produced gas.\n\neCommerce continues to focus on the expansion of the fleet of e-vehicles and the increased use of electricity from renewable sources. Delivery and pickup in the Netherlands are being made more climate-friendly through the increased use of HVO.\n\nPost & Parcel Germany continued the expansion of its fleet of e-vehicles. In addition, further measures were tested to make transport between our locations more sustainable. Using gas-powered trucks (sustainably produced compressed natural gas – CNG) for longer transport routes was identified as a solution. Moreover, the portfolio of sustainable products was expanded. The CO2e Sustainability Report offers business customers additional transparency regarding the GHG emissions caused by the transport of their national goods shipments.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/68/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Energy consumption and efficiency\n\nAir freight is the most energy-intensive mode of transport in our business model. With continuous modernization processes in our own fleet and at our locations, we can have a positive impact on our energy consumption. For this reason, we are increasingly shifting transports to our own more efficient fleet and continuing to train the pilots in the use of energy-conserving flight maneuvers.\n\nIn the year under review, Group-wide energy consumption (Scopes 1 and 2) increased to 35,056 million kWh, while the use of energy from renewable sources was increased by 35.1% compared with the previous year. The transport sector is among the most energy-intensive sectors, which is why the so-called energy intensity is calculated on the basis of **[Group revenue.](#page-38-0)** In the fiscal year, this figure amounted to 0.43 kWh per € of revenue (previous year: 0.37 kWh per € of revenue).\n\nIn the year under review, we were able to once again increase the share of electricity from renewable sources, which now comes in at 97% (previous year: 94%). Use is largely documented by means of certificates. The resulting savings in GHG emissions are reflected in the Scope 2 emissions (market-based method). In addition, we use the electricity we produce and purchase electricity from renewable sources directly via power purchase agreements.\n\n#### ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF FLEETS AND BUILDINGS (SCOPES 1 AND 2)\n\n| Million kWh                           | 2022<br>adjusted | 2023          | +/-%        |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------|---------------|-------------|\n| <b>Total energy consumption</b>       | <b>34,493</b>    | <b>35,056</b> | <b>1.6</b>  |\n| <b>From fossil sources</b>            | <b>32,226</b>    | <b>31,994</b> | <b>-0.7</b> |\n| of which air transport                | 26,648           | 26,853        | 0.8         |\n| road transport (excluding e-vehicles) | 4,237            | 3,899         | -8.0        |\n| buildings and facilities              | 1,341            | 1,242         | -7.4        |\n| <b>From renewable sources1</b>        | <b>2,267</b>     | <b>3,062</b>  | <b>35.1</b> |\n| of which air transport                | 343              | 881           | 156.9       |\n| road transport2                       | 242              | 390           | 61.2        |\n| of which e-vehicles3                  | 58               | 81            | 39.7        |\n| buildings and facilities              | 1,682            | 1,791         | 6.5         |\n\n1 Includes 41 million kWh through market-based measures for fuels.\n\n2 Includes legally required blending.\n\n3 Europe: largely regulated energy attribute certificates (EACs).

The interest rate of the bond is linked to our medium-term target of reducing Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 42% and Scope 3 GHG emissions by 25%.\n\nFor the validation process of our medium-term target by the SBTi, we had already taken into account the effect of the acquisition of Hillebrand Group on our logistics-related GHG emissions in our calculations for the 2021 base year. The acquisition was completed in the 2022 fiscal year and, since then, Hillebrand has been included in consolidation.\n\n#### CALCULATING TOTAL GHG EMISSIONS FOR THE 2021 BASE YEAR\n\n| Million metric tons of CO2e                | 2021  |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Total GHG emissions (science-based target) | 40.23 |\n| of which DHL Group1                        | 39.36 |\n| Hillebrand Group2                          | 0.87  |\n\n1 As reported in the **[2021 Annual Report.](https://group.dhl.com/content/dam/deutschepostdhl/en/media-center/investors/documents/annual-reports/DPDHL-2021-Annual-Report.pdf#Page=51)**\n\n2 Acquisition carried out in the 2022 fiscal year, recognized starting in the **[2022 Annual Report.](https://www.dpdhl.com/content/dam/dpdhl/en/media-center/investors/documents/annual-reports/DPDHL-2022-Annual-Report.pdf#Page=54)**\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/69/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. The word \"Group\" is in black and is located below the right side of the DHL part of the logo. The background is yellow.\n\nLogistics-related GHG emissions are undergoing declining development, in line with expectations. This trend is primarily the result of economic developments and our decarbonization measures. In the year under review, Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions amounted to 8.30 million metric tons of CO2e, and 24.97 million metric tons of CO2e in Scope 3. This corresponds to an increase of 10.4% in Scopes 1 and 2, as well as a decrease of 23.7% in Scope 3, compared with the base year of 2021. The increase in Scope 1 emissions is due primarily to the shift of transports to our own efficient fleet, while the decrease in shipment volumes is reflected in the Scope 3 emissions. Additionally, our decarbonization measures are making an impact across all scopes.\n\n#### PROGRESS MADE COMPARED WITH THE BASE YEAR\n\nImage /page/69/Figure/5 description: The image is a bar chart showing the million metric tons of CO2e for scopes 1 and 2, and scope 3 in 2021 and 2023. For scopes 1 and 2, the million metric tons of CO2e was 7.52 in 2021 and 8.30 in 2023, which is a 10.4% increase. For scope 3, the million metric tons of CO2e was 32.71 in 2021 and 24.97 in 2023, which is a -23.7% decrease. The image also shows that until 2030, the target for scopes 1 and 2 is -42% and the target for scope 3 is -25%.\n\n1 The calculation takes the use of sustainable fuels into consideration on the basis of amounts purchased and reduction effects from market-based measures.\n\n2 Market-based method.\n\n3 Includes the Scope 3 categories 4 (upstream transportation and distribution), 3 (fuel- and energy-related activities) and 6 (business travel). Calculation is carried out on the basis of an activity-based calculation model and contains reduction effects from market-based measures.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-70-0\"></span>Image /page/70/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The background of the image is yellow.\n\n### Social\n\n#### Common DNA as a factor for success\n\nOur corporate culture makes us strong. It is underpinned by common values, convictions and behaviors and is one of the most important factors in our business success. We call it our Common **[DNA.](#page-29-0)** This culture connects us across all business units and operating regions and defines who we are and how we operate.\n\nAs early as 2006, we defined a **[Code of Conduct](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/code-of-conduct.html)** for our employees that is applicable throughout the Group. We value the diversity of our workforce and act with respect, so that we may work together cooperatively and lay the foundation for our company's financial success.\n\n#### Being an employer of choice\n\nOur employees are our most valuable asset. With more than 590,000 employees worldwide, we are one of the world's largest employers in our sector and aim to be an employer of choice.\n\nWe aim to attract competent and committed employees, continuously develop them and retain them over the long term – because only motivated employees deliver excellent service quality, meet our customers' needs satisfactorily and therefore ensure the sustainable profitability of our business activities.\n\nFor this reason, we want to strengthen and lock in their commitment at a high level. We are dedicated to the principles of diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging to create a safe work environment free of discrimination where each individual is valued and to guarantee workplaces that promote health.\n\n#### EMPLOYEE MATTERS\n\n| Material topic                 | Performance indicators1, further measures         |               | 2022   | 2023   | Target 2024 | Target 2025 |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| Employee Engagement            | Employee Engagement1, 2                           | %             | 83     | 83     | >80         | >80         |\n|                                | Continuing education                              | Million hours | 3.7    | 4.7    | –           | –           |\n| Diversity and inclusion        | Share of women in middle and upper Management1, 3 | %             | 26.3   | 27.2   | 28.8        | At least 30 |\n|                                | Employees with disabilities4                      | Headcount     | 14,274 | 14,014 | –           | –           |\n|                                | Employment rate4                                  | %             | 8.0    | 7.9    | –           | –           |\n| Occupational health and safety | LTIFR1, 3, 5                                      | Ratio         | 3.46   | 3.1    | Maximum 3.3 | <3.1        |\n|                                | Sickness rate                                     | %             | 6.3    | 5.7    | –           | –           |\n\n1 Performance indicators are steering-relevant and are assigned target values (pursuant to Sections 289b to 289e and 315b, 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB).\n\n2 Steering- and remuneration-relevant in the year under review.

We are also continuing the **[OECD Protocol](https://group.dhl.com/en/media-relations/press-releases/2022/deutsche-post-dhl-group-adopts-new-oecd-protocol.html)** from 2016, which was agreed upon with the two global trade union confederations. A wide range of topics was discussed as part of this during the year under review, for example our Human Rights Policy Statement and the different working time arrangements in our divisions.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/71/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nAt the European level, employee concerns are regularly discussed with our European works council, the DHL Forum. The Board Member for Human Resources takes part in the discussions twice per year. UNI and the ITF are also represented.\n\nIn addition, as the largest postal service provider in Europe, the Group is a member of the EU Commission's European Social Dialogue Committee for the Postal Sector and is the Committee Chair. The work of this committee involves exchange between the employers and union representatives in the postal sector of European member states on relevant topics – for example future changes in the working world and their impact on employees – in consideration of social matters.\n\n#### Our remuneration system\n\nWe foster employee loyalty and motivation by offering performance-based remuneration in line with market standards. The remuneration includes a base salary plus the agreed variable remuneration components such as bonus payments.\n\nIn many countries – including Germany, the Great Britain, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United States – we also provide employees with access to defined benefit and defined contribution **[retirement plans.](#page-181-0)** Around 70% of our employees participate in these plans.\n\nWe also use neutral job evaluations to prevent discrimination on the basis of personal characteristics. These evaluations focus on the type of job, position in the company and responsibilities assigned and rely on, in addition to formal qualifications, relevant professional experience to increase the equity of opportunities for suitable applicants. This systematic approach enables an independent and balanced remuneration structure.\n\nIn Germany, wages or salaries are generally regulated through either industry-level or company-level collective wage agreements. In many of our subsidiaries throughout Germany, our wage-scale employees also receive a performance-based bonus in addition to their monthly wage or salary. The collectively bargained principles are gender-neutral, so the use of collective agreements ensures equity in pay for women and men. Employees of Deutsche Post AG covered by the collective wage agreement may opt to take additional time off in lieu of a pay increase. A total of 19.6% of the workforce there had exercised this option as of December 31, 2023. The remuneration of employees in a non-pay-scale employment relationship (Deutsche Post AG, principal entity in Germany) is bound by existing works agreements.\n\nA resolution was reached in the reporting year on a lasting and significant **[wage increase](https://group.dhl.com/de/presse/pressemitteilungen/2023/deutsche-post-und-verdi-einigen-sich-nach-extrem-schwierigen-verhandlungen-auf-spuerbare-lohnsteigerungen-fuer-die-beschaeftigten.html)** for the approximately 160,000 employees of Deutsche Post AG subject to collective bargaining. In spite of the downward trend in profits in the German post and parcel business and the regulatory conditions in this area, significant pay raises and additional compensation for inflation will be provided to employees. The pay increase means an average raise of 11.5% over a term of two years across all income groups that takes effect starting on April 1, 2024.\n\n#### Piloted share program\n\nIn addition to managers, we want our employees to share in the long-term success of our company and, in doing so, promote their loyalty and motivation. In the reporting year, another **[share program](#page-216-0)** was therefore developed that will initially be piloted in 12 countries. We thus enable our employees participating in the program to acquire shares of Deutsche Post AG at a discount of 15% from the market price, up to an annual cap of €3,600. The shares acquired are not subject to a lockup period. Through this pilot project, the Board of Management hopes to test the interest of employees in and the administrative burden of such a program.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-72-0\"></span>Image /page/72/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Added to this, an average throughout the year of 81,782 external FTEs (previous year: 83,951 FTEs) subject to the control and direction of the Group were employed at our locations.\n\n**[Staff costs](#page-159-0)** amounted to €26,977 million and thus exceeded the prior-year figure (€26,035 million). This includes the tax-free bonus payment to compensate for inflation.\n\n#### WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT\n\n|                                |           | 2022    | 2023    | +/-  |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|---------|---------|------|\n| Employees at year-end1         | Headcount | 600,278 | 594,396 | -1.0 |\n| Employees (annual average)1    | Headcount | 589,109 | 591,412 | 0.4  |\n| Share of female employees      | %         | 34.4    | 34.3    | -0.3 |\n| FTEs at year-end1              | FTE2      | 554,975 | 551,233 | -0.7 |\n| of which Express               | FTE       | 114,151 | 110,411 | -3.3 |\n| Global Forwarding, Freight     | FTE       | 48,053  | 46,026  | -4.2 |\n| Supply Chain                   | FTE       | 182,403 | 185,608 | 1.8  |\n| eCommerce                      | FTE       | 32,721  | 33,687  | 3.0  |\n| Post & Parcel Germany          | FTE       | 163,904 | 161,428 | -1.5 |\n| Group Functions3               | FTE       | 13,743  | 14,073  | 2.4  |\n| FTEs (annual average)1         | FTE       | 542,917 | 547,692 | 0.9  |\n| Share of part-time employees   | %         | 17      | 17      | -    |\n| Average age of Group employees | Years     | 40      | 41      | -    |\n| Unplanned employee turnover    | %         | 14      | 11      | -    |\n\n1 Including trainees.\n\n2 FTE = full-time equivalent.

Each year, we measure employee satisfaction and engagement by conducting a Group-wide survey. As part of the survey, all employees have the opportunity to anonymously rate the company's strategy and values as well as its working conditions. This important tool helps us determine where we are in our journey toward becoming an employer of choice. We use the analysis of the annual survey to derive the Employee Engagement KPI, which also makes up 10% of the **[annual bonus of the Board of Management.](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/remuneration.html)**\n\nIn the year under review, 77% of employees took the opportunity to express their opinion and provide feedback. This is used as the foundation for creating the best possible working conditions at our company, thus corresponding to our strategic goal of being an employer of choice. We once again exceeded the target of more than 80% with a figure of 83% (previous year: 83%) for this reporting period.\n\n#### KEY FIGURES FROM THE ANNUAL SURVEY OF EMPLOYEES\n\n| %                    | 2022 | 2023 |\n|----------------------|------|------|\n| Response rate        | 75   | 77   |\n| Employee Engagement1 | 83   | 83   |\n\n1 Steering- and remuneration-relevant in the fiscal year.

The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Motivating employees\n\nTraining and opportunities for professional development can have a positive influence on the motivation of a workforce, which is why all of our employees generally have the option of taking advantage of our training offers digitally or as part of in-person events. Our training offers convey knowledge about our Group strategy and how each employee can make an individual contribution to our success. One example is our Group-wide \"Certified\" employee motivation and development program, which aims to make our employees certified specialists in their respective areas of responsibility. It also creates an atmosphere that places our customers at the heart of our activities and ensures we provide excellent service. In addition to a certified foundation module, we offer our employees a wide range of follow-up modules customized to their specific roles and areas of expertise. In addition, we offer numerous professional development opportunities related to the topic of digitalization, including courses on the application of data science.\n\nWith leadership attributes, we give our employees a guide for how to conduct themselves respectfully and in a results-oriented manner on a daily basis when dealing with internal and external stakeholders. In addition, we encourage them to take on challenges with a positive attitude and to focus on their own strengths. We place additional emphasis on providing training for managers so that, together with their employees, they can make internal and external stakeholders successful.\n\nWe also offer qualified employees a number of personal development options, such as special training for those with potential and development ambitions, including coaching, mentoring and participation in interdisciplinary or international projects; these options are determined as part of an individual development plan together with the respective manager.\n\nIn the year under review, our employees spent a total of 4.7 million hours (previous year: 3.7 million hours) on training and professional development throughout the Group. Moreover, the Group invested time and money in qualification elements integrated in the job, such as orientation and service training, which are not included in this figure.\n\n#### Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging\n\nOur organization brings together people from cultures and cultural backgrounds from all over the world who possess a wide range of experiences, abilities and perspectives, with 179 nationalities represented at our German sites alone. The diversity of our employees is not only an asset to the company but also one of its major strengths.\n\nDiversity, inclusion and freedom from discrimination are anchored in the form of our **[Code of Conduct](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/code-of-conduct.html)** throughout the Group. We expressly reject any and all forms of discrimination. We take an equal-opportunity approach to new hirings, both internally and externally, and look exclusively to a candidate's qualifications when deciding on their suitability.\n\nThe scope of our diversity management activities includes the topics of equity and belonging, in addition to diversity and inclusion. The DEIB (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging) Board is comprised of executives in upper management from various central and divisional functions. Among other things, new concepts for employee retention were piloted during the year under review that are becoming increasingly important in the competition for skilled workers and qualified employees. Moreover, employee resource groups were established for the first time. Employees organize themselves voluntarily into these groups to promote a diverse and integrative working environment that aligns with our company purpose, our values, the business practices and our goals. Groups focusing on the topics (diversity dimensions) of physical and mental abilities as well as sexual orientation and gender identity (LGBTQ+) were founded in the year under review. During the Group-wide DEIB Week, a campaign on the topic of awareness for a sense of belonging was started, for which we received positive feedback from our employees.\n\nWith regard to LGBTQ+ matters, our company's in-house RainbowNet network provides opportunities for our employees to share their experiences. As a founding member of the PROUT AT WORK Foundation, we are committed to providing a collegial, discrimination-free workplace so that our employees can achieve their individual career goals regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-74-0\"></span>Image /page/74/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font size, also in red. The background of the image is yellow.\n\nOur focus remains on the share of women in management positions. By 2025, we aim for women to occupy at least 30% of middleand upper-management positions in the Group. The company uses various approaches and programs, such as coaching, mentoring and networking, to specifically empower female junior staff for the next step in their careers on the way to becoming middle- or upper-level executives. The share was 27.2% in the year under review (previous year: 26.3%). We therefore fell just short of our target of women occupying 27.7% of middle- and upper-management positions in the year under review.\n\nIn line with our inclusive approach, we give disabled individuals professional prospects. In Germany, employers of a certain size and above are required by law to ensure that employees with disabilities make up at least 5% of their workforce. At Deutsche Post AG, our principal entity in Germany, 14,014 persons with disabilities were employed in the reporting year (previous year: 14,274), 22 of whom were trainees; that represents 7.9% of the total workforce (previous year: 8.0%).\n\nThe average age of employees throughout the Group is 41 years old (previous year: 40 years old). In response to demographic developments, we have placed an additional focus of our employee retention measures on recruiting and retaining young talents. In doing so, we concentrate on **[positions with on-the-job training](https://careers.dhl.com/global/en/students-graduates#graduate-link)** as well as **[trainee and dual-study programs.](https://careers.dhl.com/global/en/students-graduates#graduate-link)** In Germany, we offered a total of around 1,900 spots in our postsecondary educational training and dual-study programs during the reporting year. We provide college and university graduates with the chance to choose between various postgraduate training programs.\n\n#### Occupational health and safety\n\nThe health and safety of our employees in the workplace is of central importance to us and is therefore embedded in our Codes of Conduct. We comply with the Group's existing occupational health and safety policies, statutory regulations and industry standards.\n\nIn the Group policy on occupational health and safety, we define our understanding and the importance of this topic; with our internal Safety First framework, we provide our employees with clear guidelines for implementation. Our management system complies with the international ISO 45001 standards, to which various business units of the divisions are also externally certified. Our Supplier Code of Conduct requires suppliers and subcontractors to adhere to these same high standards.\n\nAccident prevention in the workplace is the top priority of our occupational health and safety activities. Some of our biggest challenges are in our pickup and delivery operations, because external influences can only be managed to a certain extent in this area. Bad weather, roadwork, complex traffic situations and dealing with animals require employees to pay attention, concentrate and take responsibility for themselves. The most frequent causes of accidents remain slipping, tripping and falling, as well as dropped objects. Accidents are analyzed, the respective material root causes are identified and measures are introduced that facilitate the continuous improvement of safety for our employees. Solutions proven in practice to reduce or eliminate potential hazards are shared across the Group. We promote this via systematic, Group-wide exchange on potential improvements and corrective measures. To this end, an IT-supported process was implemented throughout the Group in the year under review. Measures can now be directly assessed and used in other divisions. The measures receiving the best assessments are nominated for internal awards. In addition, regular work meetings and workplace inspections are carried out at our locations and areas with greater hazard potential are identified with corresponding signage.\n\nTo measure the success of our efforts, we use the performance indicator of lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR), which we calculate based on the number of work-related accidents per 200,000 working hours resulting in an absence of at least one working day for the affected person following the day of the accident. This also includes accident-related injuries to external employees who are subject to instruction. We use the accident investigations to derive measures to eliminate the respective root causes of these accidents and to avoid reoccurrence. The lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) dropped to 3.1 in the year under review, meaning we significantly exceeded our target value of 3.5.\n\nIn the year under review, we unfortunately documented 11 fatal accidents with our own employees and one with an external employee subject to instructions. Of these 12 accidents, 11 of them were traffic accidents. We expressly regret this development. Each death is presented to and discussed in detail by the Operations Board, which is chaired by the CEO. The Operations Board is informed on an ongoing basis about the developments of work-related accident statistics.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/75/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Work can be a major source of satisfaction, and therefore also of health. At our company, a healthy workplace is somewhere that employees and managers work together to promote the well-being of everyone.\n\nWithin this context, through our Employee Benefits program, we offer our employees and their families insurance cover in the form of financial security in the event of death or disability as well as health insurance benefits. This offer depends upon provisions of labor law and the common market practices in many countries. Currently, around 280,000 employees in 100 countries are covered by this program. In particular as part of this program, incentives are provided to local management to offer health-promoting programs to employees and their families. We carry out such health projects and local initiatives to create a health-promoting work environment and raise awareness of a healthy lifestyle among our employees.\n\nThe Chief Medical Officer (CMO) advises the Board of Management in all matters regarding occupational health management – for instance the development of physical and mental diseases in the work context and concepts for how to deal with epidemic or pandemic risks.\n\nIn the reporting year, we approved and implemented the **[declaration on health and well-being](https://group.dhl.com/content/dam/deutschepostdhl/en/media-center/responsibility/dhl-group-health-and-wellbeing-policy.pdf)** throughout the Group as a supplement to the Group policy on occupational health and safety. In addition, we established the Health & Well-Being Forum, which is comprised of experts and managers from all divisions.\n\nThe Group-wide sickness rate decreased to 5.7% in the year under review (previous year: 6.3%).\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-76-0\"></span>Image /page/76/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters \"DHL\" is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n### Social responsibility\n\n#### Contributing to economic development and social progress\n\nWe contribute to the socioeconomic development of the regions in which we operate through our sites, our employees and our business partners, thereby making a contribution to social and individual prosperity. As part of our corporate citizenship initiatives, we are leveraging our global network and the expertise of local employees in line with our purpose: Connecting people, improving lives.\n\n#### Partnerships and initiatives\n\nOur initiatives enable us to use our strengths and capabilities to effect change locally and to work together to meet global challenges. We partner with established international organizations to ensure that our initiatives have the greatest impact possible. With GoHelp (disaster management), GoTeach (increasing employability), GoTrade (promoting trade) and GoGreen (environmental protection), we also support the United Nations **[Sustainable Development Goals](https://group.dhl.com/en/sustainability/sustainability-roadmap/sustainable-development-goals.html)** (SDGs) 4, 5, 8, 11, 13 and 17.\n\nWe also support employee engagement through our Global Volunteer Day, the \"DHL's Got Heart\" initiative and the Improving Lives Fund. Volunteering encourages employees to participate in local communities.\n\nBased on the Group-wide annual survey of employees, we know that corporate citizenship is a relevant factor in determining the overall level of motivation. They want to contribute to social and environmental objectives not only in their personal lives but also at work, to help society and the environment and to enhance the Group's reputation. We therefore measure the success of our initiatives using the approval rate for the survey question asking whether our employees are proud of DHL Group's contribution to society. In the year under review, 78% (previous year: 79%) of all employees responded positively.\n\n#### Employees take part in the Go programs in large numbers\n\nIn the year under review, our employees once again took part in social projects in large numbers as part of our Go programs. The focal points were on humanitarian missions following the severe earthquakes in Turkey, Syria and Morocco. Our GoHelp teams supported efforts on the ground with their logistics expertise. Our internal We Help Each Other aid fund also provided financial support for employees affected by natural disasters and war. Employee donations were matched by the Group, thus doubling our employees' contributions. In addition, we implemented minimum standards for GoTeach and strengthened the GoTrade training programs.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-77-0\"></span>Image /page/77/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters \"DHL\" is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n### Corporate governance\n\n#### Role model for responsible corporate governance\n\nWe intend to serve both as a role model for responsible corporate governance in our sector and as a trustworthy company. Ensuring our interactions with business partners, employees, the capital market and the general public are conducted with integrity and within the bounds of the law is vital to maintaining our reputation and is the basis for sustainable business success. We take steps to guarantee an honest and transparent business practice in compliance with the law by focusing on training managers in compliance-relevant content, building cybersecurity skills, shaping sustainable and stable relationships with business partners and fully integrating ESG metrics into management processes and incentive systems.\n\nThe rules for ethical conduct included in our Code of Conduct are further specified in our Human Rights Policy Statement as well as our Anti-Corruption and Business Ethics Standards Policy. Our focus at all times is on preventing potential violations of statutory requirements and internal guidelines.\n\nCorporate Internal Audit evaluates the effectiveness of our risk management system, control mechanisms, management and monitoring processes and compliance with Group policies, contributing to their improvement. It does this by performing independent regular and ad hoc audits at all Group companies and at corporate headquarters with the authority of the Board of Management. The audit teams discuss the audit findings and agree on measures for improvement with the audited organizational units and their management. The Board of Management is regularly informed of the findings. The Supervisory Board is provided with a summary once a year.\n\n#### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n| Material topic                             | Performance indicators1, further measures                           |           | 2022   | 2023    | Target 2024  |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|---------|--------------|\n| Cybersecurity                              | External rating1, 2, 3                                              | Points    | 700    | 750     | At least 690 |\n| Compliance                                 | Share of valid compliance training certificates1, 2, 4              | %         | 98.1   | 98.6    | 98           |\n| Respecting human rights                    | Internal audits by Corporate Internal Audit                         | Number    | 33     | 53      | –            |\n| In the workforce                           | Carry out on-site reviews                                           | Countries | 10     | 10      | –            |\n|                                            | Share of valid training certificates in middle and upper management | %         | 98.4   | 99.5    | –            |\n| Implement standards<br>in the supply chain | Supplier spend covered by an accepted Supplier Code of Conduct      | € billion | >27    | >35     | –            |\n|                                            | Potential high-risk suppliers assessed                              | Number    | >2,700 | > 4,000 | –            |\n\n1 Performance indicators are steering-relevant and are assigned target values (pursuant to Sections 289b to 289e and 315b 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB).\n\n2 Steering-relevant in the fiscal year.\n\n3 Remuneration-relevant.\n\n4 Middle and upper management.\n\n#### Trusted business partner thanks to compliance culture\n\nWe render all of our services in compliance with current legislation as well as our corporate values as defined in our Group policies. One important aspect of compliance is the legal requirements relating to preventing corruption and bribery. We observe all applicable international anti-corruption standards and statutes and are a member of the Partnering Against Corruption initiative of the World Economic Forum.\n\nEnsuring legally compliant conduct in our business activities and in our interactions with employees is an essential task of all Group management bodies. Our compliance management system (CMS) has been implemented Group-wide. Responsibility for designing the CMS lies with the Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the CFO. This establishes uniform minimum standards to ensure compliance with applicable law, for example anti-corruption legislation, and relevant internal guidelines such as the Anti-Corruption and Business Ethics Policy (Anti-Corruption Policy). The divisional compliance officers are tasked with the implementation of the CMS within the divisions.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-78-0\"></span>Image /page/78/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in black.\n\nWith our Code of Conduct and Anti-Corruption Policy, along with training on these topics, we provide clear guidance and help employees identify situations in which the integrity of the company could be called into question.\n\nParticipation of executives in middle and upper management, as well as of employees in certain functions, in various types of relevant compliance training is mandatory. In this way, we raise our employees' awareness for potential compliance risks and enable them to mitigate such risks in an appropriate manner. The compliance training courses comprise our Core Compliance Curriculum (anti-corruption, competition compliance, Code of Conduct) and training on data protection. All employees in the target group are required to repeat the training courses every two years. We use the share of valid training certificates among executives in middle and upper management as a steering-relevant KPI.\n\nPotential violations can be reported 24/7 – if legally permitted, anonymously – via our compliance incident reporting system (whistleblower hotline). In addition, potential violations can also be reported by telephone. Third parties can also use the system to report potential violations. Reports are reviewed and investigated internally for potential violations as part of a standardized process. Key figures on compliance notifications and issues are recorded throughout the Group via the compliance reporting tool (BKMS Dashboard). Information on relevant violations is collected and included in the regular compliance reports made to the Board of Management and to the Supervisory Board's Finance and Audit Committee.\n\nThe importance and value that compliance has for the Group was once again emphasized for employees by means of a campaign – Compliance Awareness Week – which was rounded out by measures tailored to the specific divisions and regions. The campaign was accompanied by statements from the Board of Management members (\"tone from the top\") and supported by panel discussions with managers. To strengthen the internal dialogue, our workforce was made aware of and informed about compliance aspects on an ongoing basis by means of further communication measures and via the compliance channels.\n\nThe compliance training certification rate was 98.6% in middle and upper management in the year under review (previous year: 98.1%), meaning we exceeded our target of 98% in the year under review. In the context of its 219 audits, Corporate Internal Audit also reviewed compliance management system processes and the implementation of agreed-upon follow-up measures. Findings from the regular audits facilitate the identification of other compliance risks and the refinement of the compliance program.\n\n#### Respecting human rights\n\nOur commitment to respect for human rights includes adherence to the principles of the UN Global Compact and the International Labor Organization (ILO), which we have embedded in our Code of Conduct and outlined in greater detail in our Human Rights Policy Statement. These stipulate clear responsibilities and requirements for our employees and managers as well as our suppliers and subcontractors and contribute to the general understanding and implementation of the principles of the UN Global Compact.\n\nOur human rights activities focus on the prevention of child and forced labor, decent working conditions (working hours, occupational health and safety, remuneration), equal opportunities, data protection and the right to freedom of association. With the Supplier Code of Conduct, we obligate suppliers and subcontractors to comply with our ethical, social and environmental principles and implement them in their own supply chains.\n\nWith our measures for respecting human rights in the workforce and in the supply chain, we are in compliance with the requirements of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – LkSG). Implementation of the measures is monitored by the LkSG Council. The board is made up of executives in upper management from the Group functions Human Resources, Corporate Development, Corporate Public Affairs, Legal Services and Global Compliance, Corporate Procurement and Corporate Internal Audit.\n\nAs part of its audits, Corporate Internal Audit also conducted reviews relating to respect for human rights and verified that the agreed-upon follow-up measures had been implemented. In the reporting year, 53 such reviews took place.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/79/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Human rights in the workforce\n\nWith our internal management system, we ensure that our Human Rights Policy Statement is implemented among our workforce. In addition, it ensures that we adhere to due diligence requirements. Our management system is comprised of annual as well as ad hoc assessments of human rights risks, measures to raise awareness among employees and managers, annual reporting on Groupwide fulfillment of due diligence requirements and the professional compliance incident reporting system.\n\nWe carry out both an abstract and a concrete risk analysis to determine human rights risks. First, the risk is analyzed using external data (Verisk Maplecroft). Then, it is substantiated by evaluating questionnaires completed by our country organizations on the basis of their specific risk profile.\n\nTargeted on-site reviews are carried out based on the risk assessments. These reviews are conducted by specially trained and externally SMETA-certified (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit) professionals from our divisions and corporate headquarters. The countries are selected based on the results of weighting and prioritization of the identified risks, including – among other factors – the findings from the questionnaires, the number of employees, the assessments of relevant Group committees and responsible experts and recommendations from international trade union confederations. If there are violations identified at locations, these are then immediately addressed as part of a structured action plan. In the year under review, on-site reviews under the leadership of the HR department were carried out at more than 30 subsidiaries in ten countries, including in Asia, Latin America, Africa and Europe.\n\nWe encourage our employees to participate in the training courses for raising awareness for respect for human rights. Participation is mandatory, however, for executives in middle and upper management; the certification rate was 99.5% in the reporting period (previous year: 98.4%).\n\n#### Standards in the supply chain\n\nCorporate Procurement selects suppliers that meet our ethical, social and environmental standards. This selection process is based on a standardized assessment process that also takes aspects such as diversity and respect for human rights into account, as well as external criteria such as those from Transparency International (Corruption Perceptions Index) and Verisk Maplecroft. In the year under review, the supplier assessment was supplemented with additional internal measures and expanded with external audits (including in accordance with the SMETA method). In the event of findings, remedial measures are discussed and plans for corrective measures are agreed upon.\n\nProcurement employees are regularly trained to identify potential supplier-related risks early on. We convey our expectations to our suppliers and subcontractors via our **[Supplier Portal](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/supplier-portal.html)** and introduce our selection processes. Suppliers can also use our portal to familiarize themselves with our Supplier Code of Conduct, which we make available in numerous languages along with the corresponding training module. From there, they can also access our professional compliance whistleblower system that they can use to report potential violations of the Code or statutory provisions as well as cybersecurity incidents.\n\nIn the year under review, we continued developing the Group-wide risk management system for supplier assessments. We calculate the potential for risk of suppliers at the level of purchase categories (material groups). The risk assessment is influenced by 46 types of risk within eight risk domains (ESG, economic, technical, legal and political risks, as well as cybersecurity) that are evaluated for each individual purchasing category. The ultimate classification of the risk potential is based on the evaluation of the probability and the possible impact. More than 4,000 potential high-risk suppliers were assessed in the year under review (previous year: >2,700).\n\nWe use supplier spend covered by an accepted Supplier Code of Conduct to measure the successful implementation of our standards in the supply chain. We record progress regarding the key figure via the central financial systems, report to management on a monthly basis and discuss developments with the CEO and the CFO. In the year under review, supplier spend covered by an accepted Supplier Code of Conduct rose to more than €35 billion (previous year: >€27 billion).\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-80-0\"></span>Image /page/80/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Cybersecurity\n\nOur cybersecurity management activities protect the information of the Group, our business partners and our employees as well as IT systems from unauthorized access or manipulation and data misuse. In addition, this ensures uninterrupted availability and enables reliable operations. Our internal guidelines and processes are based on ISO 27002 and our data centers are certified in accordance with ISO 27001.\n\nSince January 1, 2024, the Group Chief Information Security Officer (Group CISO) has reported directly to the CEO (previous year: Corporate Board Member for Global Business Services). The IT Board determines the cybersecurity strategy and defines and manages Group-wide measures for cybersecurity, for protecting systems and data and for digitalization processes. The Information Security Committee is made up of the central functions of Group CISO, IT Audit, Human Resources, Legal Services, Data Protection and Corporate Security, as well as the divisional CISOs. The committee assesses potential threats on an ongoing basis, evaluates the potential of new risks and monitors compliance with our security standards.\n\nWe limit access to our systems and data such that employees can only access the data they need to perform their duties. All systems and data are backed up on a regular basis, and critical data are replicated across data centers. Additionally, by performing continuous software updates, we can fix potential security vulnerabilities and protect system functionality.\n\nA variety of communication measures and training sessions help our workforce become more aware of possible cybersecurity risks. All employees and managers with a corporate email address are continuously made aware of risks via phishing simulations. We also draw attention to current risks using IT crisis simulations. Participation in Information Security Awareness training is mandatory for all employees with a computer workstation. All participants who have already completed their training must update their certification every two years.\n\nOur cybersecurity undergoes independent assessment by the external rating agency BitSight. This rating is based on the technical analysis of any weak points and brings potential security risks to the attention of the rated company; this is carried out by an automated service on a daily basis. Unlike with a self-assessment, a cybersecurity rating offers greater transparency and enables comparison with other companies thanks to standardization. We compare our performance with DAX 40 companies as well as with major customers and logistics companies that are not covered by the DAX 40. The target amount is determined by the aspiration to be within the upper quarter of this comparison group.\n\nThe cybersecurity rating has been remuneration-relevant since this reporting period. This performance indicator makes up 10% of the annual bonus calculation for the Board of Management. As announced, the rating scale for the cybersecurity rating in the year under review has changed due to adjustments to the method of the rating agency. In line with the change, we adjusted our target for the 2023 fiscal year from 710 to 690 points. The rating amounted to 750 of 820 achievable points as of the end of the year under review (previous year: 700 points). The target for the year under review was thus exceeded.\n\n#### Tax strategy as a standard adhered to worldwide\n\nOur tax strategy is aligned with our Group strategy and must be adhered to throughout the Group. The overarching approach applied by the Group is that taxes are always incidental to and follow business needs.\n\nWe do not undertake aggressive tax planning or enter into artificial arrangements with the goal of avoiding taxes. Our Group maintains locations in more than 220 countries and territories, including some with lower tax rates than those in Germany. These locations are necessary for carrying out our operational business in those regions. None of our companies was established with the purpose of obtaining tax benefits or is currently used to pursue aggressive tax structuring.\n\nIn interpreting and applying tax legislation, we follow the letter of the law; in case of ambiguity, we follow the law's spirit and intended purpose. As a globally active group of companies, our activities necessarily include operations in countries where uncertainty is high. In order to mitigate this uncertainty and obtain the greatest possible degree of legal certainty, we are in continual dialogue with tax authorities and tax advisers. This allows us to meet tax compliance requirements in the countries in which we operate. Our Group risk management system incorporates a tax risk management framework that enables us to monitor tax risks and respective countermeasures.\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/97/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of a stylized, bold font with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. Below the DHL part of the logo, the word \"Group\" is written in a smaller, sans-serif font, also in red. The background of the logo is yellow.\n\nand combine the respective scenarios. The totals for \"worst case\" and \"best case\" indicate the total spectrum of results for the respective division. Within these extremes, the total \"expected cases\" shows current expectations. The second method makes use of a Monte Carlo simulation, the divisional results of which are regularly included in the opportunity and risk reports to the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\n\n**3. Overall strategy:** The Group Board of Management decides on the methodology that will be used to analyze and report on opportunities and risks. The reports created by Corporate Controlling provide the Board of Management with an additional, regular source of information for managing the Group as a whole. The Group Board of Management has defined the thresholds for risk tolerance and risk-bearing ability and uses the Monte Carlo simulation to review the necessity for strategic changes on a quarterly basis. The Board of Management is supported in its duties by a Risk Committee, which analyzes individual risks on a quarterly basis and reviews the results from risk reporting. The Risk Committee also regularly discusses adjustments to the opportunity and risk management process.\n\n**4. Operating measures:** The measures to be used to take advantage of opportunities and manage risks are determined within the individual organizational units. They use cost–benefit analyses to assess whether risks can be avoided, mitigated or transferred to third parties.\n\n**5. Control:** With respect to key opportunities and risks, early-warning indicators have been defined that are monitored constantly by the risk owners. Corporate Internal Audit has the task of ensuring that the Board of Management's specifications are adhered to. It also reviews the quality of the entire opportunity and risk management operation. The control units regularly analyze all parts of the process as well as the reports from Corporate Internal Audit and the independent auditor, with the goal of identifying potential for improvement and making adjustments to processes where necessary.\n\n#### Reporting and assessing opportunities and risks\n\nIn the following, we have reported mainly on those risks and opportunities that, from a current standpoint, could have a significant impact on the Group during the forecast period beyond the impact already accounted for in the business plan. In addition, we consider both long-term as well as latent opportunities and risks, with the latter unable to be assigned to a particular year or time horizon. Opportunities and risks are assessed according to their probability of occurrence and their impact. As part of this, the effects for quantitative opportunities and risks are measured by EBIT, the financial result and direct effects on equity. The assessment is used to classify opportunities and risks as either low, medium or high. Medium and high risks and opportunities are considered significant and are shown as red or yellow in the following table. The following assessment scale is used (measured on a net basis):\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/98/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### CLASSIFICATION OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nImage /page/98/Figure/4 description: The image shows a risk matrix for planned group EBIT. The matrix is divided into two sections: Risks and Opportunities. The y-axis represents the probability of occurrence in percentage, with three categories: > 50, > 15 to ≤ 50, and ≤ 15. The x-axis represents the effects in €m, with six categories: < -500, -500 to -151, -150 to 0, 0 to 150, 151 to 500, and > 500. The Risks section has cells colored red, yellow, and gray. The Opportunities section also has cells colored red, yellow, and gray. The matrix is used to assess the significance for the group.\n\nHigh Medium Low\n\nThe following assessment scale is used for qualitative risks (measured on a net basis):\n\nImage /page/98/Figure/13 description: The image is a risk assessment matrix. The y-axis is labeled \"Risks\" and has three categories: '> 50', '> 15 to ≤ 50', and '≤ 15'. The x-axis is labeled \"Effects\" and has three categories: 'High', 'Medium', and 'Low'. The matrix is a 3x3 grid. The cell at the intersection of '> 50' and 'High' is colored red. The cell at the intersection of '> 50' and 'Medium' is colored yellow. The cell at the intersection of '> 15 to ≤ 50' and 'High' is colored yellow. All other cells are colored gray. A legend at the bottom of the image indicates that red represents 'High', yellow represents 'Medium', and gray represents 'Low' significance for the group.\n\n#### ASSESSING QUALITATIVE RISKS\n\nHigh-impact risks tend to affect the entire Group, whereas medium-impact risks play out at a divisional level and low-impact risks at a local level. Qualitative risks can be assigned in terms of their impact to financial risk, reputational risk, operational risk and environmental risk.\n\nThe opportunities and risks described here are not necessarily the only ones the Group faces or is exposed to. Our business activities could also be influenced by additional factors that we are currently unaware of or that we do not yet consider to be material.\n\nOpportunities and risks are identified and assessed decentrally at DHL Group. Reporting on possible deviations from projections, as well as long-term and latent opportunities and risks, occurs primarily at the country or regional level. In view of the degree of detail provided in the internal reports, we have combined the decentrally reported opportunities and risks in categories for the purposes of this report. It should be noted that the figures provided in the underlying individual reports exhibit a significant correlation with\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-99-0\"></span>Image /page/99/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Unless otherwise specified, a low relevance is attached to the individual opportunities and risks within the respective categories. The opportunities and risks generally apply to all divisions, unless indicated otherwise.\n\n### Opportunity and risk categories\n\n#### Overview of material opportunities and risks\n\nWe identify opportunities and risks along the categories described in the following overview. In the overview, we allocated our material opportunities and risks to these categories with the corresponding significance and measurement and explained them in the following pages:\n\n#### OVERVIEW OF MATERIAL OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS ALONG OUR CATEGORIES\n\n| Category                                   | Material opportunity/material risk¹                                                                                                                              | Significance                         | Measurement                                                                  |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Corporate strategy                         | Market pressure on pricing (1)                                                                                                                                   | Medium                               | Quantitative                                                                 |\n| Legal and compliance-related               | None                                                                                                                                                             | -

Unless otherwise explicitly labeled, these are considered immaterial.\n\n#### Opportunities and risks arising from corporate strategy\n\nOver the past few years, the Group has ensured that its business activities are well positioned in the world's fastest-growing regions and markets. We are also constantly working to create efficient structures in all areas to enable us to flexibly adapt capacities and costs to demand, which is a condition for lasting, profitable business success. With respect to our strategic orientation, we are focusing on our core competencies in the logistics and letter mail businesses. Our earnings projections regularly take account of development opportunities arising from our strategic orientation.\n\nWe take action early to counter potential strategic risks. In doing so, it helps that our portfolio of customers and supplier companies is as broad as possible and that we focus on profitable sectors and products, regularly review customer and product performance, practice strict cost management and add surcharges whenever necessary.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/100/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters. There are three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. The word \"Group\" is in red and is located below the right side of the DHL letters. The background is yellow.\n\nIn the Express division, our future success depends, above all, upon general factors such as trends in the competitive environment, costs and quantities transported. In addition, market capacities could restrict our pricing leeway due to market pressure from customers and competitors, which represents a risk of medium significance for us (1). We plan to keep growing our international business and expect a further increase in shipment volumes over the medium and long term. Based upon this assumption, we are investing in our network, our services, our employees and the DHL brand.\n\nIn the Global Forwarding, Freight division, we purchase transport services for customers from airlines, shipping companies and freight carriers rather than providing them ourselves. In the best case, we are able to outsource transport services at such a low rate that we can generate a margin. In the worst-case scenario, we bear the risk of not being able to pass on all price increases to our customers. The extent of our opportunities and risks essentially depends on trends in the supply, demand and pricing of transport services as well as the duration of our contracts. Comprehensive knowledge in the area of brokering transport services helps us to capitalize on opportunities and minimize risk.\n\nIn the Supply Chain division, our success is highly dependent on our customers' business performance. Since we offer companies a widely diversified range of products in different sectors all over the world, we are able to diversify our risk portfolio and thus counteract the incumbent risks. Our future success moreover depends on our ability to continuously improve our existing business, seamlessly integrate new business and grow in our most important markets and segments.\n\nThe eCommerce division is responsible for domestic and international non-time-definite standard parcel delivery services in various countries around the globe. It predominantly serves customers in the fast-growing e-commerce sector. Our goal is to leverage our international resources and services to build a cross-border solutions platform that can be connected to the most cost-efficient networks for last-mile delivery. We want to grow profitably in all sectors and segments. To counteract the fundamental risk of rising cost pressure, we took measures with which we intend to improve network efficiency and cost flexibility. Whether e-commerce merchants invest in the establishment and operation of delivery organizations in addition to other market participants results in opportunities and risks for the eCommerce division, as well as for the parcel business in Germany. In this regard, it can be observed that this type of investing activity currently appears to be in decline among e-commerce merchants.\n\nIn the German mail and parcel business, we are responding to the challenges posed by the structural shift from a physical to a digital business and the continual decline in letter mail occurring parallel to the steady increase in volumes of parcels and merchandise mail items. We are counteracting the risk arising from changing demand by expanding our range of services. Due to the rise in e-commerce, we expect our parcel business to continue growing in the coming years and are therefore expanding our network of Pack- and Poststations. We are also expanding our range of electronic communications services, securing our standing as a quality leader and, where possible, making our transport and delivery costs more flexible. We follow developments in the market very closely and take them into account in our earnings projections.\n\nWe currently do not see any further specific corporate strategy opportunities or risks of material significance, either for the Group or individual divisions.\n\n#### Legal and compliance-related opportunities and risks\n\nLegal disputes may arise in the case of noncompliance with national or international laws and regulations as well as agreements. Examples are violations of antitrust and competition law. Investigations of any such violations may result in considerable costs, penalties and damage to our company's reputation, which could have a disadvantageous impact on the business activities of the Group.\n\nCompliance with laws, regulations and agreements is a clearly formulated obligation of all employees of the Group, and ensuring this is one of the fundamental tasks of our managers. To support our employees and managers, we have established a corporate compliance unit differentiated according to relevant topics that, on the basis of our risk management system, monitors compliance with Group-wide standards at both Group and divisional level with respect to typical compliance risks. Thus, in addition to our compliance initiative aimed at preventing fraud and fighting corruption and violations of cartel and competition law, we have introduced initiatives in all divisions intended to ensure compliance with data protection laws – for example, to ensure adherence to the provisions of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A similar, Group-wide compliance initiative\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-101-0\"></span>Image /page/101/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\naims to ensure adherence to international and national export controls and embargo regulations. Moreover, our compliance unit supports, coordinates and monitors the observance of human rights and the fundamental environmental standards in our own operations as well as in our external supply chain.\n\nAt present, we do not see any specific legal or compliance-related opportunities or risks of material significance.\n\n#### Opportunities and risks arising from capital expenditure and projects\n\nThe Group invests in maintaining and growing its network, in buildings and technical equipment, in IT solutions and in its fleet of vehicles and freight aircraft. The objective of the investment projects is to strengthen the positioning of our divisions in consideration of aspects related to economic efficiency and ESG.\n\nThe risks associated with the investments relate primarily to deviations in costs and timelines as well as to the complexity of the projects and the availability of resources. This can lead to adverse effects on the economic efficiency, continuity and quality of our services.\n\nThe aforementioned risks are monitored via ongoing project management and investment controlling so that targeted countermeasures can be taken at an early stage. The status of investment projects is documented on a regular basis and reported to the Group Board of Management and, for larger projects, to the Supervisory Board. Moreover, the Group Board of Management is informed promptly of any critical projects.\n\nWe do not currently see any specific opportunities or risks of significance in the area of investment projects.\n\n#### Operational opportunities and risks\n\nLogistics services are generally provided in bulk and require a complex operational and external infrastructure with high quality standards. Any weaknesses with regard to the tendering, sorting, transport, warehousing, customs clearance or delivery of shipments could seriously compromise our competitive position. In particular, the impairment of significant infrastructure such as central transport hubs can have negative effects. To consistently guarantee reliability and punctual delivery, processes must be organized so as to proceed smoothly with no technical or personnel-related glitches. We counteract potential operational risks, for example through efficient workflows and structures. We also take out insurance policies to guard against potential losses.\n\nMost recently, the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, as well as the global pandemic in recent years, have revealed how external factors can restrict our transport routes and means or reduce the availability of our employees, and hence potentially impair our operating performance. For information on the measures we are taking to protect our employees, please refer to the categories titled \"Human resources\" and \"Environment, catastrophes and epidemics.\"\n\nA large number of internal processes must be aligned so that we can render our services. These include – in addition to our fundamental operating processes – supporting functions such as sales and purchasing. The extent to which we succeed in aligning our internal processes to meet customer needs while simultaneously lowering costs correlates with potential positive deviations from the current projections. Our earnings projections already incorporate the expected cost savings.\n\nIncreased restrictions imposed by law to combat climate change can be expected in the coming years, including limits on air transport or access to city centers. In certain cases, this may also affect our business models. The resulting risk represents a risk of medium significance for us currently (2).\n\nAt this time, we do not see any additional specific operational opportunities or risks of material significance.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/102/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Opportunities and risks arising from human resources\n\nQualified, dedicated and motivated employees are a prerequisite for sustainable success. Demographic change and a tense labor market situation across all job types in some regions represent a challenge for recruiting workers on a local level. To address this adequately and to avoid labor shortages, we place particular emphasis on our recruiting activities. In addition, we prevent staff shortages through recruiting measures abroad, by using skilled labor migration and by hiring refugees.\n\nFor our business success and a low level of staff turnover, it is important to provide our employees with development opportunities and foster their long-term loyalty to the company. In this context, we value the professional development of our executives, with our Group-wide Leadership Attributes serving as a guide for action. Furthermore, we ensure that our employees are able to continuously improve their skills in line with their needs through on-the-job learning opportunities as well as off-the-job training courses.\n\nThe health and safety of our employees are of central importance for DHL Group. We therefore place a high value on health and occupational safety measures. With respect to occupational health, we make use of initiatives tailored to local requirements and cooperate across divisions in the management of healthcare initiatives. This is supplemented with health and exercise programs and targeted checkup offers on-site. In addition, we address risks in the area of mental health using prevention, including by means of a continuously refined system for assessing risks associated with mental stresses and as part of our Certified programs for staff development.\n\nAs a globally active company with approximately 590,000 employees (headcount as of December 31, 2023) in over 220 countries and territories, upholding human rights is a top priority for us. We account for this responsibility through our Human Rights Policy Statement. If infringements are reported, we will take appropriate measures for clarification.\n\nThe development of staff costs is a key factor for us due to the large number of employees. This factor is also being driven by the currently high levels of inflation. The current collective bargaining agreement of Deutsche Post AG is valid for 2023 and 2024. The development of staff costs is no longer a risk of material significance for us at this time.\n\nOverall, we do not currently see any personnel-related opportunities or risks of material significance.\n\n#### Opportunities and risks arising from information technology\n\nThe security of our information systems is particularly important to us. The goal is to ensure continuous IT system operation and prevent unauthorized access to our systems and databases. To this end, we have defined guidelines, standards and procedures based upon ISO 27001, the international standard for information security management. In addition, IT risks are monitored and assessed on an ongoing basis by Group Risk Management, Corporate Internal Audit, Data Protection and Corporate Security.\n\nFor our business processes to run smoothly at all times, the essential IT systems must be continuously available. We have therefore designed our systems to protect against complete system failure. Our software is monitored and updated regularly to address potential bugs, close gaps in security and increase functionality. We employ a patch management process – a defined procedure for managing software upgrades – to control risks that could arise from outdated software or from software upgrades. In this context, we use structured processes to collect and check the devices and software versions used in our IT network, the goal being to achieve the highest possible level of coverage.\n\nWe limit access to our systems and data such that employees can generally only access the data they need to perform their duties. Systems and data are backed up on a regular basis, and critical data are replicated across data centers. We make use of outsourced data centers of established providers and operate central data centers in the Czech Republic, Malaysia and the United States. Our systems are thus geographically separate and, in addition, are replicated at local disaster recovery locations.\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/103/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nTo assess risks in the area of information security, we take a uniform Group-wide approach that factors in risks from the lack of availability, manipulation, misuse, spying and infection of data and information, as well as physical damage to IT facilities. In total, these represent a latent risk of medium significance (3).\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) opens up a wide range of possibilities, but it also comes with increasing risks for the Group due to the dangers of cybercrime. In addition, complying with regulations in dealing with generative AI is a compliance topic in general.\n\nWe also take continuous action to minimize risk, such as holding regular training courses for our employees and monitoring all of our networks and IT systems globally via our Cyber Defense Center, along with regular information security incident simulations.\n\nWe currently do not see any other specific IT-related opportunities or risks of material significance.\n\n#### Financial opportunities and risks\n\nAs a global operator, we are exposed to financial opportunities and risks arising from fluctuating foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodities prices, as well as the Group's capital requirements. Changes in pension obligations also impact our business. Due to the high volatility of recent years, the influence of interest rates on our pension obligations represents both a risk as well as an opportunity of medium significance for us (4). We attempt to reduce the volatility of our financial performance due to financial risk by implementing both operational and financial management measures. Within the Group, financial instruments are used exclusively for hedging purposes and thus reduce existing risks. Detailed information on risks in relation to the Group's defined benefit retirement plans can be found in **[note 37 to the consolidated financial statements.](#page-181-0)**\n\nWith respect to currencies, opportunities and risks result from scheduled foreign-currency transactions as well as those budgeted for the future. Any significant currency risks arising from budgeted transactions are quantified as a net position over a rolling 24 month period. Highly correlated currencies are consolidated in blocks. At the Group level, the most important net surpluses are budgeted for the US dollar block as well as for the pound sterling, the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar. The Czech koruna is the only currency with a considerable net deficit. As of the reporting date, there were no significant currency hedges for scheduled foreign-currency transactions.\n\nAny general depreciation of the euro presents an opportunity as regards the Group's earnings position. The main risk to the Group's earnings position would be a general appreciation of the euro.\n\nWe currently assess the aggregate effect of all foreign currency gains and losses both as an opportunity and a risk of medium significance for the Group (5).\n\nAs a logistics group, our biggest commodity price risks result from changes in fuel prices (kerosene, diesel and marine fuels). In the DHL divisions, most of these risks are passed on to customers via operating measures (fuel surcharges).\n\nThe key control parameters for liquidity management are the centrally available liquidity reserves. The Group's liquidity is secured over the short and medium terms. Moreover, the Group enjoys open access to the capital markets on account of its solid investment-grade rating and is well positioned to ensure that long-term capital requirements are fulfilled. We therefore see no significant risk to the Group at present in the area of liquidity.\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/104/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of a stylized font with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nFurther information on the Group's financial position and finance strategy, as well as on the management of financial risks, can be found in the Report on economic position and in **[note 43 to the consolidated financial statements.](#page-195-0)**\n\nRisks may also arise from our accounting, controlling, budgetary and financial processes. We monitor those processes continuously to prevent such risks from materializing.\n\nWe do not currently see any other significant financial opportunities or risks.\n\n#### Tax-related opportunities and risks\n\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a variety of tax regimes. Opportunities and risks arise from the introduction of new types of taxes, legislative changes and judicial rulings. As such, opportunities and risks could arise from the different interpretation of complex tax regulations, for instance.\n\nWe mitigate this risk through continual dialog with taxation authorities and tax advisers to obtain the greatest possible degree of legal certainty. This allows us to meet tax compliance requirements in the countries in which we operate to the best of our knowledge and belief. Our Group risk management system incorporates a tax risk management framework that enables us to monitor and avoid tax risk as far as possible.\n\nCurrently, we have not identified any significant taxrelated opportunities or risks.\n\n#### Opportunities and risks related to real estate transactions\n\nDHL Group is one of the world's largest corporate users of industrial properties. A large portion of the Group's industrial real estate portfolio consists of leased properties. Ownership solutions have additionally been implemented for a number of especially strategic properties. Our business may be impacted by opportunities and risks arising from the lease, purchase, sale, construction or use of real estate. A global team of real estate professionals manages the Group portfolio and ensures that any opportunities or risks are identified at an early stage and a suitable response is selected.\n\nWe negotiate suitable solutions early with our lessors, analyze real estate markets and identify suitable properties for expanding or optimizing the current portfolio based on our divisions' business strategies and operational location planning. The main objective is to secure the availability of properties needed for our core business.\n\nWe do not currently see any specific opportunities or risks of significance in the area of real estate.\n\n#### Market- and customer-specific opportunities and risks\n\nMacroeconomic and sector-specific conditions are a key factor in determining the success of our business. In addition to the development of the global economy, growth in the logistics market and its interaction with our stakeholders – our customers, suppliers and competitors – is of particular importance in this regard. Changes in demand present both opportunities and risks.\n\nAs a provider of choice, our business is based on our customers' needs. Our customers are likewise exposed to macroeconomic trends that impact growth in their respective sectors. We monitor market developments on an ongoing basis and review the potential financial effects of relationships with business partners and suppliers at regular intervals, to enable us to avert any risk that could arise from potential insolvencies, for example, at an early stage. Our Customer Solutions & Innovation unit uses a risk dashboard for this purpose. Due to the current economic situation, potential customer bankruptcies represent a risk of medium significance (6).\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/105/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nGlobal trade weakened significantly due to economic developments, geopolitical crises such as the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis and the corresponding high levels of inflation and increased interest rates. In addition, the easing of the market capacities for transport services that were heavily used in previous years is leading to a normalization of freight rates. We expect moderate business performance in 2024. In spite of the continued expectation of weaker global economic growth, we will see opportunities for growth, for instance through structural growth in e-commerce. The general trend of businesses outsourcing processes continues as well. In addition, our DHL divisions are benefitting from rising demand for complex and integrated logistics solutions thanks to our position as the global market leader.\n\nOur strong position in all the regions in which we operate allows us to compensate, at least partially, for declines in certain trade lanes, often based on growth in others. Cyclical risks can affect our divisions differently depending on their magnitude and point in time, which could mitigate the total effect. Moreover, we have taken measures in recent years to make costs more flexible and to allow us to respond quickly to changes in market demand. However, an additional weakening of global economic growth represents a risk of medium significance (7).\n\nDeutsche Post and DHL are in competition with already-established companies, as well as new entrants to the market. Such competition can significantly impact our customer base as well as the levels of prices and margins in our markets. In the logistics and letter mail business, the key factors for success are quality, confidence and competitive prices. Thanks to the high quality we offer, along with the cost savings we have generated in recent years, we believe that we will be able to remain competitive and keep any negative effects at a low level.\n\nAs a logistics concern, we are additionally exposed to the effects of fluctuations in market prices on Group profit. Despite the recent decline in inflation, this still represents a risk of medium significance (8).\n\nThe availability of renewable energy is of central importance for us to achieve our sustainability goals. In line with our ESG Roadmap, we aim to have more than 30% of the total fuel we use for air freight come from sustainable sources (sustainable aviation fuel – SAF) by 2030. The current availability and planned projects do not yet appear to be sufficient to meet the demand for sustainable aviation fuels. The possibility that the market supply of renewable energy and SAF may not be sufficient therefore represents a risk of medium significance (9).\n\nIn addition, no significant opportunities or risks are seen at present in this risk category.\n\n#### Opportunities and risks arising from political, regulatory or legal conditions\n\nOur business is fundamentally intertwined with the political and legal environments in which we operate. The stability and security of international transport routes represent the first line in this framework, and they could be critically disrupted by events ranging from geopolitical developments to military conflicts such as the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East. A number of the indirect effects of these geopolitical crises, such as the development of the global economy and inflation, have been taken into account for the corresponding risks. The remaining direct effects in the countries and regions affected currently represent a risk of low significance.\n\nIn addition, the international transport of goods is subject to the import, export and transit regulations of more than 220 countries and territories as well as their applicable foreign trade laws. In recent years, not only the number but also the complexity of such laws and regulations has increased significantly (including their extraterritorial application). Violations are also being pursued more aggressively by the competent authorities, with stricter penalties imposed. We have implemented, on the one hand, ongoing monitoring of the regulatory and legislative developments in the markets most relevant for us and, on the other, a Group-wide compliance program in response to this development. This comprises the legally prescribed checking of all senders, recipients, suppliers and employees against current embargo lists. In addition, this includes in particular the legally required review of shipments for the purpose of enforcing applicable export restrictions as well as country sanctions and embargoes. DHL Group also cooperates with the responsible authorities, both in working to prevent violations as well as in assisting in the investigation of any infringements in order to avoid or limit potential sanctions.\n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/106/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters. There are three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. The word \"Group\" is in red and is located below the right side of the DHL letters. The background is yellow.\n\nA number of risks arise primarily from the fact that the Group provides some of its services in regulated markets. Many of the postal services rendered by Deutsche Post AG and its subsidiaries (particularly the Post & Parcel Germany division) are subject to the German Postal Act, postal regulations and sector-specific regulation by the German federal network agency (*Bundesnetzagentur*), in addition to the general legal provisions. The German federal network agency approves or reviews prices, formulates the terms of downstream access, has special supervisory powers – in addition to the Federal Cartel Office – to combat market abuse and guarantees the provision of universal postal services. This general regulatory risk could lead to a decline in revenue and earnings in the event of negative decisions.\n\nThe German federal government had agreed in the coalition agreement that the Postal Act (*Postgesetz*) would again be amended. The described aim was to further enhance social and environmental standards and strengthen fair competition. The German federal cabinet passed a draft law to modernize the Postal Act on December 20, 2023. The draft will now go through the ordinary legislative process in the Bundestag and Bundesrat. The amended Postal Act is expected to enter into effect in the course of 2024.\n\nDepending upon the structure of this new regulatory framework and its application by the German federal network agency, along with its interpretation by the responsible courts, opportunities and risks may arise for the company's regulated areas.\n\nRevenue and earnings risk can arise, in particular, from the price cap procedure used to determine the rates for letter mail. Approval of the rates for the period from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2024, was issued by the German federal network agency on April 29, 2022. The German federal network agency would have to issue the approval of the rates applicable from 2025 onward in 2024 on the basis of the version of the German Postal Act applicable at the time.\n\nAn association from the CEP sector and customers have filed an action with the Cologne Administrative Court against the price cap approval of the German federal network agency for the years 2022 to 2024. The proceedings are still pending. The same CEP association, as well as postal service providers and other customers, had previously filed an action with the Cologne Administrative Court against the pricing approvals granted as part of the price cap procedure for the years 2016 to 2018 and 2019 to 2021. In a ruling issued on August 17, 2022, the Cologne Administrative Court overturned the approval for the years 2019 to 2021 in relation to the association as well as the postal service providers as a result of a ruling of the German Federal Administrative Court from May 27, 2020, due to a formal legal error in the context of the underlying legal ordinance. This formal legal error was rectified by the German government through an amendment to the German Postal Act that took effect in March 2021. The Cologne Administrative Court denied the claims of two customers because they had expired. The Cologne Administrative Court has not yet reached a decision on the other mentioned claims against the price cap approvals. The association's additional application to be granted a new approval for the years 2019 to 2021 was denied by the Cologne Administrative Court. The association has filed an appeal to this ruling with the Federal Administrative Court, as have the two customers who were completely unsuccessful in their claims with the Cologne Administrative Court; the appeals with the German Federal Administrative Court are still pending.\n\nThe rulings of the Cologne Administrative Court from August 17, 2022, are only applicable to the legal relationships with the respective plaintiffs and have no legal impact vis-à-vis other consumers.\n\nOne postal service provider, which had filed an action against the pricing approval for the years 2019 to 2021 with the Cologne Administrative Court, also filed an additional civil suit for repayment of allegedly excessive conveyance fees for standard letters delivered in 2017. The action is based primarily on the claim that Deutsche Post charged postage whose approval is unlawful pursuant to the ruling of the German Federal Administrative Court from May 27, 2020. The action was denied by the Cologne District Court in a ruling from June 17, 2021. The cartel court of the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court denied the appeal of this ruling on April 6, 2022, and did not permit any further appeals of the ruling. On May 2, 2022, the plaintiff submitted an appeal against nonpermission with Germany's Federal Court of Justice to have its appeal allowed.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/107/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font size, also in red. The background of the logo is yellow.\n\nIt cannot currently be ruled out that the effects on existing pricing approvals, or on future price cap procedures, of the court's decisions or the actions currently pending could be negative for Deutsche Post.\n\nEspecially the regulations from the Postal Act, which are currently undergoing revision, are of particular importance for us. If the regulations on terms and pricing and the clarification that so-called partial services are also a universal service proposed by the cabinet resolution dated December 20, 2023, are changed again, if it is not possible to withdraw from the provision of the universal postal service, or if the new law is not passed in a timely manner, this will come with a number of risks for our Group, including the possibility of significant impairment losses. Due to the low probability of occurrence, we currently assess this risk as medium (10) overall.\n\nOne opportunity largely taken into account in our guidance results from the tax handling of so-called partial service shipments in accordance with European legislation. If the first-instance ruling of the Cologne Finance Court on the VAT liability of partial services is confirmed by the German Federal Fiscal Court, this transport service will have to be offered without VAT. The aforementioned draft of a new Postal Act is also congruent with the European legal situation and clarifies that partial service shipments are a part of the universal postal service and thus have to be offered without VAT in the future.\n\nWe also describe significant legal proceedings in **[note 45 to the consolidated financial statements.](#page-213-0)**\n\nThe fight against climate change can result in increased regulatory and legal changes in the coming years. An increase in, or stepped up introduction of, carbon taxes and levies, certification regulations and other direct costs in conjunction with CO₂ emissions (11) represents a risk of medium importance for us, as do increased restrictions on GHG emissions (12). We have implemented ongoing monitoring of the regulatory and legislative developments in the markets most relevant for us in response to this risk, but above all we constantly work to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and have also set ourselves verified targets from the Science Based Targets Initiative to this end.\n\nWe have not identified any other significant opportunities or risks associated with the political, regulatory or statutory environment.\n\n#### Opportunities and risks arising from the environment, catastrophes and epidemics\n\nOur business operations can be impacted by natural disasters, epidemics and ecological factors, also including physical risks caused by climate change such as floods and storms.\n\nThe year 2023 was no longer significantly impacted by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, our focus at all times was, and remains, on safeguarding the health of our employees. We continue to regularly review the consequences of potential more virulent variants and their possible impact on our business activities, so that we are able to counter the respective current situation with corresponding measures.\n\nOverall, we do not currently see any specific opportunities or risks of material significance in this area.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-108-0\"></span>Image /page/108/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters \"DHL\" is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n### Internal control system\n\n#### Structure of the internal control system (ICS)\n\nOur internal control system (ICS) was designed to follow the internationally recognized COSO framework for internal control systems (COSO: Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) and is continuously updated and improved.\n\nA Group-wide guideline sets out the main principles and objectives of the ICS and specifies the structure of the ICS and the underlying role concept for the self-assessment.\n\nThe scope of the control objectives to be covered by the ICS is derived from a detailed risk analysis. Based on the risks identified and control objectives, minimum requirements are defined that must be covered through the implementation of suitable controls in the control frameworks of the divisions.\n\nOur ICS generally comprises all companies. The scope of the activities to be carried out by each entity differs and depends on, among other things, the materiality of the entity for the consolidated financial statements and the specific risks that are associated with the entity. All companies are analyzed on the basis of quantitative and qualitative aspects and categorized into companies material to the ICS in consideration of relevant financial figures and functional KPIs.\n\n#### Internal control system in the functions\n\nDisclosures unrelated to the management report (unaudited), **[preliminary remarks.](#page-17-0)**\n\nThe ICS of DHL Group takes the Finance, Human Resources (HR), Compliance, IT and Operations into account as part of the functional design of the Group-wide risk landscape.\n\nThe Group-wide risk landscape is supplemented for the respective function as part of an extended risk analysis and regularly reviewed, also including the consideration of sustainability-related targets within the ESG Roadmap. Risks and controls in this regard are identified and assigned to the respective functions and covered by the control frameworks of the divisions. Selfassessments are carried out in all functions, documented and prepared in a central reporting tool.\n\nThe goal of taking all functions of the Group into account is to ensure compliance with applicable standards and internal Group regulations as well as divisional and local provisions in all business transactions and the core processes.\n\nThe compliance management system (CMS) is a major component of the monitoring system of DHL Group. The CMS was established with the goal of creating rules, standards and processes for conduct compliant with laws and guidelines as well as measurable self-commitments. Therefore, it serves to protect DHL Group from financial risks and damage to its reputation, to minimize personal liability risks of governing bodies, managers and other employees, and to avoid competitive disadvantages.\n\nThe CMS is organized according to divisions. The Compliance Committee acts as a joint decision-making body chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer. The Compliance Committee facilitates the exchange of information on developments in compliance management in the individual divisions, coordinates fundamental strategic questions related to the CMS and ensures consistent implementation in the divisions.\n\nCompliance management at DHL Group is based on a values-oriented Code of Conduct that sets out a uniform Group-wide commitment to ethical, responsible and legally compliant conduct in business. Our managers act as role models and should set a good example to promote compliance. DHL Group uses targeted communication and regular training sessions to help its employees and business partners understand and adhere to the compliance guidelines and regulations.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/109/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font, also in red. The background of the image is yellow.\n\nAt DHL Group, compliance risks are identified and assessed on a regular basis and systematically across all divisions. The identified risks are assessed and analyzed according to qualitative criteria and, if necessary, supplemented by further risk minimization measures.\n\nOur compliance program comprises the preventive elements of guidelines, training sessions and business partner reviews. In addition, detective elements such as violation reporting and case processing management contribute to ensuring the business integrity of DHL Group.\n\n#### Accounting-related internal control system\n\nThe accounting-related ICS is an integral part of the accounting and financial reporting process of the companies included in the Group. The accounting-related ICS aims to ensure the compliance of (Group) accounting and financial reporting with generally accepted principles. Specifically, it is intended to ensure that all transactions are recorded promptly, accurately and in a uniform manner on the basis of the applicable norms, accounting standards and internal Group regulations. Accounting errors are to be avoided in principle, and material misrepresentations and errors detected promptly.\n\nWithin the framework of the ICS, we take organizational and process-related measures that involve all companies in the Group. Centrally standardized accounting guidelines govern the reconciliation of the single-entity financial statements and support uniform accounting pursuant to EU IFRSs throughout the Group. In addition, German generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) have been established for Deutsche Post AG and the other Group companies subject to HGB reporting requirements. A standard chart of accounts is required to be applied by all Group companies. We immediately assess new developments in international accounting for relevance and announce their implementation in a timely manner, for example in newsletters. Often, accounting processes are pooled in a shared service center in order to centralize and standardize them. The IFRS financial statements of the individual Group companies are recorded in a standard, SAP-based system and then processed at a central location where one-step consolidation is performed. Other quality assurance components include automatic plausibility reviews and system validations of the accounting data. In addition, regular, manual checks are carried out centrally at the Corporate Center by Corporate Accounting & Controlling, Taxes and Corporate Finance. If necessary, we call in outside professionals with the requisite expertise. Finally, the Group's standardized process of preparing financial statements by using a centrally administered financial statements calendar supports a structured and efficient accounting process.\n\nThe companies have implemented preventive and detective control mechanisms to address risks of material misrepresentation in reporting and covered division-specific as well as local requirements. To maintain the system's effectiveness and implement continuous improvements, the ICS is subjected to regular reviews. To this end, self-assessments are carried out using the dualcontrol principle and documented in a central IT application. If a self-assessment results in the finding of inadequate control implementation, an action plan must be created, and the successful execution thereof must be confirmed by the person responsible for the process.\n\nThe results of the self-assessments are documented in a central reporting tool. The Supervisory Board, Board of Management and the functional bodies are regularly informed of the findings. In addition, this information is analyzed with regard to potential improvements.\n\n#### Regular monitoring by Corporate Internal Audit\n\nOver and above the ICS and risk management, Corporate Internal Audit is an essential component of the Group's control and monitoring system. Using risk-based auditing procedures, Corporate Internal Audit regularly examines the processes related to financial reporting and reports its results to the Board of Management.\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-110-0\"></span>Image /page/110/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of a stylized, bold font with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. Below the DHL part, the word \"Group\" is written in a smaller, red font. The background is yellow.\n\n#### Statement on the appropriateness and effectiveness of the RMS and ICS\n\nDisclosures unrelated to the management report (unaudited), **[preliminary remarks.](#page-17-0)**\n\nBased on the regular reporting on the RMS and ICS, the analysis of the underlying results of the self-assessments and the appraisal of the reports from the internal audit department, the Board of Management is not aware of any circumstances that would cause it to believe that the design of the risk management system and the internal control system in its entirety is not appropriate and effective for the risk situation of DHL Group.\n\nIt should, however, always be taken into consideration that no ICS, regardless of how well designed, can offer absolute certainty that all material accounting misstatements will be avoided or detected.\n\n#### Overall assessment of the Board of Management\n\nIn the 2024 fiscal year, we anticipate consolidated EBIT between €6.0 billion and €6.6 billion. The DHL divisions are projected to generate total EBIT of more than €5.7. In the Post & Parcel Germany division, EBIT is forecast to come in at more than €0.8 billion. Group Functions is anticipated to contribute around €–0.45 billion to earnings. In view of the expected EBIT development in combination with a predicted increase in the asset charge, we expect the EAC to be down slightly year over year. Free cash flow is projected at around €2.75 billion, including a €250 million overall budget for M&A expenses.\n\nThe current business planning has not identified any significant changes in the Group's overall opportunity and risk situation compared with last year's risk report. No new risks with a potentially critical impact upon the Group's result have been identified according to current assessments. Based upon the Group's early-warning system and in the estimation of its Board of Management, there were no identifiable risks for the Group in the current forecast period that, individually or collectively, cast doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. Nor are any such risks apparent in the foreseeable future. The stable to positive outlook projected for the Group is moreover reflected in our **[credit rating.](#page-48-0)**\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-111-0\"></span>Image /page/111/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters \"DHL\" is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n## GOVERNANCE\n\n### Annual Corporate Governance Statement\n\npursuant to Sections 289f and 315d HGB with respect to Deutsche Post AG and DHL Group.\n\n#### Declaration of Conformity with the German Corporate Governance Code\n\nDeutsche Post AG complied with the suggestions and recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the year under review. The Board of Management and Supervisory Board intend to comply with all suggestions and recommendations in the future as well. In December 2023, they issued the following Declaration of Conformity:\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Post AG declare that, since the issue of the Declaration of Conformity in December 2022, all recommendations of the Government Commission German Corporate Governance Code, as amended on April 28, 2022, and published in the *Bundesanzeiger* (Federal Gazette) on June 27, 2022, have been complied with, and that all recommendations are to be complied with going forward.\n\nYou can view the current Declaration of Conformity and the Annual Corporate Governance Statement along with the Declarations of Conformity for the past five years on the **[company's website.](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/declarations-reports.html)**\n\n#### Corporate governance principles and shared values\n\nOur business relationships and activities are based upon responsible business practices that comply with applicable laws, international guidelines and ethical standards, and this also forms part of the Group's strategy. Equally, we require our suppliers to act in this way. We encourage relationships with our employees, customers and other stakeholders, as well as the shareholders, whose decisions to select DHL Group as an employer, supplier or investment are increasingly also based upon the requirement that we apply good corporate governance criteria.\n\nWith the **[Code of Conduct,](https://group.dhl.com/content/dam/deutschepostdhl/en/media-center/responsibility/dhl-group-code-of-conduct-en.pdf)** we have laid out the requirements of the conduct of our employees. It is applicable across all divisions and regions. In the Code of Conduct, we commit ourselves in particular to the principles set out in the United Nations (UN) Global Compact, comply with the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and follow additional recognized legal standards, including the applicable anti-corruption legislation and agreements. In addition, we take the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises into account. In addition, we support various sustainability initiatives, for example to promote the development of sustainable fuels and technologies, and are working with transport partners on reducing fuel consumption and the emission of greenhouse gases. As a long-standing partner of the United Nations, we support the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In 2023, DHL Group became a member of Transparency International Germany.\n\nThe Code of Conduct also describes our understanding of diversity and inclusion. This understanding and mutual respect promote cooperation within the Group and thus contribute to economic success. The criteria for the recruitment and professional development of our employees are exclusively their skills and qualifications. The members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board support the diversity measures, with a particular focus on the Group's goal of increasing the number of women in management. Doing business includes using our expertise as a service provider in the mail services and logistics sector for the benefit of society and the environment, and we motivate our employees to engage personally in this regard.\n\nEnsuring that our interactions with business partners, shareholders and the public are conducted with integrity and within the bounds of the law is vital to maintaining our reputation. This is also the foundation of DHL Group's lasting business success. Our compliance management system (CMS) is designed to promote legally compliant conduct as well as to prevent corruption and anticompetitive conduct in particular. Insights gained from compliance audits and reported violations are also used to continually improve and upgrade the CMS system. To this end, the enhanced compliance reporting tool (BKMS Dashboard) offers Group-wide,\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/112/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\ncentralized and systematic collection of all key figures related to compliance notifications and the clarification of issues. In addition, further measures were taken to promote the culture of compliance and compliance reporting was established.\n\n#### Cooperation between the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, remuneration, retirement ages\n\nAs a listed German public limited company, Deutsche Post AG has a two-tier board structure comprising the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management are responsible for the management of the company. They manage their Board departments independently, except where decisions of particular significance and consequence for the company or the Group require a resolution by all members of the Board of Management. Each member of the Board of Management is obligated to subordinate the interests of their individual Board departments to the collective interests of the company and to inform the Board of Management about significant developments in their departments. The Board of Management ensures compliance with statutory provisions and internal guidelines within the company (compliance). The internal control system and the risk management system comprise a CMS aligned with the risk situation of the company and also include targets related to sustainability.\n\nThe CEO conducts Board of Management business, aligns Board department activities with the company's collective goals and plans, and ensures that corporate policy is carried out. When making decisions, members of the Board of Management may not act in their own personal interest or exploit corporate business opportunities for their own benefit. Any conflicts of interest must be disclosed to the chairs of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management without delay; the other Board of Management members must also be informed. The Supervisory Board has determined that appointments to the Board of Management should generally end by the time the member turns 65.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board appoint, advise and oversee the Board of Management. They propose the remuneration system for Board of Management members to the Annual General Meeting, and – together with the Board of Management – are jointly responsible for the long-term succession planning for the Board of Management. Furthermore, the statutory obligations of the Supervisory Board include the review and approval of the annual and consolidated financial statements, the review of the proposal for the appropriation of the net retained profit and the recommendation of the auditor to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nFor proposals for the election of Supervisory Board members, the Supervisory Board will ensure that their term of office ends no later than the close of the next Annual General Meeting to be held after the Supervisory Board member turns 72. As a general rule, Supervisory Board members should not serve more than three terms of office.\n\nThe company's D & O (directors and officers) insurance for the members of the Board of Management provides for a deductible as set out in the AktG.\n\nThe principles governing the Supervisory Board's internal organization, a catalog of Board of Management transactions requiring approval and the work of the Supervisory Board committees are governed by the rules of procedure, which are available on the **[company's website.](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/supervisory-board.html)** The Chair, elected by the members of the Supervisory Board from their ranks, coordinates the work of the Supervisory Board and represents the Supervisory Board publicly. The Chair holds talks with investors on topics relevant to the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board represents the company in respect of the Board of Management members. Members of the Supervisory Board receive a fixed annual remuneration of €100,000. The remuneration for each of the chairs (plenary and committees) increases by 100%, for the Deputy Chair of the Supervisory Board and for committee members by 50%. This does not apply to the Mediation or Nomination Committees. The report on remuneration of Board of Management and Supervisory Board members can be accessed along with the auditor's report pursuant to Section 162(3) AktG on the **[company's website.](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/remuneration.html)** There are no contracts between the company and Supervisory Board members, with the exception of the employment contracts with the employee representatives.\n\nThe Supervisory Board meets at least twice each half year, regularly also without the Board of Management present. Extraordinary meetings are held as required. In the 2023 fiscal year, Supervisory Board members held four plenary meetings, 21 committee meetings and one closed meeting. The meetings took place in person, with a few exceptions for the committee meetings.

In cases where individual members were unable to participate, they submitted their votes in writing in advance of the meeting and thus ensured that the decisions made were based on the decisions of all responsible members. The overall attendance rate of 95% is broken down by member in the **[report of the Supervisory Board.](#page-11-0)**\n\nSupervisory Board decisions are prepared in advance in separate meetings of the shareholder representatives and the employee representatives, and by the relevant committees. During the plenary meetings, the committee chairs inform the other members about the work and decisions of the committees. Supervisory Board members are personally responsible for ensuring they receive training and professional development measures. They receive appropriate support from the company in the process. In 2023, the Directors' Days took place in May and September. The topics covered included the regulation of the postal market, ESG key performance indicators as a basis for corporate governance and Board of Management remuneration, as well as updates on supply chain legislation, Corporate Sustainability Reporting and the EU Taxonomy.\n\n#### Succession planning for the Board of Management\n\nTogether with the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board is jointly responsible for the long-term succession planning for the Board of Management. To this end, in particular the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the Chief Executive Officer regularly discuss candidates with the potential to take on positions on the Board of Management. Within the Supervisory Board, the search for suitable Board of Management members is primarily the responsibility of the Executive Committee. In the event of an upcoming vacancy, the Executive Committee selects suitable candidates for personal interviews, taking into account specific requirements for experience and qualifications to be met by the members and the composition of the Board of Management as a whole and, after discussing this list of candidates, submits it to the Supervisory Board.\n\nIndependent of specific upcoming vacancies, potential successors from within the Group are given the opportunity to give a presentation on topics from their own areas of responsibility before the Supervisory Board. In this way, the Supervisory Board maintains an overview of the potential of Group executives who could be considered for a position on the Board of Management. When appointing new members to the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board ensures that the different skills and experiences of the members supplement the Board of Management and that its membership is thus diverse. International experience is of particular importance, in addition to industry experience. The initial term of service for members of the Board of Management generally runs for three years.\n\n#### Independence of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board\n\nAll Supervisory Board members are independent within the meaning of the German Corporate Governance Code. This exceeds the target for the Supervisory Board of filling at least 60% of mandates on the shareholder side with independent members.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the largest shareholder in the company, KfW Bankengruppe, holds 20.49% of the shares in Deutsche Post AG and therefore does not exercise control, nor does the German federal government, which is an indirect shareholder via the KfW. Accordingly, Luise Hölscher and Stefan B. Wintels are also independent. On February 7, 2024, KfW Bankengruppe reduced its shareholding in Deutsche Post AG to 16.45%.\n\nStefan Schulte, who is resigning from the Supervisory Board after the Annual General Meeting scheduled for May 3, 2024, has contributed his comprehensive expertise and experience to the benefit of the company throughout his term of office and, as the Chair of the Financial and Audit Committee, engaged the Board of Management in differentiated and critical discussions. His independence was therefore not in question at any time for the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board will recommend two new independent Supervisory Board members to the Annual General Meeting to succeed Stefan Schulte and Simone Menne, who is also stepping down from the Finance and Audit Committee. More detailed information on the candidates can be found in the report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nLawrence Rosen's responsibility for the Board department Finance ended more than seven years ago and therefore does not impair his independence. At the same time, his profound knowledge of the company and the industry make it possible for him to support the Board of Management as an experienced and expert adviser and to perform the monitoring duties of the Supervisory Board in particular.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/114/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nNo Supervisory Board member exceeds the maximum age limit of 72, holds seats on governing bodies of the Group's main competitors or provides consultancy services to, or maintains other personal relationships with, such competitors.\n\n#### Effectiveness of the Supervisory Board's advisory and monitoring duties\n\nEach year, the members of the Supervisory Board review the work and decision-making processes of the Board. Discussions take place during a Supervisory Board meeting without the presence of the Board of Management. At regular intervals, most recently in the year under review, the opinions are also evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire, the results of which are incorporated into the Board's discussions. Among other topics, discussions focused on the skills profile of the Supervisory Board as well as the progress of the onboarding process for new Supervisory Board members. As a result, the Supervisory Board is of the opinion that it performed its monitoring and advisory duties effectively and efficiently.\n\n#### Targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board (skills profile)\n\nIn addition to legal requirements (notably Sections 100 and 107 AktG), the composition of the Supervisory Board is guided by recommendations C.1 and C.6 of the German Corporate Governance Code (DCGK). Overall, the Supervisory Board set the following targets for its composition that also reflect the skills profile it aspires to have:\n\n1. When proposing candidates to the Annual General Meeting for election as Supervisory Board members, the Supervisory Board is to be guided purely by the best interests of the company. Subject to this requirement, the Supervisory Board aims to ensure that the independent group of shareholder representatives as defined in C.6 of the German Corporate Governance Code is to account for at least 60% of the Supervisory Board, and that at least 30% of Supervisory Board members are women.\n\n2. The company's international activities are already adequately reflected in the current composition of the Supervisory Board. For its future proposals to the Annual General Meeting as well, the Supervisory Board strives to find candidates whose origins, education or professional experience equip them with particular international knowledge and experience.\n\n3. The Supervisory Board should collectively serve as a competent adviser to the Board of Management on future issues, in particular digital transformation and sustainability issues.\n\n4. The Supervisory Board should collectively have sufficient expertise in the areas of accounting and financial statement audits. This includes knowledge of international developments in the field of accounting. Additionally, the Supervisory Board believes that the independence of its members helps guarantee the integrity of the accounting process and ensure the independence of the auditors.\n\n5. Conflicts of interest affecting Supervisory Board members are an obstacle to providing independent advice to, and supervision of, the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board will decide how to deal with potential or actual conflicts of interest on a caseby-case basis, in accordance with the law and giving due consideration to the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\n6. In accordance with the age limit adopted by the Supervisory Board and laid down in the rules of procedure for the Supervisory Board, proposals for the election of Supervisory Board members must ensure that their term of office ends no later than the close of the next Annual General Meeting to be held after the Supervisory Board member reaches the age of 72. As a general rule, Supervisory Board members should not serve more than three terms of office.\n\nThe current Supervisory Board meets these targets and fulfills this skills profile. The Supervisory Board took targets and the skills profile into account in the election proposals it made to this year's Annual General Meeting.\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-115-0\"></span>Image /page/115/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

members can be found in the following overview.\n\n#### QUALIFICATION MATRIX\n\n|                                                          | Dr. Nikolaus<br>von Bomhard | Dr. Mario<br>Daberkow |

basis for each division, attended by representatives of management, once with the entire Board of Management and the other three times with the CEO and CFO. Additionally, quarterly review meetings are held for the cross-divisional functions with the CEO and CFO as well as representatives of management.\n\nThe review meetings involve discussions of strategic initiatives, operational matters and the budgetary situation in the divisions. In addition, all departments have Board committees where decisions are made on the fundamental strategic orientation of the respective department and prominent topics. Finally, the responsible Board departments resolve on investment, real estate and M&A plans within certain threshold limits using defined decision-making and approval processes.\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-116-0\"></span>Image /page/116/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters \"DHL\" is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### **Mediation Committee (pursuant to Section 27(3) German Co-determination Act)**\n\nDr. Nikolaus von Bomhard (Chair) Andrea Kocsis (Deputy Chair) Dr. Heinrich Hiesinger Thorsten Kühn\n\nThe Executive Committee prepares the resolutions to be taken in the plenary meetings regarding the appointment of members to the Board of Management, preparation of their service agreements (including remuneration), the system for remunerating Board of Management members, the establishment of variable remuneration targets, the establishment of variable remuneration according to degrees of target achievement, the review of the appropriateness of Board of Management remuneration and the remuneration report to be prepared annually. In addition, it regularly focuses on long-term succession planning for the Board of Management and questions of corporate governance, also providing recommendations to the Supervisory Board with regard to the latter.\n\nThe Finance and Audit Committee reviews the company's accounts, including sustainability reporting, and submits proposals for the approval of the annual and consolidated financial statements to the Supervisory Board. It oversees the company's accounting process; the effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system and the internal audit system; and the audit of the annual financial statements, in particular with respect to audit quality and the independence of the auditors. Consultation with the auditor also regularly takes place without the Board of Management members being present. The Finance and Audit Committee prepares the proposals of the Supervisory Board to be made to the Annual General Meeting concerning the choice of the audit firm. If the proposal is preceded by a formal selection process, as was the case prior to the 2022 Annual General Meeting, the committee is responsible for its execution. Following the selection process, the 2022 Annual General Meeting elected Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Munich, as the new audit firm for the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nIf the auditor is to be engaged to perform nonaudit services, the Finance and Audit Committee must approve any such engagement, and the committee receives regular reports regarding the total amount of fees agreed upon for these services to ensure compliance with the statutory upper limit. It examines corporate compliance and discusses the half-yearly financial reports and the quarterly statements with the Board of Management prior to their publication. As required, the Finance and Audit Committee is also responsible for issuing findings on the required Supervisory Board approvals of significant transactions between the company and related parties.\n\nThe Chair of the Finance and Audit Committee regularly engages in dialog with the auditor outside of the meetings as well. This exchange between the Chair of the committee and the auditor concerns the progress of the audit, and the Chair reports to the committee in this regard.\n\nThe Chair of the Finance and Audit Committee, Stefan Schulte, is independent and, on account of his many years of experience as the CFO and CEO of Fraport AG, an expert both in accounting as well as in the auditing of financial statements. Simone Menne and Lawrence Rosen also have comprehensive expertise in accounting and the auditing of financial statements thanks to their many years of service as board members for finance of Deutsche Lufthansa AG (Menne) as well as Deutsche Post AG and Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA (Rosen).\n\nThe candidates proposed to the 2024 Annual General Meeting to succeed Ms. Menne and Mr. Schulte on the Supervisory Board also possess comprehensive expertise in both of the aforementioned specialty areas. More detailed information on the candidates can be found in the report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nAn agreement has been reached with the auditor that the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the Chair of the Finance and Audit Committee will be informed without delay of any potential grounds for exclusion or for impairment of the auditors' independence that arise during the audit, to the extent that any such grounds for exclusion or impairment are not immediately remedied. In addition, it has been agreed upon that the auditor will inform the Supervisory Board without delay of all material findings and incidents occurring in the course of the audit. Furthermore, the auditor must inform the Supervisory Board if, while conducting the financial statement audit, any facts are found leading to the Declaration of Conformity issued by the Board of Management and\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/118/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The Finance and Audit Committee regularly reviews the quality of the financial statement audit. Both in the meeting of the Finance and Audit Committee held in preparation for the financial statements meeting as well as in the meeting of the plenary where the company and consolidated financial statements are approved, the members of the Supervisory Board closely examine the contents and the processes of the financial statement audit.\n\nThe Strategy and Sustainability Committee prepares the Supervisory Board's strategy discussions and regularly discusses implementation of the strategy and the competitive position of the enterprise as a whole and of the divisions. In addition, it does preparatory work on corporate acquisitions and divestitures that require the Supervisory Board's approval and takes an in-depth look at ESG topics relevant to the company. These include primarily the implementation of the sustainability strategy, in particular with regard to the goals of reducing CO₂ emissions, the safety and satisfaction of employees, the promotion of the share of women in executive positions, cybersecurity and the strengthening of compliance. All shareholder representatives on the committee have significant expertise in the field of sustainability.\n\nThe Nomination Committee is comprised exclusively of shareholder representatives. It presents the shareholder representatives of the Supervisory Board with recommendations for shareholder candidates for election to the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Personnel Committee discusses human resources principles and material topics for the Group, such as occupational health and safety, recruiting and retention, as well as equal opportunities.\n\nThe task of the Mediation Committee is stipulated by the *Mitbestimmungsgesetz* (MitbestG – German Co-Determination Act): it makes proposals to the Supervisory Board on the appointment of members of the Board of Management in cases in which the required majority of two-thirds of the votes of the Supervisory Board members is not reached. The committee did not meet in the past fiscal year.\n\nFurther information about the work of the Supervisory Board and its committees in the 2023 fiscal year is contained in the **[report of](#page-11-0)  [the Supervisory Board.](#page-11-0)** The members of the Board of Management and all additional offices held by them as well as the members of the Supervisory Board and all additional offices held by them can be found in **[boards and committees.](#page-6-0)** The Board members' curriculum vitae, information about their qualifications and the terms of their current appointments are also published on our **[website.](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/board-of-management.html)** The website also has current curriculum vitae of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board along with information on their professional occupation, their membership on the Supervisory Board and their current term of office.\n\n#### Diversity\n\nDiversity is one of the decisive factors in the business success of the Group – and the Board of Management is no exception. As part of the selection of members for the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board pays close attention to diversity and to ensuring that the members complement each other in terms of their personalities, qualifications, skills, origin and experience. Long-term succession planning in all divisions guarantees that there will be sufficient qualified internal candidates in the future as well. The early selection of women for executive positions also plays a key role. The members of the Board of Management come with different areas of professional expertise in the fields of engineering management, physics, business management, law and psychology. Moreover, the composition of the Board of Management reflects the international activities of the company: due to both their ethnic and cultural backgrounds as well as long professional tenures abroad of responsibility for business operations abroad, the members of the Board of Management have a broad range of experience in many countries in Europe, but also in the United States, Asia, Latin America and Australia. As of December 31, 2023, the average age of members of the Board of Management was 53, with the youngest member being 47 and the oldest 60.\n\nWith regard to long-term succession planning, the focus remains on the share of women in management positions. With two women on the Board of Management, the company has exceeded the minimum number applicable since August 2022 under Section 76(3a) AktG, which stipulates that the board of management of listed companies to which the German Co-determination Act applies include at least one woman and one man, if it consists of more than three persons. The target set by the Supervisory Board of a 25% share of women on the Board of Management by the end of 2024, which exceeds the statutory participation requirement, has also already been reached.\n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/119/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font size, also in red. The background is yellow.\n\nFor the period beginning January 1, 2020, the Board of Management set a target of 30% for the percentage of women at Deutsche Post AG at both executive tiers below the Board of Management. We aim to meet these targets by December 31, 2024. The two executive tiers are defined on the basis of their reporting lines: tier 1 comprises executives assigned to the N-1 reporting line; here, the share of women was 30.2% as of December 31, 2023. Tier 2 comprises executives assigned to the N-2 reporting line; here, the share of women was 33.3% as of December 31, 2023. By 2025, women should occupy at least 30% of middle- and uppermanagement positions in the Group. This figure has risen continually in recent years and stood at 27.2% as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe diversity criteria that are particularly important to the Supervisory Board when considering its own composition are also outlined in the list of its goals (skills profile). With a proportion of women of 40%, the Supervisory Board has exceeded its own target of 30%, which also reflects the minimum statutory requirement.\n\n#### Shareholders and Annual General Meeting\n\nShareholders exercise their rights, and in particular their right to receive information and to vote, at the Annual General Meeting. Each share in the company entitles the holder to one vote. The company did not issue preference shares without voting rights. The agenda with the proposed resolutions for the Annual General Meeting and additional information will be made available on the company website directly after the Annual General Meeting is convened. A CV, which provides information about their relevant knowledge, skills and functional experience and contains an overview of their essential duties in addition to the Supervisory Board, is published for each Supervisory Board candidate put forth for election. Moreover, the **[qualification matrix](#page-115-0)** offers an overview of the skills and qualifications of the Supervisory Board members.\n\nThe speech by the CEO is generally available on the company's website at least four days in advance of the respective Annual General Meeting.\n\nWe assist our shareholders in exercising their voting rights not only by making it possible to submit postal votes but also by appointing company proxies, who cast their votes at the Annual General Meeting as instructed by the shareholders. Additionally, shareholders can authorize company proxies and submit postal votes via the shareholder portal offered by the company. The voting instructions to the proxies and the postal ballots can be changed up to the point when voting begins at the Annual General Meeting. Shareholders entered into the shareholder register and their proxies will be able to watch and listen to the Annual General Meeting during an online live stream.\n\nAfter three Annual General Meetings held virtually due to the pandemic, the Board of Management was able to invite the shareholders to once again attend in person last year. The 2023 Annual General Meeting also authorized the Board of Management to hold Annual General Meetings virtually if necessary for a period of two years. For the 2024 Annual General Meeting, the Board of Management decided not to make use of this option and to carry out the meeting once again as an in-person event. This is in line with the wishes of many shareholders and shareholder representatives to have the opportunity to talk personally with the members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, as well as with each other.\n\nThe remuneration system applied to Board of Management members must be presented to the Annual General Meeting for approval in the event of significant changes, or at least every four years; the four-year interval also applies to the remuneration of the Supervisory Board members. The 2021 Annual General Meeting approved the Board of Management remuneration system with 93.39% and the Supervisory Board remuneration with 99.46% of the votes cast in favor. The resolution proposed to the Annual General Meeting on the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board for 2022 was passed with an approval rate of 99.07%. The Board of Management remuneration system and the resolutions of the Annual General Meeting on the remuneration of Supervisory Board members can also be accessed on the **[company's website.](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/remuneration.html)** Information regarding the remuneration of the individual members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board can be found in the remuneration reports available there. As scheduled, the remuneration system for the Board of Management will be presented to the 2025 Annual General Meeting for approval.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-120-0\"></span>Image /page/120/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n### Disclosures required by takeover law\n\nDisclosures required under Sections 289a and 315a HGB and explanatory report\n\n#### Composition of issued capital, voting rights and transfer of shares\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the company's share capital totaled €1,239,059,409 and was composed of the same number of no-parvalue registered shares. Each share carries the same rights and obligations stipulated by law and/or in the company's Articles of Association and entitles the holder to one vote at the Annual General Meeting (AGM). The company did not issue preference shares without voting rights or shares with special rights conveying powers of control.\n\nThe exercise of voting rights and the transfer of shares are based upon statutory provisions and the company's Articles of Association, which place no restrictions on the exercise of voting rights or transfer of shares. Under the Employee Share Plan sharebased remuneration program, stocks are subject to time-related trading restrictions during the two-year holding period. As of December 31, 2023, Deutsche Post AG held a total of 58,079,379 treasury shares, which are excluded from rights for the company in accordance with Section 71b AktG.\n\n#### Shareholdings exceeding 10% of voting rights\n\nKfW Bankengruppe (KfW), Frankfurt am Main, is our largest shareholder. On December 31, 2023, it held 20.49% of share capital, which it reduced to 16.45% on February 7, 2024, according to a voting right announcement. The Federal Republic of Germany – including via the KfW – holds a 16.84% stake in the share capital of Deutsche Post AG as of February 7, 2024.\n\n#### Appointment and replacement of members of the Board of Management\n\nThe members of the Board of Management are appointed and replaced in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions (cf. Sections 84 and 85 AktG and Section 31 MitbestG). Article 6 of the Articles of Association stipulates that the Board of Management must have at least two members. Beyond that, the number of Board members is determined by the Supervisory Board. If the Board of Management is comprised of more than three persons, at least one woman and at least one man must be members of the board, cf. Section 76 (3a) AktG.\n\n#### Amendments to the Articles of Association\n\nIn accordance with Section 119 (1), Number 6, and Section 179 (1), Sentence 1, AktG, amendments to the Articles of Association are adopted by resolution of the AGM. In accordance with Article 21 (2) of the Articles of Association in conjunction with Sections 179 (2) and 133 (1) AktG, such amendments generally require a simple majority of the votes cast and a simple majority of the share capital represented on the date of the resolution. In such instances where the law requires a greater majority for amendments to the Articles of Association, that majority is decisive.\n\n#### Board of Management authorization, particularly regarding the issue and buyback of shares\n\nThe Board of Management is authorized, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to issue up to 130,000,000 new no-parvalue registered shares (2021 Authorized Capital). Details may be found in Article 5 (2) of the Articles of Association. The Articles of Association can be accessed on the **[company's website](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/declarations-reports.html)** or in the electronic company register. They may also be viewed in the commercial register of the Bonn Local Court.\n\nThe Board of Management has furthermore been authorized by resolution of the AGMs of April 28, 2017 (agenda item 7), April 24, 2018 (agenda item 6), August 27, 2020 (agenda item 7), and May 6, 2022 (agenda items 8 and 9), to issue Performance Share Units (PSUs). The authorization resolutions are included in the notarized minutes of the AGM, which can be viewed in the commercial register. In order to service both current PSUs and those yet to be issued, the AGM approved contingent capital increases. Details may be found in Article 5 of the Articles of Association. As of December 31, 2023, the PSUs already issued conferred rights to up to 27,787,376 Deutsche Post AG shares, assuming the conditions are met. Under the authorizations granted, up to 54,619,296 additional PSUs may still be issued.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/121/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nThe AGM of May 4, 2023, authorized the company to buy back shares on or before May 3, 2028, up to an amount not to exceed 10% of the share capital existing as of the date of adoption of the resolution. Further details, including the option of using the treasury shares acquired on that basis or on the basis of a preceding authorization, may be found in the authorization resolution adopted by the AGM of May 4, 2023 (agenda item 6). In addition, the AGM of May 4, 2023, authorized the Board of Management to buy back shares within the scope specified in agenda item 6, including through the use of derivatives (agenda item 7). Together with the purchases based upon the earlier authorization dated May 6, 2021, the company repurchased a total of 23,606,169 shares in the fiscal year based upon the authorization resolution.\n\n#### Significant agreements that are conditional upon a change of control following a takeover bid and agreements with members of the Board of Management or employees providing for compensation in the event of a change of control\n\nDeutsche Post AG holds a syndicated credit facility with a volume of €2 billion under an agreement entered into with a consortium of banks. If a change of control within the meaning of the agreement occurs, each member of the bank consortium is entitled, under certain conditions, to cancel its share of the credit facility as well as its share of any outstanding loans and to request repayment. The terms and conditions of the bonds issued under the Debt Issuance Program established in March 2012 and those of the convertible bond issued in December 2017 also contain change-of-control clauses. In the event of a change of control within the meaning of those terms and conditions, creditors are, under certain conditions, granted the right to demand early redemption of the respective bonds. Finally, two framework agreements are in place with a vehicle supplier, on the basis of which vehicles with a total value in the upper double-digit-million range were purchased in the fiscal year and that can be terminated without notice by the contractual partner in the event of a change of control.\n\nIn the event of a change of control, any member of the Board of Management is entitled to resign their office for good cause within a period of six months following the change of control after giving three months' notice to the end of a given month, and to terminate their Board of Management contract (right to early termination). This is not associated with a severance payment claim. With regard to the Annual Bonus Plan with Share Matching for executives, the holding period for the shares will become invalid with immediate effect in the event of a change of control of the company. The participating executives will receive the total number of matching shares corresponding to their investment (or a cash equivalent) in due course. In such a case, the employer will be responsible for any tax disadvantages resulting from a reduction of the holding period. Taxes normally incurred after the holding period are exempt from this provision. Under the Employee Share Plan and the piloted \"myShares\" employee participation program, if a change of control occurs, any amounts that have already been invested and for which shares have yet to be delivered are reimbursed.

As of July 1, 2023, the Group name was changed from Deutsche Post DHL Group to DHL Group. The adoption of this new name does not have any influence on the services offered by the divisions. The Deutsche Post and DHL brands of the Group will continue to be used as before. These brands represent a portfolio of logistics (DHL) and communication (Deutsche Post) services. The fiscal year of Deutsche Post AG and its consolidated subsidiaries is the calendar year. Deutsche Post AG, whose registered office is in Bonn, Germany, is entered in the commercial register of the Bonn Local Court under HRB 6792.\n\n### Basis of preparation\n\nAs a listed company, Deutsche Post AG prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with Section 315e *Handelsgesetzbuch* (HGB – German Commercial Code) (\"consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards\") in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and related Interpretations of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted in the European Union in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the European Council on the application of international accounting standards.\n\n#### 1 Basis of accounting\n\nThe requirements of the standards applied have been satisfied in full, and the consolidated financial statements therefore provide a true and fair view of the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements consist of the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income, the balance sheet, the cash flow statement, the statement of changes in equity and the notes. In order to improve the clarity of presentation, various items in the balance sheet and in the income statement have been combined. These items are disclosed and explained separately in the notes. The income statement has been classified in accordance with the nature-of-expense method.\n\nThe accounting policies and the explanations and disclosures in the notes to the IFRS consolidated financial statements for the 2023 fiscal year are generally based on the same accounting policies used in the 2022 consolidated financial statements. Exceptions to this are the changes in international financial reporting under the IFRS described in **[note 5](#page-134-0)** that have been required to be applied by the Group since January 1, 2023. The accounting policies are explained in **[note 7.](#page-137-0)**\n\nThese consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by a resolution of the Board of Management of Deutsche Post AG dated February 16, 2024.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in euros (€). Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are given in millions of euros (€ million, €m).\n\n#### 2 Consolidated group\n\nThe consolidated group includes all companies controlled by Deutsche Post AG. Control exists if Deutsche Post AG has decisionmaking powers, is exposed, and has rights, to variable returns and is able to use its decision-making powers to affect the amount of the variable returns. The Group companies are consolidated from the date on which DHL Group is able to exercise control.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/129/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in a bold, red font, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller, red font. The background of the logo is yellow.\n\nWhen DHL Group holds less than the majority of voting rights, other contractual arrangements may result in the Group controlling the investee.\n\nDHL Sinotrans International Air Courier Ltd. (Sinotrans), China, is a significant company that has been consolidated despite DHL Group not having a majority of voting rights. Sinotrans provides domestic and international express delivery and transport services and has been assigned to the Express segment. The company is fully integrated into the global DHL network and operates exclusively for DHL Group. Due to the arrangements in the Network Agreement, DHL Group is able to prevail in decisions concerning Sinotrans' relevant activities. Sinotrans has therefore been consolidated although DHL Group holds no more than 50% of the company's share capital.\n\nThe complete list of the Group's shareholdings in accordance with Section 313(2), Nos. 1 to 6, and (3) HGB may be viewed in the **[list of shareholdings.](https://group.dhl.com/content/dam/deutschepostdhl/en/media-center/investors/documents/annual-reports/DHL-Group-list-of-shareholdings-2023-12-31.pdf)**\n\nThe number of companies consolidated with Deutsche Post AG is shown in the following table:\n\n#### CONSOLIDATED GROUP\n\n|                                                             | 2022 | 2023 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Number of fully consolidated companies (subsidiaries)       |      |      |\n| German                                                      | 83   | 81   |\n| Foreign                                                     | 711  | 690  |\n| Number of joint operations                                  |      |      |\n| German                                                      | 1    | 1    |\n| Foreign                                                     | 0    | 0    |\n| Number of investments accounted for using the equity method |      |      |\n| German                                                      | 1    | 1    |\n| Foreign                                                     | 16   | 17   |\n\nThe changes are primarily the result of mergers and liquidations of immaterial companies.\n\nSignificant acquisitions can be found in **note 2.1.**\n\n#### 2.1 Acquisitions in 2023\n\nThe following significant acquisitions occurred in the 2023 fiscal year:\n\n#### ACQUISITIONS\n\n| Name                                                       | Country              | Segment                    | Equity<br>interest<br>% | Acquisition date |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|\n| MNG Kargo (MNG KARGO) Yurtici ve Yurtdisi Tasimacilik A.S. | Turkey               | eCommerce                  | 100                     | Q4 2023          |\n| Danzas AEI Emirates LLC (renamed DHL Logistics LLG – SO)   | United Arab Emirates | Global Forwarding, Freight | 100                     | Q4 2023          |\n\n#### MNG KARGO\n\nAt the end of July 2023, DHL Group signed an agreement to acquire 100% of shares in the Turkish company MNG Kargo and its subsidiary. The purchase was completed on October 5, 2023, following approval by the Turkish antitrust authorities. MNG Kargo is one of the leading parcel carriers in Turkey and has a strong presence in the e-commerce segment. The acquisition complements the business portfolio of DHL Group and is to contribute to the company being able to benefit from growth potential in the Turkish market and continuing to strengthen its position in Turkey and in European markets.

The measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities and provisions assumed has not yet been completed due to time restrictions. The acquisition resulted in preliminary goodwill, which currently amounts to €267 million and cannot be deducted from tax. Current assets include trade receivables of €24 million.

The company had previously been managed together with the Investment Trading Group and recognized as a joint venture to which the equity method is applied. The company is now fully consolidated with 100% ownership of shares and has been renamed DHL Logistics LLC – SO (DHL Logistics). DHL Logistics is a specialist in logistics and transport services in Dubai and the northern Emirates. Thanks to this acquisition, the Global Forwarding, Freight division can continue driving its strategic goal and accelerate profitable growth in the Middle East and Africa region. The measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities and provisions assumed has not yet been completed due to time restrictions. The acquisition resulted in preliminary goodwill, which currently amounts to €259 million and cannot be deducted from tax. It is mainly attributable to the synergies and network effects expected in Dubai and the northern Emirates. Current assets include trade receivables of €41 million. There was a difference of €2 million between the gross amount and the carrying amount. The final purchase price allocation will be presented at a later date.\n\n#### PRELIMINARY OPENING BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 7, 2023 DHL LOGISTICS\n\n| €m                                          | Preliminary fair value |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Noncurrent assets                           | 7                      |\n| Current assets                              | 4                      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                   | 1                      |\n| <b>Assets</b>                               | <b>12</b>              |\n| Noncurrent provisions and liabilities       | -4                     |\n| Current provisions and liabilities          | -3                     |\n| <b>Equity and liabilities</b>               | <b>-7</b>              |\n| <b>Net assets</b>                           | <b>5</b>               |\n| Purchase price paid in cash                 | 18                     |\n| Fair value of the existing equity interest1 | 12                     |\n| <b>Goodwill</b>                             | <b>25</b>              |\n\n1 Also includes the gain from change in consolidation method in the amount of €114 million, which is recognized under net income from investments accounted for using the equity method.\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/131/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The companies are consolidated in consideration of noncontrolling interests. Due to this partnership, DHL Group can better respond to the specific needs of SMEs and smaller web shops, see **[2022 Annual Report, note 2 to](https://group.dhl.com/content/dam/deutschepostdhl/en/media-center/investors/documents/annual-reports/DPDHL-2022-Annual-Report.pdf#page=99)  [the consolidated financial statements.](https://group.dhl.com/content/dam/deutschepostdhl/en/media-center/investors/documents/annual-reports/DPDHL-2022-Annual-Report.pdf#page=99)** The purchase price allocation was finalized on June 30, 2023, and resulted in non-taxdeductible goodwill of €76 million, which is allocated to the Supply Chain segment. It is mainly attributable to the synergies and network effects expected from the e-commerce market in the Netherlands. There is also a call option to purchase the remaining 49% of shares that can be exercised at any time. The option is measured as a derivative at fair value through profit or loss. The customer relationships are amortized over a period of ten years and the brand name over a period of five years. The software has a useful life of five years. Current assets include trade receivables of €16 million. There was no difference between the gross amount and the carrying amount.\n\n| FINAL OPENING BALANCE AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2022 |                 |            | MONTA GROUP |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------|-------------|\n| €m                                           | Carrying amount | Adjustment | Fair value  |\n| Noncurrent assets                            | 62              | 41         | 103         |\n| Software                                     |                 | 18         |             |\n| Customer relationships                       |                 | 17         |             |\n| Brand name                                   |                 | 6          |             |\n| Current assets                               | 18              | -          | 18          |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                    | 3               | -          | 3           |\n| ASSETS                                       | 83              | 41         | 124         |\n| Noncurrent provisions and liabilities        | -51             | -10        | -61         |\n| Deferred taxes                               |                 | -10        |             |\n| Current provisions and liabilities           | -31             | -          | -31         |\n| EQUITY AND LIABILITIES                       | -82             | -10        | -93         |\n| Net assets                                   | 1               | 31         | 32          |\n| Purchase price paid in cash                  | 103             | 0          | 103         |\n| Difference                                   | 102             | -31        | 71          |\n| Less fair value of the option                | 10              | -          | 10          |\n| Noncontrolling interests                     | 0               | 15         | 15          |\n| Goodwill                                     | 92              | -16        | 76          |\n\n| €m                                                       | MNG Kargo | DHL Logistics |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------|\n| Group revenue since consolidation                        | 66        | 1             |\n| Group EBIT since consolidation                           | 8         |               |\n| Transaction costs (reported in other operating expenses) | 01        | 0             |\n\n1 Rounded below €1 million.\n\nIf the companies had already been fully consolidated as of January 1, 2023, MNG Kargo would have additionally generated revenue of €198 million and EBIT of €23 million and DHL Logistics revenue of €223 million and EBIT of €22 million.\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, a total of €452 million was paid for the subsidiaries acquired during the fiscal year. The purchase prices of the acquired companies were paid by transferring cash and cash equivalents.\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-132-0\"></span>Image /page/132/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the DHL part, also in red, is the word 'Group' in a smaller, less bold font. The background is yellow.\n\nInvestments in companies accounted for using the equity method amounted to €34 million in the 2023 fiscal year.\n\n#### 2.2 Disposal and deconsolidation effects\n\nThere were no material disposals of shareholdings in the 2023 fiscal year.\n\n#### 2.3 Joint operations\n\nJoint operations are consolidated on a pro rata basis in accordance with IFRS 11.\n\nAerologic GmbH (Aerologic), Germany, a cargo airline based in Schkeuditz, is the only joint operation in this regard. Aerologic has been assigned to the Express segment. It was jointly established by Lufthansa Cargo AG and Deutsche Post Beteiligungen Holding GmbH, which each hold 50% of its capital and voting rights. Aerologic's shareholders are simultaneously its customers, giving them access to its freight aircraft capacity. Aerologic mainly serves the DHL Express network from Monday to Friday and flies for the Lufthansa Cargo network on weekends. Individual aircraft are also used exclusively by the two respective shareholders. In contrast to its capital and voting rights, the company's assets and liabilities, as well as its income and expenses, are allocated based on this user relationship.\n\n#### 3 Significant transactions\n\nIn addition to the business combinations mentioned under **[note 2,](#page-128-0)** the following significant transactions occurred in the 2023 fiscal year:\n\n#### Issue of a new bond\n\nOn June 26, 2023, Deutsche Post AG placed its first sustainability-linked bond with an issue volume of €500 million and a term through 2033. The interest rate of the bond is coupled with the medium-term target of significantly reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030. The cash inflow and the liability were recognized on July 3, 2023. The ten-year term ends on July 3, 2033. The bond has a fixed interest rate of 3.375% per year. However, if one of the targets set for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for 2030 is not reached, the coupon to be paid increases beginning in the year 2031.The proceeds will primarily be used for general company purposes, including the refinancing of existing financial liabilities, **[note 39.](#page-189-0)**\n\n#### **Share buyback of up to €4 billion**\n\nBy a Board of Management resolution dated February 14, 2023, the current share buyback program was expanded so that a total of up to 105 million treasury shares can be purchased at a price of now up to €3 billion through to the end of 2024. The purposes remain unaffected, which means the repurchased shares will either be retired, used to service long-term executive remuneration plans and any future employee participation programs or used to meet potential obligations if rights accruing under the 2017/2025 convertible bond are exercised. The repurchase via the stock exchange started on April 8, 2022, and will end no later than in December 2024. For the first two tranches, the share buyback program was based on the authorization resolved by the company's Annual General Meeting on May 6, 2021. The third and fourth tranches were carried out based on the authorization resolved by the company's Annual General Meeting on May 4, 2023, **[note 33](#page-175-0) [and 34.](#page-178-0)**\n\nOn February 12, 2024, the Board of Management resolved to expand the current share buyback program so that a total of up to 130 million treasury shares are to be purchased at a price of now up to €4 billion through the end of 2025. The intended uses remain unaffected.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-133-0\"></span>Image /page/133/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

With the final purchase price allocation (PPA) for Monta Group, adjustments were made to the balance sheet items specified below, which were accounted for in the opening balance and led to a corresponding adjusted presentation in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.\n\nMoreover, for improved presentation in the balance sheet, accounts of a financial nature were reclassified from other assets and other liabilities to financial assets and financial liabilities, respectively (IFRS 7). This enables the amounts presented in the table titled \"Reconciliation to carrying amounts in accordance with IFRS 9\" to be allocated to the carrying amounts, **note 43.**\n\n| BALANCE SHEET                     |        |        |            |                 |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|-----------------|\n| €m                                | Reason | Amount | Adjustment | Adjusted amount |\n| December 31, 2022                 |        |        |            |                 |\n| Intangible assets                 | PPA    | 14,096 | 25         | 14,121          |\n| Current financial assets          | IFRS 7 | 1,355  | 444        | 1,799           |\n| Other current assets              | IFRS 7 | 3,551  | –444       | 3,107           |\n| Current income tax assets         |        | 283    | 173        | 456             |\n| Noncontrolling interests          | PPA    | 467    | 15         | 482             |\n| Deferred tax liabilities          | PPA    | 336    | 10         | 346             |\n| Noncurrent financial liabilities  | IFRS 7 | 17,659 | 24         | 17,683          |\n| Other noncurrent liabilities      | IFRS 7 | 321    | –24        | 297             |\n| Noncurrent income tax liabilities |        | 0      | 331        | 331             |\n| Current financial liabilities     | IFRS 7 | 4,159  | 324        | 4,483           |\n| Other current liabilities         | IFRS 7 | 6,512  | –324       | 6,188           |\n| Current income tax liabilities    |        | 659    | –158       | 501             |\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-134-0\"></span>Image /page/134/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The<br>amendment of IAS 1 explains and requires that a disclosure of \"material\" rather than \"significant\" accounting policies<br>must be made. To support this approach, the amendments to IFRS Practice Statement 2 demonstrate the application<br>of the concept of materiality to accounting policy disclosures. The consolidated financial statements were not<br>affected.                                                                    |\n| Amendments to IAS 8, Definition of<br>Accounting Estimates                                                   | The amendments introduced a new definition of accounting estimates and explain how entities should distinguish<br>changes in accounting estimates from changes in accounting policies. The consolidated financial statements were not<br>affected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Amendments to IAS 12, Deferred Tax<br>Related to Assets and Liabilities<br>Arising from a Single Transaction | The amendment limits the exemption from the (initial) recognition of deferred tax in that it no longer applies to<br>transactions for which entities recognize both an asset and a liability (e.g., leases and decommissioning obligations).<br>Going forward, deferred tax assets and liabilities must be recognized for such transactions to the extent that equal<br>amounts of deductible and taxable temporary differences arise. The consolidated financial statements were not<br>affected.                                                                   |\n| Amendments to IAS 12, International<br>Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules                                   | The amendments to IAS 12 are carried out in conjunction with the regulations for a global minimum tax. DHL Group<br>falls under the scope of application of the OECD model provisions for pillar two. The legal provisions for pillar two had<br>only been implemented in some jurisdictions, so the regulations for the global minimum tax were not yet applicable<br>throughout the Group in the year under review. Beginning with the 2024 fiscal year, the Group expects an increase in<br>current taxes by an amount in the low double-digit millions of euros. |\n| IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts,<br>including amendments to IFRS 17                                             | The standard replaces IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts, and outlines the principles governing the recognition,<br>measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts. The objective of the standard is to ensure that the<br>reporting entity provides relevant information that faithfully represents the effect that insurance contracts have on an<br>entity's net assets, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. IFRS 17 was not applied for reasons of<br>materiality.                                                               |\n| Amendments to IFRS 17, First-Time<br>Adoption of IFRS 17, and IFRS 9,<br>Comparative Information             | The narrow-scope amendment to IFRS 17 permits entities to apply an optional classification overlay, if certain<br>conditions are met, with the aim of providing useful comparative information on financial instruments for 2022. The<br>amendment was issued because the initial application of IFRS 9 is not required to be retroactive, whereas this is the<br>case for IFRS 17. This can result in accounting mismatches for financial instruments. There were no effects.                                                                                       |\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/135/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of a stylized, bold font with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the DHL part of the logo, the word \"Group\" is written in red.\n\n#### 6 Currency translation\n\nThe financial statements of consolidated companies prepared in foreign currencies are translated into euros (€) in accordance with IAS 21 using the functional currency method. The functional currency of foreign companies is determined by the primary economic environment in which they mainly generate and use cash. Within the Group, the functional currency is predominantly the local currency. In the consolidated financial statements, assets and liabilities are therefore translated at the closing rates, while periodic income and expenses are generally translated at an average price that results from the monthly prices. The resulting currency translation differences are recognized in other comprehensive income. In the 2023 fiscal year, currency translation differences amounting to €–586 million (previous year: €153 million) were recognized in other comprehensive income, see the **[statement of](https://dhl-reporting-hub-next.ryze-cloud.de/fy-2023/en/consolidated-financial-statements/statement-of-comprehensive-income/)  [comprehensive income.](https://dhl-reporting-hub-next.ryze-cloud.de/fy-2023/en/consolidated-financial-statements/statement-of-comprehensive-income/)**\n\nGoodwill arising from business combinations after January 1, 2005, is treated as an asset of the acquired company and therefore carried in the functional currency of the acquired company. Goodwill that arose for foreign subsidiaries as part of acquisition accounting prior to 2005 is carried in euros at historical cost less the accumulated amortization through to the end of 2004.\n\nThe exchange rates for the currencies that are significant for the Group were as follows:\n\n#### CURRENCY\n\n|     |                | Closing rates   |                 | Average rates   |                 |\n|-----|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|     | Country        | 2022<br>EUR 1 = | 2023<br>EUR 1 = | 2022<br>EUR 1 = | 2023<br>EUR 1 = |\n| AUD | Australia      | 1.5723          | 1.6294          | 1.5157          | 1.6351          |\n| CNY | China          | 7.3823          | 7.8843          | 7.0875          | 7.6960          |\n| GBP | United Kingdom | 0.8866          | 0.8697          | 0.8549          | 0.8689          |\n| HKD | Hong Kong      | 8.3317          | 8.6475          | 8.2241          | 8.4813          |\n| INR | India          | 88.2947         | 92.0797         | 82.7138         | 89.4486         |\n| JPY | Japan          | 140.8789        | 156.6571        | 138.1186        | 153.2537        |\n| SEK | Sweden         | 11.1005         | 11.0919         | 10.6552         | 11.4828         |\n| USD | United States  | 1.0686          | 1.1070          | 1.0502          | 1.0830          |\n\nThe carrying amounts of nonmonetary assets recognized at significant consolidated companies operating in hyperinflationary economies are generally indexed in accordance with IAS 29 and thus reflect the current purchasing power as of the reporting date. Turkey has met the criteria regarding a cumulative inflation rate of more than 100% over a period of three years since the beginning of 2022. Accounting pursuant to IAS 29 was applied for the relevant companies. Upon application, the adjustments to the carrying amounts of nonmonetary assets and liabilities based on the general price index were recognized in the financial result, **[note 18.](#page-162-0)** The consumer price index of the Turkish Statistical Institute was used for the adjustment of the purchasing power effects. As of January 1, 2023, this figure was 1,128 basis points and had increased to 1,859 basis points as of December 31, 2023.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 21, the monetary values such as receivables and liabilities in the financial statements of consolidated companies that have been prepared in local currencies are translated at the closing rate as of the reporting date. Currency translation differences are recognized in other operating income and expenses in the income statement. In the 2023 fiscal year, income of €452 million (previous year: €696 million) and expenses of €433 million (previous year: €673 million) resulted from currency translation differences. In contrast, currency translation differences relating to net investments in a foreign operation are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-137-0\"></span>Image /page/137/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### 7 Accounting policies\n\nUniform accounting policies are applied to the annual financial statements of the entities included in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for items that are required to be recognized at their fair value.\n\n#### Revenue and expense recognition\n\nDHL Group's normal business operations consist of the provision of logistics services comprising express delivery, freight transport, supply chain management, e-commerce solutions and letter and parcel dispatch in Germany. All income relating to normal business operations is recognized as revenue in the income statement. All other income is reported as other operating income.\n\nRevenue is recognized when control over the goods or services transfers to the customer, i.e., when the customer has the ability to control the use of the transferred goods or services provided and generally derive their remaining benefits. There must be a contract with enforceable rights and obligations and, among other things, the receipt of consideration must be likely, taking into account the customer's credit quality. Revenue corresponds to the transaction price to which the Group is expected to be entitled. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price when it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur. Generally, the Group does not have contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods and/or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. Accordingly, the promised consideration is not adjusted for the time value of money. For each performance obligation, revenue is either recognized at a point in time or over time. Performance progress is generally determined on the basis of the ratio of completed to still-outstanding transport duration.\n\nThe revenue generated by providing other logistics services is recognized in the reporting period in which the service was rendered.\n\nWhenever third parties are involved in the performance of a service, a distinction must be drawn between the principal and agent. If DHL Group serves as the principal, then the gross amount of revenue is recognized. If the Group acts as the agent, the net amount is recognized. The transaction price for this specific service is limited to the amount of the commission to be received. DHL Group is generally the principal when transport services are provided.\n\nOperating expenses are recognized in profit or loss when the service is utilized or when the expenses are incurred.\n\n#### Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets, which comprise internally generated and purchased intangible assets and purchased goodwill, are measured at amortized cost.\n\nInternally generated intangible assets are recognized at cost if it is probable that their production will generate an inflow of future economic benefits and the costs can be reliably measured. In the Group, this concerns internally developed software. If the criteria for capitalization are not met, the expenses are recognized immediately in income in the year in which they are incurred. In addition to direct costs, the production cost of internally developed software includes an appropriate share of allocable production overhead costs. Any borrowing costs incurred for qualifying assets are included in the production cost. Value-added tax arising in conjunction with the acquisition or production of intangible assets is included in the cost to the extent that it cannot be deducted as input tax.\n\nIntangible assets (excluding goodwill) are amortized using the straight-line method over their useful lives. Impairment losses are recognized in accordance with the principles described in the **[impairment](https://dhl-reporting-hub-next.ryze-cloud.de/fy-2023/en/consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements-of-deutsche-post-ag/basis-of-preparation/ bzw. gleiche Seite: Impairment losses | id=\"headline-12074\")** section. The useful lives of significant intangible assets are as follows:\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/138/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters \"DHL\" is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### USEFUL LIVES\n\n|                        | Years    |\n|------------------------|----------|\n| Software               | 5 to 10  |\n| Licenses               | up to 5  |\n| Customer relationships | up to 20 |\n\n1 The useful lives indicated represent maximum amounts specified by the Group. The actual useful lives may be shorter due to contractual arrangements or other specific factors such as time and location.\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or whenever there are indications of impairment. This includes goodwill almost exclusively. Impairment testing is carried out in accordance with the principles described in the **[impairment](https://dhl-reporting-hub-next.ryze-cloud.de/fy-2023/en/consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements-of-deutsche-post-ag/basis-of-preparation/ bzw. gleiche Seite: Impairment losses | id=\"headline-12074\")** section.\n\n#### Emissions certificates\n\nCO2 emissions certificates and certificates and/or proof of generation for electricity from renewable energies are recognized as intangible assets and reported under other assets. Both purchased as well as freely allocated rights are recognized at cost; no depreciation is carried out.\n\nA provision for the obligation to submit CO2 emissions certificates to the responsible authorities in the EU and the United Kingdom is recognized at the carrying amount of the CO2 emissions certificates capitalized for this purpose. If a portion of the obligation is not covered by existing certificates, the provision for this is recognized at the market price of the emissions certificates on the reporting date.\n\n#### Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is carried at cost, reduced by accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. In addition to direct costs, production cost includes an appropriate share of allocable production overhead costs. Borrowing costs that can be allocated directly to the purchase, construction or manufacture of property, plant and equipment are capitalized. Value-added tax arising in conjunction with the acquisition or production of items of property, plant or equipment is included in the cost to the extent that it cannot be deducted as input tax. Depreciation is charged using the straight-line method. Significant portions of property, plant and equipment that have different useful lives are recognized and depreciated separately. If costs are incurred in conjunction with regular comprehensive maintenance work (e.g., refurbishment of aircraft and major repairs of engines), these costs are recognized as a separate component, provided that they meet the criteria for this recognition. The estimated useful lives applied to the major asset classes are presented in the table below:\n\n#### USEFUL LIVES\n\n|                                       | Years1   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------|\n| Buildings                             | 20 to 50 |\n| Technical equipment and machinery     | 10 to 20 |\n| Aircraft                              | 15 to 25 |\n| IT equipment                          | 4 to 10  |\n| Transport equipment and vehicle fleet | 5 to 20  |\n| Other operating and office equipment  | 7 to 10  |\n\n1 The useful lives indicated represent maximum amounts specified by the Group. The actual useful lives may be shorter due to contractual arrangements or other specific factors such as time and location.\n\nIf there are indications of impairment, an impairment test must be carried out; see the **[impairment](https://dhl-reporting-hub-next.ryze-cloud.de/fy-2023/en/consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements-of-deutsche-post-ag/basis-of-preparation/ bzw. gleiche Seite: Impairment losses | id=\"headline-12074\")** section.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/139/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Impairment losses\n\nAs of each reporting date, the carrying amounts of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and investment property are reviewed for indications of impairment. If there are any such indications, an impairment test is carried out. This is done by determining the recoverable amount of the relevant asset and comparing it with the carrying amount.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 36, the recoverable amount is the asset's fair value less costs to sell or its value in use (present value of the pretax free cash flows expected to be derived from the asset in the future), whichever is higher. The discount rate used for the value in use is a pretax rate of interest reflecting current market conditions. If the recoverable amount cannot be determined for an individual asset, the recoverable amount is determined for the smallest identifiable group of assets to which the asset in question can be allocated and that independently generates cash flows (cash generating unit – CGU). If the recoverable amount of an asset is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized immediately in respect of the asset. If it can be determined, the fair value or value in use of the individual assets represents their minimum carrying amount. If, after an impairment loss has been recognized, a higher recoverable amount is determined for the asset or the CGU at a later date, the impairment loss is reversed up to a carrying amount that does not exceed the recoverable amount. The increased carrying amount attributable to the reversal of the impairment loss is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization or depreciation) if no impairment loss had been recognized in the past. The reversal of the impairment loss is recognized in the income statement. Impairment losses recognized in respect of goodwill may not be reversed. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost, less any cumulative adjustments from impairment losses. Purchased goodwill is therefore not amortized and instead is tested for impairment annually in accordance with IAS 36, regardless of whether any indication of possible impairment exists, as in the case of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. In addition, the obligation remains to conduct an impairment test if there is any indication of impairment. Goodwill resulting from company acquisitions is allocated to the CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. These groups represent the lowest reporting level at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The carrying amount of a CGU to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. Where impairment losses are recognized in connection with a CGU to which goodwill has been allocated, the existing carrying amount of the goodwill is reduced first. If the amount of the impairment loss exceeds the carrying amount of the goodwill, the difference is generally allocated proportionally to the remaining assets in the CGU.\n\n#### Leases\n\nA lease is a contract in which the right to use an asset (the leased asset) is granted for an agreed-upon period in return for compensation.\n\n#### Lessee\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 16, the Group as lessee has recognized at present value assets for the right of use received and liabilities for the payment obligations entered into for all leases in the balance sheet. Lease liabilities include the following lease payments:\n\n- fixed payments, less lease incentives offered by the lessor;\n- variable payments linked to an index or interest rate;\n- expected residual payments from residual-value guarantees;\n- the exercise price of call options when exercise is estimated to be sufficiently likely; and\n- contractual penalties for the termination of a lease if the lease term reflects the exercise of a termination option.\n\nLease payments are discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease to the extent that this can be determined. Otherwise, they are discounted at the incremental borrowing rate of the respective lessee.\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/140/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in a bold, red font, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller, red font. The background of the logo is yellow.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost, which comprises the following:\n\n- lease liability;\n- lease payments made at or prior to delivery, less lease incentives received;\n- initial direct costs and restoration obligations.\n\nRight-of-use assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost. They are depreciated over the term of the lease using the straight-line method.\n\nThe Group makes use of the relief options provided for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases (shorter than 12 months) and expenses the payments in the income statement using the straight-line method. Additionally, the requirements do not apply to leases of intangible assets. The Group also exercises the option available for contracts comprising both lease and nonlease components to not separate these components, except in the case of real estate and aircraft leases. In addition, under IFRS 8, intra-Group leases – in line with internal management – are generally presented as operating leases in segment reporting.\n\nExtension and termination options exist for a number of leases, particularly for real estate. Such contract terms offer the Group the greatest possible flexibility in doing business. In determining lease terms, all facts and circumstances offering economic incentives for exercising extension options or not exercising termination options are taken into account. Changes due to the exercise or nonexercise of such options are considered in determining the lease term only if they are sufficiently probable.\n\n#### Lessor\n\nFor operating leases, the Group reports the leased asset at amortized cost as an asset under property, plant and equipment where it is the lessor. The lease payments received in the period are recognized under other operating income or revenue if they belong to ordinary business activities.\n\nWhere the Group is the lessor in a finance lease, it recognizes the assets as lease receivables in the amount of the net investment in the balance sheet. Certain subleases embedded in customer contracts are still reported as finance leases at the lessor.\n\n#### Investments accounted for using the equity method\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method cover associates and joint ventures. These are recognized using the equity method in accordance with IAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. Based on the cost of acquisition at the time of purchase of the investments, the carrying amount of the investment is increased or reduced annually to reflect the share of earnings, dividends distributed and other changes in the equity of the associates and joint ventures attributable to the investments of Deutsche Post AG or its consolidated subsidiaries. An impairment loss is recognized on investments accounted for using the equity method, including the goodwill in the carrying amount of the investment, if the recoverable amount falls below the carrying amount. Gains and losses from the disposal of investments accounted for using the equity method are recognized in net income/expenses from investments accounted for using the equity method, as are impairments and reversals of impairments.\n\n#### Financial instruments\n\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets include, in particular, cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, originated loans and other financial receivables, as well as derivative financial assets. Financial liabilities include contractual obligations to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity. These mainly comprise trade payables, liabilities to banks, liabilities arising from bonds and leases, and derivative financial liabilities.\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/141/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of three horizontal lines on the left and the letters DHL on the right. The word \"Group\" is in red and is located below the DHL part of the logo.\n\n#### Measurement\n\nThe Group measures financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value plus the transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of these financial assets and financial liabilities on initial recognition if the financial assets and financial liabilities are not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. The transaction costs of assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognized as expenses. For financial liabilities measured according to the fair value option, the part of the change in fair value resulting from changes in the Group's own credit risk is recognized in other comprehensive income rather than in the income statement.\n\n#### Classification\n\nFinancial assets are classified in the measurement categories below. The classification of debt instruments depends on the business model used to manage the financial assets and their contractual cash flows.\n\n#### Debt instruments at amortized cost\n\nDebt instruments that are assigned to the \"hold to collect contractual cash flows\" business model and whose cash flows exclusively comprise interest and principal are measured and recognized at amortized cost. Interest income from these financial assets is reported in financial income using the effective interest method.\n\n#### Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)\n\nDebt instruments assigned to the \"hold to collect and sell\" business model must be measured at fair value plus transaction costs. As a result, changes in the carrying amount due to exchange rate gains and losses, impairment gains and losses, and interest income calculated using the effective interest method are recognized in the income statement. These amounts correspond to the amounts that would have been recognized in the income statement if they had been measured at amortized cost. All other changes of the carrying amount are recognized in other comprehensive income. When the debt instruments are derecognized, the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are to be reclassified to the income statement.\n\n#### **Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)**\n\nDebt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments acquired to maximize their cash flows by selling them in the short to medium term are assigned to the \"sell\" business model. They are measured at fair value. The resulting measurement gains and losses are reported in the income statement.\n\n#### Equity instruments classified as FVTOCI\n\nPursuant to IFRS 9, equity instruments are to be recognized at their fair value and can be assigned to the FVTOCI or FVTPL measurement categories. For strategic reasons, most of the equity instruments that the Group invests in are then assigned to the FVTOCI category. The effects of any change in the fair value of equity instruments of the FVTOCI category are recognized in other comprehensive income. Dividends are recognized in other operating income in the income statement. If the equity instruments of the FVTOCI category are sold, the fair value changes recognized in equity are to be transferred to other reserves. For equity instruments assigned to the FVTPL category, the fair value changes are to be reported immediately in the income statement. Dividends are also recognized in other income in the income statement.\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/142/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters. There are three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red. The background of the logo is yellow.\n\n#### Impairment losses\n\nThe Group makes a forward-looking assessment of the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments (expectedcredit-loss model).\n\nExpected credit loss (ECL) within the meaning of IFRS 9 is an estimate of credit loss over the expected lifetime of a financial asset accounted for at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), weighted for the probability of default. A credit loss is the difference between the contractual cash flows to which the Group is entitled and the cash flows expected by the Group. The expected credit loss takes into account the amount and timing of payments. Accordingly, a credit loss may also occur if the Group expects payment to be made in full, but later than the contractually agreed-upon date.\n\nThe Group distinguishes between the following types of financial assets that are subject to the ECL model: debt instruments measured at amortized cost and debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, on the one hand, and trade receivables and contract assets, on the other. Cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the IFRS 9 impairment rules. The identified impairment loss for the latter is immaterial.\n\nECL is generally measured at the level of individual items; in exceptional cases, such as groups of receivables with the same credit risk characteristics, it is measured collectively at portfolio level. The standard stipulates the three-stage general approach to determining credit loss for this process.\n\nIn accordance with the three-stage model, debt instruments measured at amortized cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income are initially recognized in Stage 1. The expected credit loss is equal to the loss that may occur due to possible default events in the 12 months following the reporting date. Financial assets that have experienced a significant increase in counterparty credit risk since initial recognition are transferred from Stage 1 to Stage 2. A significant increase includes situations in which debtors are no longer able to meet their payment obligations at short notice or when it appears that the debtor has experienced an actual or expected deterioration in business performance. The credit risk can then be measured using the probability of default (PD) over the instrument's lifetime (lifetime PD). The impairment loss is equivalent to the loss that may occur due to possible default events during the remaining term of the financial asset. Assets must be transferred from Stage 1 to Stage 2 when the contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. In cases where contractual payments from a debt instrument are more than 90 days past due, there is revocable reason to believe that there is objective evidence of a credit loss because the debtor is experiencing significant financial difficulties. The debt instrument is then to be transferred to Stage 3.\n\nListed debt instruments measured at amortized cost are assigned to Stage 1 of the three-stage model if an investment-grade rating exists from at least one major rating agency. The impairment loss recognized in the period is equal to the loss that may occur due to possible default events in the twelve months following the reporting date.\n\nTrade receivables and contract assets are generally short term in nature and contain no significant financing components. According to the simplified impairment approach in IFRS 9, a loss allowance in an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses must be recognized for all instruments, regardless of their credit quality. The Group calculates the expected credit loss using impairment tables for the individual divisions. The loss estimate, documented by way of loss rates, encompasses all of the available information, including historical data, current economic conditions and reliable forecasts of future economic conditions (macroeconomic factors).\n\nImpairment losses are offset against gains on the reversal of impairment losses. Further details are presented in **[note 43.](#page-195-0)** \n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/143/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Derivatives and hedges\n\nThe Group began to apply the IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirements as of January 1, 2020. Derivative hedging instruments are used to minimize variations in earnings due to payments in foreign currencies, variable-rate borrowing and for planned commodity purchases. The gains and losses from the underlying and hedging transactions are recognized simultaneously in total comprehensive income (hedge accounting). The Group has designated cash flow hedges due to the existing risks.\n\nA cash flow hedge hedges the fluctuations in future cash flows from recognized assets and liabilities (in the case of interest rate risks), highly probable forecast transactions as well as unrecognized firm commitments that entail a currency risk. The effective portion of a cash flow hedge designated as a hedge is recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve in other comprehensive income. If the option (forward element and currency basis spreads) is applied to the cost of hedging recognition, or the fair value of an option has not been designated, effective changes in value from the nondesignated portions are recognized in the cost of hedging reserve as a component of the hedging reserve in other comprehensive income. IFRS 9 allows the alternative of designating either the full or the intrinsic value of an option as a hedging instrument. The fair value of an option is considered the cost of the hedge. If only the intrinsic value of an option is designated as a hedging instrument, changes to the fair value of the option must be recognized in other comprehensive income as cost of hedging in the cost of hedging reserve and reclassified on a reasonable basis when the hedged item occurs. Similar to the intrinsic value of an option, it is permissible to only designate the spot component of a forward transaction as a hedging instrument. In this case, there is an option to also recognize the effective and cumulative fair value changes of the forward component and the foreign-currency spread in the cost of hedging reserve. Ineffective portions resulting from changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognized directly in income. The gains and losses generated by the hedging transactions are initially recognized in equity and are then reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the financial asset acquired or financial liability assumed affects profit or loss. If a hedge of a firm commitment subsequently results in the recognition of a nonfinancial asset, the gains and losses recognized directly in equity are included in the initial carrying amount of the asset (basis adjustment).\n\nNet investment hedges in foreign entities are treated in the same way as cash flow hedges. The gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income, while the gain or loss attributable to the ineffective portion is recognized directly in the income statement. The gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income remain there until the disposal or partial disposal, or an impairment loss, of the net investment.\n\n#### Recognition and derecognition\n\nRegular-way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized as of the settlement date, with the exception of derivatives, in particular. A financial asset is derecognized when the rights to receive the cash flows from the asset have expired or have been transferred, and the Group has transferred essentially all risks and opportunities of ownership. Financial liabilities are derecognized if the payment obligations arising from them have expired.\n\n#### Power purchase agreements\n\nDHL Group concludes long-term contracts for the provision of electricity from renewable sources (e.g., wind and solar power) to reduce its carbon footprint (power purchase agreements) and to hedge against fluctuating prices. If the contracts are concluded for the company's own use, they are treated as executory contracts (own-use exemption) and not accounted for as derivatives.\n\n#### Offsetting\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset on the basis of netting agreements (master netting arrangements) only if there is an enforceable right of offset and settlement on a net basis is intended as of the reporting date.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/144/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of three stylized letters with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nIf the right of offset is not enforceable in the normal course of business, the financial assets and liabilities are recognized in the balance sheet at their gross amounts as of the reporting date. The master netting arrangement then creates only a conditional right of offset.\n\n#### Investment property\n\nIn accordance with IAS 40, investment property is property held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for use in the supply of services, for administrative purposes or for sale in the normal course of the company's business. It is measured in accordance with the cost model. Depreciable investment property is depreciated over a period of between 20 and 50 years using the straight-line method. The fair value is determined on the basis of expert opinions. Impairment losses are recognized in accordance with the principles described in the **[impairment](https://dhl-reporting-hub-next.ryze-cloud.de/fy-2023/en/consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements-of-deutsche-post-ag/basis-of-preparation/ bzw. gleiche Seite: Impairment losses | id=\"headline-12074\")** section.\n\n#### Inventories\n\nInventories are assets that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business, are in the process of production or are consumed in the production process or in the rendering of services. They are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Impairment losses are charged for obsolete inventories and slow-moving goods.\n\n#### Government grants\n\nIn accordance with IAS 20, government grants are recognized at their fair value only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with and that the grants will be received. The grants are reported in the income statement and are generally recognized as income over the periods in which the costs they are intended to compensate for are incurred. Where the grants relate to the purchase or production of assets, they are reported as deferred income and recognized in the income statement over the useful lives of the assets. Such deferred income is presented in other operating income.\n\n#### Assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale\n\nAssets held for sale are assets available for sale in their present condition and whose sale is highly probable. The sale must be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year of the date of classification. Assets held for sale may consist of individual noncurrent assets, groups of assets (disposal groups), components of an entity or a subsidiary acquired exclusively for resale (discontinued operations). Liabilities intended to be disposed of together with the assets in a single transaction form part of the disposal group or discontinued operation and are also reported separately as liabilities associated with assets held for sale. Assets held for sale are no longer depreciated or amortized, but are recognized at the lower of their fair value less costs to sell and the carrying amount. Gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of individual noncurrent assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale are reported in profit or loss from continuing operations until the final date of disposal. Gains and losses arising from the measurement at fair value less costs to sell of discontinued operations classified as held for sale are reported in profit or loss from discontinued operations. This also applies to the profit or loss from operations and the gain or loss on disposal of these components of an entity.\n\n#### Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash, demand deposits and other short-term liquid financial assets with an original maturity of up to three months; they are measured at amortized cost. Overdraft facilities used are recognized in the balance sheet as amounts due to banks.\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/145/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Noncontrolling interests\n\nNoncontrolling interests are the proportionate minority interests in the equity of subsidiaries and are recognized at their carrying amount. If an interest is acquired from, or sold to, other shareholders without affecting the existing control relationship, this is presented as an equity transaction. The difference between the proportionate net assets acquired from, or sold to, other shareholders and the purchase price is recognized in other comprehensive income. If noncontrolling interests are increased by the proportionate net assets, no goodwill is allocated to the proportionate net assets.\n\n#### Share-based payments to executives\n\nEquity-settled share-based payment transactions are measured at fair value as of the grant date. The fair value of the obligation is recognized in staff costs over the vesting period. The fair value of equity-settled share-based payment transactions is determined using internationally recognized valuation techniques.\n\nCash-settled share-based payments (stock appreciation rights, SARs) are measured on the basis of an option pricing model in accordance with IFRS 2. The stock appreciation rights are measured on each reporting date and on the settlement date. The amount determined for stock appreciation rights that will probably be exercised is recognized pro rata in income under staff costs, to reflect the services rendered as consideration during the vesting period (lockup period). A provision is recognized for the same amount. Changes in value due to share price movements occurring after the grant date are recognized as other finance costs in net finance costs.\n\n#### Retirement benefit plans\n\nThere are arrangements (plans) in many countries under which the Group grants post-employment benefits to its employees. These benefits include pensions, lump-sum payments on retirement and other post-employment benefits and are referred to in these disclosures as retirement benefits, pensions and similar benefits, or pensions. A distinction must be made between defined benefit and defined contribution plans.\n\n#### The Group's defined benefit retirement plan\n\nDefined benefit obligations are measured using the projected unit credit method prescribed by IAS 19. This involves making certain actuarial assumptions. Most of the defined benefit retirement plans are at least partly funded via external plan assets. The remaining net liabilities are funded by provisions for pensions and similar obligations; net assets are presented separately as pension assets. Where necessary, an asset ceiling must be applied when recognizing pension assets. With regard to the cost components, the service cost is recognized in staff costs, net interest cost in net finance costs and the remeasurements outside the income statement in other comprehensive income. Any rights to reimbursement are reported separately in financial assets.\n\n#### Defined contribution retirement plans for civil-servant employees in Germany\n\nIn accordance with statutory provisions, Deutsche Post AG pays contributions for civil-servant employees in Germany to retirement plans that are defined contribution retirement plans for the company. These contributions are recognized in staff costs.\n\nUnder the provisions of the *Gesetz zum Personalrecht der Beschäftigten der früheren Deutschen Bundespost* (PostPersRG – Former Deutsche Bundespost Employees Act), Deutsche Post AG provides retirement benefits and assistance benefits through the *Postbeamtenversorgungskasse* (PVK – Postal civil-servant pension fund) at the *Bundesanstalt für Post und Telekommunikation* (BAnst PT – German federal post and telecommunications agency) to retired employees or their surviving dependents who are entitled to benefits on the basis of a civil-service appointment. The amount of Deutsche Post AG's payment obligations is governed by Section 16 PostPersRG. This act obliges Deutsche Post AG to pay into the PVK an annual contribution of 33% of the gross compensation of its active civil servants and the notional gross compensation of civil servants on leave of absence who are eligible for a pension.\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/146/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font size, also in red. The background of the image is yellow.\n\nUnder Section 16 PostPersRG, the federal government makes good the difference between the current payment obligations of the PVK, on the one hand, and the funding companies' current contributions or other return on assets, on the other, and guarantees that the PVK is able to meet the obligations it has assumed in respect of its funding companies at all time. Insofar as the federal government makes payments to the PVK under the terms of this guarantee, it cannot claim reimbursement from Deutsche Post AG.\n\n#### Defined contribution retirement plans for the Group's hourly workers and salaried employees\n\nDefined contribution retirement plans are in place for the Group's hourly workers and salaried employees, particularly in the United Kingdom, the United States and the Netherlands. The contributions to these plans are also reported in staff costs.\n\nThis also includes contributions to certain multiemployer plans that are basically defined benefit plans, especially in the United States and the Netherlands. However, the relevant institutions do not provide the participating companies with sufficient information to use defined benefit accounting. The plans are therefore accounted for as if they were defined contribution plans.\n\nRegarding these multiemployer plans in the United States, contributions are made based on collective agreements between the employer and the local union, with the involvement of the pension fund. There is no employer liability to any of the plans beyond the bargained contribution rates except in the event of a withdrawal meeting specified criteria, which could then include a liability for other entities' obligations as governed by US federal law. The expected employer contributions to the funds for 2024 are €79 million (actual employer contributions in the reporting period: €81 million, in the previous year: €81 million). Some of the plans in which DHL Group participates are underfunded according to information provided by the funds. No information is available to the Group that would indicate any change from the contribution rates set by current collective agreements. In addition, the potential financial risks in conjunction with underfunded joint plans were implicitly reduced through measures taken by the US government. DHL Group does not represent a significant level to any fund in terms of contributions, with the exception of one fund where the Group represents the largest employer in terms of contributions.\n\nContribution rates for one multiemployer retirement plan in the Netherlands are determined each year by the management body of the pension fund with the involvement of the central bank of the Netherlands, based on cost coverage. These contribution rates are the same for all employers and employees involved. There is no liability for the employer toward the fund beyond the contributions set, even in the case of withdrawal or obligations not met by other entities. Any subsequent underfunding ultimately results in the rights of members being cut and/or no indexation of their rights. The expected employer contributions to the fund for 2024 are €36 million (actual employer contributions in the reporting period: €33 million, in the previous year: €31 million). As of December 31, 2023, the coverage degree of plan funding was above a required minimum of approximately 105%, according to information provided by the fund. DHL Group does not represent a significant portion of the fund in terms of contributions.\n\n#### Other provisions\n\nOther provisions are recognized for all legal or constructive obligations to third parties existing as of the reporting date that have arisen as a result of past events, that are expected to result in an outflow of future economic benefits and whose amount can be measured reliably. They represent uncertain obligations that are carried at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. Provisions with more than one year to maturity are discounted at market rates of interest that reflect the region and time to settlement of the obligation. The discount rates used in the fiscal year were between 0.25% and 10.50% (previous year: 0.00% to 10.75%). The effects arising from changes in interest rates are recognized under other operating income or expenses.\n\nProvisions for restructuring are only established in accordance with the aforementioned criteria for recognition if a detailed, formal restructuring plan has been drawn up and communicated to those affected.\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/147/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of three stylized letters. To the left of the letters are three horizontal red lines. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nTechnical reserves (insurance) consist mainly of outstanding-loss reserves and IBNR (incurred but not reported) reserves. Outstanding-loss reserves represent estimates of obligations in respect of actual claims or known incidents expected to give rise to claims that have been reported to the company but have yet to be finalized and presented for payment. Outstanding-loss reserves are based on individual claim valuations carried out by the company or its ceding insurers. IBNR reserves represent estimates of obligations in respect of incidents taking place on or before the reporting date that have not been reported to the company. Such reserves also include provisions for potential errors in settling outstanding-loss reserves. The company carries out its own assessment of ultimate loss liabilities using actuarial methods and also commissions an independent actuarial study of these each year in order to verify the reasonableness of its estimates.\n\n#### Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are carried at fair value less transaction costs on initial recognition. The price determined in an efficient and liquid market or a fair value determined using the treasury risk management system deployed within the Group is taken as the fair value. Financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost in subsequent periods. Any differences between the amount received and the amount repayable are recognized in the income statement over the term of the loan using the effective interest method. Disclosures on financial liabilities under leases can be found in the **[leases](https://dhl-reporting-hub-next.ryze-cloud.de/fy-2023/en/consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements-of-deutsche-post-ag/basis-of-preparation/ bzw. gleiche Seite: Leases | id=\"headline-12038\")** section.\n\n#### Convertible bond on Deutsche Post AG shares\n\nThe convertible bond on Deutsche Post AG shares is split into an equity and a debt component, in line with the contractual arrangements. The debt component, less the transaction costs, is reported under financial liabilities (bonds), with interest added back up to the issue amount over the term of the bond using the effective interest method (unwinding of the discount). The value of the call option, which allows Deutsche Post AG to redeem the bond early if a specified share price is reached, is attributed to the debt component in accordance with IAS 32.31. The conversion right is classified as an equity component and is reported in capital reserves. The carrying amount is calculated by assigning to the conversion right the residual value that results from deducting the amount calculated separately for the debt component from the fair value of the instrument as a whole. The transaction costs are deducted on a proportionate basis.\n\n#### Liabilities\n\nTrade payables are carried at amortized cost. Most of the trade payables have a maturity of less than one year. The fair value of the liabilities corresponds more or less to their carrying amount. Group companies use reverse-factoring programs for supplier financing. As part of this, suppliers conclude financing agreements with financial institutions without the involvement of DHL Group. If they wish, suppliers can receive invoice amounts less an interest component prior to the original due date on the basis of these agreements. DHL Group pays the invoice amounts to the respective financial institutions when they come due. Because the programs do not lead to any substantial modification of the conditions of payment between DHL Group and the suppliers, and payment terms are within the normal industry range, the corresponding accounts payable are still reported under trade payables. The payments to the financial institutions are reported in the operating cash flow.\n\n#### Deferred taxes\n\nIn accordance with IAS 12, deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the IFRS financial statements and the tax basis of the individual entities. Deferred tax assets also include tax reduction claims that arise from the expected future utilization of existing tax loss carryforwards and that are likely to be realized. The recoverability of the tax reduction claims is assessed on the basis of each entity's earnings projections, which are derived from the Group projections and take any tax adjustments and effects on earnings from the reversal of taxable temporary differences into account. The planning horizon is five years.\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/148/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font size, also in red. The background of the image is yellow.\n\nIn compliance with IAS 12.24(b) and IAS 12.15(b), deferred tax assets or liabilities were only recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the IFRS balance sheet and in the tax basis of Deutsche Post AG where the differences arose after January 1, 1995. No deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for temporary differences resulting from initial differences in the opening tax accounts of Deutsche Post AG as of January 1, 1995.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the tax rates applicable in the individual countries as of the reporting date or announced for the time when the deferred tax assets and liabilities are realized. The tax rate applied to German Group companies is unchanged at 30.5%. It comprises the corporation tax rate plus the solidarity surcharge, as well as a municipal trade tax rate that is calculated as the average of the different municipal trade tax rates. Foreign Group companies use their individual income tax rates to calculate deferred tax items. The income tax rates applied for foreign companies amount to up to 38% (previous year: 38%).\n\nThe Group applies the exception to the recognition and disclosure of information regarding deferred tax assets and liabilities in conjunction with income taxes for pillar two, as provided for in the amendments to IAS 12 published in May 2023.\n\n#### Income taxes\n\nIncome tax assets and liabilities are recognized when they are probable. They are measured at the amounts for which repayments from, or payments to, the tax authorities are expected to be received or made. If uncertain tax items are recognized because they are probable, they are measured at their most likely amount. Tax-related fines are recognized in income taxes if they are included in the calculation of income tax liabilities, due to their inclusion in the tax base and/or tax rate.\n\n#### Contingent liabilities\n\nContingent liabilities represent possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the enterprise. Contingent liabilities also include certain obligations that will probably not lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits, or where the amount of the outflow of resources embodying economic benefits cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. In accordance with IAS 37, contingent liabilities are not recognized in the balance sheet.\n\n#### 8 Exercise of judgment in applying the accounting policies\n\nThe preparation of IFRS-compliant consolidated financial statements requires the exercise of judgment by management. All estimates are reassessed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and expectations with regard to future events that appear reasonable under the given circumstances. For example, this applies to assets held for sale. In this case, management must determine whether the assets are available for sale in their present condition and whether their sale is highly probable. If that is the case, the assets and associated liabilities must be measured and recognized as assets held for sale or liabilities associated with assets held for sale.\n\n#### Estimates and assessments made by management\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make certain assumptions and estimates that may affect the amounts of the assets and liabilities included in the balance sheet, the amounts of income and expenses, and the disclosures relating to contingent liabilities. Examples of the main areas where assumptions, estimates and the exercise of management judgment occur are the recognition of provisions for pensions and similar obligations, the calculation of discounted cash flows for impairment testing and purchase price allocations, taxes and legal proceedings.\n\nThe Group has operating activities around the globe and is subject to local tax laws. Management can exercise judgment when calculating the amounts of current and deferred taxes in the relevant countries. Although management believes that it has made a reasonable estimate relating to tax matters that are inherently uncertain, there can be no guarantee that the actual outcome of these uncertain tax matters will correspond exactly to the original estimate made. Any difference between actual events and the estimate made could have an effect on tax balance sheet items in the period in which the matter is finally decided. The amount recognized for deferred tax assets could be reduced if the estimates of planned taxable income or changes to current tax laws restrict the extent to which future tax benefits can be realized.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/149/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nGoodwill is regularly reported in the Group's balance sheet as a consequence of business combinations. When an acquisition is initially recognized in the consolidated financial statements, all identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are generally measured at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. One of the important estimates this requires is the determination of the fair values of these assets and liabilities as of the date of acquisition. Land, buildings and office equipment are generally valued by independent experts, while securities for which there is an active market are recognized at the quoted exchange price. If intangible assets are identified in the course of an acquisition, their measurement can be based on the opinion of an independent external expert valuer, depending on the type of intangible asset and the complexity involved in determining its fair value. The independent expert determines the fair value using appropriate valuation techniques, normally based on expected future cash flows. In addition to the assumptions about the development of future cash flows, these valuations are also significantly affected by the discount rates used.\n\nClimate change could give rise to uncertainties and risks for the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group. Extreme weather events could potentially lead to damage to property, plant and equipment. Increased restrictions imposed by law to combat climate change are expected in the coming years, including limits on air transport or access to city centers. In certain cases, this may also affect our existing business models and our ability to operate optimally. Climate-related risks can influence the useful lives of assets in different ways:\n\n- Physical changes in the climate such as the increased frequency and intensity of acute weather events (storms, fires and floods) as well as long-term trends such as rising temperatures can have an impact on assets.\n- Transitory changes in conjunction with decarbonization including political, legal, technological and market-related changes – can influence the useful lives and the values of our assets.\n\nIn particular, there are uncertainties with regard to the extent to which regulatory efforts in connection with the debate surrounding climate action will lead to higher costs. The current focus as part of the public debate and the climate action measures of DHL Group relate to CO2 emissions. DHL Group plans to reduce its logistics-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to below 29 million metric tons of CO2e by the year 2030. DHL Group wants to reduce the GHG emissions to net zero by 2050. To this end, additional costs – for emissions trading and sustainable fuels, among other things – were accounted for in the company's projections and thus included in the application of IAS 36 as well as in the impairment considerations for deferred tax assets. Other central elements of the planned reduction in CO2 emissions are the planned fleet modernization as well as the option for DHL Group customers to acquire CO2 offsets during the booking process.\n\nDHL Group does not currently see any climate-related indications for the adjustment of useful lives and residual values of aircraft and other items of property, plant and equipment. As part of determining the impairment loss on assets of property, plant and equipment, of intangible assets and of right-of-use assets, estimates are also made that relate to, among other factors, the cause, time and amount of the impairment. An impairment loss is based upon a number of factors. Management has to make significant estimates with regard to the identification and review of indications for an impairment, the estimate of future cash flows, the determination of fair values of assets (or groups of assets), the relevant discount rates, the respective useful lives and the residual values of the affected assets. Moreover, a loss allowance for financial assets has been established to account for expected credit losses resulting from customers' credit quality. Detailed information can be found under **[note 7 on expected credit loss and trade](#page-137-0)  [receivables.](#page-137-0)** Assessment of the appropriateness of the loss allowance is based on historical data and future macroeconomic key figures or the credit rating estimate for the respective customers on the basis of an external rating from the respective industry and the country in which the customer operates, **[note 43.](#page-195-0)** In the event of a deterioration of the credit quality of the customer, the scope of the derecognition (specific valuation allowances on receivables) actually carried out may exceed that of the loss allowance recognized.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/150/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nImpairment testing for goodwill is based on assumptions about the future. The Group carries out these tests annually and also whenever there are indications that goodwill has become impaired. The recoverable amount of the CGU must then be calculated. This amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Determining value in use requires assumptions and estimates to be made with respect to forecast future cash flows and the discount rate applied. Although management believes that the assumptions made for the purpose of calculating the recoverable amount are appropriate, possible unforeseeable changes in these assumptions – e.g., a reduction in the EBIT margin, an increase in the asset charge or a decline in the long-term growth rate – could result in an impairment loss that could negatively affect the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations, **[note 22.](#page-166-0)**\n\nFor the actuarial valuation of defined benefit retirement plans of the Group, actuarial assumptions are required that relate to, in particular, discount rates, expected rates of salary and pension increases and biometric probabilities. Generally accepted valuation methods are used to determine the fair value of plan assets – in particular, for assets without a market price quotation (e.g., real estate) – that require separate assumptions. If changes to these assumptions are necessary, this could have a material impact on the results of actuarial valuations, recognized carrying amounts and the future amount of retirement benefit expenses. Disclosures regarding the assumptions made in connection with the Group's defined benefit retirement plans can be found in **[note 37.](#page-181-0)**\n\nPending legal proceedings in which the Group is involved are disclosed in **[note 45.](#page-213-0)** The outcome of these proceedings could have a significant effect on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group. Management regularly analyzes the information currently available about these proceedings and recognizes provisions for probable obligations including estimated legal costs. Internal and external legal advisers participate in making this assessment. In deciding on the necessity for a provision, management takes into account the probability of an unfavorable outcome and whether the amount of the obligation can be estimated with sufficient reliability. The fact that an action has been launched or a claim asserted against the Group, or that a legal dispute has been disclosed in the notes, does not necessarily mean that a provision is recognized for the associated risk.\n\nDHL Group considers itself to be exposed to an increasingly complex and uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. This includes potential increases in fuel, energy and gas prices, which can be at least partially compensated for or passed on to customers through strict cost management and the established levers such as price increases and price surcharge mechanisms. In addition, strong volatility is still expected on the goods and financial markets and in exchange rates, driven by rising interest and inflation rates. Moreover, the risk of a potential decline in global economic growth can be observed, which could lead to an increased number of customer bankruptcies.\n\nAll assumptions and estimates are based on the circumstances prevailing and assessments made as of the reporting date. For the purpose of estimating the future development of the business, a realistic assessment was also made at that date of the economic environment likely to apply in the future to the different sectors and regions in which the Group operates. In the event of developments in these economic parameters that diverge from the assumptions made, the actual amounts may differ from the estimated amounts. In such cases, the assumptions made and, where necessary, the carrying amounts of the relevant assets and liabilities are adjusted accordingly.\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/151/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in bold red letters with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. The word \"Group\" is in a smaller font and is located to the right and slightly below the DHL letters. The background is yellow.\n\nAs of the date of preparation of the consolidated financial statements, there is no indication that any significant change in the assumptions and estimates made will be required, so that on the basis of the information currently available, it is not expected that there will be significant adjustments in the 2024 fiscal year to the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities recognized in the financial statements.\n\n#### 9 Consolidation methods\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are based on the IFRS financial statements of Deutsche Post AG and the subsidiaries, joint operations and investments accounted for using the equity method included in the consolidated financial statements and prepared in accordance with uniform accounting policies as of December 31, 2023.\n\nAcquisition accounting for subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements uses the purchase method of accounting. The cost of the acquisition corresponds to the fair value of the assets given up, the equity instruments issued and the liabilities assumed at the transaction date. Acquisition-related costs are recognized as expenses. Contingent consideration is recognized at fair value as of the date of initial consolidation.\n\nThe assets and liabilities, as well as income and expenses, of joint operations are included in the consolidated financial statements in proportion to the interest held in these operations, in accordance with IFRS 11. Accounting for the joint operators' share of the assets and liabilities, as well as recognition and measurement of goodwill, use the same methods as applied to the consolidation of subsidiaries.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 28, joint ventures and companies on which the parent can exercise significant influence (associates) are accounted for in accordance with the equity method. Any goodwill is recognized under investments accounted for using the equity method.\n\nIn the case of step acquisitions, the equity portion previously held is remeasured at the fair value applicable as of the acquisition date, and the resulting gain or loss is recognized in the income statement.\n\nIntra-Group revenue, other operating income and expenses, as well as receivables, liabilities and provisions between companies that are consolidated or proportionately consolidated, are eliminated. Intercompany profits or losses from intra-Group deliveries and services not realized by sale to third parties are eliminated. Unrealized gains and losses from business transactions with investments accounted for using the equity method are eliminated on a proportionate basis.\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-152-0\"></span>Image /page/152/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

disclosures\n\nDHL Group reports five operating segments for the 2023 fiscal year; these are managed independently by the responsible segment management bodies in line with the products and services offered and the brands, distribution channels and customer profiles involved. Components of the entity are defined as a segment on the basis of the existence of segment managers with bottom-line responsibility who report directly to DHL Group's top management.\n\nExternal revenue is the revenue generated by the divisions from non-Group third parties. Internal revenue is revenue generated with other divisions. If comparable external market prices exist for services or products offered internally within the Group, these market prices or market-oriented prices are used as transfer prices (arm's-length principle). The transfer prices for services for which no external market exists are generally based on incremental costs.\n\nThe expenses for services provided in the IT service centers are allocated to the divisions by their origin. The additional costs resulting from Deutsche Post AG's universal postal service obligation (nationwide retail outlet network, delivery every working\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/154/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font, also in red. The background is yellow.\n\nIn keeping with internal reporting, capital expenditure (capex) is disclosed. Additions to intangible assets net of goodwill and to property, plant and equipment, including right-of-use assets, are reported in the capex figure. Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses relate to the segment assets allocated to the individual divisions. For reasons of transparency, net cash from/used in operating activities is now shown in segment reporting instead of in other noncash expenses and income, as previously.\n\nThe profitability of the Group's operating divisions is measured as profit from operating activities (EBIT).\n\n#### 10.2 Segments by division\n\nThe primary reporting format is based on the divisions, reflecting the Group's predominant organizational structure. The Group distinguishes between the following divisions:\n\n#### Express\n\nThe Express division offers time-definite courier and express services to business and private customers. The division comprises the Europe, Middle East and Africa, Americas and Asia Pacific regions.\n\n#### Global Forwarding, Freight\n\nThe Global Forwarding, Freight division comprises international air, ocean and overland freight forwarding services. The division's business units are Global Forwarding and Freight.\n\n#### Supply Chain\n\nThe Supply Chain division delivers customized logistics services and supply chain solutions to its customers based on globally standardized modular components including warehousing, transport and value-added services. The division comprises the Europe, Middle East and Africa, Americas and Asia Pacific regions.\n\n#### eCommerce\n\nThe eCommerce division is home to the Group's international parcel delivery business. The core business activities are domestic parcel delivery in selected countries in Europe, Asia and the United States and non-TDI cross-border services.\n\n#### Post & Parcel Germany\n\nThe Post & Parcel Germany division transports, sorts and delivers documents and goods in and outside of Germany. Its business units are called Post Germany, Parcel Germany and International.\n\nIn addition to the reported segments shown above, segment reporting comprises the following categories:\n\n#### Group Functions\n\nGroup Functions includes Corporate Center, Global Business Services (GBS) and Customer Solutions & Innovation (CSI). The profit/loss generated by GBS is allocated to the operating segments, while its assets and liabilities remain with GBS (asymmetrical allocation).\n\n#### Consolidation\n\nThe data for the divisions is presented following consolidation of interdivisional transactions. The transactions between the divisions are eliminated in the Consolidation column.\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/155/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters. There are three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. The word \"Group\" is in red and is located below the right side of the DHL letters. The background is yellow.\n\n#### 10.3 Information about geographical regions\n\nThe main geographical regions in which the Group is active are Germany, Europe (excluding Germany), the Americas, Asia Pacific, and Middle East and Africa. External revenue, noncurrent assets and capex are disclosed for these regions. Revenue, assets and capex are allocated to the individual regions on the basis of the domicile of the reporting entity. Noncurrent assets comprise intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and other noncurrent assets (excluding pension assets).\n\n#### 10.4 Reconciliation of segment amounts to consolidated amounts\n\nThe following table shows the reconciliation of DHL Group's total assets to the segment assets. Financial asset components, income tax assets, deferred taxes, cash and cash equivalents and other asset components are deducted.\n\n#### RECONCILIATION TO SEGMENT ASSETS\n\n| €m                                   | 20221         | 2023          |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Total equity and liabilities         | 68,476        | 66,814        |\n| Investment property                  | -22           | -13           |\n| Noncurrent financial assets          | -1,040        | -944          |\n| Other noncurrent assets              | -355          | -154          |\n| Deferred tax assets                  | -1,440        | -1,453        |\n| Income tax assets                    | -456          | -663          |\n| Receivables and other current assets | -15           | -17           |\n| Current financial assets             | -1,313        | -348          |\n| Cash and cash equivalents            | -3,790        | -3,649        |\n| <b>Segment assets</b>                | <b>60,045</b> | <b>59,573</b> |\n| of which Group Functions             | 5,795         | 5,734         |\n| Total for reported segments          | 54,314        | 53,900        |\n| Consolidation2                       | -64           | -61           |\n\n1 Prior-year figures adjusted, **[note 4.](#page-133-0)**\n\n2 Including rounding.\n\nThe following table shows the reconciliation of DHL Group's total liabilities to the segment liabilities.

Among other factors, the normalization of freight rates in the Global Forwarding, Freight division contributed to this development. Business in the Express division was shaped by declining volume development. In addition, currency effects and lower fuel surcharges had a reducing effect on revenue. Meanwhile, revenue in the Supply Chain and eCommerce divisions increased due to new business and contract extensions. In the Post & Parcel Germany division, revenue growth in the Parcel Germany business unit compensated for the declining business in the Post Germany area, which is hampered by ongoing structural transition.\n\nThe contract liabilities recognized at the beginning of the fiscal year primarily led to revenue in the fiscal year.\n\nThe following table shows the factors affecting revenue:\n\n#### FACTORS AFFECTING REVENUE\n\n| €m                              | 2023    |\n|---------------------------------|---------|\n| Organic growth                  | -10,687 |\n| Portfolio changes               | 693     |\n| Currency translation effects    | -2,684  |\n| Total revenue increase/decrease | -12,678 |\n\nThe allocation of revenue to geographical regions is presented in the segment reporting.\n\n#### 12 Other operating income\n\n| €m                                           | 2022  | 2023  |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Income from currency translation             | 696   | 452   |\n| Insurance-related income                     | 340   | 403   |\n| Income from the reversal of provisions       | 214   | 353   |\n| Income from the remeasurement of liabilities | 284   | 348   |\n| Operating lease income                       | 150   | 209   |\n| Income from fees and reimbursements          | 133   | 130   |\n| Income from the disposal of assets           | 175   | 88    |\n| Income from prior-period billings            | 54    | 66    |\n| Subsidies                                    | 72    | 48    |\n| Sublease income                              | 87    | 42    |\n| Miscellaneous other operating income         | 720   | 648   |\n| Total                                        | 2,925 | 2,787 |\n\nOther operating income fell short of the prior-year figure. The reduction in income from currency translation was partially compensated for by the increased income from the reversal of provisions and by higher income from the remeasurement of liabilities.\n\nIncome from operating leases was attributable mainly to leasing of the aircraft fleet's cargo space.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-158-0\"></span>Image /page/158/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

In accordance with IAS 12.15(b) and IAS 12.24(b), the Group did not recognize any deferred tax assets in respect of these temporary differences, which related mainly to property, plant and equipment as well as to pension provisions and similar obligations. As of December 31, 2023, there were no remaining tax-deductible temporary differences between the original IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base (previous year: €99 million).\n\nEffects from deferred tax assets not recognized for tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences in the amount of €38 million (previous year: €3 million) relate to the reduction of the effective income tax expense due to the utilization of tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences, for which deferred tax assets had previously not been recognized. In addition, the recognition of deferred tax assets previously not recognized for tax loss carryforwards and of deductible temporary differences from a prior period reduced the deferred tax expense by €100 million (previous year: €274 million). Effects from unrecognized deferred tax assets do not include any effects (previous year: income of €12 million) due to a reversal or impairment loss recognized for a deferred tax asset. Other effects from unrecognized deferred tax assets relate primarily to tax loss carryforwards for which no deferred taxes were recognized.

As part of this, as of December 31, 2022, internally generated intangible assets increased by €18 million, purchased brand names by €6 million and purchased customer lists by €17 million, while goodwill fell by €16 million, **[note 2](#page-128-0) [and 4.](#page-133-0)**\n\nPurchased software, concessions, industrial rights, licenses and similar rights and assets are reported under purchased intangible assets. Internally generated intangible assets relate to development costs for internally developed software.\n\n#### 22.2 Allocation of goodwill to CGUs\n\nFor the purposes of annual impairment testing in accordance with IAS 36, the Group determines the recoverable amount of a CGU, or a group of CGUs, on the basis of its value in use. This calculation is based on projections of free cash flows that are initially discounted at a rate corresponding to the posttax cost of capital. Pretax discount rates are determined iteratively.\n\n#### ALLOCATION OF GOODWILL\n\n| €m                         | Dec. 31, 20221 | Dec. 31, 2023 |\n|----------------------------|----------------|---------------|\n| Express                    | 3,913          | 3,900         |\n| Global Forwarding, Freight |                |               |\n| Global Forwarding          | 5,329          | 5,426         |\n| Freight                    | 280            | 281           |\n| Supply Chain               | 2,079          | 2,098         |\n| eCommerce                  | 159            | 430           |\n| Post & Parcel Germany      | 954            | 951           |\n| Total goodwill             | 12,714         | 13,086        |\n\n1 Prior-year figures adjusted, **[note 4](#page-133-0)**.\n\nThe cash flow projections are based on the detailed planning for EBIT, depreciation and amortization, investment planning adopted by management, as well as changes in net working capital, and take both internal historical data and external macroeconomic data into account. The cash flow forecasts include the expenses for decarbonization measures planned to achieve the targets for reducing emissions by 2030 for expanding the use of sustainable fuels and technologies in fleets and buildings. As part of the planning for the Post & Parcel Germany CGU, assumptions regarding the regulations of the German Postal Act, which is currently undergoing revision, were taken into account on the basis of the draft legislation. If there are changes to the draft legislation, if it is not possible to withdraw from the provision of the universal postal service, or if the new law is not passed in a timely manner, these represent material risk factors; however, the probability of their occurrence is considered to be low. From a methodological perspective, the detailed planning phase covers a three-year planning horizon from 2024 to 2026. By contrast, an extended planning phase of five years was applied for the eCommerce CGU. The eCommerce division is only in its sixth year of existence and has not yet reached a steady state. This is attributable to relatively high levels of planned capital expenditure over the next three years, during which the estimated EBIT will not yet reflect business growth. The expectation is that a stable state will be achieved in 2028. Planning is supplemented by a perpetual annuity representing the value added from 2027 onward, or following the extended planning phase. This is calculated using a long-term growth rate, which is determined for each CGU or each CGU group separately and is shown in the table below. The growth rates applied are based on long-term real growth figures for the relevant economies, growth expectations for the relevant sectors and long-term inflation forecasts for the countries in which the CGU or CGU group operates. The cash flow forecasts are based both on past experience and on the effects of the anticipated future general market trend. In addition, the forecasts take into account growth in the respective geographical submarkets and in global trade, and the ongoing trend toward outsourcing logistics activities. Cost trend forecasts for the transport network and services also have an impact on value in use. A key planning assumption for the impairment test is the EBIT margin for the perpetual annuity.\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/168/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nThe pretax cost of capital is based on the weighted average cost of capital. The (pretax) discount rates for the significant CGU or CGU group and the growth rates assumed in each case for the perpetual annuity are shown in the following table:\n\n|                            |  | Discount rate |      | Growth rate |      |\n|----------------------------|--|---------------|------|-------------|------|\n| %                          |  | 2022          | 2023 | 2022        | 2023 |\n| Express                    |  | 9.7           | 11.8 | 2.0         | 2.0  |\n| Global Forwarding, Freight |  |               |      |             |      |\n| Global Forwarding          |  | 9.9           | 10.9 | 2.5         | 2.5  |\n| Freight                    |  | 10.2          | 11.1 | 2.0         | 2.0  |\n| Supply Chain               |  | 10.0          | 10.0 | 2.5         | 2.5  |\n| eCommerce                  |  | 10.5          | 10.9 | 1.5         | 1.5  |\n| Post & Parcel Germany      |  | 10.2          | 10.0 | 0.5         | 0.5  |\n\nThe change in the discount rate primarily reflects the change in interest rates in general.\n\nOn the basis of these assumptions and the impairment tests carried out for the individual CGUs or CGU groups to which goodwill was allocated, it was established that the recoverable amounts for all CGUs or CGU groups exceed their carrying amounts. No impairment losses were recognized on goodwill in any of the CGUs or CGU groups as of December 31, 2023.\n\nWhen performing the impairment test, DHL Group conducted sensitivity analyses for the significant CGUs or CGU groups in accordance with IAS 36.134 for potential changes to the EBIT margin, the discount rate and the growth rate. These analyses – which included varying the essential valuation parameters within an appropriate range – did not reveal any risk of impairment to goodwill.\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-169-0\"></span>Image /page/169/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The additional expenditure for investments in technologies for making new buildings climate-neutral amounted to €38 million (previous year: €24 million).\n\nAdvance payments relate only to advance payments on items of property, plant and equipment for which the Group has paid advances in connection with incomplete transactions. They relate, in particular, to the renewal of the Express air fleet. Assets under development relate to items of property, plant and equipment in progress as of the reporting date for whose production internal or third-party costs have already been incurred.\n\n#### 24 Investment property\n\nThe investment property largely comprises leased property encumbered by heritable building rights and developed and undeveloped land.\n\n| €m                                 | 2022 | 2023 |\n|------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Cost                               |      |      |\n| Balance as of January 1            | 71   | 31   |\n| Additions                          | 8    | 0    |\n| Reclassifications                  | -44  | -9   |\n| Disposals                          | -4   | -2   |\n| Currency translation differences   | 0    | -1   |\n| Balance as of December 31          | 31   | 19   |\n| Depreciation and impairment losses |      |      |\n| Balance as of January 1            | 23   | 9    |\n| Depreciation and impairment losses | 1    | 1    |\n| Disposals                          | -3   | -1   |\n| Reclassifications                  | -12  | -2   |\n| Currency translation differences   | 0    | -1   |\n| Balance as of December 31          | 9    | 6    |\n| Carrying amount as of December 31  | 22   | 13   |\n| of which right-of-use assets       | 9    | 8    |\n\n#### 25 Investments accounted for using the equity method\n\nIn the income statement, net income from investments accounted for using the equity method increased by €200 million to €161 million. This was due to income from the change in consolidation method for DHL Logistics (formerly Danzas AEI Emirates) in the amount of €114 million, as well as proceeds from the disposal of 0.88% of shares in Global-E Online, Israel, totaling €46 million. The following table does not include this amount, because the former Danzas AEI Emirates is no longer accounted for using the equity method.\n\nThe table below is an overview of the carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements and selected financial data for those companies that, both individually and in the aggregate, are not of material significance for the Group.\n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/171/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Another addition to associates is RailDirect LLC, United Arab Emirates, with 49% of shares, while the addition of the Polish company APM Solutions Sp. z o.o. with 49% of shares is allocated to joint ventures. Among others, disposals of associates relate to DHL Logistics (formerly Danzas AEI Emirates LLC), as the method of consolidation changed with the acquisition of the remaining 60% of shares.

A wide variety of other defined benefit retirement plans in the Group are to be found in the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United States and a large number of other countries. There are specific risks associated with these plans along with measures to mitigate them.\n\n#### 37.1 Plan features\n\n#### Germany\n\nIn Germany, Deutsche Post AG has an occupational retirement benefit arrangement based on a collective agreement, which is open to new hourly workers and salaried employees. Depending on the weekly working hours and wage/salary group, retirement benefit components are calculated annually for each hourly worker and salaried employee and credited to an individual pension account. A 2.5% increase on the previous year is included in every newly allocated component. When the statutory pension falls due, the hourly workers and salaried employees can choose whether to receive payment as a lump sum or in installments, or lifelong monthly benefit payments that increase by 1% each year. The large majority of Deutsche Post AG's obligations relates to vested entitlements of hourly workers and salaried employees from a previous agreement, and to legacy pension commitments toward former hourly workers and salaried employees who have left or retired from the company. In addition, retirement benefit arrangements are available to executives below the Board of Management level and to specific employee groups through deferred compensation, in particular. For information on the pension scheme for the Board of Management, see **[note 47.2.](#page-218-0)**\n\nThe prime source of external funding for Deutsche Post AG's respective retirement benefit obligations is a contractual trust arrangement, which also includes a pension fund. The trust is funded on a case-by-case basis in line with the Group's finance strategy. In the case of the pension fund, the regulatory funding requirements can, in principle, be met without additional employer contributions. Part of the plan assets consists of real estate that is leased out to the Group on a long-term basis. In addition, *Versorgungsanstalt der Deutschen Bundespost* (VAP – Deutsche Bundespost institution for supplementary retirement pensions), a shared pension fund for successor companies to Deutsche Bundespost, is used for some of the legacy pension commitments.\n\nIndividual subsidiaries in Germany have defined-benefit retirement plans that were acquired in the context of acquisitions and transfers of operations and that are closed to new entrants. Contractual trust arrangements are in place for two subsidiaries for external funding.\n\n#### United Kingdom\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Group's defined benefit pension arrangements are closed to new entrants and for further service accrual.\n\nThe Group's defined benefit pension arrangements in the United Kingdom have mainly been consolidated into a Group plan with different sections for the participating divisions. These are funded mainly via a Group trust.

Normal contribution amounts no longer accrue because the arrangements have been closed.\n\n#### Other\n\nIn the Netherlands, collective agreements require that those employees who are not covered by a sector-specific plan participate in a dedicated defined benefit retirement plan. The dedicated plan provides for annual accruals that are subject to a pensionable salary cap. The plan provides for monthly benefit payments that are indexed in line with inflation, on the one hand, and the funds available for such indexation, on the other. In Switzerland, employees receive an occupational pension in line with statutory requirements, where pension payments depend on the contributions paid, an interest rate that is fixed each year, certain annuity factors and any pension increases specified. A separate plan providing for lump-sum payments instead of lifelong pension payments exists for specific higher wage components. In the United States, the companies' defined benefit retirement plans have been closed to new entrants and accrued entitlements have been frozen.\n\nThe Group companies fund their dedicated defined benefit retirement plans in these three countries primarily by using respective joint funding institutions. In the Netherlands and in Switzerland, both employers and employees contribute to plan funding. In the United States, no regularly recurring contributions are currently made in this regard – with the exception of some limited employer deficit contributions that were resumed in the year under review.\n\n{183}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/183/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The background of the image is yellow.\n\nThe discount rates for defined benefit obligations in the eurozone and the United Kingdom were each derived from an individual yield curve comprising the yields of AA-rated corporate bonds and taking into account membership composition and duration. For other countries, the discount rate for defined benefit obligations was determined in a similar way, provided there was a deep market for AA-rated (or, in some cases, AA- and AAA-rated) corporate bonds. By contrast, government bond yields were used for countries without a deep market for such corporate bonds.\n\nFor the annual pension increase in Germany, fixed rates in particular must be taken into account, in addition to the assumptions shown. The effective weighted average therefore amounts to approximately 1.00% (previous year: 1.00%).\n\nThe most significant demographic assumptions made relate to life expectancy and/or mortality. For the Group companies in Germany, they are based on the HEUBECK-RICHTTAFELN 2018 G. Life expectancy for the retirement benefit plans in the United Kingdom was based mainly on the S3NMA\\_H/S3PFA\\_H tables of the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, adjusted to reflect plan-specific mortality according to the latest funding valuation. Future mortality improvements were taken into account based on the current CMI projections model and an updated long-term trend assumption. For other countries, their own country-specific current standard mortality tables were used.\n\nIf one of the significant financial assumptions were to change, the present value of the defined benefit obligations would change as follows:\n\n|                                   | Change in<br>assumption<br>percentage<br>points |         | Change in present value<br>of defined benefit obligations<br>% |        |        |  |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--|\n|                                   |                                                 | Germany | United Kingdom                                                 | Other  | Total  |  |\n| December 31, 2023                 |                                                 |         |                                                                |        |        |  |\n| Discount rate                     | 1.00                                            | -10.43  | -10.50                                                         | -12.91 | -10.90 |  |\n| (defined benefit obligations)     | -1.00                                           | 12.94   | 12.75                                                          | 16.65  | 13.58  |  |\n| Expected annual                   | 0.50                                            | 0.09    | 0                                                              | 0.93   | 0.22   |  |\n| rate of future salary development | -0.50                                           | -0.09   | 0                                                              | -0.85  | -0.21  |  |\n| Expected annual                   | 0.50                                            | 0.28    | 4.17                                                           | 6.11   | 2.41   |  |\n| rate of future pension increase   | -0.50                                           | -0.26   | -4.08                                                          | -4.58  | -2.09  |  |\n| December 31, 2022                 |                                                 |         |                                                                |        |        |  |\n| Discount rate                     | 1.00                                            | -8.36   | -10.99                                                         | -12.95 | -9.93  |  |\n| (defined benefit obligations)     | -1.00                                           | 10.64   | 13.48                                                          | 16.72  | 12.54  |  |\n| Expected annual                   | 0.50                                            | 0.10    | n.a.                                                           | 0.91   | 0.22   |  |\n| rate of future salary development | -0.50                                           | -0.08   | n.a.                                                           | -0.82  | -0.19  |  |\n| Expected annual                   | 0.50                                            | 0.29    | 4.20                                                           | 6.11   | 2.43   |  |\n| rate of future pension increase   | -0.50                                           | -0.25   | -4.05                                                          | -4.67  | -2.11  |  |\n\nThese are effective weighted changes in the respective present value of the defined benefit obligations, for example taking into account the largely fixed nature of the pension increase for Germany.\n\nA one-year increase in life expectancy for a 65-year-old beneficiary would increase the present value of the defined benefit obligations by 4.16% in Germany (previous year: 3.95%) and by 2.31% in the United Kingdom (previous year: 3.19%). The corresponding increase for other countries would be 2.78% (previous year: 2.75%) and the total increase would be 3.41% (previous year: 3.52%).\n\n{186}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/186/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The background is yellow.\n\nWhen determining the sensitivity disclosures, the present values were calculated using the same methodology used to calculate the present values as of the reporting date. The presentation does not take into account interdependencies between the assumptions; rather, it supposes that the assumptions change in isolation. This would be unusual in practice, since assumptions are often correlated.\n\nThe weighted average duration of the Group's defined benefit obligations as of December 31, 2023, was 12.0 years in Germany (previous year: 9.8 years) and 12.1 years in the United Kingdom (previous year: 13.0 years). In the other countries it was 15.1 years (previous year: 16.1 years), and in total it was 12.6 years (previous year: 11.8 years).\n\nA total of 30.3% (previous year: 29.2%) of the present value of the defined benefit obligations was attributable to active beneficiaries, 19.5% (previous year: 19.3%) to formerly employed beneficiaries and 50.2% (previous year: 51.5%) to retirees.\n\n#### 37.4 Additional information on the fair value of plan assets\n\nThe fair value of the plan assets can be disaggregated as follows:\n\n|                           |         | United<br>Kingdom |       |        |\n|---------------------------|---------|-------------------|-------|--------|\n| €m                        | Germany |                   | Other | Total  |\n| December 31, 2023         |         |                   |       |        |\n| Equities                  | 1,015   | 78                | 779   | 1,872  |\n| Fixed-income securities   | 1,687   | 3,071             | 1,002 | 5,760  |\n| Real estate               | 1,746   | 246               | 341   | 2,333  |\n| Alternatives1             | 479     | 215               | 54    | 748    |\n| Insurances                | 501     | 0                 | 139   | 640    |\n| Cash                      | 218     | 67                | 20    | 305    |\n| Other                     | 9       | 281               | 51    | 341    |\n| Fair value of plan assets | 5,655   | 3,958             | 2,386 | 11,999 |\n| December 31, 2022         |         |                   |       |        |\n| Equities                  | 426     | 57                | 636   | 1,119  |\n| Fixed-income securities   | 855     | 3,053             | 1,018 | 4,926  |\n| Real estate               | 1,821   | 272               | 329   | 2,422  |\n| Alternatives1             | 481     | 255               | 50    | 786    |\n| Insurances                | 510     | 0                 | 132   | 642    |\n| Cash                      | 1,552   | 83                | 40    | 1,675  |\n| Other                     | 20      | 334               | 53    | 407    |\n| Fair value of plan assets | 5,665   | 4,054             | 2,258 | 11,977 |\n\n1 Primarily included absolute-return products and private-equity investments.\n\nQuoted market prices in an active market exist for around 60% (previous year: 58%) of the total fair values of plan assets. The remaining assets for which no such quoted market prices exist are attributable as follows: 17% (previous year: 18%) to real estate, 12% (previous year: 12%) to fixed income securities, 5% (previous year: 6%) to insurances, 3% (previous year: 3%) to alternatives and 3% (previous year: 3%) to other. The majority of the investments on the active markets are globally diversified, with certain country-specific focus areas.\n\nReal estate included in plan assets in Germany with a fair value of €1,615 million (previous year: €1,689 million) is occupied by DHL Group.\n\nIn the previous year, hedging measures resulted in a decrease in the proportion of equity and fixed-income holdings and an increase in the proportion of the cash holdings, particularly in Germany. In particular in Germany also, the investment of plan assets\n\n{187}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-187-0\"></span>Image /page/187/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nwas realigned in light of the changed capital market environment and the proportion of cash holdings was once again significantly reduced in the year under review.\n\nAsset-liability studies are performed at regular intervals in Germany and the United Kingdom, as well as, among other places, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United States, for the purpose of matching assets and liabilities; the strategic allocation of plan assets is adjusted accordingly. Strategic asset allocation for the respective plans is mainly carried out on the basis of the structure of the underlying obligations. As part of this, different strategies are pursued in some individual countries. These strategies include, among others, the comprehensive hedging of obligations (liability-driven investment) and securing future cash flows (cash-flowdriven investment). The common factor in the strategies is that they are determined in consideration of the respective regulatory framework and in consideration of return expectations and the risk-bearing ability of the company. Due to the plan-related derivation of the capital investment strategies in consideration of the specific economic parameters, there are significant differences in the alignment of the investments.\n\nESG criteria are taken into account in the management of pension assets, in particular as part of risk management and thus as part of the long-term direction of the investment strategy.\n\n#### 37.5 Risk\n\nSpecific risks are associated with the defined benefit retirement plans. This can result in a (negative or positive) change in DHL Group's equity through other comprehensive income, whose overall relevance is classed as medium to high. In contrast, a low relevance is attached to the short-term effects on staff costs and net finance costs. Potential risk mitigation is applied depending on the specifics of the plans.\n\n#### Interest rate risk\n\nA decrease (increase) in the respective discount rate would lead to an increase (decrease) in the present value of the total obligation and would in principle be accompanied by an increase (decrease) in the fair value of the fixed income securities contained in the plan assets. Further hedging measures are applied, in some cases using derivatives.\n\n#### Inflation risk\n\nPension obligations – especially relating to final salary schemes or schemes involving increases during the pension payment phase – can be linked directly or indirectly to changes in inflation. The risk of increasing inflation rates with regard to the present value of the defined benefit obligations has been mitigated in the case of Germany, for example, by switching to a system of retirement benefit components and, in the case of the United Kingdom, by closing the defined benefit arrangements. In addition, fixed rates of increase have been set and increases partially capped, and/or lump-sum payments have been provided for. There is also a positive correlation with interest rates.\n\n#### Investment risk\n\nThe investment is in principle subject to a large number of risks; in particular, it is exposed to the risk that market prices may change. This is managed primarily by ensuring broad diversification and the use of hedging instruments.\n\n#### Longevity risk\n\nLongevity risk may arise in connection with the benefits payable in the future due to a future increase in life expectancy. This is mitigated, in particular, by using current standard mortality tables when calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligations. The mortality tables used in Germany and the United Kingdom, for example, include an allowance for expected future increases in life expectancy.\n\n{188}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/188/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

A total of €30 million was added for the active early retirement program in the Post & Parcel Germany division. The increase in other employee benefits results primarily from higher additions to the obligations for partial retirement and pension plans in the United States compared to the previous year.\n\nTechnical reserves (insurance) consist mainly of outstanding-loss reserves and IBNR (incurred but not reported) reserves, **[note 7.](#page-137-0)** The provision for aircraft maintenance relates to obligations for major aircraft and engine maintenance by third-party companies. Of the tax provisions, €67 million (previous year: €140 million) relates to VAT, €25 million (previous year: €31 million) to customs and duties and €71 million (previous year: €107 million) to other tax provisions.\n\nMiscellaneous provisions include a large number of individual items. The risks from business activities relate primarily to provisions for guarantees and compensation payments to customers as well as provisions for losses from onerous contracts. In addition, miscellaneous provisions include the obligation to return the securities for CO2 emissions certificates in the amount of €70 million (previous year: €70 million).\n\n{189}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-189-0\"></span>Image /page/189/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The interest rate of the bond is coupled with the medium-term target of significantly reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030. The cash inflow and the liability were recognized on July 3, 2023. The ten-year term ends on July 3, 2033. The bond has a fixed interest rate of 3.375% per year. However, if one of the targets set for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for 2030 is not reached, the coupon to be paid increases beginning in the year 2031. The revenue will primarily be used for general company purposes, including the refinancing of existing financial liabilities.\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT BONDS\n\n|                             |                     |                       |                  |                          | 2022             |  |                          | 2023             |  |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------------|------------------|--|--------------------------|------------------|--|\n|                             | Nominal coupon<br>% | Notional volume<br>€m | Issuer           | Carrying<br>amount<br>€m | Fair value<br>€m |  | Carrying<br>amount<br>€m | Fair value<br>€m |  |\n| Bond 2012/2024              | 2.875               | 700                   | Deutsche Post AG | 699                      | 699              |  | 700                      | 696              |  |\n| Bond 2013/2023              | 2.750               | 500                   | Deutsche Post AG | 500                      | 502              |  | n.a.                     | n.a.             |  |\n| Bond 2016/2026              | 1.250               | 500                   | Deutsche Post AG | 499                      | 472              |  | 499                      | 486              |  |\n| Bond 2017/2027              | 1.000               | 500                   | Deutsche Post AG | 497                      | 452              |  | 498                      | 469              |  |\n| Bond 2018/2028              | 1.625               | 750                   | Deutsche Post AG | 744                      | 690              |  | 745                      | 716              |  |\n| Bond 2020/2026              | 0.375               | 750                   | Deutsche Post AG | 747                      | 688              |  | 748                      | 706              |  |\n| Bond 2020/2029              | 0.750               | 750                   | Deutsche Post AG | 748                      | 649              |  | 748                      | 687              |  |\n| Bond 2020/2032              | 1.000               | 750                   | Deutsche Post AG | 747                      | 610              |  | 747                      | 669              |  |\n| Bond 2023/2033              | 3.375               | 500                   | Deutsche Post AG | n.a.                     | n.a.             |  | 498                      | 512              |  |\n| Convertible bond 2017/20251 | 0.050               | 1,000                 | Deutsche Post AG | 982                      | 914              |  | 989                      | 950              |  |\n\n1 Fair value of the debt component; the fair value of the convertible bond 2017/2025 is €980 million (previous year: €956 million).\n\n#### Convertible bond\n\nThe convertible bond issued carries a conversion right that allows holders to convert the bond into a predetermined number of Deutsche Post AG shares.\n\nIn addition, Deutsche Post AG was granted a call option allowing it to repay the bond early at face value plus accrued interest if Deutsche Post AG's share price more than temporarily exceeds 130% of the conversion price applicable at that time. The convertible bond has a debt component and an equity component. In subsequent years, interest will be added to the carrying amount of the bond, up to the issue amount, using the effective interest method and recognized in profit or loss.\n\n{191}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/191/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The leased aircraft are predominantly deployed in the air network of the Express segment. The additions also relate to the renewal of the aircraft fleet. Leased transport equipment also includes the leased vehicle fleet. The real estate leases in particular are long-term leases. The Group had 84 real estate leases with remaining lease terms of more than 20 years as of December 31, 2023 (previous year: 77 leases). Aircraft leases have remaining lease terms of up to 15 years (previous year: 14 years). Leases may include extension and termination options, **[note 7.](#page-137-0)** The leases are negotiated individually and include a wide range of different conditions.\n\n{193}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-193-0\"></span>Image /page/193/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters \"DHL\" is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nFuture cash outflows amounted to €17 billion (previous year: €16 billion) as of the reporting date, **[note 43.](#page-195-0)** Possible future cash outflows amounting to €4.2 billion (previous year: €3.6 billion) were not included in lease liabilities because it is not reasonably certain that the leases will be extended (or not terminated). Leases that the Group has entered into as a lessee but that have not yet commenced result in possible future payment outflows totaling €2.3 billion (previous year: €2.6 billion), which primarily result from the renewal of the aircraft fleet.

The interest payments reported in the cash flow statement also include payments that do not relate to liabilities from financing activities.\n\nAs of the reporting date, there were no hedges attributable solely to the liabilities arising from financing activities. The effects on cash flows from hedges are presented in the \"Other financing activities\" cash flow item in the amount of €–152 million.\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, noncash transactions were entered into that were not included in the cash flow statement in accordance with IAS 7.43 and 7.44. These relate to the exchange of land and separate building ownership between Deutsche Post AG and Deutsche Post Pensions-Treuhand GmbH & Co. KG. Although income was recognized as a result of the transaction, no cash or cash equivalents were received.\n\n{194}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-194-0\"></span>Image /page/194/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The background is yellow.\n\n#### 42.1 Net cash from operating activities\n\nAt €9,258 million, net cash from operating activities came in €1,707 million lower than the prior-year figure of €10,965 million. Income taxes paid declined by €157 million to €1,625 million. Income from the increase in the shareholding in DHL Logistics contributed primarily to the increase in noncash income and expenses from €–31 million to €–336 million. Cash inflow from the change in working capital amounted to €536 million, an increase of €321 million compared with the prior year.\n\nOther noncash income and expenses are as follows:\n\n#### OTHER NONCASH INCOME AND EXPENSES\n\n| €m                                                                         | 2022 | 2023 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Expenses from the remeasurement of assets                                  | 150  | 39   |\n| Income from the remeasurement of liabilities                               | -303 | -367 |\n| Staff costs relating to equity-settled share-based payments                | 100  | 108  |\n| Net expenses/income from investments accounted for using the equity method | 39   | -115 |\n| Other                                                                      | -17  | -1   |\n| Other noncash income (–) and expenses (+)                                  | -31  | -336 |\n\n#### 42.2 Net cash used in investing activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities fell from €3,179 million to €2,181 million. In the previous year, this included, among other items, the net purchase price payment of €1,379 million for the acquisition of Hillebrand. Cash paid to acquire property, plant and equipment and intangible assets decreased by €531 million to €3,381 million. Investing activities focused on, for example, the ongoing expansion and renewal of the air fleet and network infrastructure. The cash inflow from the change in current financial assets decreased from €1,664 million to €963 million. In the previous year, money market funds were sold to enable payment of the purchase price of subsidiaries and other business units in the amount of €1,613 million, in addition to the payment of the dividend.\n\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the course of acquisitions of material and immaterial companies undertaken in the 2023 fiscal year are presented in the following table:\n\n| ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED              |      |      |\n|------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| €m                                                   | 2022 | 2023 |\n| Noncurrent assets                                    | 283  | 110  |\n| Current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) | 547  | 81   |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                            | 82   | 28   |\n| Noncurrent provisions and liabilities                | -422 | -79  |\n| Current provisions and liabilities                   | -557 | -88  |\n\n#### 42.3 Net cash used in financing activities\n\nAt €6,898 million, net cash used in financing activities came in €513 million lower than the prior-year figure of €7,411 million. The placement of the sustainability-linked bond is reflected in the assumption of noncurrent financial liabilities in the amount of €501 million. Despite the higher dividend per share, the dividend distribution to the shareholders remained unchanged at €2,205 million. Share buybacks led to payments in the amount of €986 million for the acquisition of treasury shares, thereby coming in below the level of the previous year (€1,099 million).\n\n{195}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-195-0\"></span>Image /page/195/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The background of the image is yellow.\n\n### Other disclosures\n\n#### 43 Risks and financial instruments of the Group\n\n#### 43.1 Risk management\n\nAs a result of its operating activities, the Group is exposed to financial risks that may arise from changes in exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. DHL Group manages these risks centrally through the use of nonderivative and derivative financial instruments. Derivatives are used exclusively to mitigate nonderivative financial risks, and fluctuations in their fair value should not be assessed separately from the underlying transaction.\n\nThe Group's internal risk guidelines govern the universe of actions, responsibilities and necessary controls regarding the use of derivatives. Financial transactions are recorded, assessed and processed using proven risk management software, which also regularly documents the effectiveness of hedging relationships. Portfolios of derivatives are regularly reconciled with the banks concerned.\n\nTo limit counterparty risk from financial transactions, the Group may only enter into this type of contract with prime-rated banks. The conditions for the counterparty limits individually assigned to the banks are reviewed on a daily basis. The Group's Board of Management is informed internally at regular intervals about existing financial risks and the hedging instruments deployed to mitigate them. Financial instruments are accounted for and measured and hedge accounting is carried out in accordance with IFRS 9.\n\nDisclosures regarding risks associated with the Group's defined benefit retirement plans and their mitigation can be found in **[note 37.5.](#page-187-0)**\n\n#### Liquidity management\n\nThe ultimate objective of liquidity management is to secure the solvency of DHL Group and all Group companies. Consequently, liquidity in the Group is centralized as much as possible in cash pools and managed in the Corporate Center.\n\nThe centrally available liquidity reserves (funding availability), consisting of central short-term financial investments and committed credit lines, are the key control parameter. The target is to have at least €2 billion available in a central credit line.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Group had central liquidity reserves of €3.3 billion (previous year: €4 billion), consisting of central financial investments amounting to €1.3 billion plus a syndicated credit facility of €2 billion.\n\nThe maturity structure of nonderivative financial liabilities within the scope of IFRS 7 based on cash flows is as follows:\n\n{196}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/196/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

                   |\n\nThe contract terms stipulate how the parties must meet their obligations arising from derivative financial instruments, either by net or by gross settlement.\n\n#### Currency risk and currency management\n\nThe international business activities of DHL Group expose it to currency risks from recognized or planned future transactions:\n\nOn-balance-sheet currency risks arise from the measurement and settlement of recognized foreign currency items if the exchange rate on the measurement or settlement date differs from the rate at initial recognition. The resulting foreign exchange differences directly impact profit or loss. In order to mitigate this impact as far as possible, all significant on-balance-sheet currency risks within the Group are centralized in Deutsche Post AG's in-house bank function. The centralized currency risks are aggregated by Corporate Treasury to calculate a net position per currency and hedged externally based on value-at-risk limits. The currencyrelated value at risk (95%/one-month holding period) for the portfolio totaled €7 million (previous year: €6 million) as of the reporting date; the limit is currently a maximum of €5 million. The notional amount of the currency forwards and currency swaps used to manage on-balance-sheet currency risks amounted to €6,858 million as of the reporting date (previous year: €6,101 million); the fair value was €53 million (previous year: €–86 million). Hedge accounting was not applied. Derivatives are accounted for as trading derivatives (freestanding derivatives).\n\nCurrency risks arise from planned foreign-currency transactions if the future transactions are settled at exchange rates that differ from the originally projected rates. These currency risks are also captured centrally in Corporate Treasury. Currency risks from planned future transactions are only hedged in selected cases. The relevant hedged items and derivatives used for hedging purposes are accounted for using cash flow hedge accounting, **[note 43.3.](#page-202-0)**\n\n{198}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/198/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in black.\n\nCurrency risks also result from translating assets and liabilities of foreign operations into the Group's currency (translation risk). No translation risks were hedged as of the reporting date.\n\nCurrency forwards and currency swaps in a total notional amount of €7,073 million (previous year: €7,130 million) were outstanding as of the reporting date. The corresponding fair value was €–40 million (previous year: €–55 million).\n\nIFRS 7 requires the disclosure of quantitative risk data, showing how profit or loss and equity are affected by changes in exchange rates as of the reporting date. The impact of these changes in exchange rates on the portfolio of foreign currency financial instruments is assessed by means of a value-at-risk calculation (95% confidence/one-month holding period). It is assumed that the portfolio as of the reporting date is representative for the full year. The following assumptions are used as a basis for the sensitivity analysis:\n\nPrimary financial instruments in foreign currencies used by Group companies are hedged by Deutsche Post AG's in-house bank. Deutsche Post AG determines monthly exchange rates and guarantees these to the Group companies. Exchange-rate-related changes therefore have no effect on the profit or loss and equity of the Group companies. Where Group companies are not permitted to participate in in-house banking for legal reasons, their currency risks from primary financial instruments are fully hedged locally through the use of derivatives. They therefore have no impact on the Group's risk position.\n\nThe following table presents currency-related effects on value at risk. The information is subject to the limitations of the model, which is based on historical volatilities and correlations and thus has limited informative value regarding actual future risks. In addition, the actual risks can fall outside of the 95% confidence level and therefore be significantly higher:\n\n#### RISK DATA ON CURRENCY RISK\n\n|                                                            | 2022                   |                | 2023                   |                |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------|------------------------|----------------|\n| €m                                                         | Profit or loss effects | Equity effects | Profit or loss effects | Equity effects |\n| Primary financial instruments and freestanding derivatives | 6                      |                | 7                      |                |\n| Derivative instruments (cash flow hedges)                  |                        | 21             |                        | 5              |\n| Total value at risk1                                       |                        | 24             |                        | 8              |\n\n1 The total amount is lower than the sum of the individual amounts, owing to interdependencies.\n\n#### Interest rate risk and interest rate management\n\nAs of the reporting date, there were no outstanding interest rate hedging instruments. In the previous year, interest rate hedging instruments with a notional amount of €500 million and a fair value of €57 million were recognized, **[note 43.3.](#page-202-0)**\n\nPrimary variable-rate financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and must, therefore, be included in the sensitivity analysis. All fixed-income financial instruments measured at amortized cost are not subject to interest rate risk. If the market interest rate level as of December 31, 2023, had been 100 basis points higher, the net financial result would have improved by €31 million (previous year: €32 million). A decline in interest rates by 100 basis points would have had the opposite effect. There was no interest rate risk with an impact on equity as of the reporting date.\n\nThe proportion of financial liabilities with short-term interest lock-ins, **[note 39,](#page-189-0)** amounts to 22% (previous year: 19%) of the total financial liabilities as of the reporting date. The effect of potential interest rate changes on the Group's financial position remains insignificant.\n\n{199}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/199/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and is made up of thick, stylized letters with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. Below the DHL part of the logo, the word \"Group\" is written in red.\n\n#### Market risk\n\nMost of the risks arising from commodity price fluctuations, in particular fluctuating prices for kerosene and marine diesel fuels, were passed on to customers via operating measures. As the impact of the related fuel surcharges is delayed by one to two months, earnings may be affected temporarily if there are significant short-term fuel price variations.\n\nThe remaining fuel price risk is partly hedged with swap transactions in the notional amount of €80 million (previous year: €1 million) and a fair value of €–4 million (previous year: €1 million) running until the end of 2025.\n\nCommodity price risks also result from the ongoing purchase of natural gas and electricity. Swap transactions with a notional amount of €25 million (previous year: €24 million) were outstanding as of the reporting date. The corresponding fair value was €–14 million (previous year: €–9 million). A 10% increase in the market prices of the commodities underlying the derivatives as of the reporting date would have increased fair values and equity by €9 million (previous year: €1 million). A corresponding decline in commodity prices would have had the opposite effect.\n\nThe Group received share price options as part of the conclusion of contracts from operational and M&A transactions. As of the reporting date, share price options with a notional amount of €250 million (previous year: €252 million) and a term of two to six years were outstanding. The corresponding fair value was €25 million (previous year: €33 million).\n\nA 10% increase in the share prices underlying the derivatives as of the reporting date would have increased fair values and the financial result by €7 million (previous year: €8 million). A corresponding decrease in the share prices would have had an effect of €–6 million (previous year: €–7 million).\n\n#### Credit risk\n\nCredit risk arises for the Group from operating activities and from financial transactions. The aggregate carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum default risk.\n\nIn an effort to minimize credit risk from operating activities and financial transactions, counterparties are assigned individual limits, the utilization of which is regularly monitored. The Group's heterogeneous customer structure means that there is no risk concentration. Financial transactions are only entered into with prime-rated counterparties.\n\nThe credit risk of financial assets arising from operations is managed by the divisions.\n\nThe expected credit loss associated with financial assets must be determined if they fall under the impairment model of IFRS 9. Based on the expected credit loss model (impairment model), a loss allowance must be anticipated for the expected credit loss, **[note 7.](#page-137-0)**\n\nThe following table documents the loss allowance for all debt instruments recognized at amortized cost, such as deposits, collateral provided and loans to third parties, and for lease receivables. This does not include trade receivables without a significant financing component and contract assets.\n\n{200}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/200/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

There were no indications as of the reporting date of any poor performance of the debt instruments and lease receivables. There was no reclassification between the stages in the fiscal year.\n\nTrade receivables from customer relationships amounting to €10,537 million were due within one year as of the reporting date (previous year: €12,253 million). They are held primarily with the aim of collecting the principal amount of the receivables. These items are therefore assigned to the \"held to collect contractual cash flows\" business model and measured at amortized cost. Trade receivables changed as follows:\n\n#### CHANGES IN RECEIVABLES\n\n| €m                                | 2022   | 2023   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Gross receivables                 |        |        |\n| Balance as of January 1           | 11,971 | 12,581 |\n| Changes                           | 610    | -1,784 |\n| Balance as of December 31         | 12,581 | 10,797 |\n| Loss allowances                   |        |        |\n| Balance as of January 1           | -288   | -328   |\n| Changes                           | -40    | 68     |\n| Balance as of December 31         | -328   | -260   |\n| Carrying amount as of December 31 | 12,253 | 10,537 |\n\n{201}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/201/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The banks' purchase obligations were limited to a maximum portfolio of receivables of €241 million (previous year: €501 million). DHL Group can decide at its discretion whether, and to what extent, the revolving notional volume is utilized. The risks relevant to the derecognition of the receivables include credit risk and the risk of delayed payment (late payment risk).\n\nCredit risk represents primarily all the risks and rewards associated with ownership of the receivables. This risk is transferred in full to the bank against payment of a fixed fee for doubtful accounts. A significant late-payment risk does not exist. All of the receivables were therefore derecognized. In the 2023 fiscal year, the Group recognized program fees (interest, allowances for doubtful accounts) of €0.3 million (previous year: €0.5 million) as an expense. The notional volume of receivables factored as of December 31, 2023, amounted to €4 million (previous year: €15 million).\n\n#### 43.2 Collateral\n\n#### COLLATERAL PROVIDED\n\n| €m                                                                   | 2022 | 2023 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Noncurrent collateral                                                | 162  | 149  |\n| of which for assets for the settlement of residential building loans | 29   | 22   |\n| of which for sureties paid                                           | 114  | 117  |\n| Current collateral                                                   | 53   | 36   |\n| of which for restricted cash                                         | 0    | 0    |\n| of which for sureties paid                                           | 42   | 17   |\n\nThe collateral provided relates primarily to sureties paid and restricted cash.\n\n{202}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-202-0\"></span>Image /page/202/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The notional amount of these currency forwards and currency swaps amounted to €215 million (previous year: €1,029 million) at a fair value of €13 million (previous year: €31 million). The hedged items will have an impact on cash flow by 2028.\n\nOf the unrealized gains or losses from currency derivatives recognized in equity as of December 31, 2023, €11 million (previous year: €20 million) is expected to be recognized in profit or loss in the course of the following year.\n\nThe following table shows the net open hedging positions as of the reporting date in the currency pairs with the highest net positions and their weighted hedge rate:\n\n#### NOTIONAL VOLUME OF HEDGING INSTRUMENTS\n\n|                                |                       | Remaining term |                   |                   |                      |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| €m                             | Total notional volume | Up to 1 year   | 1 year to 5 years | More than 5 years | Average hedge rate € |\n| December 31, 2023              |                       |                |                   |                   |                      |\n| Hedges of currency risk        |                       |                |                   |                   |                      |\n| Currency forwards sell EUR/CZK | 161                   | 135            | 26                |                   | 26.93                |\n| Currency forwards buy EUR/USD  | 18                    | 18             |                   |                   | 1.09                 |\n| Currency forwards sell USD/CNY | 12                    | 12             |                   |                   | 7.07                 |\n| December 31, 2022              |                       |                |                   |                   |                      |\n| Hedges of currency risk        |                       |                |                   |                   |                      |\n| Currency forwards buy EUR/GBP  | 546                   | 546            |                   |                   | 0.88                 |\n| Currency forwards sell EUR/CZK | 364                   | 204            | 158               | 2                 | 26.53                |\n| Currency forwards buy EUR/HUF  | 47                    | 47             |                   |                   | 446.46               |\n\nInterest rate risks were not hedged at the end of 2023. An amount of €49 million is recognized in the hedge reserve from cash flow hedges that were reversed as part of the issue of the 2023/2033 bond. This amount is amortized over the originally hedged term until 2031 and reduces the future interest expense.\n\nIn addition, as part of cash flow hedging, fuel, electricity and natural gas price risks were hedged with corresponding swap transactions in the notional amount of €104 million (previous year: €25 million) and a fair value of €-18 million (previous year: €–8 million) running until the end of 2025. Only the product price component of the energy price was designated as the hedged item. In the fiscal year under review, €0 million (previous year: €17 million) in realized effects from cash flow hedges for commodity price risks were recognized in material expense.\n\nThe total gains and losses on open hedging instruments recognized in equity as of the reporting date amounted to €–5 million (previous year: €82 million).\n\n{203}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/203/Figure/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo is red and consists of the letters \"DHL\" in a bold, stylized font, with three horizontal lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller, sans-serif font. The background is yellow.\n\nAs in the previous year, carrying amounts of derivative assets amounting to €14 million (previous year: €91 million) and derivative liabilities amounting to €-19 million (previous year: €-10 million) included in cash flow hedges did not result in ineffectiveness within the period. This is because the changes in the fair value of the hedged items and hedging transactions offset each other.\n\n#### DISCLOSURES ON DESIGNATED HEDGED ITEMS AND HEDGING TRANSACTIONS\n\n| €m

Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nIf there is an active market for a financial instrument (e.g., a stock exchange), its fair value is determined by reference to the market or quoted exchange price as of the reporting date. If no fair value is available in an active market, quoted market prices for similar instruments or recognized valuation models are used to determine fair value.\n\nIFRS 13 requires financial assets to be assigned to the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy:\n\nLevel 1 comprises equity and debt instruments measured at fair value and debt instruments measured at amortized cost whose fair values can be determined based on quoted market prices.\n\nIn addition to financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortized cost, commodity, interest rate and currency derivatives are reported under Level 2. The fair values of assets measured at amortized cost are determined using the multiplier method, among other things. The fair values of the derivatives are measured on the basis of discounted expected future cash flows, taking into account forward rates for currencies, interest rates and commodities (market approach). For this purpose, price quotations observable in the market (exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices) are imported from standard market information platforms into the treasury management system. The price quotations reflect actual transactions involving similar instruments on an active market. All significant inputs used to measure derivatives are observable in the market.\n\nAs of the reporting date, a call option and warrants are recognized under Level 3 that entitle the holder to acquire further shares in the company. The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are determined on the basis of the Black Scholes option pricing model. If possible, parameters observable on the market or derived from market data are used to determine the value. A volatility of 41% is taken into account for the call option and a volatility of 39% for the warrants. The volatilities are based on the volatilities of a comparable group of companies. No major fluctuations in earnings are to be expected with regard to the call option in the future. Because the warrants are based on a listed underlying share, there could be earnings fluctuations in the subsequent years.\n\n#### UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3)\n\n|                                           |      | Assets equity derivatives |  |\n|-------------------------------------------|------|---------------------------|--|\n| €m                                        | 2022 | 2023                      |  |\n| Balance as of January 1                   | 0    | 33                        |  |\n| Profit recognized in the income statement | 18   | 8                         |  |\n| Losses recognized in the income statement | -43  | -16                       |  |\n| Additions                                 | 58   | 0                         |  |\n| Balance as of December 31                 | 33   | 25                        |  |\n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/211/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

These contracts are subject to a standardized master agreement for financial derivative transactions. This agreement provides for a conditional right of offset, resulting in the recognition of the gross amount of the financial derivative transactions as of the reporting date. The conditional right of offset is presented in the tables.\n\nSettlement processes arising from services related to postal deliveries are subject to the Universal Postal Convention and the Letter-mail INTERCONNECT Remuneration Agreement – Europe (LIRAE). These agreements, particularly the settlement conditions, are binding on all public postal operators in respect of the specified contractual arrangements. Imports and exports between the parties to the agreement during a calendar year are summarized in an annual statement of account and presented on a net basis in the final annual statement. Receivables and payables covered by the Universal Postal Convention and the LIRAE are presented on a net basis as of the reporting date. In addition, funds are presented on a net basis if a right of offset exists in the normal course of business. The tables show the receivables and payables before and after offsetting.\n\n#### 44 Contingent liabilities and other financial obligations\n\nIn addition to provisions and liabilities, the Group has contingent liabilities and other financial obligations. The contingent liabilities are broken down as follows:\n\n#### CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\n| €m                                | 2022 | 2023  |\n|-----------------------------------|------|-------|\n| Guarantee obligations             | 119  | 97    |\n| Warranties                        | 11   | 10    |\n| Liabilities from litigation risks | 258  | 264   |\n| Other contingent liabilities      | 523  | 756   |\n| Total                             | 911  | 1,127 |\n\nThe other contingent liabilities also include possible obligations from tax-related items.\n\nOther financial obligations such as the purchase obligation for investments in noncurrent assets amounted to €1,517 million (previous year: €2,668 million). They relate primarily to the delivery of additional cargo aircraft as well as obligations from fleet management.\n\n{213}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-213-0\"></span>Image /page/213/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of a stylized font with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. The word \"Group\" is in red and is located to the right and below the DHL letters. The background is yellow.\n\n#### 45 Litigation\n\nMany of the postal services rendered by Deutsche Post AG and its subsidiaries (particularly the Post & Parcel Germany division) are subject to sector-specific regulation on the basis of German postal legislation by the German federal network agency (*Bundesnetzagentur*). The German federal network agency approves or reviews prices, formulates the terms of downstream access, has special supervisory powers to combat market abuse and guarantees the provision of universal postal services. This general regulatory risk could lead to a decline in revenue and earnings in the event of negative decisions. Revenue and earnings risk can arise from the price cap procedure used to determine the rates for letter mail.\n\nThe approval of the rates for individual pieces of letter mail for the period from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2024, was issued by the German federal network agency on April 29, 2022. An association from the CEP sector and customers have filed an action with the Cologne Administrative Court against this price cap approval of the German federal network agency for the years 2022 to 2024. The proceedings are still pending. The aforementioned CEP association, as well as postal service providers and other customers, had previously filed an action with the Cologne Administrative Court against the pricing approval granted as part of the price cap procedure for the years 2016 to 2018 and 2019 to 2021. In a ruling issued on August 17, 2022, the Cologne Administrative Court overturned the approval for the years 2019 to 2021 in relation to the association as well as the postal service providers as a result of a ruling of the German Federal Administrative Court from May 27, 2020, due to a formal legal error in the context of the underlying legal ordinance. This formal legal error was rectified by the German government through an amendment to the German Postal Act that took effect in March 2021. The Cologne Administrative Court denied the claims of some customers because they had expired. The Cologne Administrative Court has not yet reached a decision on the other mentioned claims against the price cap approvals. The association's additional application to be granted a new approval for the years 2019 to 2021 was denied by the Cologne Administrative Court. The association has filed an appeal to this ruling with the German Federal Administrative Court, as have the two customers who were completely unsuccessful in their claims with the Cologne Administrative Court; the appeals with the German Federal Administrative Court are still pending. The rulings of the Cologne Administrative Court from August 17, 2022, are only applicable to the legal relationships with the respective plaintiffs and have no legal impact vis-à-vis other consumers.\n\nOne postal service provider, which had also filed an action against the pricing approval for the years 2019 to 2021 with the Cologne Administrative Court, also filed an additional civil suit for repayment of allegedly excessive conveyance fees for standard letters delivered in 2017. The action is based primarily on the claim that Deutsche Post charged postage whose approval is unlawful pursuant to the ruling of the German Federal Administrative Court from May 27, 2020. The action was denied by the Cologne District Court in a ruling from June 17, 2021. The cartel court of the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court denied the appeal of this ruling on April 6, 2022, and did not permit any further appeals of the ruling. On May 2, 2022, the plaintiff submitted an appeal against nonpermission with Germany's Federal Court of Justice to have its appeal allowed.\n\nPossible negative effects on Deutsche Post of these court rulings and the proceedings underway cannot be ruled out.\n\nSince July 1, 2010, as a result of the revision of the relevant tax exemption provisions, the VAT exemption has only applied to those specific universal services in Germany that are not subject to individually negotiated agreements or provided on special terms (discounts, etc.). Deutsche Post AG and the tax authorities hold different opinions on the VAT treatment of certain products. In the interest of resolving these issues, proceedings have been initiated by Deutsche Post AG at the tax court with jurisdiction in this matter, **[note 44.](#page-212-0)**\n\nIf the interests of the company are significantly impaired as part of the aforementioned proceedings, in accordance with IAS 37.92, no further disclosures are made on the presentation of legal disputes, estimates of the financial effects and uncertainties, as well as the recognition and amount of contingent liabilities and provisions.\n\n{214}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/214/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo is red and consists of the letters \"DHL\" in a stylized font, with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font.\n\n#### 46 Share-based payment\n\nAssumptions regarding the price of Deutsche Post AG's shares and assumptions regarding employee fluctuation are taken into account when measuring the value of share-based payments for executives. All assumptions are reviewed on a quarterly basis. The staff costs are recognized pro rata in profit or loss to reflect the services rendered as consideration during the vesting period (lockup period). In the fiscal year, a total of €194 million (previous year: €140 million) was recognized for share-based payments, €86 million (previous year: €40 million) of which were cash-settled and €108 million (previous year: €100 million) of which were equity-settled.\n\n#### 46.1 Share-based payment for executives (Share Matching Scheme)\n\nUnder the share-based payment system for executives (Share Matching Scheme), certain executives receive part of their variable remuneration for the fiscal year in the form of shares of Deutsche Post AG in the following year (deferred incentive shares). All Group executives can specify an increased equity component individually by converting a further portion of their variable remuneration for the fiscal year (investment shares). After a four-year lockup period during which the executive must be employed by the Group, they again receive the same number of Deutsche Post AG shares (matching shares). Assumptions are made regarding the conversion behavior of executives with respect to their relevant bonus portion. Share-based payment arrangements are entered into each year, with December 1 of the respective year and April 1 of the following year being the grant dates for each year's tranche. Whereas deferred incentive shares and matching shares are classified as equity-settled share-based payments, investment shares are compound financial instruments and the debt and equity components must be measured separately. However, in accordance with IFRS 2.37, only the debt component is measured due to the provisions of the Share Matching Scheme. The investment shares are therefore treated as cash-settled share-based payments.\n\nOf the expenses under the Share Matching Scheme, €63 million (previous year: €57 million) was attributable to equity-settled share-based payments. A total of €53 million related to cash-settled payments for investment shares (previous year: €64 million), all of which were unvested as of December 31, 2023.\n\nAdditional information on the granting and settlement of these rights can be found in **[note 33](#page-175-0) [and 34.](#page-178-0)** \n\n#### SHARE MATCHING SCHEME\n\n|                                                                           |           | Alternative<br>program |               |               |               |               |               |              |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|\n|                                                                           |           |                        | 2018 tranche  | 2019 tranche  | 2020 tranche  | 2021 tranche  | 2022 tranche  | 2023 tranche |\n| Grant date of deferred incentive shares and associated<br>matching shares |           | –                      | Dec. 1, 2019  | Dec. 1, 2020  | Dec. 1, 2021  | Dec. 1, 2022  | Dec. 1, 2023  |              |\n| Grant date of matching shares awarded for investment shares               |           | March 1, 2019          | April 1, 2020 | April 1, 2021 | April 1, 2022 | April 1, 2023 | April 1, 2024 |              |\n| Term                                                                      | months    |                        | 52            | 52            | 52            | 52            | 52            | 52           |\n| End of term                                                               |           |                        | June 2023     | March 2024    | March 2025    | March 2026    | March 2027    | March 2028   |\n| Share price as of grant date (fair value)                                 |           |                        |               |               |               |               |               |              |\n| Deferred incentive shares and associated matching<br>shares               | €         |                        | n.a.          | 33.29         | 40.72         | 53.55         | 38.17         | 43.92        |\n| Matching shares awarded for investment shares                             | €         |                        | 27.30         | 23.83         | 46.52         | 42.50         | 42.56         | 46.001       |\n| Number of deferred incentive shares                                       | thousands |                        | n.a.          | 369           | 246           | 293           | 263           | 1742         |\n| Number of matching shares expected                                        |           |                        |               |               |               |               |               |              |\n| Deferred incentive shares                                                 | thousands |                        | n.a.          | 332           | 222           | 264           | 237           | 174          |\n| Investment shares                                                         | thousands |                        | 854           | 1,343         | 1,007         | 1,245         | 1,232         | 845          |\n| Matching shares issued                                                    | thousands |                        | 830           |               |               |               |               |              |\n\n1 Estimated provisional amount; the final amount will be determined on April 1, 2024.\n\n2 Expected number.\n\n{215}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/215/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### 46.2 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for members of the Board of Management\n\nSince the 2006 fiscal year, the company has granted members of the Board of Management cash remuneration linked to the company's long-term share price performance through the issue of stock appreciation rights (SARs) as part of a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Participation in the LTIP requires Board of Management members to make a personal investment of 10% of their annual base salary by the grant date of each tranche, primarily in shares.\n\nThe SARs granted can be fully or partly exercised after the expiration of a four-year lockup period at the earliest, provided absolute or relative performance targets have been achieved at the end of this lockup period. After expiration of the lockup period, the SARs must be exercised within a period of two years (exercise period); any SARs not exercised expire.\n\nHow many, if any, of the SARs granted can be exercised is determined in accordance with four (absolute) performance targets based on the share price and two (relative) performance targets based on a benchmark index. One-sixth of the SARs granted are earned each time the closing price of Deutsche Post shares exceeds the issue price by at least 10% 15% 20% or 25% at the end of the waiting period (absolute performance targets). Both relative performance targets are tied to the performance of the shares in relation to the STOXX Europe 600 Index (SXXP; ISIN EU0009658202). They are met if the share price equals the index performance or if it outperforms the index by more than 10%. Performance is determined by comparing the average price of Deutsche Post shares and the average index value during a reference and a performance period. The reference period comprises the last 20 consecutive trading days prior to the issue date. The performance period is the last 60 trading days before the end of the lockup period. The average (closing) price is calculated as the average closing price of Deutsche Post shares in Deutsche Börse AG's Xetra trading system. If absolute or relative performance targets are not met by the end of the lockup period, the SARs attributable to them will expire without replacement or compensation. Each SAR exercised entitles the Board of Management member to receive a cash settlement equal to the difference between the average closing price of Deutsche Post shares for the five trading days preceding the exercise date and the exercise price of the SAR.\n\n#### LTIP\n\n|                        | 2017 tranche  | 2018 tranche  | 2019 tranche  | 2020 tranche  | 2021 tranche  | 2022 tranche  | 2023 tranche  |\n|------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Issue date             | Sept. 1, 2017 | Sept. 1, 2018 | Sept. 1, 2019 | Sept. 1, 2020 | Sept. 1, 2021 | Sept. 1, 2022 | Sept. 1, 2023 |\n| Issue price            | €34.72        | €31.08        | €28.88        | €37.83        | €58.68        | €39.06        | €43.26        |\n| Waiting period expires | Aug. 31, 2021 | Aug. 31, 2022 | Aug. 31, 2023 | Aug. 31, 2024 | Aug. 31, 2025 | Aug. 31, 2026 | Aug. 31, 2027 |\n\nThe Board of Management members received a total of 819,474 SARs (previous year: 1,176,006 SARs) with a total value, at the time of issue, of €8.0 million (previous year: €9.3 million).\n\nA stochastic simulation model is used to determine a fair value for the SARs from the LTIP. The result in the 2023 fiscal year was an expense of €32 million (previous year: income of €24 million) and a provision as of the reporting date of €27 million (previous year: €14 million). This includes the provision for the rights exercisable by the Board of Management. It amounted to €18 million as of the reporting date (previous year: €4 million).\n\nFor further disclosures on share-based payment for members of the Board of Management, see **[note 47.2.](#page-218-0)**\n\n#### 46.3 Performance Share Plan (PSP) for executives\n\nThe Annual General Meeting on May 27, 2014, resolved to introduce the Performance Share Plan (PSP) for executives. Under the PSP, shares are issued to participants at the end of the waiting period. The granting of the shares at the end of the waiting period is linked to the achievement of demanding performance targets. The performance targets under the PSP are identical to the performance targets under the LTIP for members of the Board of Management.\n\nPerformance Share Units (PSUs) were issued to selected executives for the first time on September 1, 2014. It is not planned that members of the Board of Management will participate in the PSP. The LTIP for members of the Board of Management remains unchanged.\n\n{216}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-216-0\"></span>Image /page/216/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, a total of €28 million (previous year: €27 million) has been appropriated to capital reserves for the purposes of the plan, with an equal amount recognized in staff costs.\n\nThe value of the PSP is measured using actuarial methods based on option pricing models (fair value measurement). Future dividends were taken into account, based on a moderate increase in dividend distributions over the respective measurement period.\n\nThe average remaining maturity of the outstanding PSUs as of December 31, 2023, was 27 months.\n\n#### PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN\n\n|                                                                      | 2019 tranche  | 2020 tranche  | 2021 tranche  | 2022 tranche  | 2023 tranche  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Grant date                                                           | Sept. 1, 2019 | Sept. 1, 2020 | Sept. 1, 2021 | Sept. 1, 2022 | Sept. 1, 2023 |\n| Exercise price                                                       | €28.88        | €37.83        | €58.68        | €39.06        | 43.26         |\n| Waiting period expires                                               | Aug. 31, 2023 | Aug. 31, 2024 | Aug. 31, 2025 | Aug. 31, 2026 | Aug. 31, 2027 |\n| Risk-free interest rate                                              | -0.90%        | -0.72%        | -0.80%        | 0.71%         | 2.60%         |\n| Initial dividend yield of Deutsche Post shares                       | 3.98%         | 3.57%         | 3.07%         | 4.74%         | 4.28%         |\n| Yield volatility of Deutsche Post shares                             | 21.38%        | 24.89%        | 26.49%        | 29.41%        | 30.71%        |\n| Yield volatility of Dow Jones EURO STOXX 600 Index                   | 14.79%        | 16.62%        | 17.33%        | 18.90%        | 19.10%        |\n| Covariance of Deutsche Post shares to Dow Jones EURO STOXX 600 Index | 2.21%         | 3.05%         | 3.25%         | 4.07%         | 4.32%         |\n| Number                                                               |               |               |               |               |               |\n| Rights outstanding as of January 1, 2023                             | 3,212,130     | 2,504,238     | 1,716,828     | 2,794,596     | 0             |\n| Rights granted                                                       | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 2,578,212     |\n| Rights lapsed                                                        | 59,466        | 62,202        | 44,244        | 71,880        | 3,150         |\n| Rights settled at the end of the waiting period                      | 3,152,664     | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             |\n| Rights outstanding as of December 31, 2023                           | 0             | 2,442,036     | 1,672,584     | 2,722,716     | 2,575,062     |\n\n#### 46.4 Employee Share Plan (ESP) for executives\n\nThe Employee Share Plan (ESP) was introduced for another selected group of executives starting on September 1, 2021. Participation in the ESP is voluntary. Executives participating in the ESP can acquire shares of Deutsche Post AG at a discount of 25% from the market price, up to an annual cap of €10,000 or €15,000, depending on their level. The ESP is offered quarterly. Prior to every savings period, the participating executives can choose the share of their remuneration they wish to invest in the ESP during the upcoming three-month savings period. At the beginning of the following quarter, executives receive shares at a discount of 25% from the market price. The shares acquired under the ESP are subject to a two-year lockup period.\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, a total of €17 million (previous year: €16 million) has been appropriated to capital reserves for the purposes of the ESP, with an equal amount recognized in staff costs.\n\n#### 46.5 myShares share program\n\nIn the fiscal year, a share program was developed that will initially be piloted in twelve countries starting on January 1, 2024. This program gives our employees the option to acquire shares in Deutsche Post AG at a reduced price. Participation in myShares is voluntary. Employees participating in the program can acquire shares of Deutsche Post AG at a discount of 15% from the market price, up to an annual cap of €3,600. myShares is offered on a quarterly basis. Prior to every savings period, the participating employees can choose the share of their remuneration they wish to invest during the upcoming three-month savings period. At the beginning of the following quarter, employees receive shares at a discount of 15% from the market price. The shares acquired as part of myShares are not subject to a lockup period.\n\n{217}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/217/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in bold, red, and italicized font. There are three horizontal red lines to the left of the DHL text. The word \"Group\" is in red and is located below the DHL text.\n\nNo amounts in capital reserves and, accordingly, in staff costs had been added in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, as the first savings period does not begin until January 2024.\n\n#### 47 Related-party disclosures\n\n#### 47.1 Related-party disclosures (companies and Federal Republic of Germany)\n\nAll companies that are controlled by the Group or with which a joint arrangement exists, or over which the Group can exercise significant influence, are recorded in the **[list of shareholdings.](https://group.dhl.com/content/dam/deutschepostdhl/en/media-center/investors/documents/annual-reports/DHL-Group-list-of-shareholdings-2023-12-31.pdf)**\n\nDeutsche Post AG maintains a variety of relationships with the Federal Republic of Germany (Federal Republic) and other companies controlled by the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nThe Federal Republic is a customer of Deutsche Post AG and as such uses the company's services. Deutsche Post AG has direct business relationships with the individual public authorities and other government agencies as independent individual customers. The services provided for these customers are insignificant in respect of Deutsche Post AG's overall revenue.\n\n#### Relationships with KfW\n\nKfW supports the Federal Republic in continuing to privatize companies such as Deutsche Post AG or Deutsche Telekom AG. In 1997, KfW, together with the Federal Republic, developed a \"placeholder model\" as a tool to privatize government-owned companies. Under this model, the Federal Republic sells all or part of its investments to KfW with the aim of fully privatizing these state-owned companies. On this basis, KfW has purchased shares of Deutsche Post AG from the Federal Republic in several stages since 1997 and executed various capital market transactions using these shares. KfW's interest in Deutsche Post AG's share capital is 20.49% as of December 31, 2023. Deutsche Post AG is thus considered to be an associate of the Federal Republic.\n\n#### Relationships with the Bundesanstalt für Post und Telekommunikation (BAnst PT)\n\nThe *Bundesanstalt für Post und Telekommunikation* (BAnst PT) is a government agency and falls under the technical and legal supervision of the German Federal Ministry of Finance. The BAnst PT continues to manage the social facilities such as the postal civil-servant health insurance fund, the recreation program, the *Postbeamtenversorgungskasse* (PVK – Postal civil-servant pension fund), the *Versorgungsanstalt der Deutschen Bundespost* (VAP – Deutsche Bundespost institution for supplementary retirement pensions) and the welfare service for Deutsche Post AG, Deutsche Bank AG (as legal successor to Deutsche Postbank AG) and Deutsche Telekom AG. Tasks are performed on the basis of agency agreements. In 2023, Deutsche Post AG was invoiced for €91 million (previous year: €85 million) in installment payments relating to services provided by the BAnst PT. Further disclosures on the PVK and the VAP can be found in **[note 7](#page-137-0) [and 37.](#page-181-0)**\n\n#### Relationships with Deutsche Bahn AG and its subsidiaries\n\nDeutsche Bahn AG is wholly owned by the Federal Republic. Owing to this control relationship, Deutsche Bahn AG is a related party to Deutsche Post AG. DHL Group has various business relationships with the Deutsche Bahn Group. These mainly consist of transport service agreements.\n\n#### Relationships with pension funds\n\nThe real estate with a fair value of €1,615 million (previous year: €1,689 million) – which can be offset as plan assets – of which Deutsche Post Pensions-Treuhand GmbH & Co. KG, Deutsche Post Altersvorsorge Sicherung e.V. & Co. Objekt Gronau KG and Deutsche Post Grundstücks-Vermietungsgesellschaft beta mbH Objekt Leipzig KG are the legal owners, is let almost exclusively to the Group via Deutsche Post Immobilien GmbH. These arrangements led to lease liabilities of €426 million as of December 31, 2023 (previous year: €445 million). In the 2023 fiscal year, Deutsche Post Immobilien GmbH extinguished €27 million (previous year: €26 million) in lease liabilities and paid €14 million (previous year: €14 million) in interest.\n\n{218}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-218-0\"></span>Image /page/218/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nIn the fiscal year, an exchange of land and separate building ownership was carried out between Deutsche Post AG and Deutsche Post Pensions-Treuhand GmbH & Co.

Dr. Tobias Meyer has been the new CEO since that date.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 24, transactions between the Group and related parties must be reported. Related parties are defined as the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board and the members of their families.\n\nThere were no reportable transactions or legal transactions involving these related parties in the 2023 fiscal year. In particular, the company granted no loans to these related parties.\n\n{219}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/219/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

These salaries are determined at levels that are commensurate with the salary appropriate for the function or work performed in the company.\n\nPostemployment benefits are recognized as the service cost resulting from the pension provisions for active members of the Board of Management. The corresponding liability amounted to €14 million as of the reporting date (previous year: €42 million).\n\nStarting in 2008, newly appointed Board of Management members began receiving a defined contribution pension commitment. This entails the company crediting an annual amount totaling 35% of each Board of Management member's base salary to a virtual pension account. This capital bears interest until eligibility to receive benefits begins. The pension benefit is paid out as capital in the amount of the accumulated pension balance. Pension eligibility is triggered at the earliest when retirement age is reached, in the event of invalidity during the term of office or upon death. When eligible for the pension benefit, the beneficiary may choose an annuity option.\n\n#### 47.3 Remuneration disclosures in accordance with the HGB\n\n#### Board of Management remuneration\n\nThe remuneration paid to members of the Board of Management in the 2023 fiscal year totaled €23.4 million (previous year: €26.9 million). This includes 819,474 SARs (previous year: 1,176,006 SARs), which, as of the issue date, were valued at €8.0 million (previous year: €9.3 million).\n\n#### Former members of the Board of Management\n\nBenefits paid to former members of the Board of Management and beneficiaries amounted to €38.9 million (previous year: €10.2 million). The defined benefit obligation (DBO) for current pensions calculated under IFRS was €87 million (previous year: €75 million).\n\n#### Remuneration of the Supervisory Board\n\nAs in the previous year, the total remuneration of the Supervisory Board in the 2023 fiscal year amounted to €3.7 million; as in the previous year, €3.5 million of this amount was attributable to a fixed component and €0.2 million to attendance allowances.\n\n#### Shareholdings of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, shares held by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Post AG amounted to less than 1% of the company's share capital.\n\n{220}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/220/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

In addition, we have audited the combined management report for the Parent and the group of Deutsche Post AG, Bonn/Germany, for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the combined non-financial statement pursuant to Sections 289b and 315b German Commercial Code (HGB), which is included in the section \"Non-financial statement\" of the combined management report, nor the combined corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d HGB, which is included in the section \"Governance\" of the combined management report. Moreover, we have not audited the content of those paragraphs and disclosures extraneous to the combined management report that are marked as unaudited in the combined management report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023 and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and\n- the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the combined management report does not cover the content of the above-listed statements nor of the above-listed paragraphs and disclosures extraneous to combined management reports marked as unaudited.\n\nPursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\n\n#### Basis for the Audit Opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014; referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW). We performed the audit of the consolidated financial statements in supplementary compliance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\n{224}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/224/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn the following we present the key audit matters we have determined in the course of our audit:\n\n- 1. Recoverability of goodwill\n- 2. Measurement of pension obligations and plan assets\n\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured as follows:\n\na) description (including reference to corresponding information in the consolidated financial statements) b) auditor's response\n\n#### **1. Recoverability of goodwill**\n\na) In the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023 of Deutsche Post AG, goodwill amounting to EUR 13.1 billion is reported under the balance sheet item \"Intangible assets\", representing about 20% of total assets and 57% of the Group's reported equity. Goodwill is tested for impairment by the Company at least once a year for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements regardless of whether there are external or internal indications that the assets may be impaired. The impairment test is based on a calculation model in which the planned future cash flows are discounted at the weighted average cost of capital using a discounted cash flow method. The planned future cash flows are derived from the executive directors' adopted middle-term planning and the supervisory board's approved budget planning.\n\nThe result of this measurement depends to a large extent on the assumptions made by the executive directors for the determination of future cash flows and the determination of the parameters for the discount rates used and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background and given the complexity of the underlying measurement models as well as the material importance of goodwill, this matter was of particular significance within the framework of our audit.\n\nThe executive directors' disclosures on goodwill are contained in note 22 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nb) In our audit, we dealt with the process for performing goodwill impairment tests and obtained, among others, an understanding of the accounting controls that are included in the process and retraced the method applied to carry out the impairment tests. Where identified controls were relevant to our audit, we had their design and implementation tested. In the case of estimates made by the executive directors, we evaluated the reasonableness of the methods applied, assumptions made and data used. Specifically, we satisfied ourselves as to the appropriateness of the future cash flows used in the measurement, by, among others, comparing these values with the middle-term planning adopted by the executive directors and the budget planning approved by the supervisory board as well as with general and industry-specific market expectations. As even relatively small changes in the discount rate used can have a material impact on the measurement results, we had the discount rates tested by verifying the parameters used through public data bases and own calculations of the discount rates, compared them with the discount rates used and evaluated any deviations. In addition, we retraced the calculation model and examined whether it considered all valuedetermining parameters and whether all mathematical connections were correct.\n\n{225}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/225/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nDue to the fact that the measurement also depends on economic conditions beyond the Company's sphere of influence, we additionally evaluated the sensitivity analysis prepared by the Company.\n\nOur audit procedures were supported by our internal valuation experts.\n\n#### **2. Measurement of pension obligations and plan assets**\n\na) In the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023 of Deutsche Post AG, a total of EUR 2.5 billion is reported under the balance sheet item \"Provisions for pensions and similar obligations\". Moreover, as a result of pension scheme surpluses in some defined benefit plans, pension assets of EUR 0.2 billion are reported under the balance sheet item \"Other non-current assets\" as at 31 December 2023. The net pension provisions of EUR 2.3 billion were calculated on the basis of the present value of the obligation of EUR 14.2 billion, less the plan assets of EUR 12.0 billion measured at fair value and an asset ceiling effect of EUR 0.1 billion. In measuring pension provisions, the executive directors in particular made assumptions about the discount rate and long-term salary and pension trends as well as average life expectancy with the help of an external actuary. Changes in the measurement parameters and experience adjustments resulted in actuarial losses of EUR 0.7 billion as at 31 December 2023. In addition, measuring plan assets at fair value is subject to estimation uncertainties. Deviations from the planned development of the fair value of the plan assets resulted in losses of EUR 0.1 billion that are recognised directly in equity. In our view, these matters were of particular significance in our audit as the measurement of these high-value items is to a large extent based on estimates and discretionary assumptions made by the executive directors.\n\nThe Company's disclosures on pension provisions and similar obligations and on plan assets are contained in note 37 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nb) We dealt with the process for measurement of pension provisions and plan assets, obtaining an understanding of the accounting controls included in the process. Where identified controls were relevant to our audit, we had their design and implementation tested. In the case of estimates made by the executive directors, we evaluated the reasonableness of the methods applied, assumptions made and data used. We had the appropriateness of the measurement parameters for pension provisions, including the related assumptions made, evaluated by means of expert opinions provided to us and a comparison with market-related data. This audit procedure was carried out involving internal experts for pension valuations. Moreover, we satisfied ourselves as to the competence, capabilities and objectivity of the actuary engaged by the executive directors. Our examination of the fair values of plan assets was in particular based on bank confirmations and other asset statements and real estate appraisals. Our audit of the plan assets was supported by our internal valuation experts.\n\n#### Other Information\n\nThe executive directors and/or the supervisory board are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises\n\n- the report of the supervisory board,\n- the parts included in the combined management report:\n\t- combined non-financial statement pursuant to Sections 289b and 315b HGB,\n\t- combined corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d HGB\n\t- the paragraphs and disclosures extraneous to the combined management report marked as unaudited, and\n- the executive directors' confirmation regarding the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report pursuant to Sections 297 (2) sentence 4 and 315 (1) sentence 5 HGB,\n- all other parts of the annual report,\n- but not the consolidated financial statements, not the audited content of the combined management report and not our auditor's report thereon.\n\n{226}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/226/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for the report of the supervisory board. The executive directors and the supervisory board are responsible for the declaration related to the German Corporate Governance Code pursuant to Section 161 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), which is part of the combined corporate governance statement included in the combined management report. Otherwise, the executive directors are responsible for the other information.\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, to consider whether the other information\n\n- is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the audited content of the group management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n#### Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e. fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the combined management report that as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a combined management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the combined management report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\n\n{227}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/227/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The word \"Group\" is in red and is located below the right side of the DHL letters. The background is yellow.\n\n#### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) and in supplementary compliance with the ISA will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this combined management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the combined management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and with the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB.\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n\n{228}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/228/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n- evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the combined management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the actions taken or safeguards applied to eliminate independence threats.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in the auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n#### Other legal and regulatory requirements\n\n#### **Report on the Audit of the Electronic Reproductions of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report Prepared for Publication Pursuant to Section 317 (3a) HGB**\n\n#### Audit Opinion\n\nWe have performed an audit in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB to obtain reasonable assurance whether the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report (hereinafter referred to as \"ESEF documents\") prepared for publication, contained in the file, which has the SHA-256 value\n\n760A6C398340D2A376085885D4B91F122FC9A02893BF1AEAC7853E0D8D8FD31C, meet, in all material respects, the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section 328 (1) HGB (\"ESEF format\"). In accordance with the German legal requirements, this audit only covers the conversion of the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report into the ESEF format, and therefore covers neither the information contained in these electronic reproductions nor any other information contained in the file identified above.\n\nIn our opinion, the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report prepared for publication contained in the file identified above meet, in all material respects, the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section 328 (1) HGB. Beyond this audit opinion and our audit opinions on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and on the accompanying combined management report for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023 contained in the \"Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\" above, we do not express any assurance opinion on the information contained within these electronic reproductions or on any other information contained in the file identified above.\n\n#### Basis for the Audit Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit of the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report contained in the file identified above in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB and on the basis of the IDW Auditing Standard: Audit of the Electronic Reproductions of Financial Statements and Management Reports Prepared for Publication Purposes Pursuant to Section 317 (3a) HGB (IDW AuS 410 (06.2022)). Our responsibilities in this context are further described in the \"Group Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the ESEF Documents\" section. Our audit firm has applied the requirements of the IDW Quality Management Standards.\n\n{229}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/229/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the ESEF Documents\n\nThe executive directors of the Parent are responsible for the preparation of the ESEF documents based on the electronic files of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report according to Section 328 (1) sentence 4 no. 1 HGB and for the tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to Section 328 (1) sentence 4 no. 2 HGB.\n\nIn addition, the executive directors of the Parent are responsible for such internal controls that they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of ESEF documents that are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section 328 (1) HGB.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the ESEF documents as part of the financial reporting process.\n\n#### Group Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the ESEF Documents\n\nOur objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ESEF documents are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB. We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit on the ESEF documents in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.\n- evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e. whether the file containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the balance sheet date, on the technical specification for this electronic file.\n- evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable a XHTML reproduction with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and to the audited combined management report.\n- evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with the requirements of Articles 4 and 6 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the balance sheet date, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML reproduction.\n\n#### Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation\n\nWe were elected as Group auditor by the annual general meeting on 6 May 2022. We were engaged by the supervisory board on 28 April / 4 May 2023. We have been the Group auditor of Deutsche Post AG, Bonn/Germany, since the financial year 2023.\n\nWe declare that the audit opinions expressed in this auditor's report are consistent with the additional report to the audit committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report).\n\n{230}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/230/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The background is yellow.\n\n### Other matter – use of the auditor's report\n\nOur auditor's report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report as well as with the audited ESEF documents. The consolidated financial statements and the combined management report converted into the ESEF format – including the versions to be submitted for inclusion in the Company Register – are merely electronic reproductions of the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report and do not take their place. In particular, the ESEF report and our audit opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the audited ESEF documents made available in electronic form.\n\n#### German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement\n\nThe German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement is Prof. Dr Frank Beine.\n\nMunich/Germany, 16 February 2024\n\nDeloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nProf. Dr. Frank Beine Dr. Hendrik Nardmann *Wirtschaftsprüfer Wirtschaftsprüfer*  (German Public Auditor) (German Public Auditor)\n\n{236}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-236-0\"></span>Image /page/236/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Free cash flow\nis particularly pleasing, amounting to €3.3 billion before M&A activities. The numbers prove it: we are\nhighly profitable, even in the economically weakest market environment of the last 15 years.\n\nThis is thanks to the fact that we not only had good responses to the challenges, but we were also prepared:\nwe planned our capacities with a view to the future, kept our eye on costs and increased our efficiency on\nan ongoing basis. The investments of recent years resulted in structural improvements to our profitability.\nWe benefit from this even in phases of weak economic momentum. In addition, we adjusted prices in line\nwith the market and passed on inflationary cost developments to our customers.\n\nThe past fiscal year makes it once again clear: our logistics portfolio, which is unique around the world,\nis productive and robust. No other company in the industry boasts such a broad, diversified and global\nstructure. And our network is very well suited for online retail, which remains a strong and fundamental\ndriver of growth. As a company, we have been on board with the e-commerce trend since the early days\nand have used it to our advantage. It has been contributing to our success for many years – and will\ncontinue to do so in the coming years.\n\nDHL Group also pursues ambitious goals with regard to the environment, social responsibility and sound\ncorporate governance in line with our ESG Roadmap. Our ESG measures contribute to us remaining a\nmarket leader in the future as well.\n\nOur particular priority along the way is that we remain steadfast on the path to decarbonization of logistics.\nIn the year under review, we increased our investments in the reduction of greenhouse gases by 56% and\nsaved 1.3 million metric tons of CO2e. In addition, we successfully placed our first sustainability-linked\nbond on the capital market with a volume of €500 million. We will not ease up in our dedication to more\nenvironmentally friendly logistics. Climate change remains the greatest problem that humanity is faced\nwith. And the clock keeps on ticking.\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/5/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and is to the left of the word \"Group\", which is also in red. The background is yellow.\n\nMy particular thanks go to our more than 590,000 employees worldwide – for their tireless efforts in\nyet another challenging year. Without their motivation and passion, we would not have been able to so\nsuccessfully accomplish many things. We are pleased that we again exceeded the target of more than\n80% in Employee Engagement in the year under review, with the figure coming in at 83%. And, going\nforward, we plan to offer our employees more opportunities to directly take part in the success\nof the company. To this end, we are piloting a program in 12 countries that allows employees\nto acquire our shares at a discounted price. The program is intended to further strengthen\nthe connection between the workforce and the company.\n\nAnd what can we look forward to over the remainder of 2024? Although global trade\ncontinues to find itself in a challenging environment, I see a year of opportunity –\nalso because competitors are withdrawing or appear to be distracted. For our part, we\nare definitely focused and in a position to continue delivering excellent quality. We\nare continuing to work on our status as an employer, provider and investment of choice.\nIn doing so, we want to take advantage of the many opportunities for DHL Group to\ncontinue to grow.\n\nAnd I thank you, Dear Shareholders, for the trust you have placed in me since I was named\nCEO of DHL Group. Leading a company that keeps the world running, day in and day out, and\nthat enables trade in more than 220 countries and territories is an inspiring and special responsi-\nbility. A company that connects people and improves lives. DHL Group has evolved from a national\npostal service provider to a leader in the global logistics market. I look forward to writing the upcoming\nchapters of this success story together with my colleagues on the Board of Management and the highly\ndedicated workforce.\n\n**TOBIAS MEYER**\nChief Executive Officer\n\nTobias Meyer\nChief Executive Officer\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-6-0\"></span>Image /page/6/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The Board of Management's clear strategic focus and the contributions of all employees in operational implementation made this possible.\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board worked together in a trusting and successful manner in the year under review. The Board of Management involved the Supervisory Board early on in all decisions of material significance for the company and regularly informed the Supervisory Board on further developments.\n\n#### Attendance at plenary and committee meetings\n\nThe four plenary meetings and 17 of the 21 committee meetings in the 2023 fiscal year took place in person, with individual members joining virtually depending on the situation.\n\n#### ATTENDANCE AT PLENARY AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS 2023\n\n| Supervisory Board members                      | Supervisory Board meetings |                 | Committee meetings      |                 |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|\n|                                                | Attendance/<br>meetings    | Attendance<br>% | Attendance/<br>meetings | Attendance<br>% |\n| Dr. Nikolaus von Bomhard (Chair)               | 4/4                        | 100             | 14/14                   | 100             |\n| Andrea Kocsis (Deputy Chair)                   | 4/4                        | 100             | 10/13                   | 77              |\n| Silke Busch (since May 4, 2023)                | 3/3                        | 100             | –                       |                 |\n| Dr. Mario Daberkow                             | 4/4                        | 100             | –                       |                 |\n| Ingrid Deltenre                                | 4/4                        | 100             | 8/9                     | 89              |\n| Jörg von Dosky                                 | 4/4                        | 100             | 7/7                     | 100             |\n| Gabriele Gülzau (until May 4, 2023)            | 1/1                        | 100             | –                       |                 |\n| Thomas Held                                    | 4/4                        | 100             | 9/9                     | 100             |\n| Dr. Heinrich Hiesinger                         | 4/4                        | 100             | 5/5                     | 100             |\n| Prof. Dr. Luise Hölscher                       | 4/4                        | 100             | 9/12                    | 75              |\n| Mario Jacubasch                                | 4/4                        | 100             | 4/4                     | 100             |\n| Thorsten Kühn                                  | 4/4                        | 100             | 4/4                     | 100             |\n| Ulrike Lennartz-Pipenbacher                    | 4/4                        | 100             | –                       |                 |\n| Simone Menne                                   | 3/4                        | 75              | 6/7                     | 86              |\n| Yusuf Özdemir                                  | 4/4                        | 100             | 7/7                     | 100             |\n| Lawrence Rosen                                 | 4/4                        | 100             | 6/7                     | 86              |\n| Dr. Stefan Schulte                             | 4/4                        | 100             | 7/7                     | 100             |\n| Dr. Katrin Suder (since May 4, 2023)           | 3/3                        | 100             | –                       |                 |\n| Stephan Teuscher                               | 4/4                        | 100             | 12/12                   | 100             |\n| Stefanie Weckesser                             | 4/4                        | 100             | 7/7                     | 100             |\n| Prof. Dr.-Ing.

The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font, also in red. The background of the image is yellow.\n\nOnly one extraordinary meeting of the Strategy and Sustainability Committee, along with three meetings of the Finance and Audit Committee to discuss the financial figures ahead of the quarterly reporting, took place as videoconferences. All members of the Supervisory Board took part in the plenary meetings; only Simone Menne was excused from one meeting. Attendance at plenary and committee meetings in 2023 is shown individually in the table. No member took part in fewer than three-fourths of the meetings. Meetings of the Supervisory Board were held regularly without the Board of Management members, for example on matters regarding the Board of Management and to review the efficiency of the Supervisory Board's work.\n\nThe members of the Board of Management participated in all plenary meetings and reported on the business performance in the divisions for which they are responsible. The CEO and the members of the Board of Management responsible for the respective committee attended the committee meetings. Executives from the tier immediately below the Board of Management and the auditors were also invited to attend for individual agenda items. The members of the Financial and Audit Committee discussed individual matters with the auditors, also without the Board of Management members being present.\n\n#### Discussions with investors\n\nIn the autumn of the past year, I held talks with several investors and proxies on topics that fall under the responsibility of the Supervisory Board. The talks focused on, among other topics, the ESG Roadmap of DHL Group, in particular governance aspects, and the anchoring of ESG criteria in the short- and long-term Board of Management remuneration, as well as the qualifications of the individual members of the Supervisory Board, which are shown in the curriculum vitae of the Supervisory Board members on the company's website and in table form in the **[Annual Corporate Governance Statement.](#page-115-0)** The professional experience and expertise of the new Supervisory Board members proposed by the Supervisory Board to the 2024 Annual General Meeting were discussed in detail, in consideration of their independence and the future composition of the committees. The Board of Management's intention to convene the 2024 Annual General Meeting once again as an in-person meeting was also positively received by the investors.\n\n#### Key topics addressed in plenary meetings\n\nAll meetings centered on reporting and discussion of the Group's and its divisions' financial position and business performance, as well as information on the discussions of the committee meetings.\n\nFurthermore, the risks and opportunities for the company associated with environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects were of importance, as well as the environmental and social impact of the company's current operations and the implementation of the sustainability strategy. There was also regular exchange with the Board of Management on digitalization, including the developments in the field of artificial intelligence. In addition to the strategic direction of the product portfolio in the Group as a whole, the impact of new regulatory parameters on the business in the Post & Parcel Germany division was also a material topic in the year under review.\n\nIn March 2023, we discussed the annual and consolidated financial statements, including the management report and the nonfinancial statement. At the recommendation of the Finance and Audit Committee, we approved the financial statements that had been given an unqualified opinion by the audit firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). We concurred with the Board of Management's proposed resolution on the appropriation of the net retained profit and therefore a dividend distribution in the amount of €1.85 per share. In line with the finance strategy, 41.1% of net profit was thus distributed to the shareholders last year. Following many years of having our financial statements audited by PwC, the annual and consolidated financial statements for the 2023 fiscal year were audited by the audit firm Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (Deloitte), Munich, as resolved by the Annual General Meeting. The responsible auditors were Prof. Dr. Frank Beine and Dr. Hendrik Nardmann.\n\nApproval of the remuneration report, the report of the Supervisory Board to the Annual General Meeting and the proposed resolutions on the agenda items of the Annual General Meeting, including the (re-)election of Katrin Suder and Mario Daberkow to the Supervisory Board, were also the subject of the March meeting, as well as the determination of the annual bonus of Board of Management members on the basis of the respective degree of target achievement and corresponding recommendations of the Executive Committee. Our discussions also focused on the status of collective bargaining negotiations and the expansion of the volume of the current share program to as much as €3 billion in conjunction with the approval of a potential collection of up to 55 million further repurchased shares. Moreover, in this meeting, the Supervisory Board approved the establishment of a joint venture with Saudi Aramco.\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font, also in red. The background of the image is yellow.\n\nIn the meeting in June, we discussed in particular the acquisition of the Turkish parcel service provider MNG Kargo. In addition, the agenda included the change of the Group name from Deutsche Post DHL Group to DHL Group and the approval of the adjustment of business responsibilities on the Board of Management. The allocation of business responsibilities was adjusted so that the Group Brand Marketing function was transferred to the responsibility of John Pearson. John Pearson is already responsible for the Customer Solutions & Innovation function and the Global Commercial Board. With the additional responsibility for the Group Brand Marketing function, significant commercial functions of the Group are now bundled under one umbrella.\n\nIn September, our focus was on the reform of the Postal Act and the potential impact on the financial position and results of operations of the company. Without the presence of the Board of Management, we discussed at length the effectiveness and efficiency of our activities in the plenary meetings and in the committees. The subject of our analysis included collaboration within the Supervisory Board and with the members of the Board of Management, the work in the committees, the involvement of the Supervisory Board in the strategic direction of the company and the skills profile of the Supervisory Board. In preparation for this agenda item, the members of the Supervisory Board had completed a detailed questionnaire with selected questions on various topics, for example their satisfaction with the information provided and the frequency and structure of the Supervisory Board meetings. According to the results of our discussions, the Supervisory Board performed its monitoring and advisory duties effectively and efficiently. We will continue to include suggestions made by individual members of the Supervisory Board in our discussions between the annual efficiency reviews.\n\nIn our final Supervisory Board meeting of the year in December, we approved the Group's business plan for 2024 after intense discussion, defined the annual bonus targets for the Board of Management members and addressed the topics of digitalization and the energy transition. We resolved to comply without limitation with the suggestions and recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the year under review.\n\n#### Material topics of the committee meetings\n\nThe six committees of the Supervisory Board prepare the plenary discussions and decisions and meet in advance of the plenary meetings. The committees have also been tasked with making the final decisions regarding a few matters, including Executive Committee approval for secondary activities of Board of Management members or Finance and Audit Committee approval of nonaudit services to be provided by the auditor. In the plenary meetings, the committee chairs provide the members of the Supervisory Board with comprehensive information on the work of the committees and are available for questions and further discussion. The **[Annual Corporate Governance Statement](#page-116-0)** provides information on the tasks of the committees and their members.\n\nThe Executive Committee met four times in 2023 and dealt primarily with Board of Management matters, such as succession planning on the Board of Management, the discussion of the remuneration report to the Annual General Meeting, target achievement for annual bonus calculation for the previous year and the target agreements for the following year.\n\nThe Finance and Audit Committee met seven times. Following the election of Deloitte as auditor by the Annual General Meeting, the Finance and Audit Committee commissioned the audit firm with the audit of the annual and consolidated financial statements and the audit review of the 2023 half-yearly report. The committee also commissioned Deloitte with the audit of the nonfinancial statement contained in the management report to obtain limited assurance and reasonable assurance regarding selected indicators and discussed the audit strategy, planning, results and quality with the auditors. The committee also discussed the halfyearly financial report following the review by the auditor and the quarterly financial statements with the CEO and the Board member for finance prior to publication, in the presence of the auditors. The committee monitored the independence of the auditor and had the auditor's nonaudit services submitted for approval. It also had reports submitted on the nonaudit services rendered in general as well as the status of the utilization of the statutory budget provided for this purpose. As the committee chair, Stefan Schulte was also in regular dialog with the auditor outside of the meetings regarding the progress of the audits and reported on this to the committee. Also covered at the meetings were the accounting process, risk management and the findings of internal audits. Moreover, the committee dealt intensively with the planned reform of the Postal Act and the impact on the financial situation and results of operations of the company. It obtained detailed reports from the Chief Compliance Officer on meaningful aspects of compliance and on updates to the compliance organization and compliance management. The effectiveness and development of the internal control and risk management system was also regularly presented and discussed in the presence of the responsible department head.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines to the left. The word \"Group\" is in red and is located to the right and below the DHL part of the logo. The background is yellow.\n\nThe Strategy and Sustainability Committee met five times, primarily addressing the strategic positioning of the individual business units in their respective market segments and the implementation of our Strategy 2025. In addition, the committee dealt with the company's sustainability strategy and its implementation in detail and on an ongoing basis. The meetings also focused on the acquisition and disposal of equity interest in companies, such as the establishment of a joint venture between DHL Supply Chain and Saudi Aramco.\n\nThe Nomination Committee met once during the reporting period. In preparation for the 2024 Annual General Meeting, the committee recommended to the Supervisory Board at the end of 2023 that it nominate Ann-Kristin Achleitner and Hans-Ulrich Engel for election to the Supervisory Board as successors to Simone Menne and Stefan Schulte, as well as Heinrich Hiesinger for reelection. The term of office for each is to be four years.\n\nThe Mediation Committee did not meet in the year under review.\n\nThe Personnel Committee held four meetings and dealt with, among other topics, the safety of employees, the status of collective bargaining negotiations, the promotion of women in executive positions, the results of the Employee Opinion Survey, the Groupwide corporate strategy for HR development, and the recruitment, retention and development of talents.\n\n#### Support of the members of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe company supports the members of the Supervisory Board in their activities on an ongoing basis. New members are provided with a diverse and comprehensive range of offers that ensure quick and specific onboarding. In addition to the opportunity for thorough discussions with the members of the Board of Management, the chair and, if necessary, other members of the Supervisory Board, they are given a broad array of information on relevant subjects, primarily via access to the digital data room specifically designed for the Supervisory Board, which also contains the minutes from prior Supervisory Board meetings. The costs for attending selected external training events as well as those for subscribing to industry publications are also reimbursed. Along with visits to important operating sites of the Group in conjunction with a Supervisory Board meeting, the members of the Board of Management also offer tours of individual operating units that give the Supervisory Board members the opportunity to develop a full understanding of the operating processes by providing them with in-depth insights into the conditions at the sites. In June, for instance, the Supervisory Board toured the DHL hub in Leipzig, where – following an introductory lecture – it was led through the expansive premises during the busy evening hours and introduced to individual work processes and responsibilities. Various executives from the Express division, some of whom work on-site, were available to answer questions and to make recommendations. Directors' Day, which takes place twice per year, also enables the members of the Supervisory Board to deepen their understanding of current topics and developments that are relevant to the company. In 2023, the agenda consisted of the topics of regulation of the postal market, ESG key performance indicators as a basis for corporate governance and Board of Management remuneration, as well as updates on supply chain legislation, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and the EU Taxonomy.\n\n#### Changes to the Board of Management\n\nWith Frank Appel's resignation after more than 20 years on the Board of Management, Tobias Meyer assumed the role of CEO upon the conclusion of the 2023 Annual General Meeting. He has been a member of the Board of Management since 2019 and was previously responsible for Post & Parcel Germany and Global Business Services. There were no other personnel changes during the reporting period.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters \"DHL\" is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Changes to the Supervisory Board\n\nWith regard to shareholder representatives, Katja Windt resigned from the Supervisory Board after twelve years of membership effective upon conclusion of the Annual General Meeting on May 4, 2023. Her successor is Katrin Suder, a freelance corporate consultant. Mario Daberkow, a member of the Supervisory Board since 2018 and responsible for Global IT Infrastructure & Services at Volkswagen AG, was reelected by the Annual General Meeting. Katrin Suder and Mario Daberkow were each elected for a term of four years.\n\nThe terms of office for Simone Menne, Heinrich Hiesinger and Stefan Schulte end as scheduled following the Annual General Meeting planned for May 3, 2024. In light of the rules of the German Corporate Governance Code, Simone Menne and Stefan Schulte are no longer eligible for reelection following their many years of membership on the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board recommends to the Annual General Meeting the election of Ann-Kristin Achleitner and Hans-Ulrich Engel and the reelection of Heinrich Hiesinger, each for a four-year term of office. Both candidates to be newly elected have extensive knowledge in the field of accounting and reporting in particular. The intention is to elect Hans-Ulrich Engel as the Chair of the Finance and Audit Committee, provided he is elected to the Board. The main skills of the members of the Supervisory Board can also be found in the qualification matrix in the **[Annual Corporate Governance Statement.](#page-115-0)**\n\nThe term of office for the employee representatives on the Supervisory Board ended as scheduled at the end of the 2023 Annual General Meeting. Nearly all members were reelected for another term of office. Silke Busch was elected as a new member to succeed Gabriele Gülzau. The Supervisory Board confirmed Andrea Kocsis as Deputy Chair of the Supervisory Board and the reelected employee representatives in their committee positions.\n\nAn overview of current Supervisory Board members is provided in **[Boards and committees.](#page-7-0)**\n\n#### Managing conflicts of interest\n\nSupervisory Board members neither hold positions on the governing bodies of, nor provide consultancy services to, the Group's main competitors, nor do they maintain personal relationships with them. No conflicts of interest were reported to the Supervisory Board in the year under review.\n\n#### Company in compliance with all recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code\n\nIn December 2023, the members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board issued a statement declaring that, since the issue of the declaration of conformity in December 2022, all recommendations of the Government Commission German Corporate Governance Code as amended on April 28, 2022, and published in the *Bundesanzeiger* (Federal Gazette) on June 27, 2022, had been complied with, and that all recommendations are to be complied with going forward. The statements from past years can be accessed on the company's website. Further information regarding corporate governance within the company can be found in the **[Annual Corporate Governance Statement.](#page-111-0)**\n\n#### 2023 annual and consolidated financial statements examined\n\nThe auditors elected by the 2022 Annual General Meeting for 2023 for the first time, Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (Deloitte), Munich, audited the annual and consolidated financial statements for the 2023 fiscal year, including the combined management report, and issued unqualified audit opinions. Deloitte also audited the combined nonfinancial statement for the 2023 fiscal year separately in a limited and, for certain indicators, reasonable assurance engagement and raised no objections. Deloitte also conducted the voluntary review of the half-yearly financial report. No objections were raised. The joint remuneration report for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board for the 2023 fiscal year was subjected to a formal audit and given a corresponding audit opinion in accordance with Section 162(3) AktG.\n\nAfter prior examination by the Finance and Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board in its meeting today went through the annual and consolidated financial statements, including the Board of Management's proposal on the appropriation of the net retained profit and the combined management report including the combined nonfinancial statement for the 2023 fiscal year, and discussed them in depth with the Board of Management. Deloitte reported on the results of the audit before the Finance and Audit Committee and plenary meeting and was available to answer questions. The Supervisory Board concurred with the results of the audit and approved the annual and consolidated financial statements for the 2023 fiscal year, as recommended by the Finance and\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/16/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

No objections were raised on the basis of the final outcome of the examination by the Finance and Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board of the annual and consolidated financial statements, the combined management report including the combined nonfinancial statement, and the proposal for the appropriation of the net retained profit.\n\nThe Supervisory Board endorsed the Board of Management's proposal for the appropriation of net retained profit and the payment of a dividend of €1.85 per share.\n\nThe Supervisory Board would like to expressly thank all employees and Board of Management members for their dedicated efforts.\n\nBonn, March 5, 2024 The Supervisory Board\n\nDr. Nikolaus von Bomhard Chairman\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-17-0\"></span>Image /page/17/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n### Preliminary Remarks\n\n#### Applied reporting standards\n\nAs a listed company, Deutsche Post AG has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with Section 315e Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB – German Commercial Code) in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and the corresponding Interpretations of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted in the European Union.\n\nThe combined management report comprises the Group Management Report of DHL Group and the Management Report of Deutsche Post AG. Unless otherwise noted, the information presented refers to the Group. Information pertaining solely to Deutsche Post AG is identified as such.\n\nThe combined management report also includes the combined **[nonfinancial statement](#page-58-0)** for Deutsche Post AG and for the Group in accordance with Sections 289b(1) and 315b(1) HGB. The **[nonfinancial key performance indicators](#page-33-0)** used for steering the Group were determined on the basis of their materiality in accordance with the German Commercial Code and the German Accounting Standards (GASs). Determining the report contents and the material topics is guided by the GRI Standards (core option) as a framework, supplemented by HGB requirements. The nonfinancial statement also includes information aimed at facilitating sustainable investment (EU Taxonomy) in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the European Council, as well as Delegated Regulations 2021/2178 and 2023/2486 of the European Commission. In the interest of avoiding repetition, we refer to other sections of the combined management report for reporting on mandatory disclosures, provided that they already are explained in greater detail there. Information regarding employees applies to all of the Group's staff; exceptions are noted as such.\n\n#### Independent audit\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Deutsche Post AG and its subsidiaries and the combined management report for the fiscal year from January 1 to December 31, 2023, were audited by Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (Deloitte), Munich, in a reasonable assurance engagement, **[auditor's report.](#page-223-0)** This excludes quarterly figures during the year.\n\nThe combined nonfinancial statement was audited separately by Deloitte on behalf of the Supervisory Board in a limited and, for certain indicators, reasonable assurance engagement, **[practitioner's report.](#page-231-0)**\n\nThe contents of the **[Annual Corporate Governance Statement](#page-111-0)** pursuant to Section 289f and 315d HGB have not been audited.\n\n#### Forward-looking statements\n\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that are not historical facts. They also include statements concerning assumptions and expectations that are based upon current plans, estimates and projections and the information available to Deutsche Post AG at the time this report was completed. They should not be considered to be assurances of future performance and results contained therein. Instead, they depend on a number of factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties (particularly those described in the \"Expected developments, opportunities and risks\" section) and are based on assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. It is possible that actual performance and results may differ from the forward-looking statements made in this report. Deutsche Post AG undertakes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements contained in this report except as required by applicable law. If Deutsche Post AG updates one or more forward-looking statements, no assumption can be made that the statement(s) in question or other forward-looking statements will be updated regularly.\n\n#### Disclosures unrelated to the management report\n\nThe German Corporate Governance Code stipulates disclosures related to the internal control and risk management system that go beyond the legal requirements for the management report and are therefore excepted from the auditor's review of the contents of the management report. These disclosures are set apart from those to be audited in separate paragraphs and marked accordingly\n\n.\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-18-0\"></span>Image /page/18/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters. There are three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. The word \"Group\" is in red and is located below the letters. The background is yellow.\n\n#### Additional information\n\nIn the annual report available digitally and as a PDF, we refer to – and link to – additional information online. This information is not a part of the report and is therefore excepted from the auditor's review of the contents.\n\n#### Translation\n\nThe English version of the 2023 Annual Report of DHL Group constitutes a translation of the original German version. Only the German version is legally binding, insofar as this does not conflict with legal provisions in other countries.\n\n## GENERAL INFORMATION\n\n#### Business model\n\n#### An international service portfolio\n\nDeutsche Post AG, as the parent company of DHL Group, is a listed German corporation domiciled in Bonn. Under the DHL and Deutsche Post brands, DHL Group provides a wide-ranging portfolio of services comprising international express shipping, freight transport, supply chain management, e-commerce and post and parcel services. The Group is organized into five operating divisions: Express; Global Forwarding, Freight; Supply Chain; eCommerce; and Post & Parcel Germany. Each of the divisions is managed by its own divisional headquarters and subdivided into functions, business units or regions for reporting purposes.\n\nGroup management functions are centralized in the Corporate Center. The internal services that support the entire Group are consolidated in our Global Business Services (GBS) unit. Customer Solutions & Innovation (CSI) is DHL's cross-divisional account management and innovation unit.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/19/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### CORPORATE STRUCTURE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2023\n\nImage /page/19/Figure/4 description: The image is a diagram illustrating the divisions and group functions of DHL Group. The diagram is divided into two main sections: Divisions and Group Functions. The Divisions section includes five divisions: Express, Global Forwarding, Freight, Supply Chain, E-commerce, and Post & Parcel Germany. Each division is represented by an image and a brief description of its services. Express provides transport of urgent documents and goods, primarily as time-definite international shipments. Global Forwarding, Freight offers international forwarding services for air, ocean, and overland freight. Supply Chain provides tailor-made logistics services and supply chain solutions based on globally standardized modules such as warehousing, transport, and value-added services. E-commerce provides domestic parcel transport in selected countries in Europe, the USA, and Asia, as well as deferred cross-border services to, from, and within Europe, and from the United States. Post & Parcel Germany transports, sorts, and delivers documents and goods in Germany and exports to the rest of the world. A pie chart shows the share of consolidated revenue for 2023, with the following percentages: 22.1%, 29.7%, 20.6%, 7.6%, and 20.1%. The Group Functions section includes Corporate Center, Global Business Services, and Customer Solutions & Innovation. Below these functions are CEO, Finance, and Human Resources. A note at the bottom indicates that '1' refers to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Organizational changes\n\nAfter more than 15 years as CEO, Frank Appel's term of office as a member of the Board of Management expired at the end of the Annual General Meeting on May 4, 2023. Tobias Meyer, who has been a member of the Board of Management since April 2019, has been the CEO since that date.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-20-0\"></span>Image /page/20/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nAs of July 1, 2023, the Group changed its name from Deutsche Post DHL Group to DHL Group and, since then, the exchange symbol has been DHL. This does not impact the services offered by the divisions. The DHL and Deutsche Post brands will continue to be used as before. The change of name does not have any impact on the names or characteristics of the Group's legal entities, particularly Deutsche Post AG, or on the internal and external relations with these entities.\n\n#### Worldwide presence\n\nOur locations can be found in the **[list of shareholdings.](https://group.dhl.com/content/dam/deutschepostdhl/en/media-center/investors/documents/annual-reports/DHL-Group-list-of-shareholdings-2023-12-31.pdf)** The following description of the divisions shows market shares and market volumes – where available and useful – in the most important regions.\n\n#### Express division\n\nImage /page/20/Figure/7 description: The image displays DHL's global express network statistics. It states that DHL operates in over 220 countries, has over 295 dedicated aircraft, and services over 500 airports. DHL also has around 115,000 service points, 3 million customers, around 3,800 facilities, 22 hubs, and around 116,000 employees.\n\n#### Time-definite international shipments\n\nIn the Express division, we transport urgent documents and goods reliably and on time from door to door. International timedefinite shipments are our core business. The division's main product is Time Definite International (TDI), a cross-border transport and delivery service with predefined, standardized transit times. Our expertise in customs clearance keeps shipments moving as a prerequisite in ensuring fast and reliable door-to-door service. We also provide industry-specific services to round out our TDI product. For example, our Medical Express transport solution, which is tailored specifically to companies in the life sciences and healthcare sectors, offers various types of thermal packaging for temperature-controlled, chilled and frozen contents.\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/21/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in a bold, red font, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters, the word \"Group\" is written in a smaller, red font. The background of the logo is yellow.\n\nAround 288 million TDI shipments were transported worldwide in 2023. We estimate our global market share at around 43% on the basis of a survey from 2021.\n\n#### Our virtual airline\n\nOur global air freight network is operated by multiple airlines, some of which are wholly owned by the Group. The combination of our own and purchased capacities allows us to respond flexibly to fluctuating demand. The following graphic illustrates how our available freight capacity is organized and offered on the market. Most of the freight capacity is used for TDI, our main product. If any cargo space remains on our own flights, we sell it to customers in the air freight sector. The largest buyer of remaining capacity is the DHL Global Forwarding business unit.\n\n#### AVAILABLE CAPACITY\n\nImage /page/21/Figure/7 description: The image shows a yellow and red DHL cargo plane with three cargo containers labeled 1, 2, and 3. Below the plane, there are descriptions of each container. Container 1 is labeled \"Core\" and is described as \"Express TDI core product - capacity based upon average utilization, adjusted on a daily basis.\" Container 2 is labeled \"BSA\" and is described as \"Block Space Agreement - guaranteed air cargo product.\" Container 3 is labeled \"ACS\" and is described as \"Air Capacity Sales, average total spare capacity that is not slated to be utilized for BSA or TDI core volumes.\"\n\n#### Keeping our customer service promise and standards\n\nIn order to verify the keeping of our service promise as a global network operator and to further improve it, we monitor the satisfaction and changing requirements of our customers, for example through our Insanely Customer Centric Culture program and with the Net Promoter Approach.\n\nAt our quality control centers, we track shipments across the globe and adjust the processes dynamically as required. All premium products are tracked until they are delivered.\n\nWe conduct regular reviews of operational safety, compliance with standards and quality of service at our facilities in cooperation with government authorities. Approximately 450 locations have been certified by the Transported Asset Protection Association (TAPA).\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-22-0\"></span>Image /page/22/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n[The Company](#page-2-0)  [Combined Management Report](#page-17-0) [Further Information](#page-222-0)\n\n[Consolidated Financial Statements](#page-122-0) \n\n### Global Forwarding, Freight division\n\nImage /page/22/Figure/4 description: The image shows a graphic with the text \"AIR, OCEAN AND OVERLAND FREIGHT\" at the top. Below this, there are three circular sections containing information. The first section on the left states \"Around 200 freight terminals\". The middle section says \"Around 47,000 employees\". The section on the right says \"250,000+ customers\". In between the middle and right sections, it says \"120+ countries\".\n\n#### Air, ocean and overland freight forwarding services\n\nAir, ocean and overland freight forwarding services are the core business of the Global Forwarding, Freight division. They include standardized transports as well as multimodal and sector-specific solutions, together with customized industrial projects and customs services. Our business model is based upon brokering transport services between customers and freight carriers. The global reach of our network allows us to offer efficient routing and multimodal transport options. Compared with the Group's other divisions, our operational business model is asset light. Global Forwarding, Freight is among the top three global freight forwarding companies in a market that remains fragmented.\n\n#### Declining volumes in freight markets due to overall normalization\n\nAs expected, the overall situation on the freight markets returned to normal in 2023. In this environment, we reached around 1.7 million tons (previous year: around 1.9 million tons) of export air freight transported. In ocean freight, volumes decreased by 6.2% to around 3.1 million (previous year: around 3.3 million) 20-foot container units transported.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/23/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Increased labor costs, toll charges and persistently high diesel prices caused constant cost pressure.\n\n#### Satisfied customers and high security standards\n\nWe aim to design our services to be as user-friendly as possible in the Global Forwarding, Freight division. To do so, we systematically record customer feedback by calculating Net Promoter Scores and conducting annual satisfaction surveys. Based upon the information received, we define initiatives and actions aimed at steadily improving our products and services.\n\nWith an ISO-certified business continuity management program, our global network meets the highest sector-specific safety standards, including TAPA and the US initiative C-TPAT.\n\nWith a global Transport Management System, we laid the foundation for further scaling of applications and processes in the Global Forwarding business unit. In the Freight business unit, we also have a standardized Transport Management System along with customer interaction tools such as the myDHLFreight portal, which is already running in eight countries, and Saloodo!, our digital marketplace for road freight.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-24-0\"></span>Image /page/24/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The background is yellow.\n\n### Supply Chain division\n\nImage /page/24/Figure/4 description: The image shows information about DHL. The text at the top says \"SOLUTIONS TO REDUCE SUPPLY CHAIN COMPLEXITY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS\". There are four sections with information. The first section says \"Around 188,000 employees\" and shows a DHL truck and a woman in a safety vest. The second section says \"Around 8,500 vehicles\". The third section says \"Around 17 million m² of warehousing and operational space¹\" and shows a warehouse. The fourth section says \"Active in 50+ countries\".\n\n1 Includes owned and leased warehouses only and not customer-owned facilities operated by DHL.\n\n#### Tailor-made supply chain solutions\n\nOur core business comprises tailor-made logistics services and supply chain solutions to reduce complexity for our customers and to add sustainable value. We offer a broad product portfolio including warehouse operations and transport as well as value-added services such as eFulfillment, omnichannel solutions and returns management, Lead Logistics Partner (LLP), Real Estate Solutions, Service Logistics and packaging solutions targeted to our customer's needs across all strategic industry sectors. We offer modular solutions that allow our customers' operations to be more agile and more flexible to respond to changing supply chain needs and requirements.\n\n#### Standardization and use of innovative technologies\n\nWe are constantly striving to increase speed and agility along the entire supply chain through modular standardization and the use of new technologies. State-of-the-art digital solutions are already used at more than 91% of our locations, for example with some 6,000 collaborative robots and some 46,000 smart wearables deployed. In addition, we leverage data analytics to drive operational efficiencies and to enhance the customer experience. We are integrating physical and digital supply chain solutions.\n\n#### Leading position in contract logistics\n\nThe global contract logistics market is estimated to have totaled around €275 billion for the year 2022. DHL is the global market leader in the fragmented market of contract logistics, with a market share of 6.0% (2022) and operations in more than 50 countries. The market share of the next leading provider is approximately half as large.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/25/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The background is yellow.\n\n### eCommerce division\n\nImage /page/26/Figure/4 description: The image is a graphic with a yellow background and white text boxes. The text at the top reads \"DOMESTIC PARCEL TRANSPORT AND DEFERRED CROSS-BORDER SERVICES\". There are three text boxes with statistics. The first text box says \"20+\" and \"countries\". The second text box says \"More than 1.5 billion parcels\". The third text box says \"Around 28,500 vehicles\". There is also a text box that says \"110,000+ service points\". There are also cartoon images of a man, a package, and a cell phone.\n\n#### Domestic and international parcel transport\n\nOur core business is domestic parcel transport in selected countries in Europe, in the United States, in certain countries in Asia, in particular in India, and deferred cross-border services primarily to, from and within Europe, as well as to and from the United States. Because of the broad range of business activities, no mention of individual market shares can be made.\n\nThe deferred domestic parcel delivery service is provided via our own and partner networks, serving a mix of B2C and B2B customers across all sectors. Our deferred cross-border service provides worldwide shipping solutions to enable our customers to capitalize on strong growth in cross-border trade, while meeting their expectations for speed, reliability, price and sustainability. Since the pre-pandemic year of 2019, we have increased our global cross-border volume by an average of 9% every year. The DHL Parcel Connect platform is our delivery and returns solution developed especially for e-commerce in Europe, catering to both B2B and B2C, which simplifies panEuropean cross-border shipping with a harmonized label, common IT systems, core features and local services.\n\nThe B2C volume had increased tangibly in the pandemic years. In the year under review, the expected pattern of normalization from the previous year continued. We are experiencing volumes well above the level from before the pandemic in 2019 in nearly all markets. The geographic presence of DHL eCommerce was expanded in the year under review through the acquisition of the Turkish company MNG Kargo.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-27-0\"></span>Image /page/27/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Satisfied customers and a high level of delivery reliability\n\nWe focus on delivering industry-leading performance as well as quality and service excellence. With this focus, we succeeded in achieving an overall global delivery quality of 96% (previous year: 95.5%). Moreover, by expanding our offering to more than 110,000 service points in Europe with 24,000 parcel lockers, we are closer to the customer and enable more sustainable last-mile delivery.\n\n### Post & Parcel Germany division\n\nImage /page/27/Figure/6 description: The image shows two figures with statistics about the nationwide post and parcel network in Germany. The first figure on the left shows that there are around 187,000 employees, around 25,000 sales points, and around 108,200 postboxes. The second figure on the right shows that there are around 6.3 million parcels per working day, around 46 million letters per working day, 38 parcel centers, 82 mail centers, and more than 13,000 Pack-and Poststations.\n\n#### The postal service for Germany\n\nThe core business of the Post & Parcel Germany division is the transport, sorting and delivery of documents and goods shipments. We maintain a nationwide post and parcel network in Germany, which we continually expand in consideration of digitalization and sustainability.\n\nOur products and services in the mail communication segment are targeted toward both private and business customers and range from physical and hybrid letters to additional services such as registered mail, cash on delivery and insured items.\n\nIn the year under review, the German market for mail communication for business customers was worth around €4.0 billion (previous year: around €4.3 billion). The downward trend in market development is due primarily to the continued substitution of traditional letter mail with electronic communication. This competitive market is made up of both alternative delivery service providers as well as consolidation service providers who deliver their mail volumes to Deutsche Post AG. Our market share increased to 63.2% compared with the prior year (62.1%), primarily due to competitors exiting the market.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/28/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters \"DHL\" is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### GERMAN MAIL COMMUNICATION MARKET, BUSINESS CUSTOMERS, 2023\n\n#### Market volume: around €4.0 billion\n\n| Deutsche Post | 63.2% |\n|---------------|-------|\n| Competition   | 36.8% |\n\nSource: own company estimate.\n\n#### Cross-channel dialogue\n\nOn request, Post & Parcel Germany offers advertisers end-to-end solutions in the Dialogue Marketing segment, ranging from address services and tools for design and creation to printing, delivery and evaluation. This supports cross-channel, personalized and automated dialogue to deliver digital and physical items with interrelated content according to a coordinated timetable and without any coverage waste.\n\nThe German advertising market increased by 1.3% in 2023 to come in at €29.0 billion, growing less than in the previous year. The market was burdened by heavily increased paper prices and the general economic development. Our share of the highly fragmented German advertising market amounted to 5.7% (previous year: 6.0%).\n\n#### GERMAN ADVERTISING MARKET1 2023\n\n#### Market volume: €29.0 billion\n\n| Competition   | 94.3% |\n|---------------|-------|\n| Deutsche Post | 5.7%  |\n\n1 Includes all advertising media with external distribution costs; the placement costs are shown as ratios. Source: own company estimate.\n\n#### DHL Parcel for companies and private individuals\n\nWe maintain the densest network of parcel acceptance and drop-off points in Germany, which was expanded further and digitalized in the reporting year.\n\nWe offer support to businesses to grow their online retail business. Along with the Supply Chain division, we are able to cover the entire logistics chain through to returns management on request.\n\nVarious services enable individualized parcel delivery for private customers: parcels can be delivered to an alternative address, a specific retail outlet, a Paketshop or a Packstation at short notice. This ability to individually select delivery options and notifications makes receiving a parcel more convenient and more transparent.\n\nThe German parcel market continues to be subject to competition-driven structural changes, with established as well as new companies offering their services. In e-commerce, the delivery of a portion of shipments is handled by the merchant's own distribution networks.\n\nThere has been no interruption in the growth trend in the number of online orders, despite the dynamic slowing down compared to previous years. In light of this as well, we are continuously expanding our network. By increasing the number of Pack- and Poststations in the coming years, we plan to make it even more convenient for customers all over Germany to send and receive parcels and to create an environmentally friendly, traffic-reduced parcel supply system.\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-29-0\"></span>Image /page/29/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Reliable delivery in a challenging environment\n\nAccording to surveys conducted by Quotas, a quality research institute, around 86% of all domestic letters posted in Germany during daily business hours at our retail outlets or before final collection were delivered the very next day in the year under review. Around 96% were delivered within two days. This puts us above the legally required levels of 80% (D+1) and 95% (D+2).\n\nThese figures can be deemed very positive in light of the challenging environment in which they were achieved. The beginning of 2023, for instance, was impacted by collective bargaining negotiations and the associated strikes. In addition, the situation on the German labor market remained tense overall in spite of the new collective bargaining agreement for employees of Deutsche Post AG.\n\nOur approximately 25,000 person-operated sales points were open for an average of 55 hours per week in the year under review, as was the case in the previous year. Consumers who use the products and services offered by Deutsche Post retail outlets operated mostly by retailers are surveyed annually regarding customer satisfaction by \"Kundenmonitor Deutschland.\" This study attested to the high level of approval enjoyed by Deutsche Post retail outlets: a total of 94.6% of the persons surveyed were satisfied with the quality and service (previous year: 94.2%). The fixed-location acceptance and sales network has grown to around 38,000 sites (previous year: around 36,300) thanks to the expansion of our Pack- and Poststation network. Deutsche Post and DHL are thus easier to reach and closer to consumers in Germany than ever before in recent decades.\n\n#### Strategy\n\n#### Navigating safely through a volatile, fast-changing environment\n\nThe DHL Group's strategy draws on the elements of Strategy 2015 and 2020, which established us as the world's leading logistics company. Building on this foundation, Strategy 2025, which we presented to the public at the end of 2019, has helped us to cement and grow that leading position.\n\nWe defined our strategic goals in a comprehensive process in which we worked with our relevant stakeholders including employees, customers, suppliers and investors. The \"Strategy House\" graphic of DHL Group illustrates the most important elements of our strategy and how they are connected.\n\nSo far, Strategy 2025 has guided us safely through the volatile, fast-changing environment. As part of a yearly assessment, we undertook a detailed review of our corporate strategy and found it not only to be fundamentally sound, but that it had also made DHL Group more resilient. Focusing on our core business has helped us to make the necessary adjustments quickly, in particular in the volatile environment of recent years, so that we could not only keep our promise to the customers under these challenging circumstances, but also ensure the financial stability of the company and do justice to the investors by sticking to our financial strategy. That resilience is the result of the disciplined and consistent execution of our Group strategy, with each and every element playing a key role.\n\n#### Strategic triad of purpose, vision and values\n\nOur purpose of \"Connecting people, improving lives\" has never been more important than it is today. In keeping with our vision of being THE logistics company for the world, DHL Group strives to continue leading the industry – and doing so in an increasingly digital and sustainability-oriented world. Our core values \"Respect and Results\" are just as much a part of our strategy today as they have been in the past.\n\nThe triad of purpose, vision and values underpins the three building blocks of Strategy 2025: sustained execution excellence along the three bottom lines; becoming an employer, provider and investment of choice; and a focus on our profitable core business and digital transformation. We have also cemented sustainability in the business strategy with our purpose and our own values. Respect and Results mean that we are committed to each other and, together, make a positive social contribution. Our purpose \"Connecting people, improving lives\" guides our efforts and sense of responsibility.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/30/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n[The Company](#page-2-0) \n\n#### STRATEGY HOUSE\n\nImage /page/30/Figure/4 description: The image shows a red abstract design. It consists of a series of interconnected diamond shapes, arranged in a pattern that resembles a stylized tree or branching structure. The diamonds vary in size and are connected by short lines, creating a network of geometric shapes. The overall impression is modern and somewhat minimalist.\n\nConnecting people, improving lives\n\nWe are the logistics company for the world\n\n**Respect & Results**\n\nImage /page/30/Picture/12 description: The image shows two sections with text and graphics. The top section features a triangular graphic divided into three parts: red (Employer of Choice), yellow (Provider of Choice), and green (Investment of Choice). In the center of the triangle is an icon with the text \"CONNECTING PEOPLE, IMPROVING LIVES\". To the right of the triangle is the text \"Our Mission\", followed by \"Excellence. Simply delivered.\", \"Along the three bottom lines in a sustainable way\", and \"Enabled by Common DNA\". The bottom section contains a graphic of three overlapping circles in yellow, gray, and white. The text \"PROFITABLE CORE\" is in the center of the circles. To the right of the circles is the text \"Our Business Unit focus\", followed by \"Strengthening the profitable core\" and \"Supported by Group functions\". At the bottom of the image is the word \"Digitalization\".\n\n#### Execution excellence along the three bottom lines\n\nOur mission of \"Excellence. Simply delivered.\" is defined by the three bottom lines of becoming the employer, provider and investment of choice. We believe having motivated and skilled employees is the key to providing excellent service quality and achieving profitable growth.\n\nAt DHL Group, when we speak of our Common DNA, we mean the set of behaviors, tools and programs that we put into practice throughout the Group. Group-wide programs such as Certified, First Choice and Safety First play an important part in building the Common DNA by influencing what we do on a day-to-day basis. Irrespective of division, geographical region or function, our Common DNA is an expression of who we are and how we do things at DHL Group.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-31-0\"></span>Image /page/31/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font size, also in red. The background of the image is yellow.\n\nAs an integral part of our strategy, sustainability is anchored along our three bottom lines. New policies and regulations across industries, increasingly changing buying habits and the growing interest in topics related to sustainability have motivated us to serve as a sustainability role model in our industry and to set ourselves ambitious targets. We therefore made sustainability a cornerstone of Strategy 2025 and an essential element of our mission.\n\nWith our ESG Roadmap, we build on our past achievements and plot a course for future success. The road map serves as guidance in the three areas of environment, social responsibility and corporate governance. Clear objectives were set for each of these areas. We strive for environmentally friendly logistics and aim to be a great place to work for all and a trustworthy company and partner.\n\nWe set transparent, time-bound targets and KPIs with which we make sustainability an integral component in the yearly planning and strategic cycle, with targets integrated into our decision-making process. One key target is to increase the pace of our company's planned decarbonization, **[nonfinancial statement.](#page-64-0)**\n\n#### Divisions focus on profitable core business\n\nOur divisions continue to focus relentlessly on their profitable core. In so doing, they ensure that our services and solutions can be provided reliably, even in unusual circumstances.\n\n#### Digital transformation as a key lever\n\nRepresenting a significant lever for sustainable business growth, digital transformation plays a crucial role in our strategy. We therefore invest in initiatives designed to improve the experiences our customers and employees have with the company and to increase operational efficiency. In our divisions, we have several initiatives and programs in place to upgrade the IT backbone, ensure our future agility and increase IT efficiency. In particular in the fields of automation and robotics, data science, API and the Internet of Things, we are continuously building up centralized know-how and scaling digital solutions for the divisions.\n\n#### Research and development\n\nAs a service provider, DHL Group does not engage in research and development activities in the narrower sense and therefore has no significant expenses to report in this connection.\n\n#### Steering metrics\n\n#### Financial and nonfinancial key performance indicators\n\nDHL Group uses both financial and nonfinancial performance indicators in its management of the Group. The monthly, quarterly and annual changes in these indicators are compared with prior-year data and forecast data to assist in making management decisions. The year-to-year changes in the financial and nonfinancial performance indicators described here also play a role in the calculation of management remuneration. The Group's financial performance indicators are intended to preserve a balance between profitability, the efficient use of resources and adequate liquidity. How these metrics are computed is illustrated in **[calculations.](#page-33-0)** The performance of the financial key figures in the reporting year is described in the **[report on economic position.](#page-35-0)**\n\nTo date, the progress of our ESG Roadmap has been measured using six steering-relevant performance indicators: logistics-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, Realized Decarbonization Effects, Employee Engagement, the share of women in middle and upper management, the lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) per 200,000 working hours and the share of valid compliancerelevant training certificates in middle and upper management. As planned, a seventh performance indicator – the cybersecurity rating – was introduced in corporate governance during the year under review. In addition, the performance indicators Realized Decarbonization Effects, Employee Engagement and cybersecurity rating are incorporated into – and account for 10%, respectively, of – the target portfolio for annual bonus calculation of the Board of Management. Since this reporting period, these performance indicators have also been included in the bonus calculation for executives in upper management. The targets and results of these key figures can be found in the **[report on economic position,](#page-36-0)** development is provided in the **[nonfinancial statement](#page-58-0)** and the outlook for the 2024 fiscal year is provided in the **[expected developments, opportunities and risks](#page-95-0)** chapter.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/32/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### EBIT and EAC (EBIT after asset charge)\n\nThe profitability of the Group's operating divisions is measured as profit from operating activities (EBIT).\n\nEBIT after asset charge (EAC) is another key performance indicator used by the Group. EAC is calculated by subtracting the asset charge, a cost-of-capital component, from EBIT. Making the asset charge a part of business decisions encourages the efficient use of resources and ensures that our operational business is geared toward increasing value sustainably while improving cash flow.\n\nThe asset charge is calculated on the basis of the weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, which is defined as the weighted average net cost of interest-bearing liabilities and equity, taking into account company-specific risk factors in accordance with the Capital Asset Pricing Model.\n\nA standard WACC of 8.5% is applied across the divisions. That figure also represents the minimum target for projects and investments within the Group. The WACC is generally reviewed once annually on the basis of the current situation on the financial markets. To ensure better comparability of the asset charge with previous figures, in 2023 the WACC used here was maintained at a constant level compared with the previous years.\n\nThe asset charge is calculated each month so that fluctuations in the net asset base can also be taken into account during the year. The composition of the net asset base is shown in the **[calculations.](#page-33-0)**\n\n#### Free cash flow facilitates liquidity management\n\nAlong with EBIT and EAC, cash flow is another key performance metric used by Group management. The goal is to maintain sufficient liquidity to cover all of the Group's financial obligations from debt repayment and dividends, in addition to meeting payment commitments arising from the Group's operations and investments. Cash flow is calculated using the cash flow statement.\n\nOperating cash flow (OCF) includes all items that are related directly to operating value creation. Another key parameter impacting OCF is net working capital. Effective management of net working capital is an important way for the Group to improve cash flow in the short to medium term.\n\nFree cash flow (FCF) is a management indicator derived from OCF. It is used as an indicator of how much cash is available to the company for paying out dividends or repaying debt at the end of a reporting period.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-33-0\"></span>Image /page/33/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of a stylized font with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. The word \"Group\" is in red and is located below the DHL part of the logo. The background is yellow.\n\n#### CALCULATIONS\n\nImage /page/33/Figure/4 description: The image shows a diagram of the calculation of EBIT and Revenue. On the left side, under the title REVENUE, \"Other operating income\" is added, \"Changes in inventories and work performed and capitalized\" is added, \"Materials expense\" is subtracted, \"Staff costs\" is subtracted, \"Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses\" is subtracted, \"Other operating expenses\" is subtracted, and \"Net income/loss from investments accounted for using the equity method\" is added or subtracted. The result is EBIT, or Profit from operating activities. On the right side, under the title EBIT, \"Asset charge\" is subtracted from EBIT. \"Net asset base\" is multiplied by \"Weighted average cost of capital (WACC)\". The result is EAC, or EBIT after Asset Charge. Below that, Operating assets include \"Intangible assets\", \"Property, plant and equipment\", \"Goodwill\", \"Trade receivables (included in net working capital)¹\", and \"Other noncurrent operating assets²\". Operating liabilities include \"Operating provisions (excluding provisions for pensions and similar obligations)\", \"Trade payables (included in net working capital)¹\", and \"Other noncurrent operating liabilities²\". The result is Net asset base.\n\n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n\n= **FCF**\nFree cash flow\n\n1 Includes EBIT-related current assets and liabilities. Not included are assets and liabilities related to taxes, financing and cash and cash equivalents, for example.\n\n2 Includes EBIT-related other noncurrent assets and liabilities. Not included are assets and liabilities related to taxes or bonds, for example.\n\n#### Steering and reducing greenhouse gas emissions\n\nWe aim to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by our operations, as well as our dependency on fossil fuels, in order to mitigate the impact of our operations on the global climate.\n\nWe use the **[logistics-related GHG emissions](#page-64-0)** as a medium- and long-term target. We use a second performance indicator – **[the Realized](#page-64-0)  [Decarbonization Effects](#page-64-0)** – to measure the emissions that we were able to avoid through the use of energy from renewable sources and sustainable technologies compared with conventional energy and technologies.\n\nThe calculation methodology for GHG emissions is based on recognized international standards such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, EN 16258 (replaced by ISO 14083 as of the 2024 fiscal year) and the Global Logistics Emissions Council Framework. To calculate the market-based effects, we use the guidelines of the Voluntary Market Based Measures Framework for Logistics Emissions Accounting and Reporting published by the Smart Freight Centre. Reductions in emissions through offsetting are not factored into our GHG emissions calculation.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/34/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nAs part of our steering, we consider the logistics-related GHG emissions including the upstream chain from fuel production (wellto-wheel) and include the GHG emissions caused or avoided by our transport subcontractors (Scope 3). We record the GHG emissions from categories 3 (\"Fuel- and Energy-Related Activities\"), 4 (\"Upstream Transportation and Distribution\") and 6 (\"Business Travel\"), which are also included in our targets, in the calculation of Scope 3 emissions. The use of sustainable fuels is a significant focus of our climate protection measures. The savings generated through these measures offer us the opportunity to implement climate protection in our own supply chain in a targeted manner. As part of this, fossil fuels are replaced by either the direct use of certified sustainable fuels or the documented use thereof (book and claim). This makes a positive impact on our target calculation.\n\n#### Employee engagement as a factor for success\n\nMotivated and committed employees contribute to the success of the company. In the annual Group-wide survey, all employees have the opportunity to anonymously rate the company's strategy and values as well as their working conditions. The **[Employee](#page-72-0)  [Engagement](#page-72-0)** key performance indicator represents the aggregated and weighted results of five statements in the annual Groupwide survey of employees.\n\n#### Promote diversity by focusing on share of women\n\nWe use the performance indicator of the share of women in middle and upper management to measure the success of our **[diversity](#page-73-0)  [measures.](#page-73-0)** As part of this measurement, executives working part-time are counted on a per-person basis.\n\n#### Occupational health and safety as a focus\n\nWe measure the effect of workplace accidents based on the **[lost time injury frequency rate \\(LTIFR\\),](#page-74-0)** which is determined using the number of work-related accidents per 200,000 working hours that lead to at least one day of missed work for the affected person following the day of the accident. Since the year under review, this has also included accident-related injuries to external employees who are subject to instruction.\n\n#### Subject cybersecurity to independent external assessment\n\nOur cybersecurity undergoes independent assessment by the external rating agency BitSight. This cybersecurity rating is based on the technical analysis of any weak points and brings potential security risks to the attention of the rated company. Assessment of the security situation is carried out by an automated service on a daily basis. Unlike with a self-assessment, a cybersecurity rating offers greater transparency and enables comparison with other companies thanks to standardization. We compare our performance with DAX 40 companies as well as major customers and logistics companies that are not a part of the DAX. The cybersecurity rating KPI has been steering-relevant since this reporting period and is also included in the calculation of the annual bonus for the Board of Management.\n\n#### Conduct compliance-relevant training\n\nOur aspiration is to be a reliable and trustworthy partner in all business relationships. When conducting day-to-day business, our managers serve an important function as role models to the employees and business partners, which is why corresponding training is of such importance for executives. We measure success in this area on the basis of the share of valid training certificates in middle and upper management. This performance indicator has been replaced by the cybersecurity rating since this reporting period in the calculation of the annual bonus for the Board of Management.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-35-0\"></span>Image /page/35/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller, less stylized font. The background is yellow.\n\n## REPORT ON ECONOMIC POSITION\n\n### Overall assessment of the Board of Management\n\nIn the first year without direct effects from the pandemic, the Group managed to maintain results of operations at a level well above that from the years before the pandemic, in spite of the absence of a thorough economic recovery. The 2023 fiscal year was shaped by the lack of global economic recovery and the normalization of freight transport following the pandemic-related volatility of the years 2021 and 2022. As expected, profit from operating activities (EBIT) of €6.3 billion did not reach the level of the prior-year figure. Lower freight volumes and significantly decreased freight rates, as well as negative currency effects, were a burden on the business of the DHL divisions. The results of the Post & Parcel Germany division reflect cost increases and regulatory framework conditions for the German letter mail business. Nevertheless, the Group achieved a free cash flow of €2.9 billion, including acquisitions and divestitures, in the past fiscal year. DHL Group thus underscores its structurally improved ability to perform and financial strength, even in a weak economic environment.\n\nIn the year under review, the divisions continued to focus on their profitable core business and ensured that the services and products could be provided reliably. On the one hand, DHL Group kept a close eye on costs and, on the other, invested further in growth areas of global operations as well as in the quality of its services. Representing a significant lever for sustainable business growth, digital transformation plays a crucial role in the DHL Group strategy. DHL Group therefore invests in initiatives designed to improve the experiences its customers and employees have with the company and to increase operational efficiency. Overall, we believe that e-commerce and globalization – along with omnishoring – and increasingly sustainability as well, are megatrends that will provide for growth in the future.\n\nDHL Group has a wealth of experience in dealing with various economic cycles and crises around the world. Thanks to its global presence and the broad portfolio of transport and logistics services, there were also areas of business growth in the year under review. DHL Group is well positioned to not only manage the current challenges, but also to take advantage of an upward trend in the global economy as soon as it arises.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-36-0\"></span>Image /page/36/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

These effects contributed to the high rates of inflation along with the loosening of fiscal and monetary policies during the coronavirus pandemic. The tightening of monetary policy up until the third quarter had a lasting weakening effect on the economy and global trade and is a significant factor in the caution seen in investments and consumer behavior. Although the energy markets settled down to a certain extent compared with the previous year, gas and electricity prices – especially in Germany and the rest of Europe – remained well above the level from before the war in Ukraine and thus impeded any thorough recovery of the global economy following the pandemic. Even though the key interest rates of leading central banks could have reached their peak in the fall of 2023, a loosening of monetary policy is not likely until the middle of 2024.\n\nThe data mentioned in the following paragraph describing the economic conditions stem from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nGlobal GDP growth continued to weaken from 3.1% in 2022 to 2.7% in 2023. GDP growth in industrialized companies fell from 2.6% to 1.6%, primarily due to the eurozone, which was impacted by the war in Ukraine and whose growth downright collapsed from 3.5% to 0.5%. Following growth of 1.9% in the previous year, Germany even fell into the slightly negative growth (–0.2%) in the year under review. By contrast, the United States bolstered economic activity from 1.9% to 2.4% with a very expansive fiscal policy. At the same time, emerging markets experienced a recovery from 3.7% to 4.2%, with a significant rise in China from 3.0% in 2022 to 5.4% in 2023 being a major contributor.\n\n#### Growth in global industrial production and global trade significantly hampered\n\nIn 2023, growth in global industrial production and global trade remained significantly hampered. Following growth of 7.0% and 2.8% in 2021 and 2022, respectively, industrial production grew by only 0.7% in 2023. The figures for global trade reflect this slowdown, with exports growing by a mere 1.1% compared with 10.9% in 2021 and 5.6% in 2022. For the logistics sector, this cooling comes with more moderate demand and declining volumes. In the B2B segment, challenges from partly excess inventories and dwindling demand persisted, which resulted in a sustained alignment of freight rates and transport capacities. Even toward the end of 2023, there was no significant recovery in demand, which underscores the ongoing global economic recession. For DHL Group, these developments manifested themselves in the form of a decline in revenue and earnings figures.\n\n#### E-commerce with structural growth dynamic\n\nIn spite of the overall uncertainty of the economy, continuing inflation and the slowdown in global trade, the e-commerce sector confirmed its structural growth dynamic. Following a preliminary normalization in 2022, e-commerce-based business once again experienced growth in 2023, which confirms the long-term change in consumer behaviors. DHL Group is making use of this dynamic to expand and improve its e-commerce logistics services.\n\n#### Legal environment\n\nThe Group provides some of its services in regulated markets. Many of the postal services rendered by Deutsche Post AG and its subsidiaries (particularly the Post & Parcel Germany division) are subject to sector-specific regulation under the Postgesetz (PostG – German Postal Act). Information regarding this issue and legal risks is contained in **[note 45 to the consolidated financial statements.](#page-213-0)** \n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-38-0\"></span>Image /page/38/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n## Significant events\n\nAs part of the completed second and third tranches and the initiated fourth tranche of the 2022–2024 share buyback program, we had repurchased a total of 22.0 million shares in the amount of €925 million over the course of the year through December 31, 2023. Since the beginning of the share buyback program, we have repurchased a total of 50.0 million shares with a value of €1,940 million. On February 12, 2024, the Board of Management resolved to expand the current share buyback program so that a total of up to 130 million treasury shares are to be purchased at a price of now up to €4 billion through the end of 2025.\n\nOn June 26, 2023, we placed a sustainability-linked bond with an issue volume of €500 million and a term through 2033. The interest rate from 2031 onward is linked to the achievement of DHL Group's targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nOn October 5, 2023, we acquired 100% of shares in the Turkish parcel service provider MNG Kargo following successful approval by the antitrust authorities. In the eCommerce division, the company should contribute to the ability to benefit from the growth potential of the Turkish market.\n\nOn December 7, 2023, we acquired the remaining shares in Danzas AEI Emirates, consolidated the company, which had previously been held as a joint venture, fully into the Group and renamed it DHL Logistics. With this acquisition, our customers in the Middle East and Africa region will benefit from more efficient logistics and transport services in the Global Forwarding, Freight division.\n\nThere were no further noteworthy changes to the portfolio.\n\n#### Results of operations\n\n#### SELECTED INDICATORS FOR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n|                                         |    | 2022   | 2023   | Q4 2022 | Q4 2023 |\n|-----------------------------------------|----|--------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Revenue                                 | €m | 94,436 | 81,758 | 23,776  | 21,348  |\n| Profit from operating activities (EBIT) | €m | 8,436  | 6,345  | 1,922   | 1,642   |\n| Return on sales1                        | %  | 8.9    | 7.8    | 8.1     | 7.7     |\n| EBIT after asset charge (EAC)2          | €m | 5,117  | 2,860  | 1,065   | 752     |\n| Consolidated net profit for the period3 | €m | 5,359  | 3,677  | 1,335   | 981     |\n| Earnings per share4                     | €  | 4.41   | 3.09   | 1.11    | 0.83    |\n| Dividend per share                      | €  | 1.85   | 1.855  | –       | –       |\n\n1 EBIT/revenue.\n\n2 Prior-year figure adjusted.\n\n3 After deduction of noncontrolling interests.\n\n4 Basic earnings per share.\n\n5 Proposal.\n\n#### Group revenue falls by 13.4%\n\nDue to the economic environment, Group revenue fell by €12,678 million to €81,758 million in the 2023 fiscal year. Above all, the normalization of freight rates in the Global Forwarding, Freight division and negative currency effects in the amount of €2,684 million also contributed to this development. The proportion of revenue generated abroad changed from 76.8% to 74.4%. In the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue was down from the prior-year period (€23,776 million) to €21,348 million; negative currency effects in the amount of €770 million contributed to this. At €2,787 million, other operating income fell short of the prior-year period (€2,925 million).\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-39-0\"></span>Image /page/39/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Significantly lower material expense\n\nMaterial expense decreased significantly from €53,473 million to €41,663 million, largely due to lower transport costs in the Global Forwarding, Freight division in particular as a result of lower volumes and freight rates. In addition, kerosine prices fell markedly year over year. Wage and salary increases and a slightly higher number of employees raised staff costs by €942 million to €26,977 million. Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses were up by €300 million to €4,477 million due to investment activity. At €5,409 million, other operating expenses were below the prior-year period (€5,712 million). In addition to decreased expenses from currency translation, lower expenses from impairment losses and remeasurements of receivables and liabilities were incurred in the year under review. Net income/expenses from investments accounted for using the equity method changed from €–39 million in the previous year to €161 million. In the year under review, this included, in particular, remeasurement income as a result of the increased shareholding in DHL Logistics in the United Arab Emirates.\n\n#### Consolidated EBIT down\n\nTotaling €6,345 million in the year under review, profit from operating activities (EBIT) came in €2,091 million lower than the prior-year figure. This figure declined from €1,922 million to €1,642 million in the fourth quarter. Primarily because the interest expenses for provisions and lease liabilities rose, net finance costs were €829 million and therefore above the level of the previous year (net finance costs of €525 million). Profit before income taxes fell by €2,395 million to €5,516 million. As a result, income taxes decreased by €613 million to €1,581 million in spite of a slightly higher tax rate.\n\n#### Consolidated net profit in line with EBIT\n\nConsolidated net profit showed a decline in the 2023 fiscal year from €5,717 million to €3,935 million. Of this amount, €3,677 million is attributable to Deutsche Post AG shareholders and €258 million to noncontrolling interest holders. Basic earnings per share fell from €4.41 to €3.09 and diluted earnings per share from €4.33 to €3.04.\n\n#### Dividend of €1.85 per share proposed\n\nOur finance strategy calls for paying out 40% to 60% of net profit as dividends as a general rule. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will therefore propose to the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on May 3, 2024, a dividend of €1.85 per share for the 2023 fiscal year (previous year: €1.85). The payout ratio in relation to the consolidated net profit attributable to Deutsche Post AG shareholders amounts to 59.0%. The dividend yield based on the year-end closing price for shares is 4.1%. The dividend will be disbursed on May 8, 2024.\n\nImage /page/39/Figure/11 description: The image shows a bar graph with a line graph overlayed on top of it. The y axis is labeled '€m'.

While EBIT was down, the imputed asset charge rose slightly.\n\n#### EBIT AFTER ASSET CHARGE (EAC)\n\n| €m             | 20221  | 2023   | +/-%  |\n|----------------|--------|--------|-------|\n| EBIT           | 8,436  | 6,345  | -24.8 |\n| – Asset charge | -3,319 | -3,485 | -5.0  |\n| = EAC          | 5,117  | 2,860  | -44.1 |\n\n1 Prior-year figures adjusted.\n\nNet asset base as of the reporting date increased by €1,724 million to €41,886 million. Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment increased, mainly on account of the takeover of MNG Kargo as well as the acquisition of freight aircraft and investments in warehouses, sorting facilities and the vehicle fleet. Net working capital decreased compared with the previous year.\n\nBoth operating provisions as well as other noncurrent assets and liabilities were up.\n\n#### NET ASSET BASE (CONSOLIDATED)1\n\n| €m                                                                                 | Dec. 31, 20222 | Dec. 31, 2023 | +/-%  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------|-------|\n| Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment3                               | 42,810         | 44,580        | 4.1   |\n| ± Net working capital                                                              | -296           | -374          | -26.4 |\n| – Operating provisions (excluding provisions for pensions and similar obligations) | -2,464         | -2,495        | -1.3  |\n| ± Other noncurrent assets and liabilities                                          | 112            | 175           | 56.3  |\n| = Net asset base                                                                   | 40,162         | 41,886        | 4.3   |\n\n1 Assets and liabilities as described in the segment reporting, **[note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.](#page-152-0)**\n\n2 Prior-year figures adjusted.\n\n3 Including assets held for sale.\n\n#### Express division\n\n#### Impacts of external factors on our business\n\nDeclining volume development shaped 2023. Within the context of the high levels of economic uncertainty around the world and consumer reluctance, both the B2B and the B2C volumes were down year over year. In this environment, our virtual airline model ensured high network flexibility, enabling us to constantly adapt our capacity to volume expectations.\n\n#### Express: effective yield and cost management\n\nRevenue in the Express division decreased by 10.0% to €24,846 million in the 2023 fiscal year. This includes negative currency effects amounting to €1,196 million, as well as lower fuel surcharges. Excluding currency effects and fuel surcharges, revenue in the reporting period was down 4.8%. Reflective of the continued softer market conditions, TDI daily shipment volumes declined by 2.5%.\n\nOver the course of 2023, benefits were seen from the drive to enhance productivity, optimize the utilization of capacity in our network and effectively manage costs. We addressed the ongoing effects of inflation with general price increases that were systematically implemented. In the 2023 fiscal year, EBIT in the Express division was €3,229 million, 19.8% below the prior-year figure. The return on sales was 13.0%. In the fourth quarter of 2023, EBIT in the Express division was €758 million, 19.4% below the level of the comparable prior-year figure; return on sales was 11.6%.\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/41/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

By the end of 2023, 22 of the aircraft ordered entered service. The remaining six aircraft will be delivered in 2024 and 2025. Furthermore, over the course of 2023, we continued to expand our air network with the addition of new direct services, for example between Guangzhou and the United States. Singapore Airlines now operates five B777s under the crew and maintenance agreement signed in 2022.\n\nDHL Air UK expanded its B777 operations from three to seven freighters. DHL Air Austria added two B767-300 to its operations. European Air Transport (EAT) continues to strengthen DHL's network by providing intercontinental services to Asia and the United States. In the Americas region, our regional hub located in Atlanta, USA, which opened in the previous year, bolstered our capabilities. The dedicated flights from Miami to São Paulo (VCP), Brazil, were extended to include Argentina as well. We are continuing to invest in our global hub in Cincinnati, USA, and constructed a state-of-the-art aviation maintenance facility there for our aircraft fleet. In the Asia Pacific region, three additional converted Airbus 330-300s were added by Air Hong Kong to its fleet. The fleet replacement and modernization program will continue in 2024. The extension of the hub in Hong Kong – one of DHL's three global hubs – was officially opened in 2023. In the MEA region, we invested in our infrastructure by modernizing the Bahrain hub. We also increased our fleet of B767-300s from seven to ten converted freighters, of which the last was added in June 2023. The increase in the number of aircraft has allowed us to link east to west as well as strengthen the regional network. In sub-Saharan Africa, four converted ATR 72-500s replaced older aircraft.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-42-0\"></span>Image /page/42/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n### Global Forwarding, Freight division\n\n#### Impacts of external factors on our business\n\nIn 2023, the global forwarding market was shaped by the post-pandemic normalization, the weak global economy and geopolitical wars and conflicts like those in Ukraine, in the Middle East and, at the end of the year, on the Red Sea. Due to the weak demand, market volumes were below that of the previous year, but they stabilized over the course of the year. With regard to air freight rates, normalization continued as expected and there were no major fluctuations. This trend was also observed for ocean freight, with a rise in rates setting in toward the end of the year as carriers began to pass on higher costs for freight rerouting on the Red Sea.\n\nIn the European road freight market, the decline in demand due to economic circumstances continued in the year under review and worsened in the third quarter of 2023, in particular. However, costs remained at a high level due to rising diesel, driver and vehicle prices, among other factors.\n\n#### Global Forwarding, Freight: lower revenue in air and ocean freight as anticipated\n\nRevenue in the Global Forwarding, Freight division fell significantly in the year under review by 36.1% to €19,305 million due to lower volumes and significantly decreased freight rates. Excluding negative currency effects of €871 million, revenue was 33.2% below the level of the previous year. In the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue in the Global Forwarding, Freight division amounted to €4,565 million and fell short of the prior-year figure by 32.9%.\n\nRevenue in the Global Forwarding business unit decreased by 42.9% to €14,259 million in the year under review against the backdrop of the general normalization of freight markets. Without taking negative currency effects of €756 million into account, the decrease was 39.9%. Gross profit in the reporting period in the Global Forwarding business unit was down from the previous year by 25.5% to €3,685 million.\n\nWe registered a decrease of 12.1% in air freight volumes in 2023 that impacted all significant trade lanes. Air freight revenues dropped by 42.2% and gross profit by 41.5% year over year due to lower volumes and selling rates. In the fourth quarter of 2023, air freight revenue declined by 32.5% and gross profit by 45.4%. The volumes transported in ocean freight declined by 6.2% in 2023 compared with the previous year, with the decline caused by the development on trade lanes from Asia and Europe to North America. Ocean freight revenue in the reporting period dropped by 51.0% and gross profit by 24.8%. In the fourth quarter of 2023, our ocean freight revenue was 52.6% and gross profit 31.7% below the previous year.\n\nIn the year under review, revenue in the Freight business unit amounted to €5,162 million and was thus 3.9% below the previous year, with negative currency effects totaling €119 million. Volumes were down by 9.2%. Gross profit in the reporting period for the business unit fell slightly by 0.2% to €1,328 million. In the fourth quarter, revenue was 6.2% below the previous year; excluding negative currency effects of €28 million, the decline was 4.2%.\n\nEBIT in the Global Forwarding, Freight division fell in the year under review, from €2,311 million to €1,423 million. The EBIT margin was 7.4%. EBIT in the division thus corresponds to 28.4% of gross profit and 34.6% for the Global Forwarding business unit. At €340 million, division EBIT in the fourth quarter of 2023 was below the prior-year level of €402 million. The conclusion of the acquisition of the remaining shares in DHL Logistics in the United Arab Emirates led to an earnings contribution of €114 million in the fourth quarter.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-43-0\"></span>Image /page/43/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

High flexibility, standardized processes and targeted data analyses made a contribution to the management of our customers' supply chains.\n\n#### Supply Chain: continued growth of revenue and earnings\n\nRevenue in the Supply Chain division was up by 3.2% to €16,958 million in the year under review. Excluding negative currency effects of €462 million, the increase was 6.0%. All regions and sectors recorded revenue growth that was bolstered by new business, contract renewals and expanding e-commerce business. Revenue remained flat in the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding negative currency effects of €121 million, the increase was 2.7% in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn the reporting period, the Supply Chain division concluded additional contracts with a volume of €7,378 million. The Consumer, Retail and Technology sectors accounted for the majority of the new business, which is, in a large part, attributable to e-commercebased solutions. The contract renewal rate remained at a consistently high level.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-44-0\"></span>Image /page/44/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The background is yellow.\n\nEBIT in the Supply Chain division increased to €961 million in the year under review (previous year: €893 million). In addition to the positive development of revenue, earnings growth was spurred by productivity improvements thanks to digitalization and standardization. The EBIT margin was 5.7% in the year under review. EBIT in the Supply Chain division decreased minimally from €225 million to €220 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, which is attributable primarily to negative currency effects.\n\n#### KEY FIGURES, SUPPLY CHAIN\n\n| €m                                             | 2022   | 2023   | +/-% | Q4 2022 | Q4 2023 | +/-%  |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------|---------|---------|-------|\n| Revenue                                        | 16,431 | 16,958 | 3.2  | 4,363   | 4,361   | 0.0   |\n| of which EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) | 7,252  | 7,481  | 3.2  | 1,946   | 1,935   | -0.6  |\n| Americas                                       | 6,832  | 7,003  | 2.5  | 1,787   | 1,797   | 0.6   |\n| Asia Pacific                                   | 2,419  | 2,542  | 5.1  | 649     | 654     | 0.8   |\n| Consolidation/Other                            | -72    | -68    | 5.6  | -19     | -25     | -31.6 |\n| Profit from operating activities (EBIT)        | 893    | 961    | 7.6  | 225     | 220     | -2.2  |\n| Return on sales (%)1                           | 5.4    | 5.7    | –    | 5.2     | 5.0     | –     |\n| Operating cash flow                            | 1,433  | 1,726  | 20.4 | 820     | 779     | -5.0  |\n\n1 EBIT/revenue.\n\nImage /page/44/Figure/7 description: The image contains two pie charts showing the supply chain revenue by sector and region in 2023.

Thanks to our diversified portfolio, however, our business remained resilient, and we are experiencing volumes well above the level from before the pandemic in 2019 in nearly all markets.\n\n#### eCommerce: Revenue above prior-year level\n\nThe revenue generated in the eCommerce division in the year under review totaled €6,315 million, 2.8% above the level of the previous year. Excluding negative currency effects of €174 million, revenue was 5.6% above the prior-year figure. In the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue for the eCommerce division improved by 7.6% to €1,825 million.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-45-0\"></span>Image /page/45/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nEBIT in the eCommerce division declined from €389 million to €292 million in the year under review. This was attributable mainly to higher costs as well as continuous investment in the expansion of the networks. The EBIT margin was 4.6% for the reporting period. EBIT in the eCommerce division amounted to €78 million (previous year: €91 million) in the fourth quarter of 2023 with an EBIT margin of 4.3%.\n\n#### KEY FIGURES, ECOMMERCE\n\n| €m                                      | 2022  | 2023  | +/-%  | Q4 2022 | Q4 2023 | +/-%  |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|---------|---------|-------|\n| Revenue                                 | 6,142 | 6,315 | 2.8   | 1,696   | 1,825   | 7.6   |\n| of which Americas                       | 2,188 | 2,190 | 0.1   | 636     | 637     | 0.2   |\n| Europe                                  | 3,235 | 3,465 | 7.1   | 884     | 1,013   | 14.6  |\n| Asia                                    | 720   | 659   | -8.5  | 177     | 175     | -1.1  |\n| Consolidation/Other                     | -1    | 1     | >100  | -1      | 0       | 100.0 |\n| Profit from operating activities (EBIT) | 389   | 292   | -24.9 | 91      | 78      | -14.3 |\n| Return on sales (%)1                    | 6.3   | 4.6   | –     | 5.4     | 4.3     | –     |\n| Operating cash flow                     | 582   | 504   | -13.4 | 113     | 150     | 32.7  |\n\n1 EBIT/revenue.\n\n#### Post & Parcel Germany division\n\n#### Impacts of external factors on our business\n\nThe structural transformation in letter mail business continues: as conventional letter mail volumes containing documents continue to decline, volumes of goods shipments in the mail and parcel network are growing. The Dialogue Marketing business unit underwent negative development, with the advertising spend for physical mail declining compared with the previous year due to inflation, reluctance to buy and customer insolvencies. In the German parcel market, the war in Ukraine and the increased cost of living dampened the mood in online shopping and caused parcel volumes to stagnate.\n\n#### Post & Parcel Germany: ongoing structural change shapes business performance\n\nRevenue in the Post & Parcel Germany division amounted to €16,892 million in the year under review and slightly exceeded the prior-year figure by 0.7%. The main reasons for this development were the higher prices for business customers starting in the second half of the year and increased volumes in national and international business with goods shipments. This was countered by a volume decline in national and international postal business caused by sustained structural change in mail and communication business as well as declining sales of advertising mail. Furthermore, decisions to discontinue sales territories for the EINKAUFAKTUELL product in 2023 and the overall discontinuation in 2024 had a negative impact on sales in the Dialogue Marketing segment. Parcel Germany performed well, contrary to the general market trend. Revenue in the Post & Parcel Germany division for the fourth quarter of 2023 was up by 2.5% versus the prior year.\n\nEBIT in the Post & Parcel Germany division in 2023 amounted to €870 million and was below of the prior-year figure by 31.5%. With revenue above the prior year especially in the parcel business, this was driven by higher material costs brought on by inflation and pressure from collective bargaining agreements. The costs also include €30 million in expenses for an early-retirement program established in the fourth quarter of 2023. Return on sales in the reporting period was 5.2%. EBIT in the Post & Parcel Germany division amounted to €402 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and was thus 4.7% above the prior-year period. Return on sales in the quarter was 8.5%.\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-46-0\"></span>Image /page/46/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Financial management is a centralized function in the Group\n\nThe Group's financial management activities include managing liquidity along with hedging against fluctuations in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices, arranging Group financing, issuing guarantees and letters of comfort and liaising with rating agencies. Responsibility for these activities rests with Corporate Finance at Group headquarters in Bonn, which is supported by three Regional Treasury Centers in Bonn (Germany), Weston (Florida, USA) and Singapore. The regional centers act as interfaces between Group headquarters and the operating companies, advise the companies on financial management issues and ensure compliance with Group-wide requirements. Corporate Finance's main task is to minimize financial risk and the cost of capital in addition to preserving the Group's financial stability and flexibility over the long term.\n\n#### Creating value through transparent and effective capital allocation\n\nBuilding on the principles and objectives of financial management, and in light of the Group's strong financial position, the Corporate Board most recently updated the finance strategy in January 2022. It takes into account the shareholders' interests and the lenders' requirements, focusing on value creation through a transparent and effective allocation of capital. It also aims to maintain financial flexibility and a low cost of capital for the Group with a high degree of continuity and predictability for investors, and to support the Group's ESG Roadmap. One key component of the strategy is a stand-alone target rating between \"Baa1\" and \"A3\" and \"BBB+\" and \"A–,\" respectively. The strategy also sets clear priorities on how available liquidity is allocated. It will first be used to fund business operations, finance organic investments and make regular dividend payments. Thereafter, additional dividend payments or share buybacks as well as inorganic growth will be considered.\n\n#### FINANCE STRATEGY\n\nImage /page/47/Figure/8 description: The image shows a diagram outlining priorities for available liquidity, credit rating, regular dividend policy, debt portfolio, investors, and group. Under \"Priorities for Available Liquidity\" is \"Free Cash Flow Generation\" which includes \"Fund Business Operations\", \"Finance Organic Investments\", and \"Pay Regular Dividend\". Below that is \"Shareholder Distribution Beyond Regular Dividend\" and \"Fund Inorganic Growth\". Below that is \"Balance Sheet Strength\". Under \"Credit Rating\" is \"Maintain stand-alone ratings between 'Baa1' and 'A3' and 'BBB+' and 'A-', respectively\". Under \"Regular Dividend Policy\" is \"Pay 40% to 60% of net profit\" and \"Consider cash flow and continuity\". Under \"Debt Portfolio\" is \"Syndicated credit facility as a liquidity reserve\" and \"Sustainability-linked finance framework as option for future funding\". Under \"Investors\" is \"Value creation through transparent and effective capital allocation\", \"Transparent and reliable information from the company\", and \"Predictability of expected shareholders distribution\". Under \"Group\" is \"Preserve financial and strategic flexibility\", \"Commitment to the Group's ESG Roadmap\", and \"Assure access to debt capital markets and low cost of capital\".\n\n#### Cash and liquidity managed centrally\n\nThe cash and liquidity of our globally operating subsidiaries is managed centrally by Corporate Treasury. Approximately 80% of the Group's external revenue is consolidated in cash pools and used to balance internal liquidity needs. In countries where this practice is ruled out for legal reasons, internal and external borrowing and investment are managed centrally by Corporate Treasury. In this context, we observe a balanced banking policy in order to remain independent of individual banks. Our subsidiaries' intra-Group revenue is also pooled and managed by our in-house bank (intercompany clearing) in order to avoid paying external bank charges and margins. Payment transactions are executed in accordance with uniform guidelines using standardized processes and IT systems. Many Group companies pool their external payment transactions in the intra-Group Payment Factory, which executes payments on behalf of the respective companies via Deutsche Post AG's central bank accounts.\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-48-0\"></span>Image /page/48/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Limiting market risks\n\nTo limit market risks, the Group makes use of primary and derivative financial instruments. Interest rate swaps are used to hedge against interest rate risks, and forward transactions are used for currency risks. We pass on most of the risk arising from commodity price fluctuations to our customers and, to some extent, use commodity swaps to manage the remaining risk. The parameters, responsibilities and controls governing the use of derivatives are laid down in internal guidelines.\n\n#### Flexible and stable financing\n\nThe Group covers its long-term financing requirements by means of equity and debt. This ensures our financial stability and also provides adequate flexibility. Our most important source of funds is net cash from operating activities.\n\nWe also have a syndicated credit facility in a total volume of €2 billion that creates a secure, long-term liquidity reserve. The term of the syndicated credit facility is through 2025, it does not contain any further covenants concerning the Group's financial indicators and, thanks to our solid liquidity situation, it was not drawn down during the year under review.\n\nAs part of our banking policy, we spread our business volume widely and maintain long-term relationships with the financial institutions we entrust with our business. We meet our borrowing requirements primarily through independent sources of financing, such as bonds and leases. Most debt is taken out centrally in order to leverage economies of scale and specialization benefits and hence minimize borrowing costs.\n\nIn June 2023, we placed a sustainability-linked bond with an issue volume of €500 million and a term through 2033. Moreover, a promissory note loan in the amount of €100 million was repaid in September 2023 and one bond in the amount of €500 million was repaid in October 2023. Information on bonds is contained in **[note 39 to the consolidated financial statements.](#page-189-0)**\n\n#### Group's credit rating unchanged\n\nAs of the reporting date, our credit rating was still at \"BBB+\" with a positive outlook according to Fitch Ratings and was classified as \"A2\" with a stable outlook by Moody's Investor Service. The solid investment-grade ratings ensure unfettered access to the capital market. The following table shows the ratings as of the reporting date and the underlying factors. The complete and current analyses by the rating agencies and the rating categories can be found under **[creditor relations.](https://group.dhl.com/en/investors/creditor-relations.html)**\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/49/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

For Fitch Ratings, the long-term rating is BBB+, the short-term rating is F2, and the outlook is positive. Under \"Rating factors\" are the following bullet points: Company size and geographic diversification, Broad portfolio of services and customers, Market leadership, Balanced business risk profile between the parcel and express segments, which are growing due to online retail, contract logistics business and the cyclical freight forwarding business, and Solid credit metrics and liquidity. Under \"Rating factors\" with a minus sign are the following bullet points: Structural volume decline in letter mail business, and Increased capital expenditure and dividends to shareholders. For Moody's Investors Service, the long-term rating is A2, the short-term rating is P-1, and the outlook is stable. Under \"Rating factors\" are the following bullet points: Strong business profile and large scale, supported by the company's global leadership positions in express and logistics services, and its large German mail business, Support related to its government-related issuer (GRI) status because of the German government's 21% indirect ownership of the company and the importance of the company's services to the German economy, and Solid financial profile. Under \"Rating factors\" with a minus sign is the following bullet point: Muted economic conditions, which impair volumes.\n\n- \n- \n- \n\n#### Liquidity and sources of funds\n\nAs of the reporting date, the Group reported centrally available liquidity in the amount of €1.3 billion (previous year: €2.0 billion), which is comprised of cash and cash equivalents as well as current financial assets. Due to our solid liquidity situation, the syndicated credit line in the amount of €2 billion was not drawn. In addition, unused bilateral credit lines totaling €1.6 billion were available to the Group as of the reporting date. The following table gives a breakdown of the financial liabilities reported in the balance sheet.

Continuous maintenance and renewal of our intercontinental air fleet represented an additional focus of investment spending. Some of these investments were attributable to rights of use.

In the Supply Chain division, the majority of funds were invested to support customer implementations in all regions, above all in the\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/51/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The background of the image is yellow.\n\nAmericas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. In the eCommerce division, most of the investments were attributable to network expansion in the Netherlands, the United States, Poland and the United Kingdom. In the Post & Parcel Germany division, the largest capex portion was attributable to the expansion of our infrastructure. The acquisition and development of property were continued in the year under review. An additional key focus was expanding Pack- and Poststations. At Group Functions, investments in the reporting year were mainly in the vehicle fleet and IT solutions.\n\n#### Decline in net cash from operating activities\n\nNet cash from operating activities fell from €10,965 million to €9,258 million. All noncash income and expenses, including the income from the increase in the shareholding in DHL Logistics, were eliminated based upon EBIT, which at €6,345 million was down substantially on the prior-year figure. The lower EBIT was partially compensated for by the higher cash inflow from the change in the working capital. The cash inflow was €536 million in the year under review, compared with an inflow of €215 million in the previous year. Income taxes paid declined by €157 million to €1,625 million.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased from €3,179 million to €2,181 million. In the previous year, this was primarily shaped by the purchase price payment for the acquisition of the Hillebrand Group in the net amount of €1,379 million. Cash paid to acquire property, plant and equipment and intangible assets fell from €3,912 million to €3,381 million and related primarily to the expansion and renewal of our air fleet as well as network infrastructure. The cash inflow from the change in current financial assets decreased from €1,664 million to €963 million. In the previous year, we sold money market funds to enable the purchase of subsidiaries and other business units in the amount of €1,613 million, in addition to the payment of the dividend.\n\nFree cash flow fell from €3,067 million to €2,942 million. In the previous year, this figure was significantly characterized by the purchase price payment for Hillebrand. Excluding the payments for acquisitions and divestitures, it decreased by €1,284 million.\n\n| €m                                                                                     | 2022   | 2023   | Q4 2022 | Q4 2023 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Net cash from operating activities                                                     | 10,965 | 9,258  | 3,090   | 2,480   |\n| Sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets                            | 112    | 153    | 36      | 48      |\n| Acquisition of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets                     | –3,912 | –3,381 | –1,507  | –933    |\n| Cash outflow from change in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets        | –3,800 | –3,228 | –1,471  | –885    |\n| Disposals of subsidiaries and other business units                                     | 69     | –1     | 0       | –1      |\n| Disposals of investments accounted for using the equity method and other investments   | 4      | 78     | 0       | 48      |\n| Acquisition of subsidiaries and other business units                                   | –1,613 | –424   | –99     | –423    |\n| Acquisition of investments accounted for using the equity method and other investments | 0      | –34    | 0       | –13     |\n| Cash outflow from acquisitions/divestitures                                            | –1,540 | –381   | –99     | –389    |\n| Proceeds from lease receivables                                                        | 179    | 195    | 45      | 49      |\n| Interest from lease receivables                                                        | 21     | 29     | 6       | 8       |\n| Repayment of lease liabilities                                                         | –2,283 | –2,445 | –631    | –631    |\n| Interest on lease liabilities                                                          | –452   | –540   | –123    | –152    |\n| Cash outflow for leases                                                                | –2,535 | –2,761 | –703    | –726    |\n| Interest received (without leasing)                                                    | 159    | 224    | 46      | 49      |\n| Interest paid (without leasing)                                                        | –182   | –170   | –81     | –94     |\n| Net interest paid/received                                                             | –23    | 54     | –35     | –45     |\n| Free cash flow                                                                         | 3,067  | 2,942  | 782     | 435     |\n\n#### CALCULATION OF FREE CASH FLOW\n\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased from €7,411 million to €6,898 million. The placement of the sustainability-linked bond is reflected in the assumption of noncurrent financial liabilities in the amount of €501 million. Despite an increased dividend per share, the dividend distribution of €2,205 million remained unchanged year over year due to the share buyback program. Payments for the acquisition of treasury shares in the amount of €986 million (previous year: €1,099 million) were incurred in\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-52-0\"></span>Image /page/52/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

In particular, the acquisition of MNG Kargo and the shareholding increase in DHL Logistics caused an increase in goodwill. Property, plant and equipment grew from €28,688 million to €29,958 million, as investments exceeded disposals, depreciation, amortization and impairment losses and negative currency effects. Current financial assets dropped considerably from €1,799 million to €833 million, due mainly to the liquidation of shortterm investments. Trade receivables decreased by €1,716 million to €10,537 million. Other current assets declined from €3,107 million to €2,415 million, primarily because prepaid expenses for transport costs fell.\n\nAt €22,477 million, equity attributable to Deutsche Post AG shareholders was lower than on December 31, 2022 (€23,236 million). The consolidated net profit for the period increased this figure, while the dividend distribution, currency effects, share buybacks and the remeasurement of pension obligations decreased it. In particular, remeasurements resulted in a significant increase of €583 million in provisions for pensions and similar obligations to €2,519 million. Financial liabilities increased from €22,166 million to €22,718 million, primarily because lease liabilities increased on account of investments. Trade payables declined from €9,933 million to €8,479 million. Also, because tax liabilities fell, other current liabilities decreased by €652 million to €5,536 million.\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-53-0\"></span>Image /page/53/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The assets chart includes intangible assets (21% in 2022, 22% in 2023), property, plant, and equipment (42% in 2022, 45% in 2023), trade receivables (18% in 2022, 16% in 2023), and other assets (19% in 2022, 17% in 2023). The equity and liabilities chart includes equity (35% in 2022, 34% in 2023), noncurrent provisions and liabilities (33% in 2022, 35% in 2023), and current provisions and liabilities (32% in 2022, 31% in 2023). The total assets and equity and liabilities are 68,476 million euros in 2022 and 66,814 million euros in 2023.\n\n1 Prior-year figures adjusted, **[note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.](#page-133-0)** \n\n#### Higher net debt\n\nOur net debt increased from €15,856 million as of December 31, 2022, to €17,739 million as of December 31, 2023. At 34.3%, the equity ratio was in line with the figure as of December 31, 2022 (34.6%). The net interest cover ratio indicates the extent to which net interest expenses are covered by EBIT. At 13.9, it was considerably below the prior-year level (18.6). Net gearing expresses the ratio of net debt to the total of equity and net debt. This figure was 43.7% as of December 31, 2023.\n\n#### NET DEBT\n\n| €m                                               | Dec. 31, 2022 | Dec. 31, 2023 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Noncurrent financial liabilities                 | 17,616        | 17,882        |\n| + Current financial liabilities                  | 3,486         | 3,897         |\n| = Financial liabilities1                         | 21,102        | 21,779        |\n| – Cash and cash equivalents                      | 3,790         | 3,649         |\n| – Current financial assets1                      | 1,355         | 364           |\n| – Positive fair value of noncurrent derivatives2 | 101           | 27            |\n| = Financial assets                               | 5,246         | 4,040         |\n| Net debt                                         | 15,856        | 17,739        |\n\n1 Less operating financial liabilities and/or operating financial assets.\n\n2 Recognized in noncurrent financial assets in the balance sheet.\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-54-0\"></span>Image /page/54/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

For this reason, the following presentation focuses in particular on the annual results under the HGB.\n\n#### Employees\n\nThe number of full-time equivalents at Deutsche Post AG as of the reporting date was 159,265 (previous year: 161,772).\n\n#### Results of operations\n\nRevenue rose by a total of €416 million (2.6%) year over year.\n\nRevenue from the German letter mail business was €7,193 million in the year under review and thus 4.6% below the prior-year level of €7,537 million. Of this revenue, €4,569 million (previous year: €4,861 million) was attributable to Mail Communication, €1,653 million (previous year: €1,711 million) to Dialogue Marketing and €971 million (previous year: €965 million) to other services. Revenue in the German parcel business in the reporting year was €6,452 million, exceeding the prior-year figure of €5,820 million by 10.9%. This is primarily attributable to higher intra-Group remuneration. Revenue of €2,153 million (previous year: €2,049 million) was reported for our International business unit in the reporting period. Other revenue amounted to €750 million (previous year: €726 million) and included mainly income from service level agreements, rental agreements and leases and reimbursements for employee leasing.\n\n#### INCOME STATEMENT FOR DEUTSCHE POST AG (HGB) – JANUARY 1 TO DECEMBER 31\n\n| €m                                                                                  | 2022    | 2023    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Revenue                                                                             | 16,132  | 16,548  |\n| Other own work capitalized                                                          | 96      | 101     |\n| Other operating income                                                              | 1,265   | 1,034   |\n|                                                                                     | 17,493  | 17,683  |\n| Material expense                                                                    | -5,887  | -5,988  |\n| Staff costs                                                                         | -8,740  | -9,090  |\n| Amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of property, plant and equipment | -338    | -352    |\n| Other operating expenses                                                            | -2,636  | -2,528  |\n|                                                                                     | -17,601 | -17,958 |\n| Financial result                                                                    | 3,078   | 3,403   |\n| Taxes on income                                                                     | -369    | -342    |\n| Result after tax/Net profit for the period                                          | 2,601   | 2,786   |\n| Retained profits brought forward from previous year                                 | 8,034   | 6,430   |\n| Net retained profit                                                                 | 10,635  | 9,216   |\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-55-0\"></span>Image /page/55/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

To the right and below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in a smaller, sans-serif font, also in red. The background of the logo is yellow.\n\nOther operating income registered a year-over-year decrease of €231 million, or 18.3%, driven mainly by lower income from currency translation (€176 million lower) and lower income from the reversal of provisions (€67 million lower).\n\nDue to higher costs on account of inflation, material expense rose by €101 million on account of an increase in the cost of transport services for letters and parcels as well as an increase for leases and rents.\n\nStaff costs were up by €350 million. In the year under review, inflation compensation payments in the amount of €387 million were made.\n\nThe decrease in other operating expenses by €108 million stemmed mainly from lower expenses from currency translation (€165 million).\n\nThe financial result in the amount of €3,403 million mainly comprises net investment income of €2,864 million (previous year: €3,739 million) and a net interest income of €541 million (previous year: expense of €657 million). The change in net investment income is due to the €874 million decrease in income from profit transfer agreements attributable to Deutsche Post Beteiligungen Holding GmbH, whose earnings were the result of higher intra-Group interest expenses and lower income from investments. Income from the discounting of provisions and higher intra-Group interest income due to increased interest rates in the market environment led to the improvement in net interest income of Deutsche Post AG.\n\nAfter accounting for taxes on income of €–342 million, net profit for the period totaled €2,786 million. Including retained profits carried forward, net retained profit for the period amounted to €9,216 million.\n\n### Net assets and financial position\n\n#### Total assets down\n\nTotal assets declined to €45,425 million as of the reporting date.\n\nFixed assets increased from €17,882 million to €18,103 million. Investments in property, plant and equipment totaled €526 million (previous year: €828 million) and related to land and buildings (€178 million), technical equipment (€164 million), other equipment and operating and office equipment (€65 million), as well as assets under development (€119 million). Investments were made mainly in mail and parcel centers, conveyor and sorting systems, Pack- and Poststations and real estate for network expansion. Noncurrent financial assets were down by €68 million, due primarily to lower loans to affiliated companies.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/56/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Cash and cash equivalents decreased by €745 million, due primarily to money market investments being €1,104 million lower.\n\nEquity was down from €19,224 million in the previous year to €19,033 million. Net profit for 2023 of €2,786 million exceeded the dividend paid to shareholders of €2,205 million in 2023. Earnings reserves rose by €1,243 million, in particular due to the transfer of €2,000 million to earnings reserves and the issue of shares primarily for executive remuneration plans in the amount of €209 million. The decline of €966 million in earnings reserves had the opposite effect and was due to the offsetting of share buybacks. The equity ratio increased slightly from 41.1% to 41.9%. For the disclosures pursuant to Section 160(1), no. 2, of the Aktiengesetz (German Stock Corporation Act), please refer to notes 26 and 27 to the financial statements of Deutsche Post AG, as well as appendix 5, for the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nProvisions were up by €138 million in the reporting period. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations decreased by €179 million due to discounting effects from the higher overall interest rates and higher fair values of the plan assets. The change in provisions for taxes of €266 million is primarily attributable to the increase in provisions for income taxes (€262 million).\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-57-0\"></span>Image /page/57/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of a stylized font with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nLiabilities decreased by €1,315 million to €20,195 million. The liabilities arising from bonds remain unchanged. Liabilities to banks declined by €96 million. Trade payables decreased by €115 million, liabilities to investees by €62 million and other liabilities by €107 million. The decrease in liabilities to affiliated companies amounting to €935 million resulted largely from intra-Group cash management.\n\n#### Decline in cash funds\n\nDeutsche Post AG's cash funds fell by €745 million to €1,281 million in the 2023 fiscal year.\n\n#### Decrease in debt\n\nDeutsche Post AG's debt (provisions and liabilities) fell by €1,177 million to €26,200 million compared with the previous year. The decrease was due chiefly to a decrease in liabilities to affiliated companies (€935 million).\n\n#### Expected developments, opportunities and risks\n\nThe international strategy and associated performance forecast of DHL Group also reflect the expectations for Deutsche Post AG as the parent company. Since Deutsche Post AG is interconnected with the companies of DHL Group through arrangements, including financing and guarantee commitments and direct and indirect investments in its investees, Deutsche Post AG's opportunities and risks fundamentally align with those of the Group. The section titled **[expected developments, opportunities and risks](#page-93-0)** therefore also covers expected developments, opportunities and risks with respect to Deutsche Post AG as the parent company. The Post & Parcel Germany division reflects Deutsche Post AG's core business in material respects. The subsidiaries have an indirect influence on Deutsche Post AG through net investment income from profit transfer agreements. Earnings development in 2023 corresponded with the forecast from the previous year and enables the planned dividend distribution in 2024 from the net profit for 2023.\n\nIn addition to its own operations, the subsidiaries' future operating results influence the future results of Deutsche Post AG. The HGB financial statements are material to calculating the dividend. Without one-off effects from the financial result, we anticipate for the 2024 fiscal year a result for Deutsche Post AG at the level of the previous year, which should enable a dividend payment compatible with our financial strategy.\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-58-0\"></span>Image /page/58/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Any deviations from this rule are indicated accordingly. The report contents and the material topics are guided by the GRI Standards (core option) as a framework, supplemented by HGB requirements. The performance indicators used for managing the Group were determined in accordance with the HGB and German Accounting Standard 20 was applied. We illustrate the definition of the performance indicators in the **[steering metrics](#page-33-0)** chapter. The nonfinancial statement also includes information aimed at facilitating sustainable investment (EU Taxonomy). In the interest of avoiding repetition, we refer to other sections of the management report for reporting on mandatory disclosures, provided that they already are explained in greater detail there. Information regarding employees applies to all of the Group's staff; exceptions are noted as such.\n\n#### Report contents and material topics\n\nSix topics were derived from the materiality analysis for 2021 (pursuant to GRI Standards core option and HGB) that our business has a material influence on and that, conversely, can affect our business: climate and environmental protection, employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, occupational health and safety, compliance and cybersecurity. These topics also form the foundation for our ESG Roadmap. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board reviewed and confirmed the direction for the 2023 fiscal year.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/59/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. The word \"Group\" is in black and is located to the right and below the DHL part of the logo. The background is yellow.\n\n#### Sustainability anchored in strategy and remuneration\n\nFor us, sustainability and sustainable business practices are above all an opportunity that we recognize as a meaningful factor in differentiating ourselves from the competition, which is also reflected in our purpose of \"Connecting people, improving lives.\" The long-term success of our company is determined by the degree to which we meet the needs of our key stakeholder groups, minimize the environmental impact of our business, act as trustworthy business partners and increase our contributions to society.\n\nWith our **ESG Roadmap**, we have geared our climate and environmental protection activities (**e**nvironment) more toward decarbonization to minimize our environmental footprint. The strategic approaches toward social responsibility (**s**ocial) and corporate governance (**g**overnance) were more clearly defined with the objective of providing a safe and motivating working environment and ensuring transparent, legally compliant business practices throughout the Group. In this way, we also take our potential for opportunities and risks into account within the context of sustainability.\n\nImage /page/60/Picture/6 description: The image is a circular diagram outlining sustainability commitments. The central text reads \"OUR SUSTAINABILITY COMMITMENTS\" in bold, stacked text. The diagram is divided into three colored sections: green, red, and yellow. The green section, located at the top left, contains the text \"Clean operations for climate protection\" along with a leaf icon. The red section, at the top right, states \"Great company to work for all\" and includes an icon of two people. The yellow section, at the bottom, reads \"Highly trusted company\" and features a globe icon. Encircling the entire diagram is the text \"Lasting impact in communities through our Go programs\".\n\nSustainability is factored into the annual bonus of Board of Management members in the form of the three ESG performance indicators Realized Decarbonization Effects, Employee Engagement\n\nand cybersecurity rating, each of which is weighted at 10%. The details are provided in a separate statutory **remuneration report.** In the year under review, these ESG performance indicators were also included in the annual bonus calculation for executives in upper management.\n\n#### Supporting sustainability initiatives\n\nWe participate in numerous United Nations (UN) initiatives and support its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our commitment is most closely aligned with the goals of Quality Education (SDG 4), Gender Equality (SDG 5), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11), Climate Action (SDG 13) and Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17).\n\nIn addition, we take part in various **sustainability initiatives**, for example to promote the development of sustainable fuels and technologies, and are working with our transport partners on reducing fuel consumption and the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG). In addition, we are involved in committees of the EFRAG and the International Sustainability Standards Board to develop European and global reporting standards for sustainability. In the year under review, DHL Group became a member of Transparency International Germany.\n\n#### Guidelines define implementation of ESG standards throughout the Group\n\nWe conduct our business in accordance with applicable law and pursuant to our own ESG standards. DHL Group signed the UN Global Compact in 2006. The ten principles of this compact – as well as the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the principle of social partnership – are anchored in the Group through our Code of Conduct for Employees and our Human Rights Policy Statement; additional internal guidelines provide further specificity on these principles.\n\nWe provide for compliance with our ethical, social and environmental values in the supply chain by means of our Code of Conduct for Suppliers (Supplier Code of Conduct). The Supplier Code of Conduct is a binding component of the Group's relationships with our suppliers, including subcontractors. By signing, they commit to complying with our standards and implementing them in their own supply chains.\n\nOur Code of Conduct, along with the internal policy on anti-corruption and standards for business ethics derived from it, provides all employees and managers with clear rules and standards for complying with laws and regulations while contributing to the success of the Group within the scope of their jobs and responsibilities. All our employees, but in particular our managers, play a key role when it comes to implementing our values and objectives, so we have made the Code of Conduct an integral component of their employment contracts.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/61/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nThe codes of conduct and the Group guidelines are reviewed annually to ensure that they are complete and up to date.\n\n#### Steering and planning\n\nOur performance indicators, key figures and targets are completely integrated in our financial systems and reporting and planning processes, as well as in the internal control system and the opportunity and risk management process. The development of actual versus planned performance indicators is presented to the Board of Management along with financial KPIs and discussed monthly; the Employee Engagement performance indicator is determined and discussed once per year. Approaches to solutions are discussed and resolved in the event of deviations from plan; in the year under review, the focus in this regard was on managing the procurement of sustainable fuels.\n\n#### Nonfinancial risks\n\nOpportunity and risk management takes place in Group Controlling and covers sustainability-related aspects. Opportunities and risks arising from climate change are assessed using a scenario analysis according to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which also takes the provisions of the EU Taxonomy into account. This involves discussing and assessing both transitory and physical **[risks stemming from climate change](#page-64-0)** using various scenarios.\n\nIn the reporting period, the **[ESG risks](#page-99-0)** identified in the previous year in the material issues of climate change (risk categories: operational, market- and customer-specific and from regulation) and information technology were confirmed. These risks are assessed as being of medium significance for the Group.\n\n#### Organization of sustainability\n\nThe Board of Management is the central decision-maker on Group-wide sustainability focus, whereas the divisions are responsible for implementation of the measures. The progress achieved is regularly discussed by the **[Board of Management](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/board-of-management.html)**. The ESG topics are also regularly dealt with in the meetings of the Supervisory Board as well as its Strategy and Sustainability Committee and Finance and Audit Committee. The perspective of external stakeholder groups is included through the **[Sustainability Advisory Council.](https://group.dhl.com/en/sustainability/sustainability-roadmap/sustainability-advisory-council.html)**\n\n- Department Chief Executive Officer: Responsible for strategic orientation, stakeholder dialogue and implementation of the ESG programs. The ESG topics are developed further in the Group strategy and regularly reviewed by the Sustainability Steering Board. The Sustainability Steering Board comprises the CEO, the CFO and the Board member for Human Resources, as well as managers from central and divisional functions. As of January 1, 2024, responsibility for the Group-wide cybersecurity standards was shifted from the Department Global Business Services to the Department Chief Executive Officer.\n- Department Human Resources: Develops Group-wide concepts for leadership and corporate culture, for the promotion of talents and skills, specifications related to HR processes and services as well as for maintaining relationships with the employee representatives and for respecting human rights in our workforce.\n- Department Finance: Responsible for ESG reporting and controlling, opportunity and risk assessment, integration of the internal control system and the financial systems, compliance management and data protection. In the year under review, responsibility for the materiality analysis was moved from the Department Chief Executive Officer to the Department Finance.\n- Department Global Business Services: Among other topics, responsible for determining the Group-wide standards for sustainable procurement and the process for selecting suppliers, as well as the specifications for Insurance & Risk Management and Corporate Real Estate.\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-62-0\"></span>Image /page/62/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. Below the DHL part, the word \"Group\" is written in red.\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT DECISION-MAKING BODIES FOR SUSTAINABILITY\n\nImage /page/62/Figure/4 description: The image is an organizational chart showing the structure of a company's management and its focus on sustainability. At the top is the \"BOARD OF MANAGEMENT\" with the description \"Central decision-making and sustainability focus.\" Below this are three sections: \"Strategy and management,\" \"Responsibility for topics,\" and \"Reporting and controlling.\" Under \"Strategy and management\" are the \"Sustainability Advisory Council\" (described as an independent external body with experts from scientific, political, and business communities), and the \"Sustainability Steering Board\" (focused on ongoing monitoring of the sustainability agenda, chaired by the CEO, CFO, and CHRO). Under \"Responsibility for topics\" are several boards: \"Operations Board\" (climate protection and occupational safety, chaired by the CEO), \"Global Commercial Board\" (sustainable product portfolio, chaired by Express), \"HR Board\" (employee matters and human rights, chaired by the CHRO), \"Global Business Services Board\" (compliance, procurement, real estate, insurance & risk management, chaired by the CEO), and \"IT Board\" (cyber-security, data protection, and IT systems, chaired by the CEO). Under \"Reporting and controlling\" is the \"Finance Board\" (key figures, planning, opportunity and risk assessment, reporting, and materiality analysis, chaired by the CFO). To the right of the \"BOARD OF MANAGEMENT\" is the \"Supervisory Board\" (control and consultation), with sub-committees for \"Strategy and Sustainability Committee\" and \"Finance and Audit Committee.\" At the bottom, it mentions \"Divisions\" and \"Operational management of sustainability.\"\n\n1 CEO = Chief Executive Officer, Board of Management members responsible for Finance (CFO), HR (CHRO), Express.\n\n#### Focus areas in the reporting period\n\nIn June 2023, the first sustainability-linked bond was placed with an issue volume of €500 million and a term through 2033. The interest rate of the bond is linked to our medium-term target of significantly reducing GHG emissions by 2030.\n\nThe focus throughout the year was on the interpretation and application of the European Union's (EU) new requirements of sustainability reporting that have to be applied starting in the 2024 fiscal year. The materiality analysis was conceptualized and carried out in consideration of the new requirements of materiality. As part of this, the effects, risks and opportunities were evaluated during internal expert meetings and in-depth assessments were carried out. This also included a comprehensive location-based analysis of aspects related to biodiversity. The results were discussed with internal as well as external stakeholders. According to our current assessment, we classify the ESRS topics of climate protection, own workforce, workers in the value chain and business conduct, as well as cybersecurity as a company-specific topic, as material. In addition, ESG metrics, responsibilities and internal collection and reporting systems were reviewed for necessary adjustments or expansions; moreover, the additional requirements of the EU Taxonomy were implemented.\n\n#### Environment\n\n#### Climate protection in the focus of our operations\n\nThe main environmental impact of our business activities is caused by logistics-related greenhouse gases (GHG), which contribute to climate change. The EU also classifies the transport sector as energy-intensive **[\\(high climate impact sector\\)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L_202302772)**. Within the framework of our ESG Roadmap, we have defined measures and ambitious targets to minimize these effects, to realize opportunities and to avoid risks.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/63/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n**Medium-term target:** We have set ourselves a target of reducing our logistics-related GHG emissions to below 29 million metric tons of CO₂e by the year 2030. In addition to our own GHG emissions in Scope 1 and Scope 2, we also include the Scope 3 emissions from upstream transportation and distribution (category 4), fuel- and energy-related activities (category 3) and business travel (category 6) in this target.\n\nThis target was developed based on the requirements of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and supports global efforts to limit global warming in accordance with the Paris Agreement of the United Nations. The SBTi verified the following subtargets in this regard and assessed them as aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius: using 2021 as the base year, DHL Group has committed to reducing its direct net GHG emissions from the use of fuels and the indirect emissions from purchased energy (Scopes 1 and 2) by 42% by the year 2030. Logistics-related Scope 3 emissions from fuel- and energy-related activities, upstream transportation and distribution and business travel are to be reduced by 25% by 2030. The interest rate of our first sustainability-linked bond is linked to these subtargets.\n\nThe use of sustainable fuels is a significant focus of our climate protection activities. The reduction effects generated through these measures offer us the opportunity to implement climate protection directly in the transport sector and in our supply chain in a targeted manner. As part of this, fossil fuels are replaced by either the direct use of certified sustainable fuels or the documented use thereof (book and claim). This makes a positive impact on our target calculation. To calculate the market-based effects, we use the guidelines of the Voluntary Market Based Measures Framework for Logistics Emissions Accounting and Reporting published by the Smart Freight Centre.\n\n**Long-term target:** We want to reduce the GHG emissions of our logistics services to net zero by 2050. That means we will use active reduction measures to reduce these emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) down to an unavoidable minimum, which is to be fully compensated for with recognized countermeasures (excluding offsetting).\n\n#### DECARBONIZATION TARGETS\n\n**Million metric tons of CO2e** \n\nImage /page/63/Figure/9 description: The image is a bar graph showing the reduction of CO2e emissions over time. The y-axis is labeled \"Million metric tons of CO2e\". The x-axis shows the years 2021, 2023, Target 2024, 2030, Target 2030, and Target 2050. The bar for 2021 is at 40. The bar for 2023 is at 33, with a target of 39. The bar for Target 2024 is at 35. The bar for 2030 without decarbonization measures is not labeled. The bar for Target 2030 after decarbonization measures is at 29. The target for 2050 is Net 0. A box on the right side of the graph states \"-42% Scopes 1, 22\" and \"-25% Scope 33\".\n\n1 Includes the effect from the acquisition of the Hillebrand Group in the 2022 fiscal year, recognized starting in the **[2022 Annual Report.](https://www.dpdhl.com/content/dam/dpdhl/en/media-center/investors/documents/annual-reports/DPDHL-2022-Annual-Report.pdf#Page=54)**\n\n2 Market-based method.\n\n3 Includes the Scope 3 categories 4 (upstream transportation and distribution), 3 (fuel- and energy-related activities) and 6 (business travel).\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-64-0\"></span>Image /page/64/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Implementing climate objectives\n\nFor achieving our goals by 2030, we plan to **[spend up to an additional](https://group.dhl.com/en/sustainability/environment.html)** €7 billion to expand the proportion of sustainable fuels and technologies in our fleets and buildings. We round out this package of measures with a range of specifically environmentally friendly products: GoGreen Plus enables our customers to make a conscious decision for sustainable transport solutions or the use of sustainable fuels. This approach allows us to uphold our responsibility to the climate and the environment.\n\nThe central climate protection activities are developed in the Department Chief Executive Officer and Group guidelines are adapted accordingly or drafted and implemented throughout the Group. The Department Finance collects environmental data, monitors progress toward goals, assesses opportunities and risks and carries out internal and external reporting, embedded in the internal control system.\n\nOur orientation with regard to climate and environmental protection is set out in Group policies: in the Code of Conduct and the Supplier Code of Conduct, in the Environmental and Energy Policy and the internal policies for sustainable fuels and procurement processes. In the year under review, the Environmental and Energy Policy was completely revised and adapted in line with the ESG Roadmap.\n\nIn addition, together with our subcontractors, we work as part of a wide range of initiatives to develop sustainable fuels and technologies in order to reduce fuel consumption and lower GHG emissions. This also enables us to procure the consumption and emissions data necessary for subcontractor management. The Clean Cargo Initiative of the global shipping industry and our internal **[Green Carrier Certification](https://www.dhl.com/de-en/home/global-forwarding/products-and-solutions/gogreen-solutions.html)** for road freight are examples of this.\n\n#### Risks arising from climate change\n\nOpportunities and risks arising from climate change were assessed using a scenario analysis according to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This involved applying the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change including average warming of the planet by less than 2, more than 2 or more than 4 degrees Celsius through the year 2100 to assess physical risks that could result from a rise in ocean levels, for instance. For transitory risks, we used the sustainable development scenario of the International Energy Agency.\n\nTogether with the respective Board of Management members responsible for the divisions, as part of the financial and nonfinancial **[risk assessment](#page-101-0)**, we also analyzed and evaluated the possible effects of climate change on our business models, strategy and operational business as well as our mission of achieving net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Moreover, the assessment of locations with increased physical risk was confirmed.\n\nThis results mainly in transitory risks for the Group, particularly with regard to GHG emissions: operational limitations due to stricter regulation (carbon taxes and levies) as well as the lack of availability of sustainable fuels for air transport (sustainable aviation fuels) and energy from renewable sources.\n\n#### Progress in decarbonization\n\nThe management of our measures is focused on the development of net logistics-related GHG emissions (GHG emissions) and the GHG emissions avoided by the company's own decarbonization measures. Our calculation for this includes the entire process chain for generating and supplying energy for transport with the Scope 3 categories 4 (upstream transportation distribution), 3 (fueland energy-related activities) and 6 (business travel) of the GHG Protocol (well-to-wheel). The other Scope 3 categories not directly related to logistics are not taken into account as part of our medium-term target.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/65/Figure/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nThe calculation of Scope 1 GHG emissions takes the use of sustainable fuels into consideration on the basis of amounts purchased. For calculating Scope 3 emissions, we use an activity-based calculation model that also accounts for fuel amounts and reduction measures documented by transport companies. In the Scope 1 and 3 GHG emissions, reduction effects from market-based processes are also included that represent a substitution of fossil fuels – without direct physical procurement of the fuels – documented by means of certificates (book and claim).\n\nThe GHG emissions are the result of the modes of transport and are broken down as follows: 68% air, 24% land and 7% ocean (previous year: 69% air, 22% land and 8% ocean); buildings still contribute 1%. In the year under review, GHG emissions fell by 9.1% to 33.27 million metric tons of CO2e. The Scope 1 net and Scope 2 (market-based method) GHG emissions decreased by 0.8% to 8.30 million metric tons of CO2e; the net Scope 3 emissions decreased by 11.5% to 24.97 million metric tons of CO2e.\n\nThe decrease in GHG emissions is primarily influenced by the declining development of shipment volumes. Realized Decarbonization Effects from our measures of 1.3 million metric tons of CO2e (previous year: 1 million metric tons of CO2e) made a reduction contribution, meaning we achieved our target for the year under review. As part of this, the use of electricity from renewable sources, the electrification of our pickup and delivery fleet and fueling with sustainable fuels and/or the voluntary blending in the distribution networks used had an emissions-reducing effect.\n\nAn additional reduction of 128 metric kilotons of CO₂e results from the statutorily mandated blending of biofuels (previous year adjusted: 140 metric kilotons of CO2e) that is not included in our Realized Decarbonization Effects. The burning of biomass (biological material made up of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen) resulted in emissions in the amount of 787 metric kilotons of CO2e (previous year: 538 metric kilotons of CO2e) that are not attributable to Scopes 1, 2 and 3 under the GHG Protocol.

We also invest in technologies to design our own new buildings to be climate-neutral. The share of sustainable fuels is to top 30% in air and ocean freight as well as land transport by 2030. In pickups and deliveries, 60% of vehicles used are to be electric vehicles. We want to design all of our new buildings to be climate-neutral.\n\nSustainable technologies and fuels are often more expensive than conventional technologies and fossil fuels. In the year under review, the additional expenses for decarbonization measures as a result of this increased by 55.6% to €442 million. This enables a reduction of around 1.3 million metric tons of CO2e (previous year: 1 million metric tons of CO2e), including 127 metric kilotons of CO2e from market-based mechanisms. The share of sustainable fuels increased by 1.1 percentage points to 2.8% (previous year: 1.7%). In pickups and deliveries, we increased the share of e-vehicles used in the reporting period to 37.6%; the number of evehicles was around 35,200 (previous year: 27,800). We therefore made significant progress toward achieving our goal of reaching a share of 60% by 2030. At 97%, the share of electricity from renewable sources used was well above the level of the previous year (previous year: 94%).\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/67/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

We enable our customers to make a conscious decision for sustainable transport solutions or the use of sustainable fuels. We already offer sustainable alternatives for around two-thirds of our classic product range. We also launched the DHL GoGreen Dashboard, a digital reporting platform for our customers that enables them to consolidate their GHG emissions across all modes of transport, with various options for displaying and breaking down the data.\n\nAs a supplement to GoGreen Plus, we still offer our customers offsetting products to compensate for their GHG emissions. However, in accordance with the GHG Protocol and for the presentation of the Realized Decarbonization Effects, this offsetting is not taken into account as an emissions reduction for the calculation of our own GHG footprint. In the year under review, **[certificates](https://group.dhl.com/content/dam/deutschepostdhl/en/media-center/responsibility/dpdhl-group-sgs-verification-statement-gogreen-offsetting-052023.pdf)** in the amount of 1.0 million metric tons of CO2e were retired for the 2022 fiscal year.\n\n#### Divisions drive decarbonization\n\nExpress was able to conclude further delivery contracts for sustainable aircraft fuels. Moreover, the modernization of the aircraft fleet for use on intercontinental and regional routes was continued and the network of partnerships with transport subcontractors was expanded further. Furthermore, Express continued with the expansion of its fleet of e-vehicles.\n\nGlobal Forwarding, Freight concluded additional partnerships for insetting with sustainable fuels. Our Green Carrier Certification for transport partners creates transparency regarding the sustainability of our subcontractors. Around 1,000 Freight users already receive emissions reports; via myDHLi, we offer Global Forwarding users reports containing real-time data on air and ocean freight. Our customers are thus supported in achieving their own sustainability goals.\n\nSupply Chain is driving the decarbonization of its supply chains with a portfolio of state-of-the-art, sustainable products for carbonneutral storage, transport and packaging. In the year under review, a guideline for sustainable transports for relevant subsidiaries was introduced that describes the effective use of sustainable drive technologies and fuels in consideration of economic aspects. In addition, the focus was on the further expansion of carbon-neutral warehouses and sustainable transport. Some of our fueling stations in the Great Britain were converted from diesel to HVO (hydrotreated vegetable oil). In Ireland, biogas production is being expanded by partners to enable fueling trucks with sustainably produced gas.\n\neCommerce continues to focus on the expansion of the fleet of e-vehicles and the increased use of electricity from renewable sources. Delivery and pickup in the Netherlands are being made more climate-friendly through the increased use of HVO.\n\nPost & Parcel Germany continued the expansion of its fleet of e-vehicles. In addition, further measures were tested to make transport between our locations more sustainable. Using gas-powered trucks (sustainably produced compressed natural gas – CNG) for longer transport routes was identified as a solution. Moreover, the portfolio of sustainable products was expanded. The CO2e Sustainability Report offers business customers additional transparency regarding the GHG emissions caused by the transport of their national goods shipments.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/68/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Energy consumption and efficiency\n\nAir freight is the most energy-intensive mode of transport in our business model. With continuous modernization processes in our own fleet and at our locations, we can have a positive impact on our energy consumption. For this reason, we are increasingly shifting transports to our own more efficient fleet and continuing to train the pilots in the use of energy-conserving flight maneuvers.\n\nIn the year under review, Group-wide energy consumption (Scopes 1 and 2) increased to 35,056 million kWh, while the use of energy from renewable sources was increased by 35.1% compared with the previous year. The transport sector is among the most energy-intensive sectors, which is why the so-called energy intensity is calculated on the basis of **[Group revenue.](#page-38-0)** In the fiscal year, this figure amounted to 0.43 kWh per € of revenue (previous year: 0.37 kWh per € of revenue).\n\nIn the year under review, we were able to once again increase the share of electricity from renewable sources, which now comes in at 97% (previous year: 94%). Use is largely documented by means of certificates. The resulting savings in GHG emissions are reflected in the Scope 2 emissions (market-based method). In addition, we use the electricity we produce and purchase electricity from renewable sources directly via power purchase agreements.\n\n#### ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF FLEETS AND BUILDINGS (SCOPES 1 AND 2)\n\n| Million kWh                           | 2022<br>adjusted | 2023          | +/-%        |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------|---------------|-------------|\n| <b>Total energy consumption</b>       | <b>34,493</b>    | <b>35,056</b> | <b>1.6</b>  |\n| <b>From fossil sources</b>            | <b>32,226</b>    | <b>31,994</b> | <b>-0.7</b> |\n| of which air transport                | 26,648           | 26,853        | 0.8         |\n| road transport (excluding e-vehicles) | 4,237            | 3,899         | -8.0        |\n| buildings and facilities              | 1,341            | 1,242         | -7.4        |\n| <b>From renewable sources1</b>        | <b>2,267</b>     | <b>3,062</b>  | <b>35.1</b> |\n| of which air transport                | 343              | 881           | 156.9       |\n| road transport2                       | 242              | 390           | 61.2        |\n| of which e-vehicles3                  | 58               | 81            | 39.7        |\n| buildings and facilities              | 1,682            | 1,791         | 6.5         |\n\n1 Includes 41 million kWh through market-based measures for fuels.\n\n2 Includes legally required blending.\n\n3 Europe: largely regulated energy attribute certificates (EACs).

The interest rate of the bond is linked to our medium-term target of reducing Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 42% and Scope 3 GHG emissions by 25%.\n\nFor the validation process of our medium-term target by the SBTi, we had already taken into account the effect of the acquisition of Hillebrand Group on our logistics-related GHG emissions in our calculations for the 2021 base year. The acquisition was completed in the 2022 fiscal year and, since then, Hillebrand has been included in consolidation.\n\n#### CALCULATING TOTAL GHG EMISSIONS FOR THE 2021 BASE YEAR\n\n| Million metric tons of CO2e                | 2021  |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Total GHG emissions (science-based target) | 40.23 |\n| of which DHL Group1                        | 39.36 |\n| Hillebrand Group2                          | 0.87  |\n\n1 As reported in the **[2021 Annual Report.](https://group.dhl.com/content/dam/deutschepostdhl/en/media-center/investors/documents/annual-reports/DPDHL-2021-Annual-Report.pdf#Page=51)**\n\n2 Acquisition carried out in the 2022 fiscal year, recognized starting in the **[2022 Annual Report.](https://www.dpdhl.com/content/dam/dpdhl/en/media-center/investors/documents/annual-reports/DPDHL-2022-Annual-Report.pdf#Page=54)**\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/69/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The word \"Group\" is in black and is located below the right side of the DHL part of the logo. The background is yellow.\n\nLogistics-related GHG emissions are undergoing declining development, in line with expectations. This trend is primarily the result of economic developments and our decarbonization measures. In the year under review, Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions amounted to 8.30 million metric tons of CO2e, and 24.97 million metric tons of CO2e in Scope 3. This corresponds to an increase of 10.4% in Scopes 1 and 2, as well as a decrease of 23.7% in Scope 3, compared with the base year of 2021. The increase in Scope 1 emissions is due primarily to the shift of transports to our own efficient fleet, while the decrease in shipment volumes is reflected in the Scope 3 emissions. Additionally, our decarbonization measures are making an impact across all scopes.\n\n#### PROGRESS MADE COMPARED WITH THE BASE YEAR\n\nImage /page/69/Figure/5 description: The image is a bar chart showing the million metric tons of CO2e for scopes 1 and 2, and scope 3 in 2021 and 2023. For scopes 1 and 2, the million metric tons of CO2e was 7.52 in 2021 and 8.30 in 2023, which is a 10.4% increase. For scope 3, the million metric tons of CO2e was 32.71 in 2021 and 24.97 in 2023, which is a -23.7% decrease. The image also shows that until 2030, the target for scopes 1 and 2 is -42% and the target for scope 3 is -25%.\n\n1 The calculation takes the use of sustainable fuels into consideration on the basis of amounts purchased and reduction effects from market-based measures.\n\n2 Market-based method.\n\n3 Includes the Scope 3 categories 4 (upstream transportation and distribution), 3 (fuel- and energy-related activities) and 6 (business travel). Calculation is carried out on the basis of an activity-based calculation model and contains reduction effects from market-based measures.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-70-0\"></span>Image /page/70/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The background of the image is yellow.\n\n### Social\n\n#### Common DNA as a factor for success\n\nOur corporate culture makes us strong. It is underpinned by common values, convictions and behaviors and is one of the most important factors in our business success. We call it our Common **[DNA.](#page-29-0)** This culture connects us across all business units and operating regions and defines who we are and how we operate.\n\nAs early as 2006, we defined a **[Code of Conduct](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/code-of-conduct.html)** for our employees that is applicable throughout the Group. We value the diversity of our workforce and act with respect, so that we may work together cooperatively and lay the foundation for our company's financial success.\n\n#### Being an employer of choice\n\nOur employees are our most valuable asset. With more than 590,000 employees worldwide, we are one of the world's largest employers in our sector and aim to be an employer of choice.\n\nWe aim to attract competent and committed employees, continuously develop them and retain them over the long term – because only motivated employees deliver excellent service quality, meet our customers' needs satisfactorily and therefore ensure the sustainable profitability of our business activities.\n\nFor this reason, we want to strengthen and lock in their commitment at a high level. We are dedicated to the principles of diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging to create a safe work environment free of discrimination where each individual is valued and to guarantee workplaces that promote health.\n\n#### EMPLOYEE MATTERS\n\n| Material topic                 | Performance indicators1, further measures         |               | 2022   | 2023   | Target 2024 | Target 2025 |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| Employee Engagement            | Employee Engagement1, 2                           | %             | 83     | 83     | >80         | >80         |\n|                                | Continuing education                              | Million hours | 3.7    | 4.7    | –           | –           |\n| Diversity and inclusion        | Share of women in middle and upper Management1, 3 | %             | 26.3   | 27.2   | 28.8        | At least 30 |\n|                                | Employees with disabilities4                      | Headcount     | 14,274 | 14,014 | –           | –           |\n|                                | Employment rate4                                  | %             | 8.0    | 7.9    | –           | –           |\n| Occupational health and safety | LTIFR1, 3, 5                                      | Ratio         | 3.46   | 3.1    | Maximum 3.3 | <3.1        |\n|                                | Sickness rate                                     | %             | 6.3    | 5.7    | –           | –           |\n\n1 Performance indicators are steering-relevant and are assigned target values (pursuant to Sections 289b to 289e and 315b, 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB).\n\n2 Steering- and remuneration-relevant in the year under review.

We are also continuing the **[OECD Protocol](https://group.dhl.com/en/media-relations/press-releases/2022/deutsche-post-dhl-group-adopts-new-oecd-protocol.html)** from 2016, which was agreed upon with the two global trade union confederations. A wide range of topics was discussed as part of this during the year under review, for example our Human Rights Policy Statement and the different working time arrangements in our divisions.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/71/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nAt the European level, employee concerns are regularly discussed with our European works council, the DHL Forum. The Board Member for Human Resources takes part in the discussions twice per year. UNI and the ITF are also represented.\n\nIn addition, as the largest postal service provider in Europe, the Group is a member of the EU Commission's European Social Dialogue Committee for the Postal Sector and is the Committee Chair. The work of this committee involves exchange between the employers and union representatives in the postal sector of European member states on relevant topics – for example future changes in the working world and their impact on employees – in consideration of social matters.\n\n#### Our remuneration system\n\nWe foster employee loyalty and motivation by offering performance-based remuneration in line with market standards. The remuneration includes a base salary plus the agreed variable remuneration components such as bonus payments.\n\nIn many countries – including Germany, the Great Britain, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United States – we also provide employees with access to defined benefit and defined contribution **[retirement plans.](#page-181-0)** Around 70% of our employees participate in these plans.\n\nWe also use neutral job evaluations to prevent discrimination on the basis of personal characteristics. These evaluations focus on the type of job, position in the company and responsibilities assigned and rely on, in addition to formal qualifications, relevant professional experience to increase the equity of opportunities for suitable applicants. This systematic approach enables an independent and balanced remuneration structure.\n\nIn Germany, wages or salaries are generally regulated through either industry-level or company-level collective wage agreements. In many of our subsidiaries throughout Germany, our wage-scale employees also receive a performance-based bonus in addition to their monthly wage or salary. The collectively bargained principles are gender-neutral, so the use of collective agreements ensures equity in pay for women and men. Employees of Deutsche Post AG covered by the collective wage agreement may opt to take additional time off in lieu of a pay increase. A total of 19.6% of the workforce there had exercised this option as of December 31, 2023. The remuneration of employees in a non-pay-scale employment relationship (Deutsche Post AG, principal entity in Germany) is bound by existing works agreements.\n\nA resolution was reached in the reporting year on a lasting and significant **[wage increase](https://group.dhl.com/de/presse/pressemitteilungen/2023/deutsche-post-und-verdi-einigen-sich-nach-extrem-schwierigen-verhandlungen-auf-spuerbare-lohnsteigerungen-fuer-die-beschaeftigten.html)** for the approximately 160,000 employees of Deutsche Post AG subject to collective bargaining. In spite of the downward trend in profits in the German post and parcel business and the regulatory conditions in this area, significant pay raises and additional compensation for inflation will be provided to employees. The pay increase means an average raise of 11.5% over a term of two years across all income groups that takes effect starting on April 1, 2024.\n\n#### Piloted share program\n\nIn addition to managers, we want our employees to share in the long-term success of our company and, in doing so, promote their loyalty and motivation. In the reporting year, another **[share program](#page-216-0)** was therefore developed that will initially be piloted in 12 countries. We thus enable our employees participating in the program to acquire shares of Deutsche Post AG at a discount of 15% from the market price, up to an annual cap of €3,600. The shares acquired are not subject to a lockup period. Through this pilot project, the Board of Management hopes to test the interest of employees in and the administrative burden of such a program.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-72-0\"></span>Image /page/72/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The background is yellow.\n\n#### Workforce development\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed 594,396 people around the world. Added to this, an average throughout the year of 81,782 external FTEs (previous year: 83,951 FTEs) subject to the control and direction of the Group were employed at our locations.\n\n**[Staff costs](#page-159-0)** amounted to €26,977 million and thus exceeded the prior-year figure (€26,035 million). This includes the tax-free bonus payment to compensate for inflation.\n\n#### WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT\n\n|                                |           | 2022    | 2023    | +/-  |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|---------|---------|------|\n| Employees at year-end1         | Headcount | 600,278 | 594,396 | -1.0 |\n| Employees (annual average)1    | Headcount | 589,109 | 591,412 | 0.4  |\n| Share of female employees      | %         | 34.4    | 34.3    | -0.3 |\n| FTEs at year-end1              | FTE2      | 554,975 | 551,233 | -0.7 |\n| of which Express               | FTE       | 114,151 | 110,411 | -3.3 |\n| Global Forwarding, Freight     | FTE       | 48,053  | 46,026  | -4.2 |\n| Supply Chain                   | FTE       | 182,403 | 185,608 | 1.8  |\n| eCommerce                      | FTE       | 32,721  | 33,687  | 3.0  |\n| Post & Parcel Germany          | FTE       | 163,904 | 161,428 | -1.5 |\n| Group Functions3               | FTE       | 13,743  | 14,073  | 2.4  |\n| FTEs (annual average)1         | FTE       | 542,917 | 547,692 | 0.9  |\n| Share of part-time employees   | %         | 17      | 17      | -    |\n| Average age of Group employees | Years     | 40      | 41      | -    |\n| Unplanned employee turnover    | %         | 14      | 11      | -    |\n\n1 Including trainees.\n\n2 FTE = full-time equivalent.

Each year, we measure employee satisfaction and engagement by conducting a Group-wide survey. As part of the survey, all employees have the opportunity to anonymously rate the company's strategy and values as well as its working conditions. This important tool helps us determine where we are in our journey toward becoming an employer of choice. We use the analysis of the annual survey to derive the Employee Engagement KPI, which also makes up 10% of the **[annual bonus of the Board of Management.](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/remuneration.html)**\n\nIn the year under review, 77% of employees took the opportunity to express their opinion and provide feedback. This is used as the foundation for creating the best possible working conditions at our company, thus corresponding to our strategic goal of being an employer of choice. We once again exceeded the target of more than 80% with a figure of 83% (previous year: 83%) for this reporting period.\n\n#### KEY FIGURES FROM THE ANNUAL SURVEY OF EMPLOYEES\n\n| %                    | 2022 | 2023 |\n|----------------------|------|------|\n| Response rate        | 75   | 77   |\n| Employee Engagement1 | 83   | 83   |\n\n1 Steering- and remuneration-relevant in the fiscal year.

The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Motivating employees\n\nTraining and opportunities for professional development can have a positive influence on the motivation of a workforce, which is why all of our employees generally have the option of taking advantage of our training offers digitally or as part of in-person events. Our training offers convey knowledge about our Group strategy and how each employee can make an individual contribution to our success. One example is our Group-wide \"Certified\" employee motivation and development program, which aims to make our employees certified specialists in their respective areas of responsibility. It also creates an atmosphere that places our customers at the heart of our activities and ensures we provide excellent service. In addition to a certified foundation module, we offer our employees a wide range of follow-up modules customized to their specific roles and areas of expertise. In addition, we offer numerous professional development opportunities related to the topic of digitalization, including courses on the application of data science.\n\nWith leadership attributes, we give our employees a guide for how to conduct themselves respectfully and in a results-oriented manner on a daily basis when dealing with internal and external stakeholders. In addition, we encourage them to take on challenges with a positive attitude and to focus on their own strengths. We place additional emphasis on providing training for managers so that, together with their employees, they can make internal and external stakeholders successful.\n\nWe also offer qualified employees a number of personal development options, such as special training for those with potential and development ambitions, including coaching, mentoring and participation in interdisciplinary or international projects; these options are determined as part of an individual development plan together with the respective manager.\n\nIn the year under review, our employees spent a total of 4.7 million hours (previous year: 3.7 million hours) on training and professional development throughout the Group. Moreover, the Group invested time and money in qualification elements integrated in the job, such as orientation and service training, which are not included in this figure.\n\n#### Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging\n\nOur organization brings together people from cultures and cultural backgrounds from all over the world who possess a wide range of experiences, abilities and perspectives, with 179 nationalities represented at our German sites alone. The diversity of our employees is not only an asset to the company but also one of its major strengths.\n\nDiversity, inclusion and freedom from discrimination are anchored in the form of our **[Code of Conduct](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/code-of-conduct.html)** throughout the Group. We expressly reject any and all forms of discrimination. We take an equal-opportunity approach to new hirings, both internally and externally, and look exclusively to a candidate's qualifications when deciding on their suitability.\n\nThe scope of our diversity management activities includes the topics of equity and belonging, in addition to diversity and inclusion. The DEIB (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging) Board is comprised of executives in upper management from various central and divisional functions. Among other things, new concepts for employee retention were piloted during the year under review that are becoming increasingly important in the competition for skilled workers and qualified employees. Moreover, employee resource groups were established for the first time. Employees organize themselves voluntarily into these groups to promote a diverse and integrative working environment that aligns with our company purpose, our values, the business practices and our goals. Groups focusing on the topics (diversity dimensions) of physical and mental abilities as well as sexual orientation and gender identity (LGBTQ+) were founded in the year under review. During the Group-wide DEIB Week, a campaign on the topic of awareness for a sense of belonging was started, for which we received positive feedback from our employees.\n\nWith regard to LGBTQ+ matters, our company's in-house RainbowNet network provides opportunities for our employees to share their experiences. As a founding member of the PROUT AT WORK Foundation, we are committed to providing a collegial, discrimination-free workplace so that our employees can achieve their individual career goals regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-74-0\"></span>Image /page/74/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font size, also in red. The background of the image is yellow.\n\nOur focus remains on the share of women in management positions. By 2025, we aim for women to occupy at least 30% of middleand upper-management positions in the Group. The company uses various approaches and programs, such as coaching, mentoring and networking, to specifically empower female junior staff for the next step in their careers on the way to becoming middle- or upper-level executives. The share was 27.2% in the year under review (previous year: 26.3%). We therefore fell just short of our target of women occupying 27.7% of middle- and upper-management positions in the year under review.\n\nIn line with our inclusive approach, we give disabled individuals professional prospects. In Germany, employers of a certain size and above are required by law to ensure that employees with disabilities make up at least 5% of their workforce. At Deutsche Post AG, our principal entity in Germany, 14,014 persons with disabilities were employed in the reporting year (previous year: 14,274), 22 of whom were trainees; that represents 7.9% of the total workforce (previous year: 8.0%).\n\nThe average age of employees throughout the Group is 41 years old (previous year: 40 years old). In response to demographic developments, we have placed an additional focus of our employee retention measures on recruiting and retaining young talents. In doing so, we concentrate on **[positions with on-the-job training](https://careers.dhl.com/global/en/students-graduates#graduate-link)** as well as **[trainee and dual-study programs.](https://careers.dhl.com/global/en/students-graduates#graduate-link)** In Germany, we offered a total of around 1,900 spots in our postsecondary educational training and dual-study programs during the reporting year. We provide college and university graduates with the chance to choose between various postgraduate training programs.\n\n#### Occupational health and safety\n\nThe health and safety of our employees in the workplace is of central importance to us and is therefore embedded in our Codes of Conduct. We comply with the Group's existing occupational health and safety policies, statutory regulations and industry standards.\n\nIn the Group policy on occupational health and safety, we define our understanding and the importance of this topic; with our internal Safety First framework, we provide our employees with clear guidelines for implementation. Our management system complies with the international ISO 45001 standards, to which various business units of the divisions are also externally certified. Our Supplier Code of Conduct requires suppliers and subcontractors to adhere to these same high standards.\n\nAccident prevention in the workplace is the top priority of our occupational health and safety activities. Some of our biggest challenges are in our pickup and delivery operations, because external influences can only be managed to a certain extent in this area. Bad weather, roadwork, complex traffic situations and dealing with animals require employees to pay attention, concentrate and take responsibility for themselves. The most frequent causes of accidents remain slipping, tripping and falling, as well as dropped objects. Accidents are analyzed, the respective material root causes are identified and measures are introduced that facilitate the continuous improvement of safety for our employees. Solutions proven in practice to reduce or eliminate potential hazards are shared across the Group. We promote this via systematic, Group-wide exchange on potential improvements and corrective measures. To this end, an IT-supported process was implemented throughout the Group in the year under review. Measures can now be directly assessed and used in other divisions. The measures receiving the best assessments are nominated for internal awards. In addition, regular work meetings and workplace inspections are carried out at our locations and areas with greater hazard potential are identified with corresponding signage.\n\nTo measure the success of our efforts, we use the performance indicator of lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR), which we calculate based on the number of work-related accidents per 200,000 working hours resulting in an absence of at least one working day for the affected person following the day of the accident. This also includes accident-related injuries to external employees who are subject to instruction. We use the accident investigations to derive measures to eliminate the respective root causes of these accidents and to avoid reoccurrence. The lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) dropped to 3.1 in the year under review, meaning we significantly exceeded our target value of 3.5.\n\nIn the year under review, we unfortunately documented 11 fatal accidents with our own employees and one with an external employee subject to instructions. Of these 12 accidents, 11 of them were traffic accidents. We expressly regret this development. Each death is presented to and discussed in detail by the Operations Board, which is chaired by the CEO. The Operations Board is informed on an ongoing basis about the developments of work-related accident statistics.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/75/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Work can be a major source of satisfaction, and therefore also of health. At our company, a healthy workplace is somewhere that employees and managers work together to promote the well-being of everyone.\n\nWithin this context, through our Employee Benefits program, we offer our employees and their families insurance cover in the form of financial security in the event of death or disability as well as health insurance benefits. This offer depends upon provisions of labor law and the common market practices in many countries. Currently, around 280,000 employees in 100 countries are covered by this program. In particular as part of this program, incentives are provided to local management to offer health-promoting programs to employees and their families. We carry out such health projects and local initiatives to create a health-promoting work environment and raise awareness of a healthy lifestyle among our employees.\n\nThe Chief Medical Officer (CMO) advises the Board of Management in all matters regarding occupational health management – for instance the development of physical and mental diseases in the work context and concepts for how to deal with epidemic or pandemic risks.\n\nIn the reporting year, we approved and implemented the **[declaration on health and well-being](https://group.dhl.com/content/dam/deutschepostdhl/en/media-center/responsibility/dhl-group-health-and-wellbeing-policy.pdf)** throughout the Group as a supplement to the Group policy on occupational health and safety. In addition, we established the Health & Well-Being Forum, which is comprised of experts and managers from all divisions.\n\nThe Group-wide sickness rate decreased to 5.7% in the year under review (previous year: 6.3%).\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-76-0\"></span>Image /page/76/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters \"DHL\" is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n### Social responsibility\n\n#### Contributing to economic development and social progress\n\nWe contribute to the socioeconomic development of the regions in which we operate through our sites, our employees and our business partners, thereby making a contribution to social and individual prosperity. As part of our corporate citizenship initiatives, we are leveraging our global network and the expertise of local employees in line with our purpose: Connecting people, improving lives.\n\n#### Partnerships and initiatives\n\nOur initiatives enable us to use our strengths and capabilities to effect change locally and to work together to meet global challenges. We partner with established international organizations to ensure that our initiatives have the greatest impact possible. With GoHelp (disaster management), GoTeach (increasing employability), GoTrade (promoting trade) and GoGreen (environmental protection), we also support the United Nations **[Sustainable Development Goals](https://group.dhl.com/en/sustainability/sustainability-roadmap/sustainable-development-goals.html)** (SDGs) 4, 5, 8, 11, 13 and 17.\n\nWe also support employee engagement through our Global Volunteer Day, the \"DHL's Got Heart\" initiative and the Improving Lives Fund. Volunteering encourages employees to participate in local communities.\n\nBased on the Group-wide annual survey of employees, we know that corporate citizenship is a relevant factor in determining the overall level of motivation. They want to contribute to social and environmental objectives not only in their personal lives but also at work, to help society and the environment and to enhance the Group's reputation. We therefore measure the success of our initiatives using the approval rate for the survey question asking whether our employees are proud of DHL Group's contribution to society. In the year under review, 78% (previous year: 79%) of all employees responded positively.\n\n#### Employees take part in the Go programs in large numbers\n\nIn the year under review, our employees once again took part in social projects in large numbers as part of our Go programs. The focal points were on humanitarian missions following the severe earthquakes in Turkey, Syria and Morocco. Our GoHelp teams supported efforts on the ground with their logistics expertise. Our internal We Help Each Other aid fund also provided financial support for employees affected by natural disasters and war. Employee donations were matched by the Group, thus doubling our employees' contributions. In addition, we implemented minimum standards for GoTeach and strengthened the GoTrade training programs.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-77-0\"></span>Image /page/77/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters \"DHL\" is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n### Corporate governance\n\n#### Role model for responsible corporate governance\n\nWe intend to serve both as a role model for responsible corporate governance in our sector and as a trustworthy company. Ensuring our interactions with business partners, employees, the capital market and the general public are conducted with integrity and within the bounds of the law is vital to maintaining our reputation and is the basis for sustainable business success. We take steps to guarantee an honest and transparent business practice in compliance with the law by focusing on training managers in compliance-relevant content, building cybersecurity skills, shaping sustainable and stable relationships with business partners and fully integrating ESG metrics into management processes and incentive systems.\n\nThe rules for ethical conduct included in our Code of Conduct are further specified in our Human Rights Policy Statement as well as our Anti-Corruption and Business Ethics Standards Policy. Our focus at all times is on preventing potential violations of statutory requirements and internal guidelines.\n\nCorporate Internal Audit evaluates the effectiveness of our risk management system, control mechanisms, management and monitoring processes and compliance with Group policies, contributing to their improvement. It does this by performing independent regular and ad hoc audits at all Group companies and at corporate headquarters with the authority of the Board of Management. The audit teams discuss the audit findings and agree on measures for improvement with the audited organizational units and their management. The Board of Management is regularly informed of the findings. The Supervisory Board is provided with a summary once a year.\n\n#### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n| Material topic                             | Performance indicators1, further measures                           |           | 2022   | 2023    | Target 2024  |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|---------|--------------|\n| Cybersecurity                              | External rating1, 2, 3                                              | Points    | 700    | 750     | At least 690 |\n| Compliance                                 | Share of valid compliance training certificates1, 2, 4              | %         | 98.1   | 98.6    | 98           |\n| Respecting human rights                    | Internal audits by Corporate Internal Audit                         | Number    | 33     | 53      | –            |\n| In the workforce                           | Carry out on-site reviews                                           | Countries | 10     | 10      | –            |\n|                                            | Share of valid training certificates in middle and upper management | %         | 98.4   | 99.5    | –            |\n| Implement standards<br>in the supply chain | Supplier spend covered by an accepted Supplier Code of Conduct      | € billion | >27    | >35     | –            |\n|                                            | Potential high-risk suppliers assessed                              | Number    | >2,700 | > 4,000 | –            |\n\n1 Performance indicators are steering-relevant and are assigned target values (pursuant to Sections 289b to 289e and 315b 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e HGB).\n\n2 Steering-relevant in the fiscal year.\n\n3 Remuneration-relevant.\n\n4 Middle and upper management.\n\n#### Trusted business partner thanks to compliance culture\n\nWe render all of our services in compliance with current legislation as well as our corporate values as defined in our Group policies. One important aspect of compliance is the legal requirements relating to preventing corruption and bribery. We observe all applicable international anti-corruption standards and statutes and are a member of the Partnering Against Corruption initiative of the World Economic Forum.\n\nEnsuring legally compliant conduct in our business activities and in our interactions with employees is an essential task of all Group management bodies. Our compliance management system (CMS) has been implemented Group-wide. Responsibility for designing the CMS lies with the Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the CFO. This establishes uniform minimum standards to ensure compliance with applicable law, for example anti-corruption legislation, and relevant internal guidelines such as the Anti-Corruption and Business Ethics Policy (Anti-Corruption Policy). The divisional compliance officers are tasked with the implementation of the CMS within the divisions.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-78-0\"></span>Image /page/78/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in black.\n\nWith our Code of Conduct and Anti-Corruption Policy, along with training on these topics, we provide clear guidance and help employees identify situations in which the integrity of the company could be called into question.\n\nParticipation of executives in middle and upper management, as well as of employees in certain functions, in various types of relevant compliance training is mandatory. In this way, we raise our employees' awareness for potential compliance risks and enable them to mitigate such risks in an appropriate manner. The compliance training courses comprise our Core Compliance Curriculum (anti-corruption, competition compliance, Code of Conduct) and training on data protection. All employees in the target group are required to repeat the training courses every two years. We use the share of valid training certificates among executives in middle and upper management as a steering-relevant KPI.\n\nPotential violations can be reported 24/7 – if legally permitted, anonymously – via our compliance incident reporting system (whistleblower hotline). In addition, potential violations can also be reported by telephone. Third parties can also use the system to report potential violations. Reports are reviewed and investigated internally for potential violations as part of a standardized process. Key figures on compliance notifications and issues are recorded throughout the Group via the compliance reporting tool (BKMS Dashboard). Information on relevant violations is collected and included in the regular compliance reports made to the Board of Management and to the Supervisory Board's Finance and Audit Committee.\n\nThe importance and value that compliance has for the Group was once again emphasized for employees by means of a campaign – Compliance Awareness Week – which was rounded out by measures tailored to the specific divisions and regions. The campaign was accompanied by statements from the Board of Management members (\"tone from the top\") and supported by panel discussions with managers. To strengthen the internal dialogue, our workforce was made aware of and informed about compliance aspects on an ongoing basis by means of further communication measures and via the compliance channels.\n\nThe compliance training certification rate was 98.6% in middle and upper management in the year under review (previous year: 98.1%), meaning we exceeded our target of 98% in the year under review. In the context of its 219 audits, Corporate Internal Audit also reviewed compliance management system processes and the implementation of agreed-upon follow-up measures. Findings from the regular audits facilitate the identification of other compliance risks and the refinement of the compliance program.\n\n#### Respecting human rights\n\nOur commitment to respect for human rights includes adherence to the principles of the UN Global Compact and the International Labor Organization (ILO), which we have embedded in our Code of Conduct and outlined in greater detail in our Human Rights Policy Statement. These stipulate clear responsibilities and requirements for our employees and managers as well as our suppliers and subcontractors and contribute to the general understanding and implementation of the principles of the UN Global Compact.\n\nOur human rights activities focus on the prevention of child and forced labor, decent working conditions (working hours, occupational health and safety, remuneration), equal opportunities, data protection and the right to freedom of association. With the Supplier Code of Conduct, we obligate suppliers and subcontractors to comply with our ethical, social and environmental principles and implement them in their own supply chains.\n\nWith our measures for respecting human rights in the workforce and in the supply chain, we are in compliance with the requirements of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – LkSG). Implementation of the measures is monitored by the LkSG Council. The board is made up of executives in upper management from the Group functions Human Resources, Corporate Development, Corporate Public Affairs, Legal Services and Global Compliance, Corporate Procurement and Corporate Internal Audit.\n\nAs part of its audits, Corporate Internal Audit also conducted reviews relating to respect for human rights and verified that the agreed-upon follow-up measures had been implemented. In the reporting year, 53 such reviews took place.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/79/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Human rights in the workforce\n\nWith our internal management system, we ensure that our Human Rights Policy Statement is implemented among our workforce. In addition, it ensures that we adhere to due diligence requirements. Our management system is comprised of annual as well as ad hoc assessments of human rights risks, measures to raise awareness among employees and managers, annual reporting on Groupwide fulfillment of due diligence requirements and the professional compliance incident reporting system.\n\nWe carry out both an abstract and a concrete risk analysis to determine human rights risks. First, the risk is analyzed using external data (Verisk Maplecroft). Then, it is substantiated by evaluating questionnaires completed by our country organizations on the basis of their specific risk profile.\n\nTargeted on-site reviews are carried out based on the risk assessments. These reviews are conducted by specially trained and externally SMETA-certified (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit) professionals from our divisions and corporate headquarters. The countries are selected based on the results of weighting and prioritization of the identified risks, including – among other factors – the findings from the questionnaires, the number of employees, the assessments of relevant Group committees and responsible experts and recommendations from international trade union confederations. If there are violations identified at locations, these are then immediately addressed as part of a structured action plan. In the year under review, on-site reviews under the leadership of the HR department were carried out at more than 30 subsidiaries in ten countries, including in Asia, Latin America, Africa and Europe.\n\nWe encourage our employees to participate in the training courses for raising awareness for respect for human rights. Participation is mandatory, however, for executives in middle and upper management; the certification rate was 99.5% in the reporting period (previous year: 98.4%).\n\n#### Standards in the supply chain\n\nCorporate Procurement selects suppliers that meet our ethical, social and environmental standards. This selection process is based on a standardized assessment process that also takes aspects such as diversity and respect for human rights into account, as well as external criteria such as those from Transparency International (Corruption Perceptions Index) and Verisk Maplecroft. In the year under review, the supplier assessment was supplemented with additional internal measures and expanded with external audits (including in accordance with the SMETA method). In the event of findings, remedial measures are discussed and plans for corrective measures are agreed upon.\n\nProcurement employees are regularly trained to identify potential supplier-related risks early on. We convey our expectations to our suppliers and subcontractors via our **[Supplier Portal](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/supplier-portal.html)** and introduce our selection processes. Suppliers can also use our portal to familiarize themselves with our Supplier Code of Conduct, which we make available in numerous languages along with the corresponding training module. From there, they can also access our professional compliance whistleblower system that they can use to report potential violations of the Code or statutory provisions as well as cybersecurity incidents.\n\nIn the year under review, we continued developing the Group-wide risk management system for supplier assessments. We calculate the potential for risk of suppliers at the level of purchase categories (material groups). The risk assessment is influenced by 46 types of risk within eight risk domains (ESG, economic, technical, legal and political risks, as well as cybersecurity) that are evaluated for each individual purchasing category. The ultimate classification of the risk potential is based on the evaluation of the probability and the possible impact. More than 4,000 potential high-risk suppliers were assessed in the year under review (previous year: >2,700).\n\nWe use supplier spend covered by an accepted Supplier Code of Conduct to measure the successful implementation of our standards in the supply chain. We record progress regarding the key figure via the central financial systems, report to management on a monthly basis and discuss developments with the CEO and the CFO. In the year under review, supplier spend covered by an accepted Supplier Code of Conduct rose to more than €35 billion (previous year: >€27 billion).\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-80-0\"></span>Image /page/80/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Cybersecurity\n\nOur cybersecurity management activities protect the information of the Group, our business partners and our employees as well as IT systems from unauthorized access or manipulation and data misuse. In addition, this ensures uninterrupted availability and enables reliable operations. Our internal guidelines and processes are based on ISO 27002 and our data centers are certified in accordance with ISO 27001.\n\nSince January 1, 2024, the Group Chief Information Security Officer (Group CISO) has reported directly to the CEO (previous year: Corporate Board Member for Global Business Services). The IT Board determines the cybersecurity strategy and defines and manages Group-wide measures for cybersecurity, for protecting systems and data and for digitalization processes. The Information Security Committee is made up of the central functions of Group CISO, IT Audit, Human Resources, Legal Services, Data Protection and Corporate Security, as well as the divisional CISOs. The committee assesses potential threats on an ongoing basis, evaluates the potential of new risks and monitors compliance with our security standards.\n\nWe limit access to our systems and data such that employees can only access the data they need to perform their duties. All systems and data are backed up on a regular basis, and critical data are replicated across data centers. Additionally, by performing continuous software updates, we can fix potential security vulnerabilities and protect system functionality.\n\nA variety of communication measures and training sessions help our workforce become more aware of possible cybersecurity risks. All employees and managers with a corporate email address are continuously made aware of risks via phishing simulations. We also draw attention to current risks using IT crisis simulations. Participation in Information Security Awareness training is mandatory for all employees with a computer workstation. All participants who have already completed their training must update their certification every two years.\n\nOur cybersecurity undergoes independent assessment by the external rating agency BitSight. This rating is based on the technical analysis of any weak points and brings potential security risks to the attention of the rated company; this is carried out by an automated service on a daily basis. Unlike with a self-assessment, a cybersecurity rating offers greater transparency and enables comparison with other companies thanks to standardization. We compare our performance with DAX 40 companies as well as with major customers and logistics companies that are not covered by the DAX 40. The target amount is determined by the aspiration to be within the upper quarter of this comparison group.\n\nThe cybersecurity rating has been remuneration-relevant since this reporting period. This performance indicator makes up 10% of the annual bonus calculation for the Board of Management. As announced, the rating scale for the cybersecurity rating in the year under review has changed due to adjustments to the method of the rating agency. In line with the change, we adjusted our target for the 2023 fiscal year from 710 to 690 points. The rating amounted to 750 of 820 achievable points as of the end of the year under review (previous year: 700 points). The target for the year under review was thus exceeded.\n\n#### Tax strategy as a standard adhered to worldwide\n\nOur tax strategy is aligned with our Group strategy and must be adhered to throughout the Group. The overarching approach applied by the Group is that taxes are always incidental to and follow business needs.\n\nWe do not undertake aggressive tax planning or enter into artificial arrangements with the goal of avoiding taxes. Our Group maintains locations in more than 220 countries and territories, including some with lower tax rates than those in Germany. These locations are necessary for carrying out our operational business in those regions. None of our companies was established with the purpose of obtaining tax benefits or is currently used to pursue aggressive tax structuring.\n\nIn interpreting and applying tax legislation, we follow the letter of the law; in case of ambiguity, we follow the law's spirit and intended purpose. As a globally active group of companies, our activities necessarily include operations in countries where uncertainty is high. In order to mitigate this uncertainty and obtain the greatest possible degree of legal certainty, we are in continual dialogue with tax authorities and tax advisers. This allows us to meet tax compliance requirements in the countries in which we operate. Our Group risk management system incorporates a tax risk management framework that enables us to monitor tax risks and respective countermeasures.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/81/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of a stylized font with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters.

In addition, for all activities, the Group complies with required frameworks for minimum safeguards that relate to respecting human rights and social and labor standards, as well as anti-corruption fair competition and taxation.\n\nAligned activities exclusively make a substantial contribution to EU environmental objective 1. No aligned activities were identified in conjunction with EU environmental objective 2 that make a substantial contribution to risk avoidance or the reduction of the risk of adverse effects of the current and projected climate on the activity itself or on people, nature or assets without increasing the risk of adverse effects on people, nature or assets. The activities in the area of construction and real estate make no substantial contribution to EU environmental objective 4.\n\n#### SIX EU ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES\n\n- 1 Climate change mitigation\n- 2 Climate change adaptation\n- 3 Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- 4 Transition to a circular economy\n- 5 Pollution prevention and control\n- 6 Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nThe requirements of the EU Taxonomy were expanded in the year under review: new activities in the air freight sector were added to the first EU environmental objective, and further activities were added to the EU environmental objectives 3 to 6. The taxonomy eligibility was determined and reported for these new activities. In accordance with this, we primarily carry out activities in EU environmental objectives 1 and 2; with regard to EU environmental objective 4, two activities fall under the area of construction and real estate.\n\nThe Group policy for implementing the requirements of the EU Taxonomy includes the guidelines for determining the aligned shares of revenue, capex and opex. The data is collected accordingly in the Group-wide finance and controlling systems. In the year under review, the Group policy and the Group-wide finance and controlling systems were adapted with regard to the additional requirements. For the first time, we can now report the taxonomy-eligible shares of our air freight operations.\n\n#### Development of the Taxonomy KPIs\n\nThe taxonomy-eligible and -aligned shares increased compared with the previous year. The expansion of the taxonomy requirements in the area of air freight in particular played a significant role in the increase in taxonomy eligibility. The increase in taxonomy alignment results from our decarbonization measures in the pickup and delivery fleet and the improved identification of taxonomy-aligned activities.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-83-0\"></span>Image /page/83/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Now reported separately.                               |\n\nThe EU Taxonomy still does not take into account all economic activities that are relevant for our business. Revenue from operating warehouses (Supply Chain division) in particular is therefore not reported as taxonomy-eligible.\n\nCapex generated by the addition of assets can be assigned directly to individual activities, while revenue and opex can generally not be directly assigned. In these cases, we primarily use a cost-based allocation logic that reflects the business models of the divisions. We avoid double counting by assigning revenue, capex and opex to only one activity respectively and taking intra-Group relationships into account on a consolidated basis. Property, plant and equipment from business combinations were primarily allocated to the \"Construction and real estate\" and \"Transport\" sectors; intangible assets from business combinations were classified as not taxonomy-eligible.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-84-0\"></span>Image /page/84/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Compliance with regard to recyclability (DNSH 4) and emissions thresholds (DNSH 5) is a basic requirement for approval of electric vehicles in Europe, which is why we considered these to be met. In addition, the simultaneous meeting of the criteria for fuel efficiency and rolling noise of tires represents a substantial requirement of DNSH 5. For this reason, we have determined the respective vehicle- and use-specific requirements of the tires, including the load-capacity index, and identified the highest class containing some products in the EPREL2 database for each specification as well as checked the tire classification under DNSH 5 for each vehicle. |\n| 6.6 Freight transport services by road3: Heavy-duty vehicles4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Method is analogous to 6.5.

The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n## EXPECTED DEVELOPMENTS, OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS\n\n#### Forecast period\n\nThe information contained in the report on expected developments generally refers to the 2024 fiscal year.\n\n#### Future economic prospects\n\n#### Geopolitical instability restrains global economic recovery\n\nThe ongoing geopolitical dislocations will likely continue to dampen global demand and trade in 2024. The easing tensions in global energy markets seen in 2023 could persist in 2024, thus supporting the current declining trend for inflation. However, the associated increase in real purchasing power will provide only a partial offset to the prevailing unsettledness among investors and consumers. Overall, global annual average GDP growth should weaken modestly once again from 2.7% in 2023 to 2.3% in 2024.\n\nFor the most important countries and regions, S&P Global Market Intelligence predicts the following GDP growth rates in 2024: growth in China and the United States is expected to weaken to 4.7% and 1.7%, respectively, and to remain roughly steady at a very subdued 0.4% in the eurozone. The German economy should see mild GDP growth of 0.3%, reflecting a gradual strengthening of growth momentum throughout the year following the recession experienced during the second half of 2023.\n\n#### Highly cyclical international express market\n\nGrowth in the international express market, particularly in the B2B segment, is highly dependent upon the economic situation. For 2024, we still expect only moderate growth, depending on economic development.\n\n#### Freight business influenced by demand and geopolitical developments\n\nDevelopments in freight logistics are also heavily dependent upon the economic situation and are difficult to predict in light of the uncertain market situation. However, in air and ocean freight, we expect a cautious revival in terms of demand due to the economic conditions and anticipate moderate growth for 2024. In addition, for the ocean freight market especially, the speed with which the capacity bottleneck tensions ease on the Red Sea is of importance.\n\nIn light of rather moderate economic development, we also expect only restrained volume growth in the European road transport market in 2024, but we are also still faced with high prices.\n\n#### Contract logistics market continues to grow\n\nGrowth in omnichannel e-commerce as well as geopolitical challenges will continue to increase the complexity of supply chains. This, together with the apparent vulnerability of traditional supply chains and the increasing complexity of global trade relations, will increase the demand for flexible and agile solutions, further driving outsourcing. Furthermore, in the current phase of the economic cycle, many companies are reviewing their structures and cost situations, which could result in a slightly increased willingness to outsource logistics. Therefore, the market for contract logistics is likely to continue growing, yet inflation, general economic conditions and labor shortages represent both an opportunity and a threat.\n\n#### Stable growth prospects for eCommerce\n\nIt is to be expected that the share of e-commerce in total retail revenue will continue to grow. In line with the implementation of our plans for expansion, we will continue to invest in our network, efficient workflows for the last mile and infrastructure so that we remain reliable and affordable for our customers. We also see additional opportunities for growth thanks to our entry into the Turkish market as well.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-94-0\"></span>Image /page/94/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Stable trends in the relevant post and parcel markets\n\nThe German market for paper-based mail communication will decline further as digital communication increases. We will continue to adapt the Post & Parcel Germany product portfolio to reflect this development.\n\nThe German advertising market should rise slightly in 2024. However, the shift from paper-based advertising to online marketing will continue, so that the volumes in the physical advertising market – and thus for our Dialogue Marketing services – are expected to be in decline.\n\nAccording to current predictions, the rising number of goods shipments will partially compensate for significantly declining volumes of documents in international business. Intra-European and international e-commerce could once again grow significantly.\n\nWe expect development in e-commerce to stabilize and the German parcel market to grow slightly again in 2024 and are therefore expanding our parcel network and our network of Pack- and Poststations. We are also expanding our range of electronic communications services, securing our standing as a quality leader and, where possible, making our transport and delivery costs more flexible.\n\n#### Expected developments\n\n#### Result well over the pre-pandemic level, even in face of persistent economic situation\n\nThe first half of the 2024 fiscal year will foreseeably still be shaped by the lack of any broad upward trend in the economy. The comparison with the first half of the previous year, when freight rates were still extraordinarily high in some cases, could be negative. If the economic forecasts currently available prove to be largely accurate, the result in the second half of the year should come in above the level of the comparable prior-year period. With undiminished focus on cost and price management, however, we still expect Group profit to be well above the level of the pre-pandemic years, even with a continuation of weak economic development.\n\n#### Expectations for consolidated EBIT\n\nIn the 2024 fiscal year, we anticipate consolidated EBIT between €6.0 billion and €6.6 billion. The DHL divisions are projected to generate total EBIT of more than €5.7 billion. In the Post & Parcel Germany division, EBIT is forecast to come in at more than €0.8 billion. Group Functions is anticipated to contribute around €–0.45 billion to earnings.\n\n#### Dividend proposal: €1.85 per share\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose to the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on May 3, 2024, a **[dividend](#page-39-0)** of €1.85 per share for the 2023 fiscal year (previous year: €1.85).\n\n#### Group's credit rating remains the same\n\nAs of the reporting date, our credit rating was still at \"A2\" with a stable outlook according to Moody's Investor Service and was classified as \"BBB+\" with a positive outlook by Fitch Ratings. As part of our finance strategy, we still strive for a stand-alone target rating between \"Baa1\" and \"A3\" and \"BBB+\" and \"A–,\" respectively.\n\n#### Liquidity remains solid\n\nDue to the dividend payment for the 2023 fiscal year in May 2024, our liquidity is expected to decrease up to mid-year 2024. Due to the usually good business development in the second half of the year, the liquidity situation should improve again toward the end of the year.\n\n#### Investments of €3.0 billion to €3.6 billion\n\nAs in the previous year, we want to manage investments in our strategic goals and further growth in a balanced way, in line with the challenging economic environment. We plan for capital expenditure (excluding leases) to range between €3.0 billion and €3.6 billion in 2024, while focusing on the same areas as in previous years.\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-95-0\"></span>Image /page/95/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of a stylized, bold font with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the DHL part of the logo, the word \"Group\" is written in red.\n\n#### Expected EAC and free cash flow\n\nIn view of the expected EBIT development in combination with a predicted increase in the asset charge, we expect the EAC to be down slightly year over year. Free cash flow is projected at around €2.75 billion, including a €250 million overall budget for M&A expenses.\n\n#### Limiting greenhouse gas emissions\n\nThe development of GHG emissions in the 2024 fiscal year will also depend on the development of the global economy. If transport volumes undergo weaker development, we expect logistics-related GHG emissions to remain approximately at the prior-year level; if the economy proves to be more dynamic, we aim to limit GHG emissions to a maximum of 34.9 million tons of CO₂e. This includes decarbonization effects of 1.5 million tons of CO₂e. We continue to expect a significant reduction to not come until the second half of the decade.\n\n#### Continued strong employee engagement\n\nEmployee Engagement should amount to more than 80% across the Group in the 2024 fiscal year as well; this figure is expected to remain steady at least this high level through 2025.\n\n#### Increase share of female executives\n\nIn the 2024 fiscal year, 28.8% of the positions in middle and upper management should be held by women; the share of women should rise to at least 30% by 2025.\n\n#### Keep LTIFR stable\n\nThe LTIFR per 200,000 working hours should be kept at a maximum of 3.3 in the 2024 fiscal year; by 2025, this figure should be reduced to less than 3.1. Beginning in the 2024 reporting period, we will adjust the performance indicator to one million working hours, which means the target then corresponds to 16.5 and 15.5 in the year 2025.\n\n#### Conduct compliance-relevant training\n\nIn the reporting year, the share of valid training certificates among middle and upper management should remain at the high level and amount to 98%.\n\n#### External cybersecurity rating\n\nThe cybersecurity rating from BitSight should be within the upper quartile of the comparison group and amount to at least 690 points. If BitSight once again changes its rating scale, we will adjust this figure in line with the change.\n\n#### Opportunity and risk management\n\n#### Uniform reporting standard\n\nAs an internationally operating logistics company, we are facing numerous changes. Our aim is to identify the resulting opportunities and risks at an early stage and take the necessary measures in the specific areas affected in due time, to ensure that we achieve a sustained increase in enterprise value. Our Group-wide opportunity and risk management system (RMS) facilitates this aim. Each quarter, executives estimate the impact of future scenarios, evaluate opportunities and risks in their departments and present planned measures as well as those already taken. Queries are made and approvals given on a hierarchical basis to ensure that different managerial levels are involved in the process. Opportunities and risks can also be reported at any time on an ad hoc basis.\n\nWe implemented the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as well as the provisions of the EU Taxonomy also in 2023. This involves discussing and assessing both transitory and physical risks stemming from climate change using various scenarios. The material risks identified during this process are explained in \"Opportunity and risk categories.\"\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/96/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo is red and consists of the letters \"DHL\" in a stylized font, with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller, sans-serif font. The background is yellow.\n\nOur early-identification process intertwines the RMS throughout the Group into a uniform reporting standard using a proprietary IT application that is constantly updated. Furthermore, we use a Monte Carlo simulation for the purpose of aggregating opportunities and risks in standard evaluations.\n\nThe simulation is a stochastic model that takes the probability of occurrence of the underlying risks and opportunities into consideration and is based upon the law of large numbers. Randomly selected scenarios – one for each opportunity and risk – are combined on the basis of the distribution functions for each individual opportunity and risk.\n\nThe most important steps in our opportunity and risk management process are:\n\nImage /page/96/Figure/6 description: The image shows a diagram of an opportunity and risk management process. The diagram is a cycle with five stages: 1. Identify and Assess (Assess, Define measures, Analyse, Identify), 2. Aggregate and Report (Review, Supplement and change, Aggregate, Report), 3. Overall Strategy/Risk Management/Compliance (Determine, Manage), 4. Operating Measures (Plan, Implement), and 5. Control (Review results, Review measures, Monitor early warning indicators). In the center of the cycle, it says \"Corporate Audit Reviews Processes\". The cycle is color-coded to indicate the different groups involved in each stage: Divisions (yellow), Opportunity and risk-controlling processes (red), Board of Management (gray), and Corporate Audit (black).\n\n**1. Identify and assess:** Managers in all divisions and regions evaluate the opportunity and risk situation on a quarterly basis and document the actions taken. They use scenarios to assess best, expected and worst cases. The measurement period usually corresponds to the planning period, but it can also be long term or latent. Each identified risk is assigned to at least one risk owner who assesses and monitors the risk, specifies possible procedures for going forward and then files a report. The same applies to opportunities. At least one management process used to measure net risk exposure must be reported for each opportunity or risk. In isolated cases where it is not initially possible to make a quantitative assessment, risks may be assessed on a qualitative basis to ensure that the full scope of all risks is captured. The results are compiled in a database. We also conduct an annual risk workshop for each division with the Divisional Boards, as supplements to the quarterly process. Workshop discussion focuses on opportunities and risks of significance to the whole division. At the same time, newly identified opportunities and risks are subsequently integrated into the quarterly process.\n\n**2. Aggregate and report:** The controlling units collect the results, evaluate them and review them for plausibility. If individual financial effects overlap, this is noted in our database and taken into account in the compilation process. After being approved by the division risk owners, all results are passed on to the next level in the hierarchy. The last step is complete when Corporate Controlling reports to the Group Board of Management and the Supervisory Board on significant opportunities and risks as well as on the potential overall impact each division might experience. For this purpose, opportunities and risks are aggregated for the key organizational levels. We use two methods for this. In the first method, we calculate a possible spectrum of results for the divisions\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/97/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of a stylized, bold font with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. Below the DHL part of the logo, the word \"Group\" is written in a smaller, sans-serif font, also in red. The background of the logo is yellow.\n\nand combine the respective scenarios. The totals for \"worst case\" and \"best case\" indicate the total spectrum of results for the respective division. Within these extremes, the total \"expected cases\" shows current expectations. The second method makes use of a Monte Carlo simulation, the divisional results of which are regularly included in the opportunity and risk reports to the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\n\n**3. Overall strategy:** The Group Board of Management decides on the methodology that will be used to analyze and report on opportunities and risks. The reports created by Corporate Controlling provide the Board of Management with an additional, regular source of information for managing the Group as a whole. The Group Board of Management has defined the thresholds for risk tolerance and risk-bearing ability and uses the Monte Carlo simulation to review the necessity for strategic changes on a quarterly basis. The Board of Management is supported in its duties by a Risk Committee, which analyzes individual risks on a quarterly basis and reviews the results from risk reporting. The Risk Committee also regularly discusses adjustments to the opportunity and risk management process.\n\n**4. Operating measures:** The measures to be used to take advantage of opportunities and manage risks are determined within the individual organizational units. They use cost–benefit analyses to assess whether risks can be avoided, mitigated or transferred to third parties.\n\n**5. Control:** With respect to key opportunities and risks, early-warning indicators have been defined that are monitored constantly by the risk owners. Corporate Internal Audit has the task of ensuring that the Board of Management's specifications are adhered to. It also reviews the quality of the entire opportunity and risk management operation. The control units regularly analyze all parts of the process as well as the reports from Corporate Internal Audit and the independent auditor, with the goal of identifying potential for improvement and making adjustments to processes where necessary.\n\n#### Reporting and assessing opportunities and risks\n\nIn the following, we have reported mainly on those risks and opportunities that, from a current standpoint, could have a significant impact on the Group during the forecast period beyond the impact already accounted for in the business plan. In addition, we consider both long-term as well as latent opportunities and risks, with the latter unable to be assigned to a particular year or time horizon. Opportunities and risks are assessed according to their probability of occurrence and their impact. As part of this, the effects for quantitative opportunities and risks are measured by EBIT, the financial result and direct effects on equity. The assessment is used to classify opportunities and risks as either low, medium or high. Medium and high risks and opportunities are considered significant and are shown as red or yellow in the following table. The following assessment scale is used (measured on a net basis):\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/98/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### CLASSIFICATION OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nImage /page/98/Figure/4 description: The image shows a risk matrix for planned group EBIT. The matrix is divided into two sections: Risks and Opportunities. The y-axis represents the probability of occurrence in percentage, with three categories: > 50, > 15 to ≤ 50, and ≤ 15. The x-axis represents the effects in €m, with six categories: < -500, -500 to -151, -150 to 0, 0 to 150, 151 to 500, and > 500. The Risks section has cells colored red, yellow, and gray. The Opportunities section also has cells colored red, yellow, and gray. The matrix is used to assess the significance for the group.\n\nHigh Medium Low\n\nThe following assessment scale is used for qualitative risks (measured on a net basis):\n\nImage /page/98/Figure/13 description: The image is a risk assessment matrix. The y-axis is labeled \"Risks\" and has three categories: '> 50', '> 15 to ≤ 50', and '≤ 15'. The x-axis is labeled \"Effects\" and has three categories: 'High', 'Medium', and 'Low'. The matrix is a 3x3 grid. The cell at the intersection of '> 50' and 'High' is colored red. The cell at the intersection of '> 50' and 'Medium' is colored yellow. The cell at the intersection of '> 15 to ≤ 50' and 'High' is colored yellow. All other cells are colored gray. A legend at the bottom of the image indicates that red represents 'High', yellow represents 'Medium', and gray represents 'Low' significance for the group.\n\n#### ASSESSING QUALITATIVE RISKS\n\nHigh-impact risks tend to affect the entire Group, whereas medium-impact risks play out at a divisional level and low-impact risks at a local level. Qualitative risks can be assigned in terms of their impact to financial risk, reputational risk, operational risk and environmental risk.\n\nThe opportunities and risks described here are not necessarily the only ones the Group faces or is exposed to. Our business activities could also be influenced by additional factors that we are currently unaware of or that we do not yet consider to be material.\n\nOpportunities and risks are identified and assessed decentrally at DHL Group. Reporting on possible deviations from projections, as well as long-term and latent opportunities and risks, occurs primarily at the country or regional level. In view of the degree of detail provided in the internal reports, we have combined the decentrally reported opportunities and risks in categories for the purposes of this report. It should be noted that the figures provided in the underlying individual reports exhibit a significant correlation with\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-99-0\"></span>Image /page/99/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Unless otherwise specified, a low relevance is attached to the individual opportunities and risks within the respective categories. The opportunities and risks generally apply to all divisions, unless indicated otherwise.\n\n### Opportunity and risk categories\n\n#### Overview of material opportunities and risks\n\nWe identify opportunities and risks along the categories described in the following overview. In the overview, we allocated our material opportunities and risks to these categories with the corresponding significance and measurement and explained them in the following pages:\n\n#### OVERVIEW OF MATERIAL OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS ALONG OUR CATEGORIES\n\n| Category                                   | Material opportunity/material risk¹                                                                                                                              | Significance                         | Measurement                                                                  |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Corporate strategy                         | Market pressure on pricing (1)                                                                                                                                   | Medium                               | Quantitative                                                                 |\n| Legal and compliance-related               | None                                                                                                                                                             | -

Unless otherwise explicitly labeled, these are considered immaterial.\n\n#### Opportunities and risks arising from corporate strategy\n\nOver the past few years, the Group has ensured that its business activities are well positioned in the world's fastest-growing regions and markets. We are also constantly working to create efficient structures in all areas to enable us to flexibly adapt capacities and costs to demand, which is a condition for lasting, profitable business success. With respect to our strategic orientation, we are focusing on our core competencies in the logistics and letter mail businesses. Our earnings projections regularly take account of development opportunities arising from our strategic orientation.\n\nWe take action early to counter potential strategic risks. In doing so, it helps that our portfolio of customers and supplier companies is as broad as possible and that we focus on profitable sectors and products, regularly review customer and product performance, practice strict cost management and add surcharges whenever necessary.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/100/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters. There are three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. The word \"Group\" is in red and is located below the right side of the DHL letters. The background is yellow.\n\nIn the Express division, our future success depends, above all, upon general factors such as trends in the competitive environment, costs and quantities transported. In addition, market capacities could restrict our pricing leeway due to market pressure from customers and competitors, which represents a risk of medium significance for us (1). We plan to keep growing our international business and expect a further increase in shipment volumes over the medium and long term. Based upon this assumption, we are investing in our network, our services, our employees and the DHL brand.\n\nIn the Global Forwarding, Freight division, we purchase transport services for customers from airlines, shipping companies and freight carriers rather than providing them ourselves. In the best case, we are able to outsource transport services at such a low rate that we can generate a margin. In the worst-case scenario, we bear the risk of not being able to pass on all price increases to our customers. The extent of our opportunities and risks essentially depends on trends in the supply, demand and pricing of transport services as well as the duration of our contracts. Comprehensive knowledge in the area of brokering transport services helps us to capitalize on opportunities and minimize risk.\n\nIn the Supply Chain division, our success is highly dependent on our customers' business performance. Since we offer companies a widely diversified range of products in different sectors all over the world, we are able to diversify our risk portfolio and thus counteract the incumbent risks. Our future success moreover depends on our ability to continuously improve our existing business, seamlessly integrate new business and grow in our most important markets and segments.\n\nThe eCommerce division is responsible for domestic and international non-time-definite standard parcel delivery services in various countries around the globe. It predominantly serves customers in the fast-growing e-commerce sector. Our goal is to leverage our international resources and services to build a cross-border solutions platform that can be connected to the most cost-efficient networks for last-mile delivery. We want to grow profitably in all sectors and segments. To counteract the fundamental risk of rising cost pressure, we took measures with which we intend to improve network efficiency and cost flexibility. Whether e-commerce merchants invest in the establishment and operation of delivery organizations in addition to other market participants results in opportunities and risks for the eCommerce division, as well as for the parcel business in Germany. In this regard, it can be observed that this type of investing activity currently appears to be in decline among e-commerce merchants.\n\nIn the German mail and parcel business, we are responding to the challenges posed by the structural shift from a physical to a digital business and the continual decline in letter mail occurring parallel to the steady increase in volumes of parcels and merchandise mail items. We are counteracting the risk arising from changing demand by expanding our range of services. Due to the rise in e-commerce, we expect our parcel business to continue growing in the coming years and are therefore expanding our network of Pack- and Poststations. We are also expanding our range of electronic communications services, securing our standing as a quality leader and, where possible, making our transport and delivery costs more flexible. We follow developments in the market very closely and take them into account in our earnings projections.\n\nWe currently do not see any further specific corporate strategy opportunities or risks of material significance, either for the Group or individual divisions.\n\n#### Legal and compliance-related opportunities and risks\n\nLegal disputes may arise in the case of noncompliance with national or international laws and regulations as well as agreements. Examples are violations of antitrust and competition law. Investigations of any such violations may result in considerable costs, penalties and damage to our company's reputation, which could have a disadvantageous impact on the business activities of the Group.\n\nCompliance with laws, regulations and agreements is a clearly formulated obligation of all employees of the Group, and ensuring this is one of the fundamental tasks of our managers. To support our employees and managers, we have established a corporate compliance unit differentiated according to relevant topics that, on the basis of our risk management system, monitors compliance with Group-wide standards at both Group and divisional level with respect to typical compliance risks. Thus, in addition to our compliance initiative aimed at preventing fraud and fighting corruption and violations of cartel and competition law, we have introduced initiatives in all divisions intended to ensure compliance with data protection laws – for example, to ensure adherence to the provisions of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A similar, Group-wide compliance initiative\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-101-0\"></span>Image /page/101/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\naims to ensure adherence to international and national export controls and embargo regulations. Moreover, our compliance unit supports, coordinates and monitors the observance of human rights and the fundamental environmental standards in our own operations as well as in our external supply chain.\n\nAt present, we do not see any specific legal or compliance-related opportunities or risks of material significance.\n\n#### Opportunities and risks arising from capital expenditure and projects\n\nThe Group invests in maintaining and growing its network, in buildings and technical equipment, in IT solutions and in its fleet of vehicles and freight aircraft. The objective of the investment projects is to strengthen the positioning of our divisions in consideration of aspects related to economic efficiency and ESG.\n\nThe risks associated with the investments relate primarily to deviations in costs and timelines as well as to the complexity of the projects and the availability of resources. This can lead to adverse effects on the economic efficiency, continuity and quality of our services.\n\nThe aforementioned risks are monitored via ongoing project management and investment controlling so that targeted countermeasures can be taken at an early stage. The status of investment projects is documented on a regular basis and reported to the Group Board of Management and, for larger projects, to the Supervisory Board. Moreover, the Group Board of Management is informed promptly of any critical projects.\n\nWe do not currently see any specific opportunities or risks of significance in the area of investment projects.\n\n#### Operational opportunities and risks\n\nLogistics services are generally provided in bulk and require a complex operational and external infrastructure with high quality standards. Any weaknesses with regard to the tendering, sorting, transport, warehousing, customs clearance or delivery of shipments could seriously compromise our competitive position. In particular, the impairment of significant infrastructure such as central transport hubs can have negative effects. To consistently guarantee reliability and punctual delivery, processes must be organized so as to proceed smoothly with no technical or personnel-related glitches. We counteract potential operational risks, for example through efficient workflows and structures. We also take out insurance policies to guard against potential losses.\n\nMost recently, the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, as well as the global pandemic in recent years, have revealed how external factors can restrict our transport routes and means or reduce the availability of our employees, and hence potentially impair our operating performance. For information on the measures we are taking to protect our employees, please refer to the categories titled \"Human resources\" and \"Environment, catastrophes and epidemics.\"\n\nA large number of internal processes must be aligned so that we can render our services. These include – in addition to our fundamental operating processes – supporting functions such as sales and purchasing. The extent to which we succeed in aligning our internal processes to meet customer needs while simultaneously lowering costs correlates with potential positive deviations from the current projections. Our earnings projections already incorporate the expected cost savings.\n\nIncreased restrictions imposed by law to combat climate change can be expected in the coming years, including limits on air transport or access to city centers. In certain cases, this may also affect our business models. The resulting risk represents a risk of medium significance for us currently (2).\n\nAt this time, we do not see any additional specific operational opportunities or risks of material significance.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/102/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Opportunities and risks arising from human resources\n\nQualified, dedicated and motivated employees are a prerequisite for sustainable success. Demographic change and a tense labor market situation across all job types in some regions represent a challenge for recruiting workers on a local level. To address this adequately and to avoid labor shortages, we place particular emphasis on our recruiting activities. In addition, we prevent staff shortages through recruiting measures abroad, by using skilled labor migration and by hiring refugees.\n\nFor our business success and a low level of staff turnover, it is important to provide our employees with development opportunities and foster their long-term loyalty to the company. In this context, we value the professional development of our executives, with our Group-wide Leadership Attributes serving as a guide for action. Furthermore, we ensure that our employees are able to continuously improve their skills in line with their needs through on-the-job learning opportunities as well as off-the-job training courses.\n\nThe health and safety of our employees are of central importance for DHL Group. We therefore place a high value on health and occupational safety measures. With respect to occupational health, we make use of initiatives tailored to local requirements and cooperate across divisions in the management of healthcare initiatives. This is supplemented with health and exercise programs and targeted checkup offers on-site. In addition, we address risks in the area of mental health using prevention, including by means of a continuously refined system for assessing risks associated with mental stresses and as part of our Certified programs for staff development.\n\nAs a globally active company with approximately 590,000 employees (headcount as of December 31, 2023) in over 220 countries and territories, upholding human rights is a top priority for us. We account for this responsibility through our Human Rights Policy Statement. If infringements are reported, we will take appropriate measures for clarification.\n\nThe development of staff costs is a key factor for us due to the large number of employees. This factor is also being driven by the currently high levels of inflation. The current collective bargaining agreement of Deutsche Post AG is valid for 2023 and 2024. The development of staff costs is no longer a risk of material significance for us at this time.\n\nOverall, we do not currently see any personnel-related opportunities or risks of material significance.\n\n#### Opportunities and risks arising from information technology\n\nThe security of our information systems is particularly important to us. The goal is to ensure continuous IT system operation and prevent unauthorized access to our systems and databases. To this end, we have defined guidelines, standards and procedures based upon ISO 27001, the international standard for information security management. In addition, IT risks are monitored and assessed on an ongoing basis by Group Risk Management, Corporate Internal Audit, Data Protection and Corporate Security.\n\nFor our business processes to run smoothly at all times, the essential IT systems must be continuously available. We have therefore designed our systems to protect against complete system failure. Our software is monitored and updated regularly to address potential bugs, close gaps in security and increase functionality. We employ a patch management process – a defined procedure for managing software upgrades – to control risks that could arise from outdated software or from software upgrades. In this context, we use structured processes to collect and check the devices and software versions used in our IT network, the goal being to achieve the highest possible level of coverage.\n\nWe limit access to our systems and data such that employees can generally only access the data they need to perform their duties. Systems and data are backed up on a regular basis, and critical data are replicated across data centers. We make use of outsourced data centers of established providers and operate central data centers in the Czech Republic, Malaysia and the United States. Our systems are thus geographically separate and, in addition, are replicated at local disaster recovery locations.\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/103/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nTo assess risks in the area of information security, we take a uniform Group-wide approach that factors in risks from the lack of availability, manipulation, misuse, spying and infection of data and information, as well as physical damage to IT facilities. In total, these represent a latent risk of medium significance (3).\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) opens up a wide range of possibilities, but it also comes with increasing risks for the Group due to the dangers of cybercrime. In addition, complying with regulations in dealing with generative AI is a compliance topic in general.\n\nWe also take continuous action to minimize risk, such as holding regular training courses for our employees and monitoring all of our networks and IT systems globally via our Cyber Defense Center, along with regular information security incident simulations.\n\nWe currently do not see any other specific IT-related opportunities or risks of material significance.\n\n#### Financial opportunities and risks\n\nAs a global operator, we are exposed to financial opportunities and risks arising from fluctuating foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodities prices, as well as the Group's capital requirements. Changes in pension obligations also impact our business. Due to the high volatility of recent years, the influence of interest rates on our pension obligations represents both a risk as well as an opportunity of medium significance for us (4). We attempt to reduce the volatility of our financial performance due to financial risk by implementing both operational and financial management measures. Within the Group, financial instruments are used exclusively for hedging purposes and thus reduce existing risks. Detailed information on risks in relation to the Group's defined benefit retirement plans can be found in **[note 37 to the consolidated financial statements.](#page-181-0)**\n\nWith respect to currencies, opportunities and risks result from scheduled foreign-currency transactions as well as those budgeted for the future. Any significant currency risks arising from budgeted transactions are quantified as a net position over a rolling 24 month period. Highly correlated currencies are consolidated in blocks. At the Group level, the most important net surpluses are budgeted for the US dollar block as well as for the pound sterling, the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar. The Czech koruna is the only currency with a considerable net deficit. As of the reporting date, there were no significant currency hedges for scheduled foreign-currency transactions.\n\nAny general depreciation of the euro presents an opportunity as regards the Group's earnings position. The main risk to the Group's earnings position would be a general appreciation of the euro.\n\nWe currently assess the aggregate effect of all foreign currency gains and losses both as an opportunity and a risk of medium significance for the Group (5).\n\nAs a logistics group, our biggest commodity price risks result from changes in fuel prices (kerosene, diesel and marine fuels). In the DHL divisions, most of these risks are passed on to customers via operating measures (fuel surcharges).\n\nThe key control parameters for liquidity management are the centrally available liquidity reserves. The Group's liquidity is secured over the short and medium terms. Moreover, the Group enjoys open access to the capital markets on account of its solid investment-grade rating and is well positioned to ensure that long-term capital requirements are fulfilled. We therefore see no significant risk to the Group at present in the area of liquidity.\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/104/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of a stylized font with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nFurther information on the Group's financial position and finance strategy, as well as on the management of financial risks, can be found in the Report on economic position and in **[note 43 to the consolidated financial statements.](#page-195-0)**\n\nRisks may also arise from our accounting, controlling, budgetary and financial processes. We monitor those processes continuously to prevent such risks from materializing.\n\nWe do not currently see any other significant financial opportunities or risks.\n\n#### Tax-related opportunities and risks\n\nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a variety of tax regimes. Opportunities and risks arise from the introduction of new types of taxes, legislative changes and judicial rulings. As such, opportunities and risks could arise from the different interpretation of complex tax regulations, for instance.\n\nWe mitigate this risk through continual dialog with taxation authorities and tax advisers to obtain the greatest possible degree of legal certainty. This allows us to meet tax compliance requirements in the countries in which we operate to the best of our knowledge and belief. Our Group risk management system incorporates a tax risk management framework that enables us to monitor and avoid tax risk as far as possible.\n\nCurrently, we have not identified any significant taxrelated opportunities or risks.\n\n#### Opportunities and risks related to real estate transactions\n\nDHL Group is one of the world's largest corporate users of industrial properties. A large portion of the Group's industrial real estate portfolio consists of leased properties. Ownership solutions have additionally been implemented for a number of especially strategic properties. Our business may be impacted by opportunities and risks arising from the lease, purchase, sale, construction or use of real estate. A global team of real estate professionals manages the Group portfolio and ensures that any opportunities or risks are identified at an early stage and a suitable response is selected.\n\nWe negotiate suitable solutions early with our lessors, analyze real estate markets and identify suitable properties for expanding or optimizing the current portfolio based on our divisions' business strategies and operational location planning. The main objective is to secure the availability of properties needed for our core business.\n\nWe do not currently see any specific opportunities or risks of significance in the area of real estate.\n\n#### Market- and customer-specific opportunities and risks\n\nMacroeconomic and sector-specific conditions are a key factor in determining the success of our business. In addition to the development of the global economy, growth in the logistics market and its interaction with our stakeholders – our customers, suppliers and competitors – is of particular importance in this regard. Changes in demand present both opportunities and risks.\n\nAs a provider of choice, our business is based on our customers' needs. Our customers are likewise exposed to macroeconomic trends that impact growth in their respective sectors. We monitor market developments on an ongoing basis and review the potential financial effects of relationships with business partners and suppliers at regular intervals, to enable us to avert any risk that could arise from potential insolvencies, for example, at an early stage. Our Customer Solutions & Innovation unit uses a risk dashboard for this purpose. Due to the current economic situation, potential customer bankruptcies represent a risk of medium significance (6).\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/105/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nGlobal trade weakened significantly due to economic developments, geopolitical crises such as the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis and the corresponding high levels of inflation and increased interest rates. In addition, the easing of the market capacities for transport services that were heavily used in previous years is leading to a normalization of freight rates. We expect moderate business performance in 2024. In spite of the continued expectation of weaker global economic growth, we will see opportunities for growth, for instance through structural growth in e-commerce. The general trend of businesses outsourcing processes continues as well. In addition, our DHL divisions are benefitting from rising demand for complex and integrated logistics solutions thanks to our position as the global market leader.\n\nOur strong position in all the regions in which we operate allows us to compensate, at least partially, for declines in certain trade lanes, often based on growth in others. Cyclical risks can affect our divisions differently depending on their magnitude and point in time, which could mitigate the total effect. Moreover, we have taken measures in recent years to make costs more flexible and to allow us to respond quickly to changes in market demand. However, an additional weakening of global economic growth represents a risk of medium significance (7).\n\nDeutsche Post and DHL are in competition with already-established companies, as well as new entrants to the market. Such competition can significantly impact our customer base as well as the levels of prices and margins in our markets. In the logistics and letter mail business, the key factors for success are quality, confidence and competitive prices. Thanks to the high quality we offer, along with the cost savings we have generated in recent years, we believe that we will be able to remain competitive and keep any negative effects at a low level.\n\nAs a logistics concern, we are additionally exposed to the effects of fluctuations in market prices on Group profit. Despite the recent decline in inflation, this still represents a risk of medium significance (8).\n\nThe availability of renewable energy is of central importance for us to achieve our sustainability goals. In line with our ESG Roadmap, we aim to have more than 30% of the total fuel we use for air freight come from sustainable sources (sustainable aviation fuel – SAF) by 2030. The current availability and planned projects do not yet appear to be sufficient to meet the demand for sustainable aviation fuels. The possibility that the market supply of renewable energy and SAF may not be sufficient therefore represents a risk of medium significance (9).\n\nIn addition, no significant opportunities or risks are seen at present in this risk category.\n\n#### Opportunities and risks arising from political, regulatory or legal conditions\n\nOur business is fundamentally intertwined with the political and legal environments in which we operate. The stability and security of international transport routes represent the first line in this framework, and they could be critically disrupted by events ranging from geopolitical developments to military conflicts such as the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East. A number of the indirect effects of these geopolitical crises, such as the development of the global economy and inflation, have been taken into account for the corresponding risks. The remaining direct effects in the countries and regions affected currently represent a risk of low significance.\n\nIn addition, the international transport of goods is subject to the import, export and transit regulations of more than 220 countries and territories as well as their applicable foreign trade laws. In recent years, not only the number but also the complexity of such laws and regulations has increased significantly (including their extraterritorial application). Violations are also being pursued more aggressively by the competent authorities, with stricter penalties imposed. We have implemented, on the one hand, ongoing monitoring of the regulatory and legislative developments in the markets most relevant for us and, on the other, a Group-wide compliance program in response to this development. This comprises the legally prescribed checking of all senders, recipients, suppliers and employees against current embargo lists. In addition, this includes in particular the legally required review of shipments for the purpose of enforcing applicable export restrictions as well as country sanctions and embargoes. DHL Group also cooperates with the responsible authorities, both in working to prevent violations as well as in assisting in the investigation of any infringements in order to avoid or limit potential sanctions.\n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/106/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters. There are three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. The word \"Group\" is in red and is located below the right side of the DHL letters. The background is yellow.\n\nA number of risks arise primarily from the fact that the Group provides some of its services in regulated markets. Many of the postal services rendered by Deutsche Post AG and its subsidiaries (particularly the Post & Parcel Germany division) are subject to the German Postal Act, postal regulations and sector-specific regulation by the German federal network agency (*Bundesnetzagentur*), in addition to the general legal provisions. The German federal network agency approves or reviews prices, formulates the terms of downstream access, has special supervisory powers – in addition to the Federal Cartel Office – to combat market abuse and guarantees the provision of universal postal services. This general regulatory risk could lead to a decline in revenue and earnings in the event of negative decisions.\n\nThe German federal government had agreed in the coalition agreement that the Postal Act (*Postgesetz*) would again be amended. The described aim was to further enhance social and environmental standards and strengthen fair competition. The German federal cabinet passed a draft law to modernize the Postal Act on December 20, 2023. The draft will now go through the ordinary legislative process in the Bundestag and Bundesrat. The amended Postal Act is expected to enter into effect in the course of 2024.\n\nDepending upon the structure of this new regulatory framework and its application by the German federal network agency, along with its interpretation by the responsible courts, opportunities and risks may arise for the company's regulated areas.\n\nRevenue and earnings risk can arise, in particular, from the price cap procedure used to determine the rates for letter mail. Approval of the rates for the period from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2024, was issued by the German federal network agency on April 29, 2022. The German federal network agency would have to issue the approval of the rates applicable from 2025 onward in 2024 on the basis of the version of the German Postal Act applicable at the time.\n\nAn association from the CEP sector and customers have filed an action with the Cologne Administrative Court against the price cap approval of the German federal network agency for the years 2022 to 2024. The proceedings are still pending. The same CEP association, as well as postal service providers and other customers, had previously filed an action with the Cologne Administrative Court against the pricing approvals granted as part of the price cap procedure for the years 2016 to 2018 and 2019 to 2021. In a ruling issued on August 17, 2022, the Cologne Administrative Court overturned the approval for the years 2019 to 2021 in relation to the association as well as the postal service providers as a result of a ruling of the German Federal Administrative Court from May 27, 2020, due to a formal legal error in the context of the underlying legal ordinance. This formal legal error was rectified by the German government through an amendment to the German Postal Act that took effect in March 2021. The Cologne Administrative Court denied the claims of two customers because they had expired. The Cologne Administrative Court has not yet reached a decision on the other mentioned claims against the price cap approvals. The association's additional application to be granted a new approval for the years 2019 to 2021 was denied by the Cologne Administrative Court. The association has filed an appeal to this ruling with the Federal Administrative Court, as have the two customers who were completely unsuccessful in their claims with the Cologne Administrative Court; the appeals with the German Federal Administrative Court are still pending.\n\nThe rulings of the Cologne Administrative Court from August 17, 2022, are only applicable to the legal relationships with the respective plaintiffs and have no legal impact vis-à-vis other consumers.\n\nOne postal service provider, which had filed an action against the pricing approval for the years 2019 to 2021 with the Cologne Administrative Court, also filed an additional civil suit for repayment of allegedly excessive conveyance fees for standard letters delivered in 2017. The action is based primarily on the claim that Deutsche Post charged postage whose approval is unlawful pursuant to the ruling of the German Federal Administrative Court from May 27, 2020. The action was denied by the Cologne District Court in a ruling from June 17, 2021. The cartel court of the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court denied the appeal of this ruling on April 6, 2022, and did not permit any further appeals of the ruling. On May 2, 2022, the plaintiff submitted an appeal against nonpermission with Germany's Federal Court of Justice to have its appeal allowed.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/107/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font size, also in red. The background of the logo is yellow.\n\nIt cannot currently be ruled out that the effects on existing pricing approvals, or on future price cap procedures, of the court's decisions or the actions currently pending could be negative for Deutsche Post.\n\nEspecially the regulations from the Postal Act, which are currently undergoing revision, are of particular importance for us. If the regulations on terms and pricing and the clarification that so-called partial services are also a universal service proposed by the cabinet resolution dated December 20, 2023, are changed again, if it is not possible to withdraw from the provision of the universal postal service, or if the new law is not passed in a timely manner, this will come with a number of risks for our Group, including the possibility of significant impairment losses. Due to the low probability of occurrence, we currently assess this risk as medium (10) overall.\n\nOne opportunity largely taken into account in our guidance results from the tax handling of so-called partial service shipments in accordance with European legislation. If the first-instance ruling of the Cologne Finance Court on the VAT liability of partial services is confirmed by the German Federal Fiscal Court, this transport service will have to be offered without VAT. The aforementioned draft of a new Postal Act is also congruent with the European legal situation and clarifies that partial service shipments are a part of the universal postal service and thus have to be offered without VAT in the future.\n\nWe also describe significant legal proceedings in **[note 45 to the consolidated financial statements.](#page-213-0)**\n\nThe fight against climate change can result in increased regulatory and legal changes in the coming years. An increase in, or stepped up introduction of, carbon taxes and levies, certification regulations and other direct costs in conjunction with CO₂ emissions (11) represents a risk of medium importance for us, as do increased restrictions on GHG emissions (12). We have implemented ongoing monitoring of the regulatory and legislative developments in the markets most relevant for us in response to this risk, but above all we constantly work to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and have also set ourselves verified targets from the Science Based Targets Initiative to this end.\n\nWe have not identified any other significant opportunities or risks associated with the political, regulatory or statutory environment.\n\n#### Opportunities and risks arising from the environment, catastrophes and epidemics\n\nOur business operations can be impacted by natural disasters, epidemics and ecological factors, also including physical risks caused by climate change such as floods and storms.\n\nThe year 2023 was no longer significantly impacted by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, our focus at all times was, and remains, on safeguarding the health of our employees. We continue to regularly review the consequences of potential more virulent variants and their possible impact on our business activities, so that we are able to counter the respective current situation with corresponding measures.\n\nOverall, we do not currently see any specific opportunities or risks of material significance in this area.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-108-0\"></span>Image /page/108/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters \"DHL\" is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n### Internal control system\n\n#### Structure of the internal control system (ICS)\n\nOur internal control system (ICS) was designed to follow the internationally recognized COSO framework for internal control systems (COSO: Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) and is continuously updated and improved.\n\nA Group-wide guideline sets out the main principles and objectives of the ICS and specifies the structure of the ICS and the underlying role concept for the self-assessment.\n\nThe scope of the control objectives to be covered by the ICS is derived from a detailed risk analysis. Based on the risks identified and control objectives, minimum requirements are defined that must be covered through the implementation of suitable controls in the control frameworks of the divisions.\n\nOur ICS generally comprises all companies. The scope of the activities to be carried out by each entity differs and depends on, among other things, the materiality of the entity for the consolidated financial statements and the specific risks that are associated with the entity. All companies are analyzed on the basis of quantitative and qualitative aspects and categorized into companies material to the ICS in consideration of relevant financial figures and functional KPIs.\n\n#### Internal control system in the functions\n\nDisclosures unrelated to the management report (unaudited), **[preliminary remarks.](#page-17-0)**\n\nThe ICS of DHL Group takes the Finance, Human Resources (HR), Compliance, IT and Operations into account as part of the functional design of the Group-wide risk landscape.\n\nThe Group-wide risk landscape is supplemented for the respective function as part of an extended risk analysis and regularly reviewed, also including the consideration of sustainability-related targets within the ESG Roadmap. Risks and controls in this regard are identified and assigned to the respective functions and covered by the control frameworks of the divisions. Selfassessments are carried out in all functions, documented and prepared in a central reporting tool.\n\nThe goal of taking all functions of the Group into account is to ensure compliance with applicable standards and internal Group regulations as well as divisional and local provisions in all business transactions and the core processes.\n\nThe compliance management system (CMS) is a major component of the monitoring system of DHL Group. The CMS was established with the goal of creating rules, standards and processes for conduct compliant with laws and guidelines as well as measurable self-commitments. Therefore, it serves to protect DHL Group from financial risks and damage to its reputation, to minimize personal liability risks of governing bodies, managers and other employees, and to avoid competitive disadvantages.\n\nThe CMS is organized according to divisions. The Compliance Committee acts as a joint decision-making body chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer. The Compliance Committee facilitates the exchange of information on developments in compliance management in the individual divisions, coordinates fundamental strategic questions related to the CMS and ensures consistent implementation in the divisions.\n\nCompliance management at DHL Group is based on a values-oriented Code of Conduct that sets out a uniform Group-wide commitment to ethical, responsible and legally compliant conduct in business. Our managers act as role models and should set a good example to promote compliance. DHL Group uses targeted communication and regular training sessions to help its employees and business partners understand and adhere to the compliance guidelines and regulations.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/109/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font, also in red. The background of the image is yellow.\n\nAt DHL Group, compliance risks are identified and assessed on a regular basis and systematically across all divisions. The identified risks are assessed and analyzed according to qualitative criteria and, if necessary, supplemented by further risk minimization measures.\n\nOur compliance program comprises the preventive elements of guidelines, training sessions and business partner reviews. In addition, detective elements such as violation reporting and case processing management contribute to ensuring the business integrity of DHL Group.\n\n#### Accounting-related internal control system\n\nThe accounting-related ICS is an integral part of the accounting and financial reporting process of the companies included in the Group. The accounting-related ICS aims to ensure the compliance of (Group) accounting and financial reporting with generally accepted principles. Specifically, it is intended to ensure that all transactions are recorded promptly, accurately and in a uniform manner on the basis of the applicable norms, accounting standards and internal Group regulations. Accounting errors are to be avoided in principle, and material misrepresentations and errors detected promptly.\n\nWithin the framework of the ICS, we take organizational and process-related measures that involve all companies in the Group. Centrally standardized accounting guidelines govern the reconciliation of the single-entity financial statements and support uniform accounting pursuant to EU IFRSs throughout the Group. In addition, German generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) have been established for Deutsche Post AG and the other Group companies subject to HGB reporting requirements. A standard chart of accounts is required to be applied by all Group companies. We immediately assess new developments in international accounting for relevance and announce their implementation in a timely manner, for example in newsletters. Often, accounting processes are pooled in a shared service center in order to centralize and standardize them. The IFRS financial statements of the individual Group companies are recorded in a standard, SAP-based system and then processed at a central location where one-step consolidation is performed. Other quality assurance components include automatic plausibility reviews and system validations of the accounting data. In addition, regular, manual checks are carried out centrally at the Corporate Center by Corporate Accounting & Controlling, Taxes and Corporate Finance. If necessary, we call in outside professionals with the requisite expertise. Finally, the Group's standardized process of preparing financial statements by using a centrally administered financial statements calendar supports a structured and efficient accounting process.\n\nThe companies have implemented preventive and detective control mechanisms to address risks of material misrepresentation in reporting and covered division-specific as well as local requirements. To maintain the system's effectiveness and implement continuous improvements, the ICS is subjected to regular reviews. To this end, self-assessments are carried out using the dualcontrol principle and documented in a central IT application. If a self-assessment results in the finding of inadequate control implementation, an action plan must be created, and the successful execution thereof must be confirmed by the person responsible for the process.\n\nThe results of the self-assessments are documented in a central reporting tool. The Supervisory Board, Board of Management and the functional bodies are regularly informed of the findings. In addition, this information is analyzed with regard to potential improvements.\n\n#### Regular monitoring by Corporate Internal Audit\n\nOver and above the ICS and risk management, Corporate Internal Audit is an essential component of the Group's control and monitoring system. Using risk-based auditing procedures, Corporate Internal Audit regularly examines the processes related to financial reporting and reports its results to the Board of Management.\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-110-0\"></span>Image /page/110/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of a stylized, bold font with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. Below the DHL part, the word \"Group\" is written in a smaller, red font. The background is yellow.\n\n#### Statement on the appropriateness and effectiveness of the RMS and ICS\n\nDisclosures unrelated to the management report (unaudited), **[preliminary remarks.](#page-17-0)**\n\nBased on the regular reporting on the RMS and ICS, the analysis of the underlying results of the self-assessments and the appraisal of the reports from the internal audit department, the Board of Management is not aware of any circumstances that would cause it to believe that the design of the risk management system and the internal control system in its entirety is not appropriate and effective for the risk situation of DHL Group.\n\nIt should, however, always be taken into consideration that no ICS, regardless of how well designed, can offer absolute certainty that all material accounting misstatements will be avoided or detected.\n\n#### Overall assessment of the Board of Management\n\nIn the 2024 fiscal year, we anticipate consolidated EBIT between €6.0 billion and €6.6 billion. The DHL divisions are projected to generate total EBIT of more than €5.7. In the Post & Parcel Germany division, EBIT is forecast to come in at more than €0.8 billion. Group Functions is anticipated to contribute around €–0.45 billion to earnings. In view of the expected EBIT development in combination with a predicted increase in the asset charge, we expect the EAC to be down slightly year over year. Free cash flow is projected at around €2.75 billion, including a €250 million overall budget for M&A expenses.\n\nThe current business planning has not identified any significant changes in the Group's overall opportunity and risk situation compared with last year's risk report. No new risks with a potentially critical impact upon the Group's result have been identified according to current assessments. Based upon the Group's early-warning system and in the estimation of its Board of Management, there were no identifiable risks for the Group in the current forecast period that, individually or collectively, cast doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. Nor are any such risks apparent in the foreseeable future. The stable to positive outlook projected for the Group is moreover reflected in our **[credit rating.](#page-48-0)**\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-111-0\"></span>Image /page/111/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters \"DHL\" is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n## GOVERNANCE\n\n### Annual Corporate Governance Statement\n\npursuant to Sections 289f and 315d HGB with respect to Deutsche Post AG and DHL Group.\n\n#### Declaration of Conformity with the German Corporate Governance Code\n\nDeutsche Post AG complied with the suggestions and recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code in the year under review. The Board of Management and Supervisory Board intend to comply with all suggestions and recommendations in the future as well. In December 2023, they issued the following Declaration of Conformity:\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Post AG declare that, since the issue of the Declaration of Conformity in December 2022, all recommendations of the Government Commission German Corporate Governance Code, as amended on April 28, 2022, and published in the *Bundesanzeiger* (Federal Gazette) on June 27, 2022, have been complied with, and that all recommendations are to be complied with going forward.\n\nYou can view the current Declaration of Conformity and the Annual Corporate Governance Statement along with the Declarations of Conformity for the past five years on the **[company's website.](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/declarations-reports.html)**\n\n#### Corporate governance principles and shared values\n\nOur business relationships and activities are based upon responsible business practices that comply with applicable laws, international guidelines and ethical standards, and this also forms part of the Group's strategy. Equally, we require our suppliers to act in this way. We encourage relationships with our employees, customers and other stakeholders, as well as the shareholders, whose decisions to select DHL Group as an employer, supplier or investment are increasingly also based upon the requirement that we apply good corporate governance criteria.\n\nWith the **[Code of Conduct,](https://group.dhl.com/content/dam/deutschepostdhl/en/media-center/responsibility/dhl-group-code-of-conduct-en.pdf)** we have laid out the requirements of the conduct of our employees. It is applicable across all divisions and regions. In the Code of Conduct, we commit ourselves in particular to the principles set out in the United Nations (UN) Global Compact, comply with the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and follow additional recognized legal standards, including the applicable anti-corruption legislation and agreements. In addition, we take the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises into account. In addition, we support various sustainability initiatives, for example to promote the development of sustainable fuels and technologies, and are working with transport partners on reducing fuel consumption and the emission of greenhouse gases. As a long-standing partner of the United Nations, we support the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In 2023, DHL Group became a member of Transparency International Germany.\n\nThe Code of Conduct also describes our understanding of diversity and inclusion. This understanding and mutual respect promote cooperation within the Group and thus contribute to economic success. The criteria for the recruitment and professional development of our employees are exclusively their skills and qualifications. The members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board support the diversity measures, with a particular focus on the Group's goal of increasing the number of women in management. Doing business includes using our expertise as a service provider in the mail services and logistics sector for the benefit of society and the environment, and we motivate our employees to engage personally in this regard.\n\nEnsuring that our interactions with business partners, shareholders and the public are conducted with integrity and within the bounds of the law is vital to maintaining our reputation. This is also the foundation of DHL Group's lasting business success. Our compliance management system (CMS) is designed to promote legally compliant conduct as well as to prevent corruption and anticompetitive conduct in particular. Insights gained from compliance audits and reported violations are also used to continually improve and upgrade the CMS system. To this end, the enhanced compliance reporting tool (BKMS Dashboard) offers Group-wide,\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/112/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\ncentralized and systematic collection of all key figures related to compliance notifications and the clarification of issues. In addition, further measures were taken to promote the culture of compliance and compliance reporting was established.\n\n#### Cooperation between the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, remuneration, retirement ages\n\nAs a listed German public limited company, Deutsche Post AG has a two-tier board structure comprising the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management are responsible for the management of the company. They manage their Board departments independently, except where decisions of particular significance and consequence for the company or the Group require a resolution by all members of the Board of Management. Each member of the Board of Management is obligated to subordinate the interests of their individual Board departments to the collective interests of the company and to inform the Board of Management about significant developments in their departments. The Board of Management ensures compliance with statutory provisions and internal guidelines within the company (compliance). The internal control system and the risk management system comprise a CMS aligned with the risk situation of the company and also include targets related to sustainability.\n\nThe CEO conducts Board of Management business, aligns Board department activities with the company's collective goals and plans, and ensures that corporate policy is carried out. When making decisions, members of the Board of Management may not act in their own personal interest or exploit corporate business opportunities for their own benefit. Any conflicts of interest must be disclosed to the chairs of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management without delay; the other Board of Management members must also be informed. The Supervisory Board has determined that appointments to the Board of Management should generally end by the time the member turns 65.\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board appoint, advise and oversee the Board of Management. They propose the remuneration system for Board of Management members to the Annual General Meeting, and – together with the Board of Management – are jointly responsible for the long-term succession planning for the Board of Management. Furthermore, the statutory obligations of the Supervisory Board include the review and approval of the annual and consolidated financial statements, the review of the proposal for the appropriation of the net retained profit and the recommendation of the auditor to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nFor proposals for the election of Supervisory Board members, the Supervisory Board will ensure that their term of office ends no later than the close of the next Annual General Meeting to be held after the Supervisory Board member turns 72. As a general rule, Supervisory Board members should not serve more than three terms of office.\n\nThe company's D & O (directors and officers) insurance for the members of the Board of Management provides for a deductible as set out in the AktG.\n\nThe principles governing the Supervisory Board's internal organization, a catalog of Board of Management transactions requiring approval and the work of the Supervisory Board committees are governed by the rules of procedure, which are available on the **[company's website.](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/supervisory-board.html)** The Chair, elected by the members of the Supervisory Board from their ranks, coordinates the work of the Supervisory Board and represents the Supervisory Board publicly. The Chair holds talks with investors on topics relevant to the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board represents the company in respect of the Board of Management members. Members of the Supervisory Board receive a fixed annual remuneration of €100,000. The remuneration for each of the chairs (plenary and committees) increases by 100%, for the Deputy Chair of the Supervisory Board and for committee members by 50%. This does not apply to the Mediation or Nomination Committees. The report on remuneration of Board of Management and Supervisory Board members can be accessed along with the auditor's report pursuant to Section 162(3) AktG on the **[company's website.](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/remuneration.html)** There are no contracts between the company and Supervisory Board members, with the exception of the employment contracts with the employee representatives.\n\nThe Supervisory Board meets at least twice each half year, regularly also without the Board of Management present. Extraordinary meetings are held as required. In the 2023 fiscal year, Supervisory Board members held four plenary meetings, 21 committee meetings and one closed meeting. The meetings took place in person, with a few exceptions for the committee meetings. Individual\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/113/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

In cases where individual members were unable to participate, they submitted their votes in writing in advance of the meeting and thus ensured that the decisions made were based on the decisions of all responsible members. The overall attendance rate of 95% is broken down by member in the **[report of the Supervisory Board.](#page-11-0)**\n\nSupervisory Board decisions are prepared in advance in separate meetings of the shareholder representatives and the employee representatives, and by the relevant committees. During the plenary meetings, the committee chairs inform the other members about the work and decisions of the committees. Supervisory Board members are personally responsible for ensuring they receive training and professional development measures. They receive appropriate support from the company in the process. In 2023, the Directors' Days took place in May and September. The topics covered included the regulation of the postal market, ESG key performance indicators as a basis for corporate governance and Board of Management remuneration, as well as updates on supply chain legislation, Corporate Sustainability Reporting and the EU Taxonomy.\n\n#### Succession planning for the Board of Management\n\nTogether with the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board is jointly responsible for the long-term succession planning for the Board of Management. To this end, in particular the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the Chief Executive Officer regularly discuss candidates with the potential to take on positions on the Board of Management. Within the Supervisory Board, the search for suitable Board of Management members is primarily the responsibility of the Executive Committee. In the event of an upcoming vacancy, the Executive Committee selects suitable candidates for personal interviews, taking into account specific requirements for experience and qualifications to be met by the members and the composition of the Board of Management as a whole and, after discussing this list of candidates, submits it to the Supervisory Board.\n\nIndependent of specific upcoming vacancies, potential successors from within the Group are given the opportunity to give a presentation on topics from their own areas of responsibility before the Supervisory Board. In this way, the Supervisory Board maintains an overview of the potential of Group executives who could be considered for a position on the Board of Management. When appointing new members to the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board ensures that the different skills and experiences of the members supplement the Board of Management and that its membership is thus diverse. International experience is of particular importance, in addition to industry experience. The initial term of service for members of the Board of Management generally runs for three years.\n\n#### Independence of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board\n\nAll Supervisory Board members are independent within the meaning of the German Corporate Governance Code. This exceeds the target for the Supervisory Board of filling at least 60% of mandates on the shareholder side with independent members.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the largest shareholder in the company, KfW Bankengruppe, holds 20.49% of the shares in Deutsche Post AG and therefore does not exercise control, nor does the German federal government, which is an indirect shareholder via the KfW. Accordingly, Luise Hölscher and Stefan B. Wintels are also independent. On February 7, 2024, KfW Bankengruppe reduced its shareholding in Deutsche Post AG to 16.45%.\n\nStefan Schulte, who is resigning from the Supervisory Board after the Annual General Meeting scheduled for May 3, 2024, has contributed his comprehensive expertise and experience to the benefit of the company throughout his term of office and, as the Chair of the Financial and Audit Committee, engaged the Board of Management in differentiated and critical discussions. His independence was therefore not in question at any time for the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board will recommend two new independent Supervisory Board members to the Annual General Meeting to succeed Stefan Schulte and Simone Menne, who is also stepping down from the Finance and Audit Committee. More detailed information on the candidates can be found in the report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nLawrence Rosen's responsibility for the Board department Finance ended more than seven years ago and therefore does not impair his independence. At the same time, his profound knowledge of the company and the industry make it possible for him to support the Board of Management as an experienced and expert adviser and to perform the monitoring duties of the Supervisory Board in particular.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/114/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nNo Supervisory Board member exceeds the maximum age limit of 72, holds seats on governing bodies of the Group's main competitors or provides consultancy services to, or maintains other personal relationships with, such competitors.\n\n#### Effectiveness of the Supervisory Board's advisory and monitoring duties\n\nEach year, the members of the Supervisory Board review the work and decision-making processes of the Board. Discussions take place during a Supervisory Board meeting without the presence of the Board of Management. At regular intervals, most recently in the year under review, the opinions are also evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire, the results of which are incorporated into the Board's discussions. Among other topics, discussions focused on the skills profile of the Supervisory Board as well as the progress of the onboarding process for new Supervisory Board members. As a result, the Supervisory Board is of the opinion that it performed its monitoring and advisory duties effectively and efficiently.\n\n#### Targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board (skills profile)\n\nIn addition to legal requirements (notably Sections 100 and 107 AktG), the composition of the Supervisory Board is guided by recommendations C.1 and C.6 of the German Corporate Governance Code (DCGK). Overall, the Supervisory Board set the following targets for its composition that also reflect the skills profile it aspires to have:\n\n1. When proposing candidates to the Annual General Meeting for election as Supervisory Board members, the Supervisory Board is to be guided purely by the best interests of the company. Subject to this requirement, the Supervisory Board aims to ensure that the independent group of shareholder representatives as defined in C.6 of the German Corporate Governance Code is to account for at least 60% of the Supervisory Board, and that at least 30% of Supervisory Board members are women.\n\n2. The company's international activities are already adequately reflected in the current composition of the Supervisory Board. For its future proposals to the Annual General Meeting as well, the Supervisory Board strives to find candidates whose origins, education or professional experience equip them with particular international knowledge and experience.\n\n3. The Supervisory Board should collectively serve as a competent adviser to the Board of Management on future issues, in particular digital transformation and sustainability issues.\n\n4. The Supervisory Board should collectively have sufficient expertise in the areas of accounting and financial statement audits. This includes knowledge of international developments in the field of accounting. Additionally, the Supervisory Board believes that the independence of its members helps guarantee the integrity of the accounting process and ensure the independence of the auditors.\n\n5. Conflicts of interest affecting Supervisory Board members are an obstacle to providing independent advice to, and supervision of, the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board will decide how to deal with potential or actual conflicts of interest on a caseby-case basis, in accordance with the law and giving due consideration to the German Corporate Governance Code.\n\n6. In accordance with the age limit adopted by the Supervisory Board and laid down in the rules of procedure for the Supervisory Board, proposals for the election of Supervisory Board members must ensure that their term of office ends no later than the close of the next Annual General Meeting to be held after the Supervisory Board member reaches the age of 72. As a general rule, Supervisory Board members should not serve more than three terms of office.\n\nThe current Supervisory Board meets these targets and fulfills this skills profile. The Supervisory Board took targets and the skills profile into account in the election proposals it made to this year's Annual General Meeting.\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-115-0\"></span>Image /page/115/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

basis for each division, attended by representatives of management, once with the entire Board of Management and the other three times with the CEO and CFO. Additionally, quarterly review meetings are held for the cross-divisional functions with the CEO and CFO as well as representatives of management.\n\nThe review meetings involve discussions of strategic initiatives, operational matters and the budgetary situation in the divisions. In addition, all departments have Board committees where decisions are made on the fundamental strategic orientation of the respective department and prominent topics. Finally, the responsible Board departments resolve on investment, real estate and M&A plans within certain threshold limits using defined decision-making and approval processes.\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-116-0\"></span>Image /page/116/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters \"DHL\" is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### **Mediation Committee (pursuant to Section 27(3) German Co-determination Act)**\n\nDr. Nikolaus von Bomhard (Chair) Andrea Kocsis (Deputy Chair) Dr. Heinrich Hiesinger Thorsten Kühn\n\nThe Executive Committee prepares the resolutions to be taken in the plenary meetings regarding the appointment of members to the Board of Management, preparation of their service agreements (including remuneration), the system for remunerating Board of Management members, the establishment of variable remuneration targets, the establishment of variable remuneration according to degrees of target achievement, the review of the appropriateness of Board of Management remuneration and the remuneration report to be prepared annually. In addition, it regularly focuses on long-term succession planning for the Board of Management and questions of corporate governance, also providing recommendations to the Supervisory Board with regard to the latter.\n\nThe Finance and Audit Committee reviews the company's accounts, including sustainability reporting, and submits proposals for the approval of the annual and consolidated financial statements to the Supervisory Board. It oversees the company's accounting process; the effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system and the internal audit system; and the audit of the annual financial statements, in particular with respect to audit quality and the independence of the auditors. Consultation with the auditor also regularly takes place without the Board of Management members being present. The Finance and Audit Committee prepares the proposals of the Supervisory Board to be made to the Annual General Meeting concerning the choice of the audit firm. If the proposal is preceded by a formal selection process, as was the case prior to the 2022 Annual General Meeting, the committee is responsible for its execution. Following the selection process, the 2022 Annual General Meeting elected Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Munich, as the new audit firm for the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nIf the auditor is to be engaged to perform nonaudit services, the Finance and Audit Committee must approve any such engagement, and the committee receives regular reports regarding the total amount of fees agreed upon for these services to ensure compliance with the statutory upper limit. It examines corporate compliance and discusses the half-yearly financial reports and the quarterly statements with the Board of Management prior to their publication. As required, the Finance and Audit Committee is also responsible for issuing findings on the required Supervisory Board approvals of significant transactions between the company and related parties.\n\nThe Chair of the Finance and Audit Committee regularly engages in dialog with the auditor outside of the meetings as well. This exchange between the Chair of the committee and the auditor concerns the progress of the audit, and the Chair reports to the committee in this regard.\n\nThe Chair of the Finance and Audit Committee, Stefan Schulte, is independent and, on account of his many years of experience as the CFO and CEO of Fraport AG, an expert both in accounting as well as in the auditing of financial statements. Simone Menne and Lawrence Rosen also have comprehensive expertise in accounting and the auditing of financial statements thanks to their many years of service as board members for finance of Deutsche Lufthansa AG (Menne) as well as Deutsche Post AG and Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA (Rosen).\n\nThe candidates proposed to the 2024 Annual General Meeting to succeed Ms. Menne and Mr. Schulte on the Supervisory Board also possess comprehensive expertise in both of the aforementioned specialty areas. More detailed information on the candidates can be found in the report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nAn agreement has been reached with the auditor that the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the Chair of the Finance and Audit Committee will be informed without delay of any potential grounds for exclusion or for impairment of the auditors' independence that arise during the audit, to the extent that any such grounds for exclusion or impairment are not immediately remedied. In addition, it has been agreed upon that the auditor will inform the Supervisory Board without delay of all material findings and incidents occurring in the course of the audit. Furthermore, the auditor must inform the Supervisory Board if, while conducting the financial statement audit, any facts are found leading to the Declaration of Conformity issued by the Board of Management and\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/118/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The Finance and Audit Committee regularly reviews the quality of the financial statement audit. Both in the meeting of the Finance and Audit Committee held in preparation for the financial statements meeting as well as in the meeting of the plenary where the company and consolidated financial statements are approved, the members of the Supervisory Board closely examine the contents and the processes of the financial statement audit.\n\nThe Strategy and Sustainability Committee prepares the Supervisory Board's strategy discussions and regularly discusses implementation of the strategy and the competitive position of the enterprise as a whole and of the divisions. In addition, it does preparatory work on corporate acquisitions and divestitures that require the Supervisory Board's approval and takes an in-depth look at ESG topics relevant to the company. These include primarily the implementation of the sustainability strategy, in particular with regard to the goals of reducing CO₂ emissions, the safety and satisfaction of employees, the promotion of the share of women in executive positions, cybersecurity and the strengthening of compliance. All shareholder representatives on the committee have significant expertise in the field of sustainability.\n\nThe Nomination Committee is comprised exclusively of shareholder representatives. It presents the shareholder representatives of the Supervisory Board with recommendations for shareholder candidates for election to the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Personnel Committee discusses human resources principles and material topics for the Group, such as occupational health and safety, recruiting and retention, as well as equal opportunities.\n\nThe task of the Mediation Committee is stipulated by the *Mitbestimmungsgesetz* (MitbestG – German Co-Determination Act): it makes proposals to the Supervisory Board on the appointment of members of the Board of Management in cases in which the required majority of two-thirds of the votes of the Supervisory Board members is not reached. The committee did not meet in the past fiscal year.\n\nFurther information about the work of the Supervisory Board and its committees in the 2023 fiscal year is contained in the **[report of](#page-11-0)  [the Supervisory Board.](#page-11-0)** The members of the Board of Management and all additional offices held by them as well as the members of the Supervisory Board and all additional offices held by them can be found in **[boards and committees.](#page-6-0)** The Board members' curriculum vitae, information about their qualifications and the terms of their current appointments are also published on our **[website.](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/board-of-management.html)** The website also has current curriculum vitae of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board along with information on their professional occupation, their membership on the Supervisory Board and their current term of office.\n\n#### Diversity\n\nDiversity is one of the decisive factors in the business success of the Group – and the Board of Management is no exception. As part of the selection of members for the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board pays close attention to diversity and to ensuring that the members complement each other in terms of their personalities, qualifications, skills, origin and experience. Long-term succession planning in all divisions guarantees that there will be sufficient qualified internal candidates in the future as well. The early selection of women for executive positions also plays a key role. The members of the Board of Management come with different areas of professional expertise in the fields of engineering management, physics, business management, law and psychology. Moreover, the composition of the Board of Management reflects the international activities of the company: due to both their ethnic and cultural backgrounds as well as long professional tenures abroad of responsibility for business operations abroad, the members of the Board of Management have a broad range of experience in many countries in Europe, but also in the United States, Asia, Latin America and Australia. As of December 31, 2023, the average age of members of the Board of Management was 53, with the youngest member being 47 and the oldest 60.\n\nWith regard to long-term succession planning, the focus remains on the share of women in management positions. With two women on the Board of Management, the company has exceeded the minimum number applicable since August 2022 under Section 76(3a) AktG, which stipulates that the board of management of listed companies to which the German Co-determination Act applies include at least one woman and one man, if it consists of more than three persons. The target set by the Supervisory Board of a 25% share of women on the Board of Management by the end of 2024, which exceeds the statutory participation requirement, has also already been reached.\n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/119/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font size, also in red. The background is yellow.\n\nFor the period beginning January 1, 2020, the Board of Management set a target of 30% for the percentage of women at Deutsche Post AG at both executive tiers below the Board of Management. We aim to meet these targets by December 31, 2024. The two executive tiers are defined on the basis of their reporting lines: tier 1 comprises executives assigned to the N-1 reporting line; here, the share of women was 30.2% as of December 31, 2023. Tier 2 comprises executives assigned to the N-2 reporting line; here, the share of women was 33.3% as of December 31, 2023. By 2025, women should occupy at least 30% of middle- and uppermanagement positions in the Group. This figure has risen continually in recent years and stood at 27.2% as of December 31, 2023.\n\nThe diversity criteria that are particularly important to the Supervisory Board when considering its own composition are also outlined in the list of its goals (skills profile). With a proportion of women of 40%, the Supervisory Board has exceeded its own target of 30%, which also reflects the minimum statutory requirement.\n\n#### Shareholders and Annual General Meeting\n\nShareholders exercise their rights, and in particular their right to receive information and to vote, at the Annual General Meeting. Each share in the company entitles the holder to one vote. The company did not issue preference shares without voting rights. The agenda with the proposed resolutions for the Annual General Meeting and additional information will be made available on the company website directly after the Annual General Meeting is convened. A CV, which provides information about their relevant knowledge, skills and functional experience and contains an overview of their essential duties in addition to the Supervisory Board, is published for each Supervisory Board candidate put forth for election. Moreover, the **[qualification matrix](#page-115-0)** offers an overview of the skills and qualifications of the Supervisory Board members.\n\nThe speech by the CEO is generally available on the company's website at least four days in advance of the respective Annual General Meeting.\n\nWe assist our shareholders in exercising their voting rights not only by making it possible to submit postal votes but also by appointing company proxies, who cast their votes at the Annual General Meeting as instructed by the shareholders. Additionally, shareholders can authorize company proxies and submit postal votes via the shareholder portal offered by the company. The voting instructions to the proxies and the postal ballots can be changed up to the point when voting begins at the Annual General Meeting. Shareholders entered into the shareholder register and their proxies will be able to watch and listen to the Annual General Meeting during an online live stream.\n\nAfter three Annual General Meetings held virtually due to the pandemic, the Board of Management was able to invite the shareholders to once again attend in person last year. The 2023 Annual General Meeting also authorized the Board of Management to hold Annual General Meetings virtually if necessary for a period of two years. For the 2024 Annual General Meeting, the Board of Management decided not to make use of this option and to carry out the meeting once again as an in-person event. This is in line with the wishes of many shareholders and shareholder representatives to have the opportunity to talk personally with the members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, as well as with each other.\n\nThe remuneration system applied to Board of Management members must be presented to the Annual General Meeting for approval in the event of significant changes, or at least every four years; the four-year interval also applies to the remuneration of the Supervisory Board members. The 2021 Annual General Meeting approved the Board of Management remuneration system with 93.39% and the Supervisory Board remuneration with 99.46% of the votes cast in favor. The resolution proposed to the Annual General Meeting on the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board for 2022 was passed with an approval rate of 99.07%. The Board of Management remuneration system and the resolutions of the Annual General Meeting on the remuneration of Supervisory Board members can also be accessed on the **[company's website.](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/remuneration.html)** Information regarding the remuneration of the individual members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board can be found in the remuneration reports available there. As scheduled, the remuneration system for the Board of Management will be presented to the 2025 Annual General Meeting for approval.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-120-0\"></span>Image /page/120/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n### Disclosures required by takeover law\n\nDisclosures required under Sections 289a and 315a HGB and explanatory report\n\n#### Composition of issued capital, voting rights and transfer of shares\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the company's share capital totaled €1,239,059,409 and was composed of the same number of no-parvalue registered shares. Each share carries the same rights and obligations stipulated by law and/or in the company's Articles of Association and entitles the holder to one vote at the Annual General Meeting (AGM). The company did not issue preference shares without voting rights or shares with special rights conveying powers of control.\n\nThe exercise of voting rights and the transfer of shares are based upon statutory provisions and the company's Articles of Association, which place no restrictions on the exercise of voting rights or transfer of shares. Under the Employee Share Plan sharebased remuneration program, stocks are subject to time-related trading restrictions during the two-year holding period. As of December 31, 2023, Deutsche Post AG held a total of 58,079,379 treasury shares, which are excluded from rights for the company in accordance with Section 71b AktG.\n\n#### Shareholdings exceeding 10% of voting rights\n\nKfW Bankengruppe (KfW), Frankfurt am Main, is our largest shareholder. On December 31, 2023, it held 20.49% of share capital, which it reduced to 16.45% on February 7, 2024, according to a voting right announcement. The Federal Republic of Germany – including via the KfW – holds a 16.84% stake in the share capital of Deutsche Post AG as of February 7, 2024.\n\n#### Appointment and replacement of members of the Board of Management\n\nThe members of the Board of Management are appointed and replaced in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions (cf. Sections 84 and 85 AktG and Section 31 MitbestG). Article 6 of the Articles of Association stipulates that the Board of Management must have at least two members. Beyond that, the number of Board members is determined by the Supervisory Board. If the Board of Management is comprised of more than three persons, at least one woman and at least one man must be members of the board, cf. Section 76 (3a) AktG.\n\n#### Amendments to the Articles of Association\n\nIn accordance with Section 119 (1), Number 6, and Section 179 (1), Sentence 1, AktG, amendments to the Articles of Association are adopted by resolution of the AGM. In accordance with Article 21 (2) of the Articles of Association in conjunction with Sections 179 (2) and 133 (1) AktG, such amendments generally require a simple majority of the votes cast and a simple majority of the share capital represented on the date of the resolution. In such instances where the law requires a greater majority for amendments to the Articles of Association, that majority is decisive.\n\n#### Board of Management authorization, particularly regarding the issue and buyback of shares\n\nThe Board of Management is authorized, subject to the consent of the Supervisory Board, to issue up to 130,000,000 new no-parvalue registered shares (2021 Authorized Capital). Details may be found in Article 5 (2) of the Articles of Association. The Articles of Association can be accessed on the **[company's website](https://group.dhl.com/en/about-us/corporate-governance/declarations-reports.html)** or in the electronic company register. They may also be viewed in the commercial register of the Bonn Local Court.\n\nThe Board of Management has furthermore been authorized by resolution of the AGMs of April 28, 2017 (agenda item 7), April 24, 2018 (agenda item 6), August 27, 2020 (agenda item 7), and May 6, 2022 (agenda items 8 and 9), to issue Performance Share Units (PSUs). The authorization resolutions are included in the notarized minutes of the AGM, which can be viewed in the commercial register. In order to service both current PSUs and those yet to be issued, the AGM approved contingent capital increases. Details may be found in Article 5 of the Articles of Association. As of December 31, 2023, the PSUs already issued conferred rights to up to 27,787,376 Deutsche Post AG shares, assuming the conditions are met. Under the authorizations granted, up to 54,619,296 additional PSUs may still be issued.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/121/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nThe AGM of May 4, 2023, authorized the company to buy back shares on or before May 3, 2028, up to an amount not to exceed 10% of the share capital existing as of the date of adoption of the resolution. Further details, including the option of using the treasury shares acquired on that basis or on the basis of a preceding authorization, may be found in the authorization resolution adopted by the AGM of May 4, 2023 (agenda item 6). In addition, the AGM of May 4, 2023, authorized the Board of Management to buy back shares within the scope specified in agenda item 6, including through the use of derivatives (agenda item 7). Together with the purchases based upon the earlier authorization dated May 6, 2021, the company repurchased a total of 23,606,169 shares in the fiscal year based upon the authorization resolution.\n\n#### Significant agreements that are conditional upon a change of control following a takeover bid and agreements with members of the Board of Management or employees providing for compensation in the event of a change of control\n\nDeutsche Post AG holds a syndicated credit facility with a volume of €2 billion under an agreement entered into with a consortium of banks. If a change of control within the meaning of the agreement occurs, each member of the bank consortium is entitled, under certain conditions, to cancel its share of the credit facility as well as its share of any outstanding loans and to request repayment. The terms and conditions of the bonds issued under the Debt Issuance Program established in March 2012 and those of the convertible bond issued in December 2017 also contain change-of-control clauses. In the event of a change of control within the meaning of those terms and conditions, creditors are, under certain conditions, granted the right to demand early redemption of the respective bonds. Finally, two framework agreements are in place with a vehicle supplier, on the basis of which vehicles with a total value in the upper double-digit-million range were purchased in the fiscal year and that can be terminated without notice by the contractual partner in the event of a change of control.\n\nIn the event of a change of control, any member of the Board of Management is entitled to resign their office for good cause within a period of six months following the change of control after giving three months' notice to the end of a given month, and to terminate their Board of Management contract (right to early termination). This is not associated with a severance payment claim. With regard to the Annual Bonus Plan with Share Matching for executives, the holding period for the shares will become invalid with immediate effect in the event of a change of control of the company. The participating executives will receive the total number of matching shares corresponding to their investment (or a cash equivalent) in due course. In such a case, the employer will be responsible for any tax disadvantages resulting from a reduction of the holding period. Taxes normally incurred after the holding period are exempt from this provision. Under the Employee Share Plan and the piloted \"myShares\" employee participation program, if a change of control occurs, any amounts that have already been invested and for which shares have yet to be delivered are reimbursed.

As of July 1, 2023, the Group name was changed from Deutsche Post DHL Group to DHL Group. The adoption of this new name does not have any influence on the services offered by the divisions. The Deutsche Post and DHL brands of the Group will continue to be used as before. These brands represent a portfolio of logistics (DHL) and communication (Deutsche Post) services. The fiscal year of Deutsche Post AG and its consolidated subsidiaries is the calendar year. Deutsche Post AG, whose registered office is in Bonn, Germany, is entered in the commercial register of the Bonn Local Court under HRB 6792.\n\n### Basis of preparation\n\nAs a listed company, Deutsche Post AG prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with Section 315e *Handelsgesetzbuch* (HGB – German Commercial Code) (\"consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards\") in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and related Interpretations of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted in the European Union in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the European Council on the application of international accounting standards.\n\n#### 1 Basis of accounting\n\nThe requirements of the standards applied have been satisfied in full, and the consolidated financial statements therefore provide a true and fair view of the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements consist of the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income, the balance sheet, the cash flow statement, the statement of changes in equity and the notes. In order to improve the clarity of presentation, various items in the balance sheet and in the income statement have been combined. These items are disclosed and explained separately in the notes. The income statement has been classified in accordance with the nature-of-expense method.\n\nThe accounting policies and the explanations and disclosures in the notes to the IFRS consolidated financial statements for the 2023 fiscal year are generally based on the same accounting policies used in the 2022 consolidated financial statements. Exceptions to this are the changes in international financial reporting under the IFRS described in **[note 5](#page-134-0)** that have been required to be applied by the Group since January 1, 2023. The accounting policies are explained in **[note 7.](#page-137-0)**\n\nThese consolidated financial statements were authorized for issue by a resolution of the Board of Management of Deutsche Post AG dated February 16, 2024.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in euros (€). Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are given in millions of euros (€ million, €m).\n\n#### 2 Consolidated group\n\nThe consolidated group includes all companies controlled by Deutsche Post AG. Control exists if Deutsche Post AG has decisionmaking powers, is exposed, and has rights, to variable returns and is able to use its decision-making powers to affect the amount of the variable returns. The Group companies are consolidated from the date on which DHL Group is able to exercise control.\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/129/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in a bold, red font, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller, red font. The background of the logo is yellow.\n\nWhen DHL Group holds less than the majority of voting rights, other contractual arrangements may result in the Group controlling the investee.\n\nDHL Sinotrans International Air Courier Ltd. (Sinotrans), China, is a significant company that has been consolidated despite DHL Group not having a majority of voting rights. Sinotrans provides domestic and international express delivery and transport services and has been assigned to the Express segment. The company is fully integrated into the global DHL network and operates exclusively for DHL Group. Due to the arrangements in the Network Agreement, DHL Group is able to prevail in decisions concerning Sinotrans' relevant activities. Sinotrans has therefore been consolidated although DHL Group holds no more than 50% of the company's share capital.\n\nThe complete list of the Group's shareholdings in accordance with Section 313(2), Nos. 1 to 6, and (3) HGB may be viewed in the **[list of shareholdings.](https://group.dhl.com/content/dam/deutschepostdhl/en/media-center/investors/documents/annual-reports/DHL-Group-list-of-shareholdings-2023-12-31.pdf)**\n\nThe number of companies consolidated with Deutsche Post AG is shown in the following table:\n\n#### CONSOLIDATED GROUP\n\n|                                                             | 2022 | 2023 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Number of fully consolidated companies (subsidiaries)       |      |      |\n| German                                                      | 83   | 81   |\n| Foreign                                                     | 711  | 690  |\n| Number of joint operations                                  |      |      |\n| German                                                      | 1    | 1    |\n| Foreign                                                     | 0    | 0    |\n| Number of investments accounted for using the equity method |      |      |\n| German                                                      | 1    | 1    |\n| Foreign                                                     | 16   | 17   |\n\nThe changes are primarily the result of mergers and liquidations of immaterial companies.\n\nSignificant acquisitions can be found in **note 2.1.**\n\n#### 2.1 Acquisitions in 2023\n\nThe following significant acquisitions occurred in the 2023 fiscal year:\n\n#### ACQUISITIONS\n\n| Name                                                       | Country              | Segment                    | Equity<br>interest<br>% | Acquisition date |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|\n| MNG Kargo (MNG KARGO) Yurtici ve Yurtdisi Tasimacilik A.S. | Turkey               | eCommerce                  | 100                     | Q4 2023          |\n| Danzas AEI Emirates LLC (renamed DHL Logistics LLG – SO)   | United Arab Emirates | Global Forwarding, Freight | 100                     | Q4 2023          |\n\n#### MNG KARGO\n\nAt the end of July 2023, DHL Group signed an agreement to acquire 100% of shares in the Turkish company MNG Kargo and its subsidiary. The purchase was completed on October 5, 2023, following approval by the Turkish antitrust authorities. MNG Kargo is one of the leading parcel carriers in Turkey and has a strong presence in the e-commerce segment. The acquisition complements the business portfolio of DHL Group and is to contribute to the company being able to benefit from growth potential in the Turkish market and continuing to strengthen its position in Turkey and in European markets.

The measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities and provisions assumed has not yet been completed due to time restrictions. The acquisition resulted in preliminary goodwill, which currently amounts to €267 million and cannot be deducted from tax. Current assets include trade receivables of €24 million.

The company had previously been managed together with the Investment Trading Group and recognized as a joint venture to which the equity method is applied. The company is now fully consolidated with 100% ownership of shares and has been renamed DHL Logistics LLC – SO (DHL Logistics). DHL Logistics is a specialist in logistics and transport services in Dubai and the northern Emirates. Thanks to this acquisition, the Global Forwarding, Freight division can continue driving its strategic goal and accelerate profitable growth in the Middle East and Africa region. The measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities and provisions assumed has not yet been completed due to time restrictions. The acquisition resulted in preliminary goodwill, which currently amounts to €259 million and cannot be deducted from tax. It is mainly attributable to the synergies and network effects expected in Dubai and the northern Emirates. Current assets include trade receivables of €41 million. There was a difference of €2 million between the gross amount and the carrying amount. The final purchase price allocation will be presented at a later date.\n\n#### PRELIMINARY OPENING BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 7, 2023 DHL LOGISTICS\n\n| €m                                          | Preliminary fair value |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Noncurrent assets                           | 7                      |\n| Current assets                              | 4                      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                   | 1                      |\n| <b>Assets</b>                               | <b>12</b>              |\n| Noncurrent provisions and liabilities       | -4                     |\n| Current provisions and liabilities          | -3                     |\n| <b>Equity and liabilities</b>               | <b>-7</b>              |\n| <b>Net assets</b>                           | <b>5</b>               |\n| Purchase price paid in cash                 | 18                     |\n| Fair value of the existing equity interest1 | 12                     |\n| <b>Goodwill</b>                             | <b>25</b>              |\n\n1 Also includes the gain from change in consolidation method in the amount of €114 million, which is recognized under net income from investments accounted for using the equity method.\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/131/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The companies are consolidated in consideration of noncontrolling interests. Due to this partnership, DHL Group can better respond to the specific needs of SMEs and smaller web shops, see **[2022 Annual Report, note 2 to](https://group.dhl.com/content/dam/deutschepostdhl/en/media-center/investors/documents/annual-reports/DPDHL-2022-Annual-Report.pdf#page=99)  [the consolidated financial statements.](https://group.dhl.com/content/dam/deutschepostdhl/en/media-center/investors/documents/annual-reports/DPDHL-2022-Annual-Report.pdf#page=99)** The purchase price allocation was finalized on June 30, 2023, and resulted in non-taxdeductible goodwill of €76 million, which is allocated to the Supply Chain segment. It is mainly attributable to the synergies and network effects expected from the e-commerce market in the Netherlands. There is also a call option to purchase the remaining 49% of shares that can be exercised at any time. The option is measured as a derivative at fair value through profit or loss. The customer relationships are amortized over a period of ten years and the brand name over a period of five years. The software has a useful life of five years. Current assets include trade receivables of €16 million. There was no difference between the gross amount and the carrying amount.\n\n| FINAL OPENING BALANCE AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2022 |                 |            | MONTA GROUP |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------|-------------|\n| €m                                           | Carrying amount | Adjustment | Fair value  |\n| Noncurrent assets                            | 62              | 41         | 103         |\n| Software                                     |                 | 18         |             |\n| Customer relationships                       |                 | 17         |             |\n| Brand name                                   |                 | 6          |             |\n| Current assets                               | 18              | -          | 18          |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                    | 3               | -          | 3           |\n| ASSETS                                       | 83              | 41         | 124         |\n| Noncurrent provisions and liabilities        | -51             | -10        | -61         |\n| Deferred taxes                               |                 | -10        |             |\n| Current provisions and liabilities           | -31             | -          | -31         |\n| EQUITY AND LIABILITIES                       | -82             | -10        | -93         |\n| Net assets                                   | 1               | 31         | 32          |\n| Purchase price paid in cash                  | 103             | 0          | 103         |\n| Difference                                   | 102             | -31        | 71          |\n| Less fair value of the option                | 10              | -          | 10          |\n| Noncontrolling interests                     | 0               | 15         | 15          |\n| Goodwill                                     | 92              | -16        | 76          |\n\n| €m                                                       | MNG Kargo | DHL Logistics |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------|\n| Group revenue since consolidation                        | 66        | 1             |\n| Group EBIT since consolidation                           | 8         |               |\n| Transaction costs (reported in other operating expenses) | 01        | 0             |\n\n1 Rounded below €1 million.\n\nIf the companies had already been fully consolidated as of January 1, 2023, MNG Kargo would have additionally generated revenue of €198 million and EBIT of €23 million and DHL Logistics revenue of €223 million and EBIT of €22 million.\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, a total of €452 million was paid for the subsidiaries acquired during the fiscal year. The purchase prices of the acquired companies were paid by transferring cash and cash equivalents.\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-132-0\"></span>Image /page/132/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the DHL part, also in red, is the word 'Group' in a smaller, less bold font. The background is yellow.\n\nInvestments in companies accounted for using the equity method amounted to €34 million in the 2023 fiscal year.\n\n#### 2.2 Disposal and deconsolidation effects\n\nThere were no material disposals of shareholdings in the 2023 fiscal year.\n\n#### 2.3 Joint operations\n\nJoint operations are consolidated on a pro rata basis in accordance with IFRS 11.\n\nAerologic GmbH (Aerologic), Germany, a cargo airline based in Schkeuditz, is the only joint operation in this regard. Aerologic has been assigned to the Express segment. It was jointly established by Lufthansa Cargo AG and Deutsche Post Beteiligungen Holding GmbH, which each hold 50% of its capital and voting rights. Aerologic's shareholders are simultaneously its customers, giving them access to its freight aircraft capacity. Aerologic mainly serves the DHL Express network from Monday to Friday and flies for the Lufthansa Cargo network on weekends. Individual aircraft are also used exclusively by the two respective shareholders. In contrast to its capital and voting rights, the company's assets and liabilities, as well as its income and expenses, are allocated based on this user relationship.\n\n#### 3 Significant transactions\n\nIn addition to the business combinations mentioned under **[note 2,](#page-128-0)** the following significant transactions occurred in the 2023 fiscal year:\n\n#### Issue of a new bond\n\nOn June 26, 2023, Deutsche Post AG placed its first sustainability-linked bond with an issue volume of €500 million and a term through 2033. The interest rate of the bond is coupled with the medium-term target of significantly reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030. The cash inflow and the liability were recognized on July 3, 2023. The ten-year term ends on July 3, 2033. The bond has a fixed interest rate of 3.375% per year. However, if one of the targets set for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for 2030 is not reached, the coupon to be paid increases beginning in the year 2031.The proceeds will primarily be used for general company purposes, including the refinancing of existing financial liabilities, **[note 39.](#page-189-0)**\n\n#### **Share buyback of up to €4 billion**\n\nBy a Board of Management resolution dated February 14, 2023, the current share buyback program was expanded so that a total of up to 105 million treasury shares can be purchased at a price of now up to €3 billion through to the end of 2024. The purposes remain unaffected, which means the repurchased shares will either be retired, used to service long-term executive remuneration plans and any future employee participation programs or used to meet potential obligations if rights accruing under the 2017/2025 convertible bond are exercised. The repurchase via the stock exchange started on April 8, 2022, and will end no later than in December 2024. For the first two tranches, the share buyback program was based on the authorization resolved by the company's Annual General Meeting on May 6, 2021. The third and fourth tranches were carried out based on the authorization resolved by the company's Annual General Meeting on May 4, 2023, **[note 33](#page-175-0) [and 34.](#page-178-0)**\n\nOn February 12, 2024, the Board of Management resolved to expand the current share buyback program so that a total of up to 130 million treasury shares are to be purchased at a price of now up to €4 billion through the end of 2025. The intended uses remain unaffected.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-133-0\"></span>Image /page/133/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

With the final purchase price allocation (PPA) for Monta Group, adjustments were made to the balance sheet items specified below, which were accounted for in the opening balance and led to a corresponding adjusted presentation in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.\n\nMoreover, for improved presentation in the balance sheet, accounts of a financial nature were reclassified from other assets and other liabilities to financial assets and financial liabilities, respectively (IFRS 7). This enables the amounts presented in the table titled \"Reconciliation to carrying amounts in accordance with IFRS 9\" to be allocated to the carrying amounts, **note 43.**\n\n| BALANCE SHEET                     |        |        |            |                 |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|-----------------|\n| €m                                | Reason | Amount | Adjustment | Adjusted amount |\n| December 31, 2022                 |        |        |            |                 |\n| Intangible assets                 | PPA    | 14,096 | 25         | 14,121          |\n| Current financial assets          | IFRS 7 | 1,355  | 444        | 1,799           |\n| Other current assets              | IFRS 7 | 3,551  | –444       | 3,107           |\n| Current income tax assets         |        | 283    | 173        | 456             |\n| Noncontrolling interests          | PPA    | 467    | 15         | 482             |\n| Deferred tax liabilities          | PPA    | 336    | 10         | 346             |\n| Noncurrent financial liabilities  | IFRS 7 | 17,659 | 24         | 17,683          |\n| Other noncurrent liabilities      | IFRS 7 | 321    | –24        | 297             |\n| Noncurrent income tax liabilities |        | 0      | 331        | 331             |\n| Current financial liabilities     | IFRS 7 | 4,159  | 324        | 4,483           |\n| Other current liabilities         | IFRS 7 | 6,512  | –324       | 6,188           |\n| Current income tax liabilities    |        | 659    | –158       | 501             |\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-134-0\"></span>Image /page/134/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The<br>amendment of IAS 1 explains and requires that a disclosure of \"material\" rather than \"significant\" accounting policies<br>must be made. To support this approach, the amendments to IFRS Practice Statement 2 demonstrate the application<br>of the concept of materiality to accounting policy disclosures. The consolidated financial statements were not<br>affected.                                                                    |\n| Amendments to IAS 8, Definition of<br>Accounting Estimates                                                   | The amendments introduced a new definition of accounting estimates and explain how entities should distinguish<br>changes in accounting estimates from changes in accounting policies. The consolidated financial statements were not<br>affected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Amendments to IAS 12, Deferred Tax<br>Related to Assets and Liabilities<br>Arising from a Single Transaction | The amendment limits the exemption from the (initial) recognition of deferred tax in that it no longer applies to<br>transactions for which entities recognize both an asset and a liability (e.g., leases and decommissioning obligations).<br>Going forward, deferred tax assets and liabilities must be recognized for such transactions to the extent that equal<br>amounts of deductible and taxable temporary differences arise. The consolidated financial statements were not<br>affected.                                                                   |\n| Amendments to IAS 12, International<br>Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules                                   | The amendments to IAS 12 are carried out in conjunction with the regulations for a global minimum tax. DHL Group<br>falls under the scope of application of the OECD model provisions for pillar two. The legal provisions for pillar two had<br>only been implemented in some jurisdictions, so the regulations for the global minimum tax were not yet applicable<br>throughout the Group in the year under review. Beginning with the 2024 fiscal year, the Group expects an increase in<br>current taxes by an amount in the low double-digit millions of euros. |\n| IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts,<br>including amendments to IFRS 17                                             | The standard replaces IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts, and outlines the principles governing the recognition,<br>measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts. The objective of the standard is to ensure that the<br>reporting entity provides relevant information that faithfully represents the effect that insurance contracts have on an<br>entity's net assets, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. IFRS 17 was not applied for reasons of<br>materiality.                                                               |\n| Amendments to IFRS 17, First-Time<br>Adoption of IFRS 17, and IFRS 9,<br>Comparative Information             | The narrow-scope amendment to IFRS 17 permits entities to apply an optional classification overlay, if certain<br>conditions are met, with the aim of providing useful comparative information on financial instruments for 2022. The<br>amendment was issued because the initial application of IFRS 9 is not required to be retroactive, whereas this is the<br>case for IFRS 17. This can result in accounting mismatches for financial instruments. There were no effects.                                                                                       |\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/135/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of a stylized, bold font with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the DHL part of the logo, the word \"Group\" is written in red.\n\n#### 6 Currency translation\n\nThe financial statements of consolidated companies prepared in foreign currencies are translated into euros (€) in accordance with IAS 21 using the functional currency method. The functional currency of foreign companies is determined by the primary economic environment in which they mainly generate and use cash. Within the Group, the functional currency is predominantly the local currency. In the consolidated financial statements, assets and liabilities are therefore translated at the closing rates, while periodic income and expenses are generally translated at an average price that results from the monthly prices. The resulting currency translation differences are recognized in other comprehensive income. In the 2023 fiscal year, currency translation differences amounting to €–586 million (previous year: €153 million) were recognized in other comprehensive income, see the **[statement of](https://dhl-reporting-hub-next.ryze-cloud.de/fy-2023/en/consolidated-financial-statements/statement-of-comprehensive-income/)  [comprehensive income.](https://dhl-reporting-hub-next.ryze-cloud.de/fy-2023/en/consolidated-financial-statements/statement-of-comprehensive-income/)**\n\nGoodwill arising from business combinations after January 1, 2005, is treated as an asset of the acquired company and therefore carried in the functional currency of the acquired company. Goodwill that arose for foreign subsidiaries as part of acquisition accounting prior to 2005 is carried in euros at historical cost less the accumulated amortization through to the end of 2004.\n\nThe exchange rates for the currencies that are significant for the Group were as follows:\n\n#### CURRENCY\n\n|     |                | Closing rates   |                 | Average rates   |                 |\n|-----|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|     | Country        | 2022<br>EUR 1 = | 2023<br>EUR 1 = | 2022<br>EUR 1 = | 2023<br>EUR 1 = |\n| AUD | Australia      | 1.5723          | 1.6294          | 1.5157          | 1.6351          |\n| CNY | China          | 7.3823          | 7.8843          | 7.0875          | 7.6960          |\n| GBP | United Kingdom | 0.8866          | 0.8697          | 0.8549          | 0.8689          |\n| HKD | Hong Kong      | 8.3317          | 8.6475          | 8.2241          | 8.4813          |\n| INR | India          | 88.2947         | 92.0797         | 82.7138         | 89.4486         |\n| JPY | Japan          | 140.8789        | 156.6571        | 138.1186        | 153.2537        |\n| SEK | Sweden         | 11.1005         | 11.0919         | 10.6552         | 11.4828         |\n| USD | United States  | 1.0686          | 1.1070          | 1.0502          | 1.0830          |\n\nThe carrying amounts of nonmonetary assets recognized at significant consolidated companies operating in hyperinflationary economies are generally indexed in accordance with IAS 29 and thus reflect the current purchasing power as of the reporting date. Turkey has met the criteria regarding a cumulative inflation rate of more than 100% over a period of three years since the beginning of 2022. Accounting pursuant to IAS 29 was applied for the relevant companies. Upon application, the adjustments to the carrying amounts of nonmonetary assets and liabilities based on the general price index were recognized in the financial result, **[note 18.](#page-162-0)** The consumer price index of the Turkish Statistical Institute was used for the adjustment of the purchasing power effects. As of January 1, 2023, this figure was 1,128 basis points and had increased to 1,859 basis points as of December 31, 2023.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 21, the monetary values such as receivables and liabilities in the financial statements of consolidated companies that have been prepared in local currencies are translated at the closing rate as of the reporting date. Currency translation differences are recognized in other operating income and expenses in the income statement. In the 2023 fiscal year, income of €452 million (previous year: €696 million) and expenses of €433 million (previous year: €673 million) resulted from currency translation differences. In contrast, currency translation differences relating to net investments in a foreign operation are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-137-0\"></span>Image /page/137/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### 7 Accounting policies\n\nUniform accounting policies are applied to the annual financial statements of the entities included in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for items that are required to be recognized at their fair value.\n\n#### Revenue and expense recognition\n\nDHL Group's normal business operations consist of the provision of logistics services comprising express delivery, freight transport, supply chain management, e-commerce solutions and letter and parcel dispatch in Germany. All income relating to normal business operations is recognized as revenue in the income statement. All other income is reported as other operating income.\n\nRevenue is recognized when control over the goods or services transfers to the customer, i.e., when the customer has the ability to control the use of the transferred goods or services provided and generally derive their remaining benefits. There must be a contract with enforceable rights and obligations and, among other things, the receipt of consideration must be likely, taking into account the customer's credit quality. Revenue corresponds to the transaction price to which the Group is expected to be entitled. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price when it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur. Generally, the Group does not have contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods and/or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. Accordingly, the promised consideration is not adjusted for the time value of money. For each performance obligation, revenue is either recognized at a point in time or over time. Performance progress is generally determined on the basis of the ratio of completed to still-outstanding transport duration.\n\nThe revenue generated by providing other logistics services is recognized in the reporting period in which the service was rendered.\n\nWhenever third parties are involved in the performance of a service, a distinction must be drawn between the principal and agent. If DHL Group serves as the principal, then the gross amount of revenue is recognized. If the Group acts as the agent, the net amount is recognized. The transaction price for this specific service is limited to the amount of the commission to be received. DHL Group is generally the principal when transport services are provided.\n\nOperating expenses are recognized in profit or loss when the service is utilized or when the expenses are incurred.\n\n#### Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets, which comprise internally generated and purchased intangible assets and purchased goodwill, are measured at amortized cost.\n\nInternally generated intangible assets are recognized at cost if it is probable that their production will generate an inflow of future economic benefits and the costs can be reliably measured. In the Group, this concerns internally developed software. If the criteria for capitalization are not met, the expenses are recognized immediately in income in the year in which they are incurred. In addition to direct costs, the production cost of internally developed software includes an appropriate share of allocable production overhead costs. Any borrowing costs incurred for qualifying assets are included in the production cost. Value-added tax arising in conjunction with the acquisition or production of intangible assets is included in the cost to the extent that it cannot be deducted as input tax.\n\nIntangible assets (excluding goodwill) are amortized using the straight-line method over their useful lives. Impairment losses are recognized in accordance with the principles described in the **[impairment](https://dhl-reporting-hub-next.ryze-cloud.de/fy-2023/en/consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements-of-deutsche-post-ag/basis-of-preparation/ bzw. gleiche Seite: Impairment losses | id=\"headline-12074\")** section. The useful lives of significant intangible assets are as follows:\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/138/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters \"DHL\" is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### USEFUL LIVES\n\n|                        | Years    |\n|------------------------|----------|\n| Software               | 5 to 10  |\n| Licenses               | up to 5  |\n| Customer relationships | up to 20 |\n\n1 The useful lives indicated represent maximum amounts specified by the Group. The actual useful lives may be shorter due to contractual arrangements or other specific factors such as time and location.\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or whenever there are indications of impairment. This includes goodwill almost exclusively. Impairment testing is carried out in accordance with the principles described in the **[impairment](https://dhl-reporting-hub-next.ryze-cloud.de/fy-2023/en/consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements-of-deutsche-post-ag/basis-of-preparation/ bzw. gleiche Seite: Impairment losses | id=\"headline-12074\")** section.\n\n#### Emissions certificates\n\nCO2 emissions certificates and certificates and/or proof of generation for electricity from renewable energies are recognized as intangible assets and reported under other assets. Both purchased as well as freely allocated rights are recognized at cost; no depreciation is carried out.\n\nA provision for the obligation to submit CO2 emissions certificates to the responsible authorities in the EU and the United Kingdom is recognized at the carrying amount of the CO2 emissions certificates capitalized for this purpose. If a portion of the obligation is not covered by existing certificates, the provision for this is recognized at the market price of the emissions certificates on the reporting date.\n\n#### Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is carried at cost, reduced by accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. In addition to direct costs, production cost includes an appropriate share of allocable production overhead costs. Borrowing costs that can be allocated directly to the purchase, construction or manufacture of property, plant and equipment are capitalized. Value-added tax arising in conjunction with the acquisition or production of items of property, plant or equipment is included in the cost to the extent that it cannot be deducted as input tax. Depreciation is charged using the straight-line method. Significant portions of property, plant and equipment that have different useful lives are recognized and depreciated separately. If costs are incurred in conjunction with regular comprehensive maintenance work (e.g., refurbishment of aircraft and major repairs of engines), these costs are recognized as a separate component, provided that they meet the criteria for this recognition. The estimated useful lives applied to the major asset classes are presented in the table below:\n\n#### USEFUL LIVES\n\n|                                       | Years1   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------|\n| Buildings                             | 20 to 50 |\n| Technical equipment and machinery     | 10 to 20 |\n| Aircraft                              | 15 to 25 |\n| IT equipment                          | 4 to 10  |\n| Transport equipment and vehicle fleet | 5 to 20  |\n| Other operating and office equipment  | 7 to 10  |\n\n1 The useful lives indicated represent maximum amounts specified by the Group. The actual useful lives may be shorter due to contractual arrangements or other specific factors such as time and location.\n\nIf there are indications of impairment, an impairment test must be carried out; see the **[impairment](https://dhl-reporting-hub-next.ryze-cloud.de/fy-2023/en/consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements-of-deutsche-post-ag/basis-of-preparation/ bzw. gleiche Seite: Impairment losses | id=\"headline-12074\")** section.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/139/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Impairment losses\n\nAs of each reporting date, the carrying amounts of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and investment property are reviewed for indications of impairment. If there are any such indications, an impairment test is carried out. This is done by determining the recoverable amount of the relevant asset and comparing it with the carrying amount.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 36, the recoverable amount is the asset's fair value less costs to sell or its value in use (present value of the pretax free cash flows expected to be derived from the asset in the future), whichever is higher. The discount rate used for the value in use is a pretax rate of interest reflecting current market conditions. If the recoverable amount cannot be determined for an individual asset, the recoverable amount is determined for the smallest identifiable group of assets to which the asset in question can be allocated and that independently generates cash flows (cash generating unit – CGU). If the recoverable amount of an asset is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized immediately in respect of the asset. If it can be determined, the fair value or value in use of the individual assets represents their minimum carrying amount. If, after an impairment loss has been recognized, a higher recoverable amount is determined for the asset or the CGU at a later date, the impairment loss is reversed up to a carrying amount that does not exceed the recoverable amount. The increased carrying amount attributable to the reversal of the impairment loss is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization or depreciation) if no impairment loss had been recognized in the past. The reversal of the impairment loss is recognized in the income statement. Impairment losses recognized in respect of goodwill may not be reversed. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost, less any cumulative adjustments from impairment losses. Purchased goodwill is therefore not amortized and instead is tested for impairment annually in accordance with IAS 36, regardless of whether any indication of possible impairment exists, as in the case of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. In addition, the obligation remains to conduct an impairment test if there is any indication of impairment. Goodwill resulting from company acquisitions is allocated to the CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. These groups represent the lowest reporting level at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The carrying amount of a CGU to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. Where impairment losses are recognized in connection with a CGU to which goodwill has been allocated, the existing carrying amount of the goodwill is reduced first. If the amount of the impairment loss exceeds the carrying amount of the goodwill, the difference is generally allocated proportionally to the remaining assets in the CGU.\n\n#### Leases\n\nA lease is a contract in which the right to use an asset (the leased asset) is granted for an agreed-upon period in return for compensation.\n\n#### Lessee\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 16, the Group as lessee has recognized at present value assets for the right of use received and liabilities for the payment obligations entered into for all leases in the balance sheet. Lease liabilities include the following lease payments:\n\n- fixed payments, less lease incentives offered by the lessor;\n- variable payments linked to an index or interest rate;\n- expected residual payments from residual-value guarantees;\n- the exercise price of call options when exercise is estimated to be sufficiently likely; and\n- contractual penalties for the termination of a lease if the lease term reflects the exercise of a termination option.\n\nLease payments are discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease to the extent that this can be determined. Otherwise, they are discounted at the incremental borrowing rate of the respective lessee.\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/140/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in a bold, red font, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller, red font. The background of the logo is yellow.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost, which comprises the following:\n\n- lease liability;\n- lease payments made at or prior to delivery, less lease incentives received;\n- initial direct costs and restoration obligations.\n\nRight-of-use assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost. They are depreciated over the term of the lease using the straight-line method.\n\nThe Group makes use of the relief options provided for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases (shorter than 12 months) and expenses the payments in the income statement using the straight-line method. Additionally, the requirements do not apply to leases of intangible assets. The Group also exercises the option available for contracts comprising both lease and nonlease components to not separate these components, except in the case of real estate and aircraft leases. In addition, under IFRS 8, intra-Group leases – in line with internal management – are generally presented as operating leases in segment reporting.\n\nExtension and termination options exist for a number of leases, particularly for real estate. Such contract terms offer the Group the greatest possible flexibility in doing business. In determining lease terms, all facts and circumstances offering economic incentives for exercising extension options or not exercising termination options are taken into account. Changes due to the exercise or nonexercise of such options are considered in determining the lease term only if they are sufficiently probable.\n\n#### Lessor\n\nFor operating leases, the Group reports the leased asset at amortized cost as an asset under property, plant and equipment where it is the lessor. The lease payments received in the period are recognized under other operating income or revenue if they belong to ordinary business activities.\n\nWhere the Group is the lessor in a finance lease, it recognizes the assets as lease receivables in the amount of the net investment in the balance sheet. Certain subleases embedded in customer contracts are still reported as finance leases at the lessor.\n\n#### Investments accounted for using the equity method\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method cover associates and joint ventures. These are recognized using the equity method in accordance with IAS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. Based on the cost of acquisition at the time of purchase of the investments, the carrying amount of the investment is increased or reduced annually to reflect the share of earnings, dividends distributed and other changes in the equity of the associates and joint ventures attributable to the investments of Deutsche Post AG or its consolidated subsidiaries. An impairment loss is recognized on investments accounted for using the equity method, including the goodwill in the carrying amount of the investment, if the recoverable amount falls below the carrying amount. Gains and losses from the disposal of investments accounted for using the equity method are recognized in net income/expenses from investments accounted for using the equity method, as are impairments and reversals of impairments.\n\n#### Financial instruments\n\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets include, in particular, cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, originated loans and other financial receivables, as well as derivative financial assets. Financial liabilities include contractual obligations to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity. These mainly comprise trade payables, liabilities to banks, liabilities arising from bonds and leases, and derivative financial liabilities.\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/141/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of three horizontal lines on the left and the letters DHL on the right. The word \"Group\" is in red and is located below the DHL part of the logo.\n\n#### Measurement\n\nThe Group measures financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value plus the transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of these financial assets and financial liabilities on initial recognition if the financial assets and financial liabilities are not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. The transaction costs of assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognized as expenses. For financial liabilities measured according to the fair value option, the part of the change in fair value resulting from changes in the Group's own credit risk is recognized in other comprehensive income rather than in the income statement.\n\n#### Classification\n\nFinancial assets are classified in the measurement categories below. The classification of debt instruments depends on the business model used to manage the financial assets and their contractual cash flows.\n\n#### Debt instruments at amortized cost\n\nDebt instruments that are assigned to the \"hold to collect contractual cash flows\" business model and whose cash flows exclusively comprise interest and principal are measured and recognized at amortized cost. Interest income from these financial assets is reported in financial income using the effective interest method.\n\n#### Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)\n\nDebt instruments assigned to the \"hold to collect and sell\" business model must be measured at fair value plus transaction costs. As a result, changes in the carrying amount due to exchange rate gains and losses, impairment gains and losses, and interest income calculated using the effective interest method are recognized in the income statement. These amounts correspond to the amounts that would have been recognized in the income statement if they had been measured at amortized cost. All other changes of the carrying amount are recognized in other comprehensive income. When the debt instruments are derecognized, the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are to be reclassified to the income statement.\n\n#### **Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)**\n\nDebt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments acquired to maximize their cash flows by selling them in the short to medium term are assigned to the \"sell\" business model. They are measured at fair value. The resulting measurement gains and losses are reported in the income statement.\n\n#### Equity instruments classified as FVTOCI\n\nPursuant to IFRS 9, equity instruments are to be recognized at their fair value and can be assigned to the FVTOCI or FVTPL measurement categories. For strategic reasons, most of the equity instruments that the Group invests in are then assigned to the FVTOCI category. The effects of any change in the fair value of equity instruments of the FVTOCI category are recognized in other comprehensive income. Dividends are recognized in other operating income in the income statement. If the equity instruments of the FVTOCI category are sold, the fair value changes recognized in equity are to be transferred to other reserves. For equity instruments assigned to the FVTPL category, the fair value changes are to be reported immediately in the income statement. Dividends are also recognized in other income in the income statement.\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/142/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters. There are three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red. The background of the logo is yellow.\n\n#### Impairment losses\n\nThe Group makes a forward-looking assessment of the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments (expectedcredit-loss model).\n\nExpected credit loss (ECL) within the meaning of IFRS 9 is an estimate of credit loss over the expected lifetime of a financial asset accounted for at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), weighted for the probability of default. A credit loss is the difference between the contractual cash flows to which the Group is entitled and the cash flows expected by the Group. The expected credit loss takes into account the amount and timing of payments. Accordingly, a credit loss may also occur if the Group expects payment to be made in full, but later than the contractually agreed-upon date.\n\nThe Group distinguishes between the following types of financial assets that are subject to the ECL model: debt instruments measured at amortized cost and debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, on the one hand, and trade receivables and contract assets, on the other. Cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the IFRS 9 impairment rules. The identified impairment loss for the latter is immaterial.\n\nECL is generally measured at the level of individual items; in exceptional cases, such as groups of receivables with the same credit risk characteristics, it is measured collectively at portfolio level. The standard stipulates the three-stage general approach to determining credit loss for this process.\n\nIn accordance with the three-stage model, debt instruments measured at amortized cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income are initially recognized in Stage 1. The expected credit loss is equal to the loss that may occur due to possible default events in the 12 months following the reporting date. Financial assets that have experienced a significant increase in counterparty credit risk since initial recognition are transferred from Stage 1 to Stage 2. A significant increase includes situations in which debtors are no longer able to meet their payment obligations at short notice or when it appears that the debtor has experienced an actual or expected deterioration in business performance. The credit risk can then be measured using the probability of default (PD) over the instrument's lifetime (lifetime PD). The impairment loss is equivalent to the loss that may occur due to possible default events during the remaining term of the financial asset. Assets must be transferred from Stage 1 to Stage 2 when the contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. In cases where contractual payments from a debt instrument are more than 90 days past due, there is revocable reason to believe that there is objective evidence of a credit loss because the debtor is experiencing significant financial difficulties. The debt instrument is then to be transferred to Stage 3.\n\nListed debt instruments measured at amortized cost are assigned to Stage 1 of the three-stage model if an investment-grade rating exists from at least one major rating agency. The impairment loss recognized in the period is equal to the loss that may occur due to possible default events in the twelve months following the reporting date.\n\nTrade receivables and contract assets are generally short term in nature and contain no significant financing components. According to the simplified impairment approach in IFRS 9, a loss allowance in an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses must be recognized for all instruments, regardless of their credit quality. The Group calculates the expected credit loss using impairment tables for the individual divisions. The loss estimate, documented by way of loss rates, encompasses all of the available information, including historical data, current economic conditions and reliable forecasts of future economic conditions (macroeconomic factors).\n\nImpairment losses are offset against gains on the reversal of impairment losses. Further details are presented in **[note 43.](#page-195-0)** \n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/143/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Derivatives and hedges\n\nThe Group began to apply the IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirements as of January 1, 2020. Derivative hedging instruments are used to minimize variations in earnings due to payments in foreign currencies, variable-rate borrowing and for planned commodity purchases. The gains and losses from the underlying and hedging transactions are recognized simultaneously in total comprehensive income (hedge accounting). The Group has designated cash flow hedges due to the existing risks.\n\nA cash flow hedge hedges the fluctuations in future cash flows from recognized assets and liabilities (in the case of interest rate risks), highly probable forecast transactions as well as unrecognized firm commitments that entail a currency risk. The effective portion of a cash flow hedge designated as a hedge is recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve in other comprehensive income. If the option (forward element and currency basis spreads) is applied to the cost of hedging recognition, or the fair value of an option has not been designated, effective changes in value from the nondesignated portions are recognized in the cost of hedging reserve as a component of the hedging reserve in other comprehensive income. IFRS 9 allows the alternative of designating either the full or the intrinsic value of an option as a hedging instrument. The fair value of an option is considered the cost of the hedge. If only the intrinsic value of an option is designated as a hedging instrument, changes to the fair value of the option must be recognized in other comprehensive income as cost of hedging in the cost of hedging reserve and reclassified on a reasonable basis when the hedged item occurs. Similar to the intrinsic value of an option, it is permissible to only designate the spot component of a forward transaction as a hedging instrument. In this case, there is an option to also recognize the effective and cumulative fair value changes of the forward component and the foreign-currency spread in the cost of hedging reserve. Ineffective portions resulting from changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognized directly in income. The gains and losses generated by the hedging transactions are initially recognized in equity and are then reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the financial asset acquired or financial liability assumed affects profit or loss. If a hedge of a firm commitment subsequently results in the recognition of a nonfinancial asset, the gains and losses recognized directly in equity are included in the initial carrying amount of the asset (basis adjustment).\n\nNet investment hedges in foreign entities are treated in the same way as cash flow hedges. The gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income, while the gain or loss attributable to the ineffective portion is recognized directly in the income statement. The gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income remain there until the disposal or partial disposal, or an impairment loss, of the net investment.\n\n#### Recognition and derecognition\n\nRegular-way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized as of the settlement date, with the exception of derivatives, in particular. A financial asset is derecognized when the rights to receive the cash flows from the asset have expired or have been transferred, and the Group has transferred essentially all risks and opportunities of ownership. Financial liabilities are derecognized if the payment obligations arising from them have expired.\n\n#### Power purchase agreements\n\nDHL Group concludes long-term contracts for the provision of electricity from renewable sources (e.g., wind and solar power) to reduce its carbon footprint (power purchase agreements) and to hedge against fluctuating prices. If the contracts are concluded for the company's own use, they are treated as executory contracts (own-use exemption) and not accounted for as derivatives.\n\n#### Offsetting\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset on the basis of netting agreements (master netting arrangements) only if there is an enforceable right of offset and settlement on a net basis is intended as of the reporting date.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/144/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of three stylized letters with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nIf the right of offset is not enforceable in the normal course of business, the financial assets and liabilities are recognized in the balance sheet at their gross amounts as of the reporting date. The master netting arrangement then creates only a conditional right of offset.\n\n#### Investment property\n\nIn accordance with IAS 40, investment property is property held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for use in the supply of services, for administrative purposes or for sale in the normal course of the company's business. It is measured in accordance with the cost model. Depreciable investment property is depreciated over a period of between 20 and 50 years using the straight-line method. The fair value is determined on the basis of expert opinions. Impairment losses are recognized in accordance with the principles described in the **[impairment](https://dhl-reporting-hub-next.ryze-cloud.de/fy-2023/en/consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements-of-deutsche-post-ag/basis-of-preparation/ bzw. gleiche Seite: Impairment losses | id=\"headline-12074\")** section.\n\n#### Inventories\n\nInventories are assets that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business, are in the process of production or are consumed in the production process or in the rendering of services. They are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Impairment losses are charged for obsolete inventories and slow-moving goods.\n\n#### Government grants\n\nIn accordance with IAS 20, government grants are recognized at their fair value only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with and that the grants will be received. The grants are reported in the income statement and are generally recognized as income over the periods in which the costs they are intended to compensate for are incurred. Where the grants relate to the purchase or production of assets, they are reported as deferred income and recognized in the income statement over the useful lives of the assets. Such deferred income is presented in other operating income.\n\n#### Assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale\n\nAssets held for sale are assets available for sale in their present condition and whose sale is highly probable. The sale must be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year of the date of classification. Assets held for sale may consist of individual noncurrent assets, groups of assets (disposal groups), components of an entity or a subsidiary acquired exclusively for resale (discontinued operations). Liabilities intended to be disposed of together with the assets in a single transaction form part of the disposal group or discontinued operation and are also reported separately as liabilities associated with assets held for sale. Assets held for sale are no longer depreciated or amortized, but are recognized at the lower of their fair value less costs to sell and the carrying amount. Gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of individual noncurrent assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale are reported in profit or loss from continuing operations until the final date of disposal. Gains and losses arising from the measurement at fair value less costs to sell of discontinued operations classified as held for sale are reported in profit or loss from discontinued operations. This also applies to the profit or loss from operations and the gain or loss on disposal of these components of an entity.\n\n#### Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash, demand deposits and other short-term liquid financial assets with an original maturity of up to three months; they are measured at amortized cost. Overdraft facilities used are recognized in the balance sheet as amounts due to banks.\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/145/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Noncontrolling interests\n\nNoncontrolling interests are the proportionate minority interests in the equity of subsidiaries and are recognized at their carrying amount. If an interest is acquired from, or sold to, other shareholders without affecting the existing control relationship, this is presented as an equity transaction. The difference between the proportionate net assets acquired from, or sold to, other shareholders and the purchase price is recognized in other comprehensive income. If noncontrolling interests are increased by the proportionate net assets, no goodwill is allocated to the proportionate net assets.\n\n#### Share-based payments to executives\n\nEquity-settled share-based payment transactions are measured at fair value as of the grant date. The fair value of the obligation is recognized in staff costs over the vesting period. The fair value of equity-settled share-based payment transactions is determined using internationally recognized valuation techniques.\n\nCash-settled share-based payments (stock appreciation rights, SARs) are measured on the basis of an option pricing model in accordance with IFRS 2. The stock appreciation rights are measured on each reporting date and on the settlement date. The amount determined for stock appreciation rights that will probably be exercised is recognized pro rata in income under staff costs, to reflect the services rendered as consideration during the vesting period (lockup period). A provision is recognized for the same amount. Changes in value due to share price movements occurring after the grant date are recognized as other finance costs in net finance costs.\n\n#### Retirement benefit plans\n\nThere are arrangements (plans) in many countries under which the Group grants post-employment benefits to its employees. These benefits include pensions, lump-sum payments on retirement and other post-employment benefits and are referred to in these disclosures as retirement benefits, pensions and similar benefits, or pensions. A distinction must be made between defined benefit and defined contribution plans.\n\n#### The Group's defined benefit retirement plan\n\nDefined benefit obligations are measured using the projected unit credit method prescribed by IAS 19. This involves making certain actuarial assumptions. Most of the defined benefit retirement plans are at least partly funded via external plan assets. The remaining net liabilities are funded by provisions for pensions and similar obligations; net assets are presented separately as pension assets. Where necessary, an asset ceiling must be applied when recognizing pension assets. With regard to the cost components, the service cost is recognized in staff costs, net interest cost in net finance costs and the remeasurements outside the income statement in other comprehensive income. Any rights to reimbursement are reported separately in financial assets.\n\n#### Defined contribution retirement plans for civil-servant employees in Germany\n\nIn accordance with statutory provisions, Deutsche Post AG pays contributions for civil-servant employees in Germany to retirement plans that are defined contribution retirement plans for the company. These contributions are recognized in staff costs.\n\nUnder the provisions of the *Gesetz zum Personalrecht der Beschäftigten der früheren Deutschen Bundespost* (PostPersRG – Former Deutsche Bundespost Employees Act), Deutsche Post AG provides retirement benefits and assistance benefits through the *Postbeamtenversorgungskasse* (PVK – Postal civil-servant pension fund) at the *Bundesanstalt für Post und Telekommunikation* (BAnst PT – German federal post and telecommunications agency) to retired employees or their surviving dependents who are entitled to benefits on the basis of a civil-service appointment. The amount of Deutsche Post AG's payment obligations is governed by Section 16 PostPersRG. This act obliges Deutsche Post AG to pay into the PVK an annual contribution of 33% of the gross compensation of its active civil servants and the notional gross compensation of civil servants on leave of absence who are eligible for a pension.\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/146/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font size, also in red. The background of the image is yellow.\n\nUnder Section 16 PostPersRG, the federal government makes good the difference between the current payment obligations of the PVK, on the one hand, and the funding companies' current contributions or other return on assets, on the other, and guarantees that the PVK is able to meet the obligations it has assumed in respect of its funding companies at all time. Insofar as the federal government makes payments to the PVK under the terms of this guarantee, it cannot claim reimbursement from Deutsche Post AG.\n\n#### Defined contribution retirement plans for the Group's hourly workers and salaried employees\n\nDefined contribution retirement plans are in place for the Group's hourly workers and salaried employees, particularly in the United Kingdom, the United States and the Netherlands. The contributions to these plans are also reported in staff costs.\n\nThis also includes contributions to certain multiemployer plans that are basically defined benefit plans, especially in the United States and the Netherlands. However, the relevant institutions do not provide the participating companies with sufficient information to use defined benefit accounting. The plans are therefore accounted for as if they were defined contribution plans.\n\nRegarding these multiemployer plans in the United States, contributions are made based on collective agreements between the employer and the local union, with the involvement of the pension fund. There is no employer liability to any of the plans beyond the bargained contribution rates except in the event of a withdrawal meeting specified criteria, which could then include a liability for other entities' obligations as governed by US federal law. The expected employer contributions to the funds for 2024 are €79 million (actual employer contributions in the reporting period: €81 million, in the previous year: €81 million). Some of the plans in which DHL Group participates are underfunded according to information provided by the funds. No information is available to the Group that would indicate any change from the contribution rates set by current collective agreements. In addition, the potential financial risks in conjunction with underfunded joint plans were implicitly reduced through measures taken by the US government. DHL Group does not represent a significant level to any fund in terms of contributions, with the exception of one fund where the Group represents the largest employer in terms of contributions.\n\nContribution rates for one multiemployer retirement plan in the Netherlands are determined each year by the management body of the pension fund with the involvement of the central bank of the Netherlands, based on cost coverage. These contribution rates are the same for all employers and employees involved. There is no liability for the employer toward the fund beyond the contributions set, even in the case of withdrawal or obligations not met by other entities. Any subsequent underfunding ultimately results in the rights of members being cut and/or no indexation of their rights. The expected employer contributions to the fund for 2024 are €36 million (actual employer contributions in the reporting period: €33 million, in the previous year: €31 million). As of December 31, 2023, the coverage degree of plan funding was above a required minimum of approximately 105%, according to information provided by the fund. DHL Group does not represent a significant portion of the fund in terms of contributions.\n\n#### Other provisions\n\nOther provisions are recognized for all legal or constructive obligations to third parties existing as of the reporting date that have arisen as a result of past events, that are expected to result in an outflow of future economic benefits and whose amount can be measured reliably. They represent uncertain obligations that are carried at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. Provisions with more than one year to maturity are discounted at market rates of interest that reflect the region and time to settlement of the obligation. The discount rates used in the fiscal year were between 0.25% and 10.50% (previous year: 0.00% to 10.75%). The effects arising from changes in interest rates are recognized under other operating income or expenses.\n\nProvisions for restructuring are only established in accordance with the aforementioned criteria for recognition if a detailed, formal restructuring plan has been drawn up and communicated to those affected.\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/147/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of three stylized letters. To the left of the letters are three horizontal red lines. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nTechnical reserves (insurance) consist mainly of outstanding-loss reserves and IBNR (incurred but not reported) reserves. Outstanding-loss reserves represent estimates of obligations in respect of actual claims or known incidents expected to give rise to claims that have been reported to the company but have yet to be finalized and presented for payment. Outstanding-loss reserves are based on individual claim valuations carried out by the company or its ceding insurers. IBNR reserves represent estimates of obligations in respect of incidents taking place on or before the reporting date that have not been reported to the company. Such reserves also include provisions for potential errors in settling outstanding-loss reserves. The company carries out its own assessment of ultimate loss liabilities using actuarial methods and also commissions an independent actuarial study of these each year in order to verify the reasonableness of its estimates.\n\n#### Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are carried at fair value less transaction costs on initial recognition. The price determined in an efficient and liquid market or a fair value determined using the treasury risk management system deployed within the Group is taken as the fair value. Financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost in subsequent periods. Any differences between the amount received and the amount repayable are recognized in the income statement over the term of the loan using the effective interest method. Disclosures on financial liabilities under leases can be found in the **[leases](https://dhl-reporting-hub-next.ryze-cloud.de/fy-2023/en/consolidated-financial-statements/notes-to-the-consolidated-financial-statements-of-deutsche-post-ag/basis-of-preparation/ bzw. gleiche Seite: Leases | id=\"headline-12038\")** section.\n\n#### Convertible bond on Deutsche Post AG shares\n\nThe convertible bond on Deutsche Post AG shares is split into an equity and a debt component, in line with the contractual arrangements. The debt component, less the transaction costs, is reported under financial liabilities (bonds), with interest added back up to the issue amount over the term of the bond using the effective interest method (unwinding of the discount). The value of the call option, which allows Deutsche Post AG to redeem the bond early if a specified share price is reached, is attributed to the debt component in accordance with IAS 32.31. The conversion right is classified as an equity component and is reported in capital reserves. The carrying amount is calculated by assigning to the conversion right the residual value that results from deducting the amount calculated separately for the debt component from the fair value of the instrument as a whole. The transaction costs are deducted on a proportionate basis.\n\n#### Liabilities\n\nTrade payables are carried at amortized cost. Most of the trade payables have a maturity of less than one year. The fair value of the liabilities corresponds more or less to their carrying amount. Group companies use reverse-factoring programs for supplier financing. As part of this, suppliers conclude financing agreements with financial institutions without the involvement of DHL Group. If they wish, suppliers can receive invoice amounts less an interest component prior to the original due date on the basis of these agreements. DHL Group pays the invoice amounts to the respective financial institutions when they come due. Because the programs do not lead to any substantial modification of the conditions of payment between DHL Group and the suppliers, and payment terms are within the normal industry range, the corresponding accounts payable are still reported under trade payables. The payments to the financial institutions are reported in the operating cash flow.\n\n#### Deferred taxes\n\nIn accordance with IAS 12, deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the IFRS financial statements and the tax basis of the individual entities. Deferred tax assets also include tax reduction claims that arise from the expected future utilization of existing tax loss carryforwards and that are likely to be realized. The recoverability of the tax reduction claims is assessed on the basis of each entity's earnings projections, which are derived from the Group projections and take any tax adjustments and effects on earnings from the reversal of taxable temporary differences into account. The planning horizon is five years.\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/148/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font size, also in red. The background of the image is yellow.\n\nIn compliance with IAS 12.24(b) and IAS 12.15(b), deferred tax assets or liabilities were only recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the IFRS balance sheet and in the tax basis of Deutsche Post AG where the differences arose after January 1, 1995. No deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for temporary differences resulting from initial differences in the opening tax accounts of Deutsche Post AG as of January 1, 1995.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the tax rates applicable in the individual countries as of the reporting date or announced for the time when the deferred tax assets and liabilities are realized. The tax rate applied to German Group companies is unchanged at 30.5%. It comprises the corporation tax rate plus the solidarity surcharge, as well as a municipal trade tax rate that is calculated as the average of the different municipal trade tax rates. Foreign Group companies use their individual income tax rates to calculate deferred tax items. The income tax rates applied for foreign companies amount to up to 38% (previous year: 38%).\n\nThe Group applies the exception to the recognition and disclosure of information regarding deferred tax assets and liabilities in conjunction with income taxes for pillar two, as provided for in the amendments to IAS 12 published in May 2023.\n\n#### Income taxes\n\nIncome tax assets and liabilities are recognized when they are probable. They are measured at the amounts for which repayments from, or payments to, the tax authorities are expected to be received or made. If uncertain tax items are recognized because they are probable, they are measured at their most likely amount. Tax-related fines are recognized in income taxes if they are included in the calculation of income tax liabilities, due to their inclusion in the tax base and/or tax rate.\n\n#### Contingent liabilities\n\nContingent liabilities represent possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence, or nonoccurrence, of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the enterprise. Contingent liabilities also include certain obligations that will probably not lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits, or where the amount of the outflow of resources embodying economic benefits cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. In accordance with IAS 37, contingent liabilities are not recognized in the balance sheet.\n\n#### 8 Exercise of judgment in applying the accounting policies\n\nThe preparation of IFRS-compliant consolidated financial statements requires the exercise of judgment by management. All estimates are reassessed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and expectations with regard to future events that appear reasonable under the given circumstances. For example, this applies to assets held for sale. In this case, management must determine whether the assets are available for sale in their present condition and whether their sale is highly probable. If that is the case, the assets and associated liabilities must be measured and recognized as assets held for sale or liabilities associated with assets held for sale.\n\n#### Estimates and assessments made by management\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make certain assumptions and estimates that may affect the amounts of the assets and liabilities included in the balance sheet, the amounts of income and expenses, and the disclosures relating to contingent liabilities. Examples of the main areas where assumptions, estimates and the exercise of management judgment occur are the recognition of provisions for pensions and similar obligations, the calculation of discounted cash flows for impairment testing and purchase price allocations, taxes and legal proceedings.\n\nThe Group has operating activities around the globe and is subject to local tax laws. Management can exercise judgment when calculating the amounts of current and deferred taxes in the relevant countries. Although management believes that it has made a reasonable estimate relating to tax matters that are inherently uncertain, there can be no guarantee that the actual outcome of these uncertain tax matters will correspond exactly to the original estimate made. Any difference between actual events and the estimate made could have an effect on tax balance sheet items in the period in which the matter is finally decided. The amount recognized for deferred tax assets could be reduced if the estimates of planned taxable income or changes to current tax laws restrict the extent to which future tax benefits can be realized.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/149/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nGoodwill is regularly reported in the Group's balance sheet as a consequence of business combinations. When an acquisition is initially recognized in the consolidated financial statements, all identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are generally measured at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. One of the important estimates this requires is the determination of the fair values of these assets and liabilities as of the date of acquisition. Land, buildings and office equipment are generally valued by independent experts, while securities for which there is an active market are recognized at the quoted exchange price. If intangible assets are identified in the course of an acquisition, their measurement can be based on the opinion of an independent external expert valuer, depending on the type of intangible asset and the complexity involved in determining its fair value. The independent expert determines the fair value using appropriate valuation techniques, normally based on expected future cash flows. In addition to the assumptions about the development of future cash flows, these valuations are also significantly affected by the discount rates used.\n\nClimate change could give rise to uncertainties and risks for the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group. Extreme weather events could potentially lead to damage to property, plant and equipment. Increased restrictions imposed by law to combat climate change are expected in the coming years, including limits on air transport or access to city centers. In certain cases, this may also affect our existing business models and our ability to operate optimally. Climate-related risks can influence the useful lives of assets in different ways:\n\n- Physical changes in the climate such as the increased frequency and intensity of acute weather events (storms, fires and floods) as well as long-term trends such as rising temperatures can have an impact on assets.\n- Transitory changes in conjunction with decarbonization including political, legal, technological and market-related changes – can influence the useful lives and the values of our assets.\n\nIn particular, there are uncertainties with regard to the extent to which regulatory efforts in connection with the debate surrounding climate action will lead to higher costs. The current focus as part of the public debate and the climate action measures of DHL Group relate to CO2 emissions. DHL Group plans to reduce its logistics-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to below 29 million metric tons of CO2e by the year 2030. DHL Group wants to reduce the GHG emissions to net zero by 2050. To this end, additional costs – for emissions trading and sustainable fuels, among other things – were accounted for in the company's projections and thus included in the application of IAS 36 as well as in the impairment considerations for deferred tax assets. Other central elements of the planned reduction in CO2 emissions are the planned fleet modernization as well as the option for DHL Group customers to acquire CO2 offsets during the booking process.\n\nDHL Group does not currently see any climate-related indications for the adjustment of useful lives and residual values of aircraft and other items of property, plant and equipment. As part of determining the impairment loss on assets of property, plant and equipment, of intangible assets and of right-of-use assets, estimates are also made that relate to, among other factors, the cause, time and amount of the impairment. An impairment loss is based upon a number of factors. Management has to make significant estimates with regard to the identification and review of indications for an impairment, the estimate of future cash flows, the determination of fair values of assets (or groups of assets), the relevant discount rates, the respective useful lives and the residual values of the affected assets. Moreover, a loss allowance for financial assets has been established to account for expected credit losses resulting from customers' credit quality. Detailed information can be found under **[note 7 on expected credit loss and trade](#page-137-0)  [receivables.](#page-137-0)** Assessment of the appropriateness of the loss allowance is based on historical data and future macroeconomic key figures or the credit rating estimate for the respective customers on the basis of an external rating from the respective industry and the country in which the customer operates, **[note 43.](#page-195-0)** In the event of a deterioration of the credit quality of the customer, the scope of the derecognition (specific valuation allowances on receivables) actually carried out may exceed that of the loss allowance recognized.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/150/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nImpairment testing for goodwill is based on assumptions about the future. The Group carries out these tests annually and also whenever there are indications that goodwill has become impaired. The recoverable amount of the CGU must then be calculated. This amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Determining value in use requires assumptions and estimates to be made with respect to forecast future cash flows and the discount rate applied. Although management believes that the assumptions made for the purpose of calculating the recoverable amount are appropriate, possible unforeseeable changes in these assumptions – e.g., a reduction in the EBIT margin, an increase in the asset charge or a decline in the long-term growth rate – could result in an impairment loss that could negatively affect the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations, **[note 22.](#page-166-0)**\n\nFor the actuarial valuation of defined benefit retirement plans of the Group, actuarial assumptions are required that relate to, in particular, discount rates, expected rates of salary and pension increases and biometric probabilities. Generally accepted valuation methods are used to determine the fair value of plan assets – in particular, for assets without a market price quotation (e.g., real estate) – that require separate assumptions. If changes to these assumptions are necessary, this could have a material impact on the results of actuarial valuations, recognized carrying amounts and the future amount of retirement benefit expenses. Disclosures regarding the assumptions made in connection with the Group's defined benefit retirement plans can be found in **[note 37.](#page-181-0)**\n\nPending legal proceedings in which the Group is involved are disclosed in **[note 45.](#page-213-0)** The outcome of these proceedings could have a significant effect on the net assets, financial position and results of operations of the Group. Management regularly analyzes the information currently available about these proceedings and recognizes provisions for probable obligations including estimated legal costs. Internal and external legal advisers participate in making this assessment. In deciding on the necessity for a provision, management takes into account the probability of an unfavorable outcome and whether the amount of the obligation can be estimated with sufficient reliability. The fact that an action has been launched or a claim asserted against the Group, or that a legal dispute has been disclosed in the notes, does not necessarily mean that a provision is recognized for the associated risk.\n\nDHL Group considers itself to be exposed to an increasingly complex and uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. This includes potential increases in fuel, energy and gas prices, which can be at least partially compensated for or passed on to customers through strict cost management and the established levers such as price increases and price surcharge mechanisms. In addition, strong volatility is still expected on the goods and financial markets and in exchange rates, driven by rising interest and inflation rates. Moreover, the risk of a potential decline in global economic growth can be observed, which could lead to an increased number of customer bankruptcies.\n\nAll assumptions and estimates are based on the circumstances prevailing and assessments made as of the reporting date. For the purpose of estimating the future development of the business, a realistic assessment was also made at that date of the economic environment likely to apply in the future to the different sectors and regions in which the Group operates. In the event of developments in these economic parameters that diverge from the assumptions made, the actual amounts may differ from the estimated amounts. In such cases, the assumptions made and, where necessary, the carrying amounts of the relevant assets and liabilities are adjusted accordingly.\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/151/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in bold red letters with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. The word \"Group\" is in a smaller font and is located to the right and slightly below the DHL letters. The background is yellow.\n\nAs of the date of preparation of the consolidated financial statements, there is no indication that any significant change in the assumptions and estimates made will be required, so that on the basis of the information currently available, it is not expected that there will be significant adjustments in the 2024 fiscal year to the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities recognized in the financial statements.\n\n#### 9 Consolidation methods\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are based on the IFRS financial statements of Deutsche Post AG and the subsidiaries, joint operations and investments accounted for using the equity method included in the consolidated financial statements and prepared in accordance with uniform accounting policies as of December 31, 2023.\n\nAcquisition accounting for subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements uses the purchase method of accounting. The cost of the acquisition corresponds to the fair value of the assets given up, the equity instruments issued and the liabilities assumed at the transaction date. Acquisition-related costs are recognized as expenses. Contingent consideration is recognized at fair value as of the date of initial consolidation.\n\nThe assets and liabilities, as well as income and expenses, of joint operations are included in the consolidated financial statements in proportion to the interest held in these operations, in accordance with IFRS 11. Accounting for the joint operators' share of the assets and liabilities, as well as recognition and measurement of goodwill, use the same methods as applied to the consolidation of subsidiaries.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 28, joint ventures and companies on which the parent can exercise significant influence (associates) are accounted for in accordance with the equity method. Any goodwill is recognized under investments accounted for using the equity method.\n\nIn the case of step acquisitions, the equity portion previously held is remeasured at the fair value applicable as of the acquisition date, and the resulting gain or loss is recognized in the income statement.\n\nIntra-Group revenue, other operating income and expenses, as well as receivables, liabilities and provisions between companies that are consolidated or proportionately consolidated, are eliminated. Intercompany profits or losses from intra-Group deliveries and services not realized by sale to third parties are eliminated. Unrealized gains and losses from business transactions with investments accounted for using the equity method are eliminated on a proportionate basis.\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-152-0\"></span>Image /page/152/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

disclosures\n\nDHL Group reports five operating segments for the 2023 fiscal year; these are managed independently by the responsible segment management bodies in line with the products and services offered and the brands, distribution channels and customer profiles involved. Components of the entity are defined as a segment on the basis of the existence of segment managers with bottom-line responsibility who report directly to DHL Group's top management.\n\nExternal revenue is the revenue generated by the divisions from non-Group third parties. Internal revenue is revenue generated with other divisions. If comparable external market prices exist for services or products offered internally within the Group, these market prices or market-oriented prices are used as transfer prices (arm's-length principle). The transfer prices for services for which no external market exists are generally based on incremental costs.\n\nThe expenses for services provided in the IT service centers are allocated to the divisions by their origin. The additional costs resulting from Deutsche Post AG's universal postal service obligation (nationwide retail outlet network, delivery every working\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/154/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font, also in red. The background is yellow.\n\nIn keeping with internal reporting, capital expenditure (capex) is disclosed. Additions to intangible assets net of goodwill and to property, plant and equipment, including right-of-use assets, are reported in the capex figure. Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses relate to the segment assets allocated to the individual divisions. For reasons of transparency, net cash from/used in operating activities is now shown in segment reporting instead of in other noncash expenses and income, as previously.\n\nThe profitability of the Group's operating divisions is measured as profit from operating activities (EBIT).\n\n#### 10.2 Segments by division\n\nThe primary reporting format is based on the divisions, reflecting the Group's predominant organizational structure. The Group distinguishes between the following divisions:\n\n#### Express\n\nThe Express division offers time-definite courier and express services to business and private customers. The division comprises the Europe, Middle East and Africa, Americas and Asia Pacific regions.\n\n#### Global Forwarding, Freight\n\nThe Global Forwarding, Freight division comprises international air, ocean and overland freight forwarding services. The division's business units are Global Forwarding and Freight.\n\n#### Supply Chain\n\nThe Supply Chain division delivers customized logistics services and supply chain solutions to its customers based on globally standardized modular components including warehousing, transport and value-added services. The division comprises the Europe, Middle East and Africa, Americas and Asia Pacific regions.\n\n#### eCommerce\n\nThe eCommerce division is home to the Group's international parcel delivery business. The core business activities are domestic parcel delivery in selected countries in Europe, Asia and the United States and non-TDI cross-border services.\n\n#### Post & Parcel Germany\n\nThe Post & Parcel Germany division transports, sorts and delivers documents and goods in and outside of Germany. Its business units are called Post Germany, Parcel Germany and International.\n\nIn addition to the reported segments shown above, segment reporting comprises the following categories:\n\n#### Group Functions\n\nGroup Functions includes Corporate Center, Global Business Services (GBS) and Customer Solutions & Innovation (CSI). The profit/loss generated by GBS is allocated to the operating segments, while its assets and liabilities remain with GBS (asymmetrical allocation).\n\n#### Consolidation\n\nThe data for the divisions is presented following consolidation of interdivisional transactions. The transactions between the divisions are eliminated in the Consolidation column.\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/155/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters. There are three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. The word \"Group\" is in red and is located below the right side of the DHL letters. The background is yellow.\n\n#### 10.3 Information about geographical regions\n\nThe main geographical regions in which the Group is active are Germany, Europe (excluding Germany), the Americas, Asia Pacific, and Middle East and Africa. External revenue, noncurrent assets and capex are disclosed for these regions. Revenue, assets and capex are allocated to the individual regions on the basis of the domicile of the reporting entity. Noncurrent assets comprise intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and other noncurrent assets (excluding pension assets).\n\n#### 10.4 Reconciliation of segment amounts to consolidated amounts\n\nThe following table shows the reconciliation of DHL Group's total assets to the segment assets. Financial asset components, income tax assets, deferred taxes, cash and cash equivalents and other asset components are deducted.\n\n#### RECONCILIATION TO SEGMENT ASSETS\n\n| €m                                   | 20221         | 2023          |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Total equity and liabilities         | 68,476        | 66,814        |\n| Investment property                  | -22           | -13           |\n| Noncurrent financial assets          | -1,040        | -944          |\n| Other noncurrent assets              | -355          | -154          |\n| Deferred tax assets                  | -1,440        | -1,453        |\n| Income tax assets                    | -456          | -663          |\n| Receivables and other current assets | -15           | -17           |\n| Current financial assets             | -1,313        | -348          |\n| Cash and cash equivalents            | -3,790        | -3,649        |\n| <b>Segment assets</b>                | <b>60,045</b> | <b>59,573</b> |\n| of which Group Functions             | 5,795         | 5,734         |\n| Total for reported segments          | 54,314        | 53,900        |\n| Consolidation2                       | -64           | -61           |\n\n1 Prior-year figures adjusted, **[note 4.](#page-133-0)**\n\n2 Including rounding.\n\nThe following table shows the reconciliation of DHL Group's total liabilities to the segment liabilities.

Among other factors, the normalization of freight rates in the Global Forwarding, Freight division contributed to this development. Business in the Express division was shaped by declining volume development. In addition, currency effects and lower fuel surcharges had a reducing effect on revenue. Meanwhile, revenue in the Supply Chain and eCommerce divisions increased due to new business and contract extensions. In the Post & Parcel Germany division, revenue growth in the Parcel Germany business unit compensated for the declining business in the Post Germany area, which is hampered by ongoing structural transition.\n\nThe contract liabilities recognized at the beginning of the fiscal year primarily led to revenue in the fiscal year.\n\nThe following table shows the factors affecting revenue:\n\n#### FACTORS AFFECTING REVENUE\n\n| €m                              | 2023    |\n|---------------------------------|---------|\n| Organic growth                  | -10,687 |\n| Portfolio changes               | 693     |\n| Currency translation effects    | -2,684  |\n| Total revenue increase/decrease | -12,678 |\n\nThe allocation of revenue to geographical regions is presented in the segment reporting.\n\n#### 12 Other operating income\n\n| €m                                           | 2022  | 2023  |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Income from currency translation             | 696   | 452   |\n| Insurance-related income                     | 340   | 403   |\n| Income from the reversal of provisions       | 214   | 353   |\n| Income from the remeasurement of liabilities | 284   | 348   |\n| Operating lease income                       | 150   | 209   |\n| Income from fees and reimbursements          | 133   | 130   |\n| Income from the disposal of assets           | 175   | 88    |\n| Income from prior-period billings            | 54    | 66    |\n| Subsidies                                    | 72    | 48    |\n| Sublease income                              | 87    | 42    |\n| Miscellaneous other operating income         | 720   | 648   |\n| Total                                        | 2,925 | 2,787 |\n\nOther operating income fell short of the prior-year figure. The reduction in income from currency translation was partially compensated for by the increased income from the reversal of provisions and by higher income from the remeasurement of liabilities.\n\nIncome from operating leases was attributable mainly to leasing of the aircraft fleet's cargo space.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-158-0\"></span>Image /page/158/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

In accordance with IAS 12.15(b) and IAS 12.24(b), the Group did not recognize any deferred tax assets in respect of these temporary differences, which related mainly to property, plant and equipment as well as to pension provisions and similar obligations. As of December 31, 2023, there were no remaining tax-deductible temporary differences between the original IFRS carrying amounts and the tax base (previous year: €99 million).\n\nEffects from deferred tax assets not recognized for tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences in the amount of €38 million (previous year: €3 million) relate to the reduction of the effective income tax expense due to the utilization of tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences, for which deferred tax assets had previously not been recognized. In addition, the recognition of deferred tax assets previously not recognized for tax loss carryforwards and of deductible temporary differences from a prior period reduced the deferred tax expense by €100 million (previous year: €274 million). Effects from unrecognized deferred tax assets do not include any effects (previous year: income of €12 million) due to a reversal or impairment loss recognized for a deferred tax asset. Other effects from unrecognized deferred tax assets relate primarily to tax loss carryforwards for which no deferred taxes were recognized.

As part of this, as of December 31, 2022, internally generated intangible assets increased by €18 million, purchased brand names by €6 million and purchased customer lists by €17 million, while goodwill fell by €16 million, **[note 2](#page-128-0) [and 4.](#page-133-0)**\n\nPurchased software, concessions, industrial rights, licenses and similar rights and assets are reported under purchased intangible assets. Internally generated intangible assets relate to development costs for internally developed software.\n\n#### 22.2 Allocation of goodwill to CGUs\n\nFor the purposes of annual impairment testing in accordance with IAS 36, the Group determines the recoverable amount of a CGU, or a group of CGUs, on the basis of its value in use. This calculation is based on projections of free cash flows that are initially discounted at a rate corresponding to the posttax cost of capital. Pretax discount rates are determined iteratively.\n\n#### ALLOCATION OF GOODWILL\n\n| €m                         | Dec. 31, 20221 | Dec. 31, 2023 |\n|----------------------------|----------------|---------------|\n| Express                    | 3,913          | 3,900         |\n| Global Forwarding, Freight |                |               |\n| Global Forwarding          | 5,329          | 5,426         |\n| Freight                    | 280            | 281           |\n| Supply Chain               | 2,079          | 2,098         |\n| eCommerce                  | 159            | 430           |\n| Post & Parcel Germany      | 954            | 951           |\n| Total goodwill             | 12,714         | 13,086        |\n\n1 Prior-year figures adjusted, **[note 4](#page-133-0)**.\n\nThe cash flow projections are based on the detailed planning for EBIT, depreciation and amortization, investment planning adopted by management, as well as changes in net working capital, and take both internal historical data and external macroeconomic data into account. The cash flow forecasts include the expenses for decarbonization measures planned to achieve the targets for reducing emissions by 2030 for expanding the use of sustainable fuels and technologies in fleets and buildings. As part of the planning for the Post & Parcel Germany CGU, assumptions regarding the regulations of the German Postal Act, which is currently undergoing revision, were taken into account on the basis of the draft legislation. If there are changes to the draft legislation, if it is not possible to withdraw from the provision of the universal postal service, or if the new law is not passed in a timely manner, these represent material risk factors; however, the probability of their occurrence is considered to be low. From a methodological perspective, the detailed planning phase covers a three-year planning horizon from 2024 to 2026. By contrast, an extended planning phase of five years was applied for the eCommerce CGU. The eCommerce division is only in its sixth year of existence and has not yet reached a steady state. This is attributable to relatively high levels of planned capital expenditure over the next three years, during which the estimated EBIT will not yet reflect business growth. The expectation is that a stable state will be achieved in 2028. Planning is supplemented by a perpetual annuity representing the value added from 2027 onward, or following the extended planning phase. This is calculated using a long-term growth rate, which is determined for each CGU or each CGU group separately and is shown in the table below. The growth rates applied are based on long-term real growth figures for the relevant economies, growth expectations for the relevant sectors and long-term inflation forecasts for the countries in which the CGU or CGU group operates. The cash flow forecasts are based both on past experience and on the effects of the anticipated future general market trend. In addition, the forecasts take into account growth in the respective geographical submarkets and in global trade, and the ongoing trend toward outsourcing logistics activities. Cost trend forecasts for the transport network and services also have an impact on value in use. A key planning assumption for the impairment test is the EBIT margin for the perpetual annuity.\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/168/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nThe pretax cost of capital is based on the weighted average cost of capital. The (pretax) discount rates for the significant CGU or CGU group and the growth rates assumed in each case for the perpetual annuity are shown in the following table:\n\n|                            |  | Discount rate |      | Growth rate |      |\n|----------------------------|--|---------------|------|-------------|------|\n| %                          |  | 2022          | 2023 | 2022        | 2023 |\n| Express                    |  | 9.7           | 11.8 | 2.0         | 2.0  |\n| Global Forwarding, Freight |  |               |      |             |      |\n| Global Forwarding          |  | 9.9           | 10.9 | 2.5         | 2.5  |\n| Freight                    |  | 10.2          | 11.1 | 2.0         | 2.0  |\n| Supply Chain               |  | 10.0          | 10.0 | 2.5         | 2.5  |\n| eCommerce                  |  | 10.5          | 10.9 | 1.5         | 1.5  |\n| Post & Parcel Germany      |  | 10.2          | 10.0 | 0.5         | 0.5  |\n\nThe change in the discount rate primarily reflects the change in interest rates in general.\n\nOn the basis of these assumptions and the impairment tests carried out for the individual CGUs or CGU groups to which goodwill was allocated, it was established that the recoverable amounts for all CGUs or CGU groups exceed their carrying amounts. No impairment losses were recognized on goodwill in any of the CGUs or CGU groups as of December 31, 2023.\n\nWhen performing the impairment test, DHL Group conducted sensitivity analyses for the significant CGUs or CGU groups in accordance with IAS 36.134 for potential changes to the EBIT margin, the discount rate and the growth rate. These analyses – which included varying the essential valuation parameters within an appropriate range – did not reveal any risk of impairment to goodwill.\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-169-0\"></span>Image /page/169/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The additional expenditure for investments in technologies for making new buildings climate-neutral amounted to €38 million (previous year: €24 million).\n\nAdvance payments relate only to advance payments on items of property, plant and equipment for which the Group has paid advances in connection with incomplete transactions. They relate, in particular, to the renewal of the Express air fleet. Assets under development relate to items of property, plant and equipment in progress as of the reporting date for whose production internal or third-party costs have already been incurred.\n\n#### 24 Investment property\n\nThe investment property largely comprises leased property encumbered by heritable building rights and developed and undeveloped land.\n\n| €m                                 | 2022 | 2023 |\n|------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Cost                               |      |      |\n| Balance as of January 1            | 71   | 31   |\n| Additions                          | 8    | 0    |\n| Reclassifications                  | -44  | -9   |\n| Disposals                          | -4   | -2   |\n| Currency translation differences   | 0    | -1   |\n| Balance as of December 31          | 31   | 19   |\n| Depreciation and impairment losses |      |      |\n| Balance as of January 1            | 23   | 9    |\n| Depreciation and impairment losses | 1    | 1    |\n| Disposals                          | -3   | -1   |\n| Reclassifications                  | -12  | -2   |\n| Currency translation differences   | 0    | -1   |\n| Balance as of December 31          | 9    | 6    |\n| Carrying amount as of December 31  | 22   | 13   |\n| of which right-of-use assets       | 9    | 8    |\n\n#### 25 Investments accounted for using the equity method\n\nIn the income statement, net income from investments accounted for using the equity method increased by €200 million to €161 million. This was due to income from the change in consolidation method for DHL Logistics (formerly Danzas AEI Emirates) in the amount of €114 million, as well as proceeds from the disposal of 0.88% of shares in Global-E Online, Israel, totaling €46 million. The following table does not include this amount, because the former Danzas AEI Emirates is no longer accounted for using the equity method.\n\nThe table below is an overview of the carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements and selected financial data for those companies that, both individually and in the aggregate, are not of material significance for the Group.\n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/171/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Another addition to associates is RailDirect LLC, United Arab Emirates, with 49% of shares, while the addition of the Polish company APM Solutions Sp. z o.o. with 49% of shares is allocated to joint ventures. Among others, disposals of associates relate to DHL Logistics (formerly Danzas AEI Emirates LLC), as the method of consolidation changed with the acquisition of the remaining 60% of shares.

A wide variety of other defined benefit retirement plans in the Group are to be found in the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United States and a large number of other countries. There are specific risks associated with these plans along with measures to mitigate them.\n\n#### 37.1 Plan features\n\n#### Germany\n\nIn Germany, Deutsche Post AG has an occupational retirement benefit arrangement based on a collective agreement, which is open to new hourly workers and salaried employees. Depending on the weekly working hours and wage/salary group, retirement benefit components are calculated annually for each hourly worker and salaried employee and credited to an individual pension account. A 2.5% increase on the previous year is included in every newly allocated component. When the statutory pension falls due, the hourly workers and salaried employees can choose whether to receive payment as a lump sum or in installments, or lifelong monthly benefit payments that increase by 1% each year. The large majority of Deutsche Post AG's obligations relates to vested entitlements of hourly workers and salaried employees from a previous agreement, and to legacy pension commitments toward former hourly workers and salaried employees who have left or retired from the company. In addition, retirement benefit arrangements are available to executives below the Board of Management level and to specific employee groups through deferred compensation, in particular. For information on the pension scheme for the Board of Management, see **[note 47.2.](#page-218-0)**\n\nThe prime source of external funding for Deutsche Post AG's respective retirement benefit obligations is a contractual trust arrangement, which also includes a pension fund. The trust is funded on a case-by-case basis in line with the Group's finance strategy. In the case of the pension fund, the regulatory funding requirements can, in principle, be met without additional employer contributions. Part of the plan assets consists of real estate that is leased out to the Group on a long-term basis. In addition, *Versorgungsanstalt der Deutschen Bundespost* (VAP – Deutsche Bundespost institution for supplementary retirement pensions), a shared pension fund for successor companies to Deutsche Bundespost, is used for some of the legacy pension commitments.\n\nIndividual subsidiaries in Germany have defined-benefit retirement plans that were acquired in the context of acquisitions and transfers of operations and that are closed to new entrants. Contractual trust arrangements are in place for two subsidiaries for external funding.\n\n#### United Kingdom\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Group's defined benefit pension arrangements are closed to new entrants and for further service accrual.\n\nThe Group's defined benefit pension arrangements in the United Kingdom have mainly been consolidated into a Group plan with different sections for the participating divisions. These are funded mainly via a Group trust.

Normal contribution amounts no longer accrue because the arrangements have been closed.\n\n#### Other\n\nIn the Netherlands, collective agreements require that those employees who are not covered by a sector-specific plan participate in a dedicated defined benefit retirement plan. The dedicated plan provides for annual accruals that are subject to a pensionable salary cap. The plan provides for monthly benefit payments that are indexed in line with inflation, on the one hand, and the funds available for such indexation, on the other. In Switzerland, employees receive an occupational pension in line with statutory requirements, where pension payments depend on the contributions paid, an interest rate that is fixed each year, certain annuity factors and any pension increases specified. A separate plan providing for lump-sum payments instead of lifelong pension payments exists for specific higher wage components. In the United States, the companies' defined benefit retirement plans have been closed to new entrants and accrued entitlements have been frozen.\n\nThe Group companies fund their dedicated defined benefit retirement plans in these three countries primarily by using respective joint funding institutions. In the Netherlands and in Switzerland, both employers and employees contribute to plan funding. In the United States, no regularly recurring contributions are currently made in this regard – with the exception of some limited employer deficit contributions that were resumed in the year under review.\n\n{183}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/183/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The background of the image is yellow.\n\nThe discount rates for defined benefit obligations in the eurozone and the United Kingdom were each derived from an individual yield curve comprising the yields of AA-rated corporate bonds and taking into account membership composition and duration. For other countries, the discount rate for defined benefit obligations was determined in a similar way, provided there was a deep market for AA-rated (or, in some cases, AA- and AAA-rated) corporate bonds. By contrast, government bond yields were used for countries without a deep market for such corporate bonds.\n\nFor the annual pension increase in Germany, fixed rates in particular must be taken into account, in addition to the assumptions shown. The effective weighted average therefore amounts to approximately 1.00% (previous year: 1.00%).\n\nThe most significant demographic assumptions made relate to life expectancy and/or mortality. For the Group companies in Germany, they are based on the HEUBECK-RICHTTAFELN 2018 G. Life expectancy for the retirement benefit plans in the United Kingdom was based mainly on the S3NMA\\_H/S3PFA\\_H tables of the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, adjusted to reflect plan-specific mortality according to the latest funding valuation. Future mortality improvements were taken into account based on the current CMI projections model and an updated long-term trend assumption. For other countries, their own country-specific current standard mortality tables were used.\n\nIf one of the significant financial assumptions were to change, the present value of the defined benefit obligations would change as follows:\n\n|                                   | Change in<br>assumption<br>percentage<br>points |         | Change in present value<br>of defined benefit obligations<br>% |        |        |  |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--|\n|                                   |                                                 | Germany | United Kingdom                                                 | Other  | Total  |  |\n| December 31, 2023                 |                                                 |         |                                                                |        |        |  |\n| Discount rate                     | 1.00                                            | -10.43  | -10.50                                                         | -12.91 | -10.90 |  |\n| (defined benefit obligations)     | -1.00                                           | 12.94   | 12.75                                                          | 16.65  | 13.58  |  |\n| Expected annual                   | 0.50                                            | 0.09    | 0                                                              | 0.93   | 0.22   |  |\n| rate of future salary development | -0.50                                           | -0.09   | 0                                                              | -0.85  | -0.21  |  |\n| Expected annual                   | 0.50                                            | 0.28    | 4.17                                                           | 6.11   | 2.41   |  |\n| rate of future pension increase   | -0.50                                           | -0.26   | -4.08                                                          | -4.58  | -2.09  |  |\n| December 31, 2022                 |                                                 |         |                                                                |        |        |  |\n| Discount rate                     | 1.00                                            | -8.36   | -10.99                                                         | -12.95 | -9.93  |  |\n| (defined benefit obligations)     | -1.00                                           | 10.64   | 13.48                                                          | 16.72  | 12.54  |  |\n| Expected annual                   | 0.50                                            | 0.10    | n.a.                                                           | 0.91   | 0.22   |  |\n| rate of future salary development | -0.50                                           | -0.08   | n.a.                                                           | -0.82  | -0.19  |  |\n| Expected annual                   | 0.50                                            | 0.29    | 4.20                                                           | 6.11   | 2.43   |  |\n| rate of future pension increase   | -0.50                                           | -0.25   | -4.05                                                          | -4.67  | -2.11  |  |\n\nThese are effective weighted changes in the respective present value of the defined benefit obligations, for example taking into account the largely fixed nature of the pension increase for Germany.\n\nA one-year increase in life expectancy for a 65-year-old beneficiary would increase the present value of the defined benefit obligations by 4.16% in Germany (previous year: 3.95%) and by 2.31% in the United Kingdom (previous year: 3.19%). The corresponding increase for other countries would be 2.78% (previous year: 2.75%) and the total increase would be 3.41% (previous year: 3.52%).\n\n{186}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/186/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The background is yellow.\n\nWhen determining the sensitivity disclosures, the present values were calculated using the same methodology used to calculate the present values as of the reporting date. The presentation does not take into account interdependencies between the assumptions; rather, it supposes that the assumptions change in isolation. This would be unusual in practice, since assumptions are often correlated.\n\nThe weighted average duration of the Group's defined benefit obligations as of December 31, 2023, was 12.0 years in Germany (previous year: 9.8 years) and 12.1 years in the United Kingdom (previous year: 13.0 years). In the other countries it was 15.1 years (previous year: 16.1 years), and in total it was 12.6 years (previous year: 11.8 years).\n\nA total of 30.3% (previous year: 29.2%) of the present value of the defined benefit obligations was attributable to active beneficiaries, 19.5% (previous year: 19.3%) to formerly employed beneficiaries and 50.2% (previous year: 51.5%) to retirees.\n\n#### 37.4 Additional information on the fair value of plan assets\n\nThe fair value of the plan assets can be disaggregated as follows:\n\n|                           |         | United<br>Kingdom |       |        |\n|---------------------------|---------|-------------------|-------|--------|\n| €m                        | Germany |                   | Other | Total  |\n| December 31, 2023         |         |                   |       |        |\n| Equities                  | 1,015   | 78                | 779   | 1,872  |\n| Fixed-income securities   | 1,687   | 3,071             | 1,002 | 5,760  |\n| Real estate               | 1,746   | 246               | 341   | 2,333  |\n| Alternatives1             | 479     | 215               | 54    | 748    |\n| Insurances                | 501     | 0                 | 139   | 640    |\n| Cash                      | 218     | 67                | 20    | 305    |\n| Other                     | 9       | 281               | 51    | 341    |\n| Fair value of plan assets | 5,655   | 3,958             | 2,386 | 11,999 |\n| December 31, 2022         |         |                   |       |        |\n| Equities                  | 426     | 57                | 636   | 1,119  |\n| Fixed-income securities   | 855     | 3,053             | 1,018 | 4,926  |\n| Real estate               | 1,821   | 272               | 329   | 2,422  |\n| Alternatives1             | 481     | 255               | 50    | 786    |\n| Insurances                | 510     | 0                 | 132   | 642    |\n| Cash                      | 1,552   | 83                | 40    | 1,675  |\n| Other                     | 20      | 334               | 53    | 407    |\n| Fair value of plan assets | 5,665   | 4,054             | 2,258 | 11,977 |\n\n1 Primarily included absolute-return products and private-equity investments.\n\nQuoted market prices in an active market exist for around 60% (previous year: 58%) of the total fair values of plan assets. The remaining assets for which no such quoted market prices exist are attributable as follows: 17% (previous year: 18%) to real estate, 12% (previous year: 12%) to fixed income securities, 5% (previous year: 6%) to insurances, 3% (previous year: 3%) to alternatives and 3% (previous year: 3%) to other. The majority of the investments on the active markets are globally diversified, with certain country-specific focus areas.\n\nReal estate included in plan assets in Germany with a fair value of €1,615 million (previous year: €1,689 million) is occupied by DHL Group.\n\nIn the previous year, hedging measures resulted in a decrease in the proportion of equity and fixed-income holdings and an increase in the proportion of the cash holdings, particularly in Germany. In particular in Germany also, the investment of plan assets\n\n{187}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-187-0\"></span>Image /page/187/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nwas realigned in light of the changed capital market environment and the proportion of cash holdings was once again significantly reduced in the year under review.\n\nAsset-liability studies are performed at regular intervals in Germany and the United Kingdom, as well as, among other places, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United States, for the purpose of matching assets and liabilities; the strategic allocation of plan assets is adjusted accordingly. Strategic asset allocation for the respective plans is mainly carried out on the basis of the structure of the underlying obligations. As part of this, different strategies are pursued in some individual countries. These strategies include, among others, the comprehensive hedging of obligations (liability-driven investment) and securing future cash flows (cash-flowdriven investment). The common factor in the strategies is that they are determined in consideration of the respective regulatory framework and in consideration of return expectations and the risk-bearing ability of the company. Due to the plan-related derivation of the capital investment strategies in consideration of the specific economic parameters, there are significant differences in the alignment of the investments.\n\nESG criteria are taken into account in the management of pension assets, in particular as part of risk management and thus as part of the long-term direction of the investment strategy.\n\n#### 37.5 Risk\n\nSpecific risks are associated with the defined benefit retirement plans. This can result in a (negative or positive) change in DHL Group's equity through other comprehensive income, whose overall relevance is classed as medium to high. In contrast, a low relevance is attached to the short-term effects on staff costs and net finance costs. Potential risk mitigation is applied depending on the specifics of the plans.\n\n#### Interest rate risk\n\nA decrease (increase) in the respective discount rate would lead to an increase (decrease) in the present value of the total obligation and would in principle be accompanied by an increase (decrease) in the fair value of the fixed income securities contained in the plan assets. Further hedging measures are applied, in some cases using derivatives.\n\n#### Inflation risk\n\nPension obligations – especially relating to final salary schemes or schemes involving increases during the pension payment phase – can be linked directly or indirectly to changes in inflation. The risk of increasing inflation rates with regard to the present value of the defined benefit obligations has been mitigated in the case of Germany, for example, by switching to a system of retirement benefit components and, in the case of the United Kingdom, by closing the defined benefit arrangements. In addition, fixed rates of increase have been set and increases partially capped, and/or lump-sum payments have been provided for. There is also a positive correlation with interest rates.\n\n#### Investment risk\n\nThe investment is in principle subject to a large number of risks; in particular, it is exposed to the risk that market prices may change. This is managed primarily by ensuring broad diversification and the use of hedging instruments.\n\n#### Longevity risk\n\nLongevity risk may arise in connection with the benefits payable in the future due to a future increase in life expectancy. This is mitigated, in particular, by using current standard mortality tables when calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligations. The mortality tables used in Germany and the United Kingdom, for example, include an allowance for expected future increases in life expectancy.\n\n{188}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/188/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

A total of €30 million was added for the active early retirement program in the Post & Parcel Germany division. The increase in other employee benefits results primarily from higher additions to the obligations for partial retirement and pension plans in the United States compared to the previous year.\n\nTechnical reserves (insurance) consist mainly of outstanding-loss reserves and IBNR (incurred but not reported) reserves, **[note 7.](#page-137-0)** The provision for aircraft maintenance relates to obligations for major aircraft and engine maintenance by third-party companies. Of the tax provisions, €67 million (previous year: €140 million) relates to VAT, €25 million (previous year: €31 million) to customs and duties and €71 million (previous year: €107 million) to other tax provisions.\n\nMiscellaneous provisions include a large number of individual items. The risks from business activities relate primarily to provisions for guarantees and compensation payments to customers as well as provisions for losses from onerous contracts. In addition, miscellaneous provisions include the obligation to return the securities for CO2 emissions certificates in the amount of €70 million (previous year: €70 million).\n\n{189}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-189-0\"></span>Image /page/189/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The interest rate of the bond is coupled with the medium-term target of significantly reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030. The cash inflow and the liability were recognized on July 3, 2023. The ten-year term ends on July 3, 2033. The bond has a fixed interest rate of 3.375% per year. However, if one of the targets set for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for 2030 is not reached, the coupon to be paid increases beginning in the year 2031. The revenue will primarily be used for general company purposes, including the refinancing of existing financial liabilities.\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT BONDS\n\n|                             |                     |                       |                  |                          | 2022             |  |                          | 2023             |  |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|------------------|--------------------------|------------------|--|--------------------------|------------------|--|\n|                             | Nominal coupon<br>% | Notional volume<br>€m | Issuer           | Carrying<br>amount<br>€m | Fair value<br>€m |  | Carrying<br>amount<br>€m | Fair value<br>€m |  |\n| Bond 2012/2024              | 2.875               | 700                   | Deutsche Post AG | 699                      | 699              |  | 700                      | 696              |  |\n| Bond 2013/2023              | 2.750               | 500                   | Deutsche Post AG | 500                      | 502              |  | n.a.                     | n.a.             |  |\n| Bond 2016/2026              | 1.250               | 500                   | Deutsche Post AG | 499                      | 472              |  | 499                      | 486              |  |\n| Bond 2017/2027              | 1.000               | 500                   | Deutsche Post AG | 497                      | 452              |  | 498                      | 469              |  |\n| Bond 2018/2028              | 1.625               | 750                   | Deutsche Post AG | 744                      | 690              |  | 745                      | 716              |  |\n| Bond 2020/2026              | 0.375               | 750                   | Deutsche Post AG | 747                      | 688              |  | 748                      | 706              |  |\n| Bond 2020/2029              | 0.750               | 750                   | Deutsche Post AG | 748                      | 649              |  | 748                      | 687              |  |\n| Bond 2020/2032              | 1.000               | 750                   | Deutsche Post AG | 747                      | 610              |  | 747                      | 669              |  |\n| Bond 2023/2033              | 3.375               | 500                   | Deutsche Post AG | n.a.                     | n.a.             |  | 498                      | 512              |  |\n| Convertible bond 2017/20251 | 0.050               | 1,000                 | Deutsche Post AG | 982                      | 914              |  | 989                      | 950              |  |\n\n1 Fair value of the debt component; the fair value of the convertible bond 2017/2025 is €980 million (previous year: €956 million).\n\n#### Convertible bond\n\nThe convertible bond issued carries a conversion right that allows holders to convert the bond into a predetermined number of Deutsche Post AG shares.\n\nIn addition, Deutsche Post AG was granted a call option allowing it to repay the bond early at face value plus accrued interest if Deutsche Post AG's share price more than temporarily exceeds 130% of the conversion price applicable at that time. The convertible bond has a debt component and an equity component. In subsequent years, interest will be added to the carrying amount of the bond, up to the issue amount, using the effective interest method and recognized in profit or loss.\n\n{191}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/191/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The leased aircraft are predominantly deployed in the air network of the Express segment. The additions also relate to the renewal of the aircraft fleet. Leased transport equipment also includes the leased vehicle fleet. The real estate leases in particular are long-term leases. The Group had 84 real estate leases with remaining lease terms of more than 20 years as of December 31, 2023 (previous year: 77 leases). Aircraft leases have remaining lease terms of up to 15 years (previous year: 14 years). Leases may include extension and termination options, **[note 7.](#page-137-0)** The leases are negotiated individually and include a wide range of different conditions.\n\n{193}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-193-0\"></span>Image /page/193/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters \"DHL\" is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nFuture cash outflows amounted to €17 billion (previous year: €16 billion) as of the reporting date, **[note 43.](#page-195-0)** Possible future cash outflows amounting to €4.2 billion (previous year: €3.6 billion) were not included in lease liabilities because it is not reasonably certain that the leases will be extended (or not terminated). Leases that the Group has entered into as a lessee but that have not yet commenced result in possible future payment outflows totaling €2.3 billion (previous year: €2.6 billion), which primarily result from the renewal of the aircraft fleet.

The interest payments reported in the cash flow statement also include payments that do not relate to liabilities from financing activities.\n\nAs of the reporting date, there were no hedges attributable solely to the liabilities arising from financing activities. The effects on cash flows from hedges are presented in the \"Other financing activities\" cash flow item in the amount of €–152 million.\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, noncash transactions were entered into that were not included in the cash flow statement in accordance with IAS 7.43 and 7.44. These relate to the exchange of land and separate building ownership between Deutsche Post AG and Deutsche Post Pensions-Treuhand GmbH & Co. KG. Although income was recognized as a result of the transaction, no cash or cash equivalents were received.\n\n{194}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-194-0\"></span>Image /page/194/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The background is yellow.\n\n#### 42.1 Net cash from operating activities\n\nAt €9,258 million, net cash from operating activities came in €1,707 million lower than the prior-year figure of €10,965 million. Income taxes paid declined by €157 million to €1,625 million. Income from the increase in the shareholding in DHL Logistics contributed primarily to the increase in noncash income and expenses from €–31 million to €–336 million. Cash inflow from the change in working capital amounted to €536 million, an increase of €321 million compared with the prior year.\n\nOther noncash income and expenses are as follows:\n\n#### OTHER NONCASH INCOME AND EXPENSES\n\n| €m                                                                         | 2022 | 2023 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Expenses from the remeasurement of assets                                  | 150  | 39   |\n| Income from the remeasurement of liabilities                               | -303 | -367 |\n| Staff costs relating to equity-settled share-based payments                | 100  | 108  |\n| Net expenses/income from investments accounted for using the equity method | 39   | -115 |\n| Other                                                                      | -17  | -1   |\n| Other noncash income (–) and expenses (+)                                  | -31  | -336 |\n\n#### 42.2 Net cash used in investing activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities fell from €3,179 million to €2,181 million. In the previous year, this included, among other items, the net purchase price payment of €1,379 million for the acquisition of Hillebrand. Cash paid to acquire property, plant and equipment and intangible assets decreased by €531 million to €3,381 million. Investing activities focused on, for example, the ongoing expansion and renewal of the air fleet and network infrastructure. The cash inflow from the change in current financial assets decreased from €1,664 million to €963 million. In the previous year, money market funds were sold to enable payment of the purchase price of subsidiaries and other business units in the amount of €1,613 million, in addition to the payment of the dividend.\n\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the course of acquisitions of material and immaterial companies undertaken in the 2023 fiscal year are presented in the following table:\n\n| ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED              |      |      |\n|------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| €m                                                   | 2022 | 2023 |\n| Noncurrent assets                                    | 283  | 110  |\n| Current assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) | 547  | 81   |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                            | 82   | 28   |\n| Noncurrent provisions and liabilities                | -422 | -79  |\n| Current provisions and liabilities                   | -557 | -88  |\n\n#### 42.3 Net cash used in financing activities\n\nAt €6,898 million, net cash used in financing activities came in €513 million lower than the prior-year figure of €7,411 million. The placement of the sustainability-linked bond is reflected in the assumption of noncurrent financial liabilities in the amount of €501 million. Despite the higher dividend per share, the dividend distribution to the shareholders remained unchanged at €2,205 million. Share buybacks led to payments in the amount of €986 million for the acquisition of treasury shares, thereby coming in below the level of the previous year (€1,099 million).\n\n{195}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-195-0\"></span>Image /page/195/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The background of the image is yellow.\n\n### Other disclosures\n\n#### 43 Risks and financial instruments of the Group\n\n#### 43.1 Risk management\n\nAs a result of its operating activities, the Group is exposed to financial risks that may arise from changes in exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. DHL Group manages these risks centrally through the use of nonderivative and derivative financial instruments. Derivatives are used exclusively to mitigate nonderivative financial risks, and fluctuations in their fair value should not be assessed separately from the underlying transaction.\n\nThe Group's internal risk guidelines govern the universe of actions, responsibilities and necessary controls regarding the use of derivatives. Financial transactions are recorded, assessed and processed using proven risk management software, which also regularly documents the effectiveness of hedging relationships. Portfolios of derivatives are regularly reconciled with the banks concerned.\n\nTo limit counterparty risk from financial transactions, the Group may only enter into this type of contract with prime-rated banks. The conditions for the counterparty limits individually assigned to the banks are reviewed on a daily basis. The Group's Board of Management is informed internally at regular intervals about existing financial risks and the hedging instruments deployed to mitigate them. Financial instruments are accounted for and measured and hedge accounting is carried out in accordance with IFRS 9.\n\nDisclosures regarding risks associated with the Group's defined benefit retirement plans and their mitigation can be found in **[note 37.5.](#page-187-0)**\n\n#### Liquidity management\n\nThe ultimate objective of liquidity management is to secure the solvency of DHL Group and all Group companies. Consequently, liquidity in the Group is centralized as much as possible in cash pools and managed in the Corporate Center.\n\nThe centrally available liquidity reserves (funding availability), consisting of central short-term financial investments and committed credit lines, are the key control parameter. The target is to have at least €2 billion available in a central credit line.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Group had central liquidity reserves of €3.3 billion (previous year: €4 billion), consisting of central financial investments amounting to €1.3 billion plus a syndicated credit facility of €2 billion.\n\nThe maturity structure of nonderivative financial liabilities within the scope of IFRS 7 based on cash flows is as follows:\n\n{196}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/196/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

                   |\n\nThe contract terms stipulate how the parties must meet their obligations arising from derivative financial instruments, either by net or by gross settlement.\n\n#### Currency risk and currency management\n\nThe international business activities of DHL Group expose it to currency risks from recognized or planned future transactions:\n\nOn-balance-sheet currency risks arise from the measurement and settlement of recognized foreign currency items if the exchange rate on the measurement or settlement date differs from the rate at initial recognition. The resulting foreign exchange differences directly impact profit or loss. In order to mitigate this impact as far as possible, all significant on-balance-sheet currency risks within the Group are centralized in Deutsche Post AG's in-house bank function. The centralized currency risks are aggregated by Corporate Treasury to calculate a net position per currency and hedged externally based on value-at-risk limits. The currencyrelated value at risk (95%/one-month holding period) for the portfolio totaled €7 million (previous year: €6 million) as of the reporting date; the limit is currently a maximum of €5 million. The notional amount of the currency forwards and currency swaps used to manage on-balance-sheet currency risks amounted to €6,858 million as of the reporting date (previous year: €6,101 million); the fair value was €53 million (previous year: €–86 million). Hedge accounting was not applied. Derivatives are accounted for as trading derivatives (freestanding derivatives).\n\nCurrency risks arise from planned foreign-currency transactions if the future transactions are settled at exchange rates that differ from the originally projected rates. These currency risks are also captured centrally in Corporate Treasury. Currency risks from planned future transactions are only hedged in selected cases. The relevant hedged items and derivatives used for hedging purposes are accounted for using cash flow hedge accounting, **[note 43.3.](#page-202-0)**\n\n{198}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/198/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in black.\n\nCurrency risks also result from translating assets and liabilities of foreign operations into the Group's currency (translation risk). No translation risks were hedged as of the reporting date.\n\nCurrency forwards and currency swaps in a total notional amount of €7,073 million (previous year: €7,130 million) were outstanding as of the reporting date. The corresponding fair value was €–40 million (previous year: €–55 million).\n\nIFRS 7 requires the disclosure of quantitative risk data, showing how profit or loss and equity are affected by changes in exchange rates as of the reporting date. The impact of these changes in exchange rates on the portfolio of foreign currency financial instruments is assessed by means of a value-at-risk calculation (95% confidence/one-month holding period). It is assumed that the portfolio as of the reporting date is representative for the full year. The following assumptions are used as a basis for the sensitivity analysis:\n\nPrimary financial instruments in foreign currencies used by Group companies are hedged by Deutsche Post AG's in-house bank. Deutsche Post AG determines monthly exchange rates and guarantees these to the Group companies. Exchange-rate-related changes therefore have no effect on the profit or loss and equity of the Group companies. Where Group companies are not permitted to participate in in-house banking for legal reasons, their currency risks from primary financial instruments are fully hedged locally through the use of derivatives. They therefore have no impact on the Group's risk position.\n\nThe following table presents currency-related effects on value at risk. The information is subject to the limitations of the model, which is based on historical volatilities and correlations and thus has limited informative value regarding actual future risks. In addition, the actual risks can fall outside of the 95% confidence level and therefore be significantly higher:\n\n#### RISK DATA ON CURRENCY RISK\n\n|                                                            | 2022                   |                | 2023                   |                |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------|------------------------|----------------|\n| €m                                                         | Profit or loss effects | Equity effects | Profit or loss effects | Equity effects |\n| Primary financial instruments and freestanding derivatives | 6                      |                | 7                      |                |\n| Derivative instruments (cash flow hedges)                  |                        | 21             |                        | 5              |\n| Total value at risk1                                       |                        | 24             |                        | 8              |\n\n1 The total amount is lower than the sum of the individual amounts, owing to interdependencies.\n\n#### Interest rate risk and interest rate management\n\nAs of the reporting date, there were no outstanding interest rate hedging instruments. In the previous year, interest rate hedging instruments with a notional amount of €500 million and a fair value of €57 million were recognized, **[note 43.3.](#page-202-0)**\n\nPrimary variable-rate financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and must, therefore, be included in the sensitivity analysis. All fixed-income financial instruments measured at amortized cost are not subject to interest rate risk. If the market interest rate level as of December 31, 2023, had been 100 basis points higher, the net financial result would have improved by €31 million (previous year: €32 million). A decline in interest rates by 100 basis points would have had the opposite effect. There was no interest rate risk with an impact on equity as of the reporting date.\n\nThe proportion of financial liabilities with short-term interest lock-ins, **[note 39,](#page-189-0)** amounts to 22% (previous year: 19%) of the total financial liabilities as of the reporting date. The effect of potential interest rate changes on the Group's financial position remains insignificant.\n\n{199}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/199/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and is made up of thick, stylized letters with three horizontal lines extending from the left side. Below the DHL part of the logo, the word \"Group\" is written in red.\n\n#### Market risk\n\nMost of the risks arising from commodity price fluctuations, in particular fluctuating prices for kerosene and marine diesel fuels, were passed on to customers via operating measures. As the impact of the related fuel surcharges is delayed by one to two months, earnings may be affected temporarily if there are significant short-term fuel price variations.\n\nThe remaining fuel price risk is partly hedged with swap transactions in the notional amount of €80 million (previous year: €1 million) and a fair value of €–4 million (previous year: €1 million) running until the end of 2025.\n\nCommodity price risks also result from the ongoing purchase of natural gas and electricity. Swap transactions with a notional amount of €25 million (previous year: €24 million) were outstanding as of the reporting date. The corresponding fair value was €–14 million (previous year: €–9 million). A 10% increase in the market prices of the commodities underlying the derivatives as of the reporting date would have increased fair values and equity by €9 million (previous year: €1 million). A corresponding decline in commodity prices would have had the opposite effect.\n\nThe Group received share price options as part of the conclusion of contracts from operational and M&A transactions. As of the reporting date, share price options with a notional amount of €250 million (previous year: €252 million) and a term of two to six years were outstanding. The corresponding fair value was €25 million (previous year: €33 million).\n\nA 10% increase in the share prices underlying the derivatives as of the reporting date would have increased fair values and the financial result by €7 million (previous year: €8 million). A corresponding decrease in the share prices would have had an effect of €–6 million (previous year: €–7 million).\n\n#### Credit risk\n\nCredit risk arises for the Group from operating activities and from financial transactions. The aggregate carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum default risk.\n\nIn an effort to minimize credit risk from operating activities and financial transactions, counterparties are assigned individual limits, the utilization of which is regularly monitored. The Group's heterogeneous customer structure means that there is no risk concentration. Financial transactions are only entered into with prime-rated counterparties.\n\nThe credit risk of financial assets arising from operations is managed by the divisions.\n\nThe expected credit loss associated with financial assets must be determined if they fall under the impairment model of IFRS 9. Based on the expected credit loss model (impairment model), a loss allowance must be anticipated for the expected credit loss, **[note 7.](#page-137-0)**\n\nThe following table documents the loss allowance for all debt instruments recognized at amortized cost, such as deposits, collateral provided and loans to third parties, and for lease receivables. This does not include trade receivables without a significant financing component and contract assets.\n\n{200}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/200/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

There were no indications as of the reporting date of any poor performance of the debt instruments and lease receivables. There was no reclassification between the stages in the fiscal year.\n\nTrade receivables from customer relationships amounting to €10,537 million were due within one year as of the reporting date (previous year: €12,253 million). They are held primarily with the aim of collecting the principal amount of the receivables. These items are therefore assigned to the \"held to collect contractual cash flows\" business model and measured at amortized cost. Trade receivables changed as follows:\n\n#### CHANGES IN RECEIVABLES\n\n| €m                                | 2022   | 2023   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Gross receivables                 |        |        |\n| Balance as of January 1           | 11,971 | 12,581 |\n| Changes                           | 610    | -1,784 |\n| Balance as of December 31         | 12,581 | 10,797 |\n| Loss allowances                   |        |        |\n| Balance as of January 1           | -288   | -328   |\n| Changes                           | -40    | 68     |\n| Balance as of December 31         | -328   | -260   |\n| Carrying amount as of December 31 | 12,253 | 10,537 |\n\n{201}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/201/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The banks' purchase obligations were limited to a maximum portfolio of receivables of €241 million (previous year: €501 million). DHL Group can decide at its discretion whether, and to what extent, the revolving notional volume is utilized. The risks relevant to the derecognition of the receivables include credit risk and the risk of delayed payment (late payment risk).\n\nCredit risk represents primarily all the risks and rewards associated with ownership of the receivables. This risk is transferred in full to the bank against payment of a fixed fee for doubtful accounts. A significant late-payment risk does not exist. All of the receivables were therefore derecognized. In the 2023 fiscal year, the Group recognized program fees (interest, allowances for doubtful accounts) of €0.3 million (previous year: €0.5 million) as an expense. The notional volume of receivables factored as of December 31, 2023, amounted to €4 million (previous year: €15 million).\n\n#### 43.2 Collateral\n\n#### COLLATERAL PROVIDED\n\n| €m                                                                   | 2022 | 2023 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Noncurrent collateral                                                | 162  | 149  |\n| of which for assets for the settlement of residential building loans | 29   | 22   |\n| of which for sureties paid                                           | 114  | 117  |\n| Current collateral                                                   | 53   | 36   |\n| of which for restricted cash                                         | 0    | 0    |\n| of which for sureties paid                                           | 42   | 17   |\n\nThe collateral provided relates primarily to sureties paid and restricted cash.\n\n{202}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-202-0\"></span>Image /page/202/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The notional amount of these currency forwards and currency swaps amounted to €215 million (previous year: €1,029 million) at a fair value of €13 million (previous year: €31 million). The hedged items will have an impact on cash flow by 2028.\n\nOf the unrealized gains or losses from currency derivatives recognized in equity as of December 31, 2023, €11 million (previous year: €20 million) is expected to be recognized in profit or loss in the course of the following year.\n\nThe following table shows the net open hedging positions as of the reporting date in the currency pairs with the highest net positions and their weighted hedge rate:\n\n#### NOTIONAL VOLUME OF HEDGING INSTRUMENTS\n\n|                                |                       | Remaining term |                   |                   |                      |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| €m                             | Total notional volume | Up to 1 year   | 1 year to 5 years | More than 5 years | Average hedge rate € |\n| December 31, 2023              |                       |                |                   |                   |                      |\n| Hedges of currency risk        |                       |                |                   |                   |                      |\n| Currency forwards sell EUR/CZK | 161                   | 135            | 26                |                   | 26.93                |\n| Currency forwards buy EUR/USD  | 18                    | 18             |                   |                   | 1.09                 |\n| Currency forwards sell USD/CNY | 12                    | 12             |                   |                   | 7.07                 |\n| December 31, 2022              |                       |                |                   |                   |                      |\n| Hedges of currency risk        |                       |                |                   |                   |                      |\n| Currency forwards buy EUR/GBP  | 546                   | 546            |                   |                   | 0.88                 |\n| Currency forwards sell EUR/CZK | 364                   | 204            | 158               | 2                 | 26.53                |\n| Currency forwards buy EUR/HUF  | 47                    | 47             |                   |                   | 446.46               |\n\nInterest rate risks were not hedged at the end of 2023. An amount of €49 million is recognized in the hedge reserve from cash flow hedges that were reversed as part of the issue of the 2023/2033 bond. This amount is amortized over the originally hedged term until 2031 and reduces the future interest expense.\n\nIn addition, as part of cash flow hedging, fuel, electricity and natural gas price risks were hedged with corresponding swap transactions in the notional amount of €104 million (previous year: €25 million) and a fair value of €-18 million (previous year: €–8 million) running until the end of 2025. Only the product price component of the energy price was designated as the hedged item. In the fiscal year under review, €0 million (previous year: €17 million) in realized effects from cash flow hedges for commodity price risks were recognized in material expense.\n\nThe total gains and losses on open hedging instruments recognized in equity as of the reporting date amounted to €–5 million (previous year: €82 million).\n\n{203}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/203/Figure/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo is red and consists of the letters \"DHL\" in a bold, stylized font, with three horizontal lines to the left of the \"D\". Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller, sans-serif font. The background is yellow.\n\nAs in the previous year, carrying amounts of derivative assets amounting to €14 million (previous year: €91 million) and derivative liabilities amounting to €-19 million (previous year: €-10 million) included in cash flow hedges did not result in ineffectiveness within the period. This is because the changes in the fair value of the hedged items and hedging transactions offset each other.\n\n#### DISCLOSURES ON DESIGNATED HEDGED ITEMS AND HEDGING TRANSACTIONS\n\n| €m

Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nIf there is an active market for a financial instrument (e.g., a stock exchange), its fair value is determined by reference to the market or quoted exchange price as of the reporting date. If no fair value is available in an active market, quoted market prices for similar instruments or recognized valuation models are used to determine fair value.\n\nIFRS 13 requires financial assets to be assigned to the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy:\n\nLevel 1 comprises equity and debt instruments measured at fair value and debt instruments measured at amortized cost whose fair values can be determined based on quoted market prices.\n\nIn addition to financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortized cost, commodity, interest rate and currency derivatives are reported under Level 2. The fair values of assets measured at amortized cost are determined using the multiplier method, among other things. The fair values of the derivatives are measured on the basis of discounted expected future cash flows, taking into account forward rates for currencies, interest rates and commodities (market approach). For this purpose, price quotations observable in the market (exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices) are imported from standard market information platforms into the treasury management system. The price quotations reflect actual transactions involving similar instruments on an active market. All significant inputs used to measure derivatives are observable in the market.\n\nAs of the reporting date, a call option and warrants are recognized under Level 3 that entitle the holder to acquire further shares in the company. The fair values of the derivative financial instruments are determined on the basis of the Black Scholes option pricing model. If possible, parameters observable on the market or derived from market data are used to determine the value. A volatility of 41% is taken into account for the call option and a volatility of 39% for the warrants. The volatilities are based on the volatilities of a comparable group of companies. No major fluctuations in earnings are to be expected with regard to the call option in the future. Because the warrants are based on a listed underlying share, there could be earnings fluctuations in the subsequent years.\n\n#### UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3)\n\n|                                           |      | Assets equity derivatives |  |\n|-------------------------------------------|------|---------------------------|--|\n| €m                                        | 2022 | 2023                      |  |\n| Balance as of January 1                   | 0    | 33                        |  |\n| Profit recognized in the income statement | 18   | 8                         |  |\n| Losses recognized in the income statement | -43  | -16                       |  |\n| Additions                                 | 58   | 0                         |  |\n| Balance as of December 31                 | 33   | 25                        |  |\n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/211/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

These contracts are subject to a standardized master agreement for financial derivative transactions. This agreement provides for a conditional right of offset, resulting in the recognition of the gross amount of the financial derivative transactions as of the reporting date. The conditional right of offset is presented in the tables.\n\nSettlement processes arising from services related to postal deliveries are subject to the Universal Postal Convention and the Letter-mail INTERCONNECT Remuneration Agreement – Europe (LIRAE). These agreements, particularly the settlement conditions, are binding on all public postal operators in respect of the specified contractual arrangements. Imports and exports between the parties to the agreement during a calendar year are summarized in an annual statement of account and presented on a net basis in the final annual statement. Receivables and payables covered by the Universal Postal Convention and the LIRAE are presented on a net basis as of the reporting date. In addition, funds are presented on a net basis if a right of offset exists in the normal course of business. The tables show the receivables and payables before and after offsetting.\n\n#### 44 Contingent liabilities and other financial obligations\n\nIn addition to provisions and liabilities, the Group has contingent liabilities and other financial obligations. The contingent liabilities are broken down as follows:\n\n#### CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\n| €m                                | 2022 | 2023  |\n|-----------------------------------|------|-------|\n| Guarantee obligations             | 119  | 97    |\n| Warranties                        | 11   | 10    |\n| Liabilities from litigation risks | 258  | 264   |\n| Other contingent liabilities      | 523  | 756   |\n| Total                             | 911  | 1,127 |\n\nThe other contingent liabilities also include possible obligations from tax-related items.\n\nOther financial obligations such as the purchase obligation for investments in noncurrent assets amounted to €1,517 million (previous year: €2,668 million). They relate primarily to the delivery of additional cargo aircraft as well as obligations from fleet management.\n\n{213}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-213-0\"></span>Image /page/213/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of a stylized font with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. The word \"Group\" is in red and is located to the right and below the DHL letters. The background is yellow.\n\n#### 45 Litigation\n\nMany of the postal services rendered by Deutsche Post AG and its subsidiaries (particularly the Post & Parcel Germany division) are subject to sector-specific regulation on the basis of German postal legislation by the German federal network agency (*Bundesnetzagentur*). The German federal network agency approves or reviews prices, formulates the terms of downstream access, has special supervisory powers to combat market abuse and guarantees the provision of universal postal services. This general regulatory risk could lead to a decline in revenue and earnings in the event of negative decisions. Revenue and earnings risk can arise from the price cap procedure used to determine the rates for letter mail.\n\nThe approval of the rates for individual pieces of letter mail for the period from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2024, was issued by the German federal network agency on April 29, 2022. An association from the CEP sector and customers have filed an action with the Cologne Administrative Court against this price cap approval of the German federal network agency for the years 2022 to 2024. The proceedings are still pending. The aforementioned CEP association, as well as postal service providers and other customers, had previously filed an action with the Cologne Administrative Court against the pricing approval granted as part of the price cap procedure for the years 2016 to 2018 and 2019 to 2021. In a ruling issued on August 17, 2022, the Cologne Administrative Court overturned the approval for the years 2019 to 2021 in relation to the association as well as the postal service providers as a result of a ruling of the German Federal Administrative Court from May 27, 2020, due to a formal legal error in the context of the underlying legal ordinance. This formal legal error was rectified by the German government through an amendment to the German Postal Act that took effect in March 2021. The Cologne Administrative Court denied the claims of some customers because they had expired. The Cologne Administrative Court has not yet reached a decision on the other mentioned claims against the price cap approvals. The association's additional application to be granted a new approval for the years 2019 to 2021 was denied by the Cologne Administrative Court. The association has filed an appeal to this ruling with the German Federal Administrative Court, as have the two customers who were completely unsuccessful in their claims with the Cologne Administrative Court; the appeals with the German Federal Administrative Court are still pending. The rulings of the Cologne Administrative Court from August 17, 2022, are only applicable to the legal relationships with the respective plaintiffs and have no legal impact vis-à-vis other consumers.\n\nOne postal service provider, which had also filed an action against the pricing approval for the years 2019 to 2021 with the Cologne Administrative Court, also filed an additional civil suit for repayment of allegedly excessive conveyance fees for standard letters delivered in 2017. The action is based primarily on the claim that Deutsche Post charged postage whose approval is unlawful pursuant to the ruling of the German Federal Administrative Court from May 27, 2020. The action was denied by the Cologne District Court in a ruling from June 17, 2021. The cartel court of the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court denied the appeal of this ruling on April 6, 2022, and did not permit any further appeals of the ruling. On May 2, 2022, the plaintiff submitted an appeal against nonpermission with Germany's Federal Court of Justice to have its appeal allowed.\n\nPossible negative effects on Deutsche Post of these court rulings and the proceedings underway cannot be ruled out.\n\nSince July 1, 2010, as a result of the revision of the relevant tax exemption provisions, the VAT exemption has only applied to those specific universal services in Germany that are not subject to individually negotiated agreements or provided on special terms (discounts, etc.). Deutsche Post AG and the tax authorities hold different opinions on the VAT treatment of certain products. In the interest of resolving these issues, proceedings have been initiated by Deutsche Post AG at the tax court with jurisdiction in this matter, **[note 44.](#page-212-0)**\n\nIf the interests of the company are significantly impaired as part of the aforementioned proceedings, in accordance with IAS 37.92, no further disclosures are made on the presentation of legal disputes, estimates of the financial effects and uncertainties, as well as the recognition and amount of contingent liabilities and provisions.\n\n{214}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/214/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo is red and consists of the letters \"DHL\" in a stylized font, with three horizontal lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in a smaller font.\n\n#### 46 Share-based payment\n\nAssumptions regarding the price of Deutsche Post AG's shares and assumptions regarding employee fluctuation are taken into account when measuring the value of share-based payments for executives. All assumptions are reviewed on a quarterly basis. The staff costs are recognized pro rata in profit or loss to reflect the services rendered as consideration during the vesting period (lockup period). In the fiscal year, a total of €194 million (previous year: €140 million) was recognized for share-based payments, €86 million (previous year: €40 million) of which were cash-settled and €108 million (previous year: €100 million) of which were equity-settled.\n\n#### 46.1 Share-based payment for executives (Share Matching Scheme)\n\nUnder the share-based payment system for executives (Share Matching Scheme), certain executives receive part of their variable remuneration for the fiscal year in the form of shares of Deutsche Post AG in the following year (deferred incentive shares). All Group executives can specify an increased equity component individually by converting a further portion of their variable remuneration for the fiscal year (investment shares). After a four-year lockup period during which the executive must be employed by the Group, they again receive the same number of Deutsche Post AG shares (matching shares). Assumptions are made regarding the conversion behavior of executives with respect to their relevant bonus portion. Share-based payment arrangements are entered into each year, with December 1 of the respective year and April 1 of the following year being the grant dates for each year's tranche. Whereas deferred incentive shares and matching shares are classified as equity-settled share-based payments, investment shares are compound financial instruments and the debt and equity components must be measured separately. However, in accordance with IFRS 2.37, only the debt component is measured due to the provisions of the Share Matching Scheme. The investment shares are therefore treated as cash-settled share-based payments.\n\nOf the expenses under the Share Matching Scheme, €63 million (previous year: €57 million) was attributable to equity-settled share-based payments. A total of €53 million related to cash-settled payments for investment shares (previous year: €64 million), all of which were unvested as of December 31, 2023.\n\nAdditional information on the granting and settlement of these rights can be found in **[note 33](#page-175-0) [and 34.](#page-178-0)** \n\n#### SHARE MATCHING SCHEME\n\n|                                                                           |           | Alternative<br>program |               |               |               |               |               |              |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|\n|                                                                           |           |                        | 2018 tranche  | 2019 tranche  | 2020 tranche  | 2021 tranche  | 2022 tranche  | 2023 tranche |\n| Grant date of deferred incentive shares and associated<br>matching shares |           | –                      | Dec. 1, 2019  | Dec. 1, 2020  | Dec. 1, 2021  | Dec. 1, 2022  | Dec. 1, 2023  |              |\n| Grant date of matching shares awarded for investment shares               |           | March 1, 2019          | April 1, 2020 | April 1, 2021 | April 1, 2022 | April 1, 2023 | April 1, 2024 |              |\n| Term                                                                      | months    |                        | 52            | 52            | 52            | 52            | 52            | 52           |\n| End of term                                                               |           |                        | June 2023     | March 2024    | March 2025    | March 2026    | March 2027    | March 2028   |\n| Share price as of grant date (fair value)                                 |           |                        |               |               |               |               |               |              |\n| Deferred incentive shares and associated matching<br>shares               | €         |                        | n.a.          | 33.29         | 40.72         | 53.55         | 38.17         | 43.92        |\n| Matching shares awarded for investment shares                             | €         |                        | 27.30         | 23.83         | 46.52         | 42.50         | 42.56         | 46.001       |\n| Number of deferred incentive shares                                       | thousands |                        | n.a.          | 369           | 246           | 293           | 263           | 1742         |\n| Number of matching shares expected                                        |           |                        |               |               |               |               |               |              |\n| Deferred incentive shares                                                 | thousands |                        | n.a.          | 332           | 222           | 264           | 237           | 174          |\n| Investment shares                                                         | thousands |                        | 854           | 1,343         | 1,007         | 1,245         | 1,232         | 845          |\n| Matching shares issued                                                    | thousands |                        | 830           |               |               |               |               |              |\n\n1 Estimated provisional amount; the final amount will be determined on April 1, 2024.\n\n2 Expected number.\n\n{215}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/215/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### 46.2 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for members of the Board of Management\n\nSince the 2006 fiscal year, the company has granted members of the Board of Management cash remuneration linked to the company's long-term share price performance through the issue of stock appreciation rights (SARs) as part of a Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Participation in the LTIP requires Board of Management members to make a personal investment of 10% of their annual base salary by the grant date of each tranche, primarily in shares.\n\nThe SARs granted can be fully or partly exercised after the expiration of a four-year lockup period at the earliest, provided absolute or relative performance targets have been achieved at the end of this lockup period. After expiration of the lockup period, the SARs must be exercised within a period of two years (exercise period); any SARs not exercised expire.\n\nHow many, if any, of the SARs granted can be exercised is determined in accordance with four (absolute) performance targets based on the share price and two (relative) performance targets based on a benchmark index. One-sixth of the SARs granted are earned each time the closing price of Deutsche Post shares exceeds the issue price by at least 10% 15% 20% or 25% at the end of the waiting period (absolute performance targets). Both relative performance targets are tied to the performance of the shares in relation to the STOXX Europe 600 Index (SXXP; ISIN EU0009658202). They are met if the share price equals the index performance or if it outperforms the index by more than 10%. Performance is determined by comparing the average price of Deutsche Post shares and the average index value during a reference and a performance period. The reference period comprises the last 20 consecutive trading days prior to the issue date. The performance period is the last 60 trading days before the end of the lockup period. The average (closing) price is calculated as the average closing price of Deutsche Post shares in Deutsche Börse AG's Xetra trading system. If absolute or relative performance targets are not met by the end of the lockup period, the SARs attributable to them will expire without replacement or compensation. Each SAR exercised entitles the Board of Management member to receive a cash settlement equal to the difference between the average closing price of Deutsche Post shares for the five trading days preceding the exercise date and the exercise price of the SAR.\n\n#### LTIP\n\n|                        | 2017 tranche  | 2018 tranche  | 2019 tranche  | 2020 tranche  | 2021 tranche  | 2022 tranche  | 2023 tranche  |\n|------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Issue date             | Sept. 1, 2017 | Sept. 1, 2018 | Sept. 1, 2019 | Sept. 1, 2020 | Sept. 1, 2021 | Sept. 1, 2022 | Sept. 1, 2023 |\n| Issue price            | €34.72        | €31.08        | €28.88        | €37.83        | €58.68        | €39.06        | €43.26        |\n| Waiting period expires | Aug. 31, 2021 | Aug. 31, 2022 | Aug. 31, 2023 | Aug. 31, 2024 | Aug. 31, 2025 | Aug. 31, 2026 | Aug. 31, 2027 |\n\nThe Board of Management members received a total of 819,474 SARs (previous year: 1,176,006 SARs) with a total value, at the time of issue, of €8.0 million (previous year: €9.3 million).\n\nA stochastic simulation model is used to determine a fair value for the SARs from the LTIP. The result in the 2023 fiscal year was an expense of €32 million (previous year: income of €24 million) and a provision as of the reporting date of €27 million (previous year: €14 million). This includes the provision for the rights exercisable by the Board of Management. It amounted to €18 million as of the reporting date (previous year: €4 million).\n\nFor further disclosures on share-based payment for members of the Board of Management, see **[note 47.2.](#page-218-0)**\n\n#### 46.3 Performance Share Plan (PSP) for executives\n\nThe Annual General Meeting on May 27, 2014, resolved to introduce the Performance Share Plan (PSP) for executives. Under the PSP, shares are issued to participants at the end of the waiting period. The granting of the shares at the end of the waiting period is linked to the achievement of demanding performance targets. The performance targets under the PSP are identical to the performance targets under the LTIP for members of the Board of Management.\n\nPerformance Share Units (PSUs) were issued to selected executives for the first time on September 1, 2014. It is not planned that members of the Board of Management will participate in the PSP. The LTIP for members of the Board of Management remains unchanged.\n\n{216}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-216-0\"></span>Image /page/216/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, a total of €28 million (previous year: €27 million) has been appropriated to capital reserves for the purposes of the plan, with an equal amount recognized in staff costs.\n\nThe value of the PSP is measured using actuarial methods based on option pricing models (fair value measurement). Future dividends were taken into account, based on a moderate increase in dividend distributions over the respective measurement period.\n\nThe average remaining maturity of the outstanding PSUs as of December 31, 2023, was 27 months.\n\n#### PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN\n\n|                                                                      | 2019 tranche  | 2020 tranche  | 2021 tranche  | 2022 tranche  | 2023 tranche  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Grant date                                                           | Sept. 1, 2019 | Sept. 1, 2020 | Sept. 1, 2021 | Sept. 1, 2022 | Sept. 1, 2023 |\n| Exercise price                                                       | €28.88        | €37.83        | €58.68        | €39.06        | 43.26         |\n| Waiting period expires                                               | Aug. 31, 2023 | Aug. 31, 2024 | Aug. 31, 2025 | Aug. 31, 2026 | Aug. 31, 2027 |\n| Risk-free interest rate                                              | -0.90%        | -0.72%        | -0.80%        | 0.71%         | 2.60%         |\n| Initial dividend yield of Deutsche Post shares                       | 3.98%         | 3.57%         | 3.07%         | 4.74%         | 4.28%         |\n| Yield volatility of Deutsche Post shares                             | 21.38%        | 24.89%        | 26.49%        | 29.41%        | 30.71%        |\n| Yield volatility of Dow Jones EURO STOXX 600 Index                   | 14.79%        | 16.62%        | 17.33%        | 18.90%        | 19.10%        |\n| Covariance of Deutsche Post shares to Dow Jones EURO STOXX 600 Index | 2.21%         | 3.05%         | 3.25%         | 4.07%         | 4.32%         |\n| Number                                                               |               |               |               |               |               |\n| Rights outstanding as of January 1, 2023                             | 3,212,130     | 2,504,238     | 1,716,828     | 2,794,596     | 0             |\n| Rights granted                                                       | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             | 2,578,212     |\n| Rights lapsed                                                        | 59,466        | 62,202        | 44,244        | 71,880        | 3,150         |\n| Rights settled at the end of the waiting period                      | 3,152,664     | 0             | 0             | 0             | 0             |\n| Rights outstanding as of December 31, 2023                           | 0             | 2,442,036     | 1,672,584     | 2,722,716     | 2,575,062     |\n\n#### 46.4 Employee Share Plan (ESP) for executives\n\nThe Employee Share Plan (ESP) was introduced for another selected group of executives starting on September 1, 2021. Participation in the ESP is voluntary. Executives participating in the ESP can acquire shares of Deutsche Post AG at a discount of 25% from the market price, up to an annual cap of €10,000 or €15,000, depending on their level. The ESP is offered quarterly. Prior to every savings period, the participating executives can choose the share of their remuneration they wish to invest in the ESP during the upcoming three-month savings period. At the beginning of the following quarter, executives receive shares at a discount of 25% from the market price. The shares acquired under the ESP are subject to a two-year lockup period.\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, a total of €17 million (previous year: €16 million) has been appropriated to capital reserves for the purposes of the ESP, with an equal amount recognized in staff costs.\n\n#### 46.5 myShares share program\n\nIn the fiscal year, a share program was developed that will initially be piloted in twelve countries starting on January 1, 2024. This program gives our employees the option to acquire shares in Deutsche Post AG at a reduced price. Participation in myShares is voluntary. Employees participating in the program can acquire shares of Deutsche Post AG at a discount of 15% from the market price, up to an annual cap of €3,600. myShares is offered on a quarterly basis. Prior to every savings period, the participating employees can choose the share of their remuneration they wish to invest during the upcoming three-month savings period. At the beginning of the following quarter, employees receive shares at a discount of 15% from the market price. The shares acquired as part of myShares are not subject to a lockup period.\n\n{217}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/217/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in bold, red, and italicized font. There are three horizontal red lines to the left of the DHL text. The word \"Group\" is in red and is located below the DHL text.\n\nNo amounts in capital reserves and, accordingly, in staff costs had been added in the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023, as the first savings period does not begin until January 2024.\n\n#### 47 Related-party disclosures\n\n#### 47.1 Related-party disclosures (companies and Federal Republic of Germany)\n\nAll companies that are controlled by the Group or with which a joint arrangement exists, or over which the Group can exercise significant influence, are recorded in the **[list of shareholdings.](https://group.dhl.com/content/dam/deutschepostdhl/en/media-center/investors/documents/annual-reports/DHL-Group-list-of-shareholdings-2023-12-31.pdf)**\n\nDeutsche Post AG maintains a variety of relationships with the Federal Republic of Germany (Federal Republic) and other companies controlled by the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nThe Federal Republic is a customer of Deutsche Post AG and as such uses the company's services. Deutsche Post AG has direct business relationships with the individual public authorities and other government agencies as independent individual customers. The services provided for these customers are insignificant in respect of Deutsche Post AG's overall revenue.\n\n#### Relationships with KfW\n\nKfW supports the Federal Republic in continuing to privatize companies such as Deutsche Post AG or Deutsche Telekom AG. In 1997, KfW, together with the Federal Republic, developed a \"placeholder model\" as a tool to privatize government-owned companies. Under this model, the Federal Republic sells all or part of its investments to KfW with the aim of fully privatizing these state-owned companies. On this basis, KfW has purchased shares of Deutsche Post AG from the Federal Republic in several stages since 1997 and executed various capital market transactions using these shares. KfW's interest in Deutsche Post AG's share capital is 20.49% as of December 31, 2023. Deutsche Post AG is thus considered to be an associate of the Federal Republic.\n\n#### Relationships with the Bundesanstalt für Post und Telekommunikation (BAnst PT)\n\nThe *Bundesanstalt für Post und Telekommunikation* (BAnst PT) is a government agency and falls under the technical and legal supervision of the German Federal Ministry of Finance. The BAnst PT continues to manage the social facilities such as the postal civil-servant health insurance fund, the recreation program, the *Postbeamtenversorgungskasse* (PVK – Postal civil-servant pension fund), the *Versorgungsanstalt der Deutschen Bundespost* (VAP – Deutsche Bundespost institution for supplementary retirement pensions) and the welfare service for Deutsche Post AG, Deutsche Bank AG (as legal successor to Deutsche Postbank AG) and Deutsche Telekom AG. Tasks are performed on the basis of agency agreements. In 2023, Deutsche Post AG was invoiced for €91 million (previous year: €85 million) in installment payments relating to services provided by the BAnst PT. Further disclosures on the PVK and the VAP can be found in **[note 7](#page-137-0) [and 37.](#page-181-0)**\n\n#### Relationships with Deutsche Bahn AG and its subsidiaries\n\nDeutsche Bahn AG is wholly owned by the Federal Republic. Owing to this control relationship, Deutsche Bahn AG is a related party to Deutsche Post AG. DHL Group has various business relationships with the Deutsche Bahn Group. These mainly consist of transport service agreements.\n\n#### Relationships with pension funds\n\nThe real estate with a fair value of €1,615 million (previous year: €1,689 million) – which can be offset as plan assets – of which Deutsche Post Pensions-Treuhand GmbH & Co. KG, Deutsche Post Altersvorsorge Sicherung e.V. & Co. Objekt Gronau KG and Deutsche Post Grundstücks-Vermietungsgesellschaft beta mbH Objekt Leipzig KG are the legal owners, is let almost exclusively to the Group via Deutsche Post Immobilien GmbH. These arrangements led to lease liabilities of €426 million as of December 31, 2023 (previous year: €445 million). In the 2023 fiscal year, Deutsche Post Immobilien GmbH extinguished €27 million (previous year: €26 million) in lease liabilities and paid €14 million (previous year: €14 million) in interest.\n\n{218}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-218-0\"></span>Image /page/218/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nIn the fiscal year, an exchange of land and separate building ownership was carried out between Deutsche Post AG and Deutsche Post Pensions-Treuhand GmbH & Co.

Dr. Tobias Meyer has been the new CEO since that date.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 24, transactions between the Group and related parties must be reported. Related parties are defined as the Board of Management, the Supervisory Board and the members of their families.\n\nThere were no reportable transactions or legal transactions involving these related parties in the 2023 fiscal year. In particular, the company granted no loans to these related parties.\n\n{219}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/219/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

These salaries are determined at levels that are commensurate with the salary appropriate for the function or work performed in the company.\n\nPostemployment benefits are recognized as the service cost resulting from the pension provisions for active members of the Board of Management. The corresponding liability amounted to €14 million as of the reporting date (previous year: €42 million).\n\nStarting in 2008, newly appointed Board of Management members began receiving a defined contribution pension commitment. This entails the company crediting an annual amount totaling 35% of each Board of Management member's base salary to a virtual pension account. This capital bears interest until eligibility to receive benefits begins. The pension benefit is paid out as capital in the amount of the accumulated pension balance. Pension eligibility is triggered at the earliest when retirement age is reached, in the event of invalidity during the term of office or upon death. When eligible for the pension benefit, the beneficiary may choose an annuity option.\n\n#### 47.3 Remuneration disclosures in accordance with the HGB\n\n#### Board of Management remuneration\n\nThe remuneration paid to members of the Board of Management in the 2023 fiscal year totaled €23.4 million (previous year: €26.9 million). This includes 819,474 SARs (previous year: 1,176,006 SARs), which, as of the issue date, were valued at €8.0 million (previous year: €9.3 million).\n\n#### Former members of the Board of Management\n\nBenefits paid to former members of the Board of Management and beneficiaries amounted to €38.9 million (previous year: €10.2 million). The defined benefit obligation (DBO) for current pensions calculated under IFRS was €87 million (previous year: €75 million).\n\n#### Remuneration of the Supervisory Board\n\nAs in the previous year, the total remuneration of the Supervisory Board in the 2023 fiscal year amounted to €3.7 million; as in the previous year, €3.5 million of this amount was attributable to a fixed component and €0.2 million to attendance allowances.\n\n#### Shareholdings of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, shares held by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Post AG amounted to less than 1% of the company's share capital.\n\n{220}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/220/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

In addition, we have audited the combined management report for the Parent and the group of Deutsche Post AG, Bonn/Germany, for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the combined non-financial statement pursuant to Sections 289b and 315b German Commercial Code (HGB), which is included in the section \"Non-financial statement\" of the combined management report, nor the combined corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d HGB, which is included in the section \"Governance\" of the combined management report. Moreover, we have not audited the content of those paragraphs and disclosures extraneous to the combined management report that are marked as unaudited in the combined management report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023 and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and\n- the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the combined management report does not cover the content of the above-listed statements nor of the above-listed paragraphs and disclosures extraneous to combined management reports marked as unaudited.\n\nPursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\n\n#### Basis for the Audit Opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014; referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW). We performed the audit of the consolidated financial statements in supplementary compliance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\n{224}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/224/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn the following we present the key audit matters we have determined in the course of our audit:\n\n- 1. Recoverability of goodwill\n- 2. Measurement of pension obligations and plan assets\n\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured as follows:\n\na) description (including reference to corresponding information in the consolidated financial statements) b) auditor's response\n\n#### **1. Recoverability of goodwill**\n\na) In the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023 of Deutsche Post AG, goodwill amounting to EUR 13.1 billion is reported under the balance sheet item \"Intangible assets\", representing about 20% of total assets and 57% of the Group's reported equity. Goodwill is tested for impairment by the Company at least once a year for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements regardless of whether there are external or internal indications that the assets may be impaired. The impairment test is based on a calculation model in which the planned future cash flows are discounted at the weighted average cost of capital using a discounted cash flow method. The planned future cash flows are derived from the executive directors' adopted middle-term planning and the supervisory board's approved budget planning.\n\nThe result of this measurement depends to a large extent on the assumptions made by the executive directors for the determination of future cash flows and the determination of the parameters for the discount rates used and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background and given the complexity of the underlying measurement models as well as the material importance of goodwill, this matter was of particular significance within the framework of our audit.\n\nThe executive directors' disclosures on goodwill are contained in note 22 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nb) In our audit, we dealt with the process for performing goodwill impairment tests and obtained, among others, an understanding of the accounting controls that are included in the process and retraced the method applied to carry out the impairment tests. Where identified controls were relevant to our audit, we had their design and implementation tested. In the case of estimates made by the executive directors, we evaluated the reasonableness of the methods applied, assumptions made and data used. Specifically, we satisfied ourselves as to the appropriateness of the future cash flows used in the measurement, by, among others, comparing these values with the middle-term planning adopted by the executive directors and the budget planning approved by the supervisory board as well as with general and industry-specific market expectations. As even relatively small changes in the discount rate used can have a material impact on the measurement results, we had the discount rates tested by verifying the parameters used through public data bases and own calculations of the discount rates, compared them with the discount rates used and evaluated any deviations. In addition, we retraced the calculation model and examined whether it considered all valuedetermining parameters and whether all mathematical connections were correct.\n\n{225}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/225/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nDue to the fact that the measurement also depends on economic conditions beyond the Company's sphere of influence, we additionally evaluated the sensitivity analysis prepared by the Company.\n\nOur audit procedures were supported by our internal valuation experts.\n\n#### **2. Measurement of pension obligations and plan assets**\n\na) In the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023 of Deutsche Post AG, a total of EUR 2.5 billion is reported under the balance sheet item \"Provisions for pensions and similar obligations\". Moreover, as a result of pension scheme surpluses in some defined benefit plans, pension assets of EUR 0.2 billion are reported under the balance sheet item \"Other non-current assets\" as at 31 December 2023. The net pension provisions of EUR 2.3 billion were calculated on the basis of the present value of the obligation of EUR 14.2 billion, less the plan assets of EUR 12.0 billion measured at fair value and an asset ceiling effect of EUR 0.1 billion. In measuring pension provisions, the executive directors in particular made assumptions about the discount rate and long-term salary and pension trends as well as average life expectancy with the help of an external actuary. Changes in the measurement parameters and experience adjustments resulted in actuarial losses of EUR 0.7 billion as at 31 December 2023. In addition, measuring plan assets at fair value is subject to estimation uncertainties. Deviations from the planned development of the fair value of the plan assets resulted in losses of EUR 0.1 billion that are recognised directly in equity. In our view, these matters were of particular significance in our audit as the measurement of these high-value items is to a large extent based on estimates and discretionary assumptions made by the executive directors.\n\nThe Company's disclosures on pension provisions and similar obligations and on plan assets are contained in note 37 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nb) We dealt with the process for measurement of pension provisions and plan assets, obtaining an understanding of the accounting controls included in the process. Where identified controls were relevant to our audit, we had their design and implementation tested. In the case of estimates made by the executive directors, we evaluated the reasonableness of the methods applied, assumptions made and data used. We had the appropriateness of the measurement parameters for pension provisions, including the related assumptions made, evaluated by means of expert opinions provided to us and a comparison with market-related data. This audit procedure was carried out involving internal experts for pension valuations. Moreover, we satisfied ourselves as to the competence, capabilities and objectivity of the actuary engaged by the executive directors. Our examination of the fair values of plan assets was in particular based on bank confirmations and other asset statements and real estate appraisals. Our audit of the plan assets was supported by our internal valuation experts.\n\n#### Other Information\n\nThe executive directors and/or the supervisory board are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises\n\n- the report of the supervisory board,\n- the parts included in the combined management report:\n\t- combined non-financial statement pursuant to Sections 289b and 315b HGB,\n\t- combined corporate governance statement pursuant to Sections 289f and 315d HGB\n\t- the paragraphs and disclosures extraneous to the combined management report marked as unaudited, and\n- the executive directors' confirmation regarding the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report pursuant to Sections 297 (2) sentence 4 and 315 (1) sentence 5 HGB,\n- all other parts of the annual report,\n- but not the consolidated financial statements, not the audited content of the combined management report and not our auditor's report thereon.\n\n{226}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/226/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for the report of the supervisory board. The executive directors and the supervisory board are responsible for the declaration related to the German Corporate Governance Code pursuant to Section 161 German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), which is part of the combined corporate governance statement included in the combined management report. Otherwise, the executive directors are responsible for the other information.\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, to consider whether the other information\n\n- is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the audited content of the group management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n#### Responsibilities of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e. fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the combined management report that as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a combined management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the combined management report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\n\n{227}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/227/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The word \"Group\" is in red and is located below the right side of the DHL letters. The background is yellow.\n\n#### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) and in supplementary compliance with the ISA will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this combined management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the combined management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and with the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB.\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n\n{228}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/228/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of stylized letters. Below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n- evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the combined management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the actions taken or safeguards applied to eliminate independence threats.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in the auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n#### Other legal and regulatory requirements\n\n#### **Report on the Audit of the Electronic Reproductions of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report Prepared for Publication Pursuant to Section 317 (3a) HGB**\n\n#### Audit Opinion\n\nWe have performed an audit in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB to obtain reasonable assurance whether the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report (hereinafter referred to as \"ESEF documents\") prepared for publication, contained in the file, which has the SHA-256 value\n\n760A6C398340D2A376085885D4B91F122FC9A02893BF1AEAC7853E0D8D8FD31C, meet, in all material respects, the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section 328 (1) HGB (\"ESEF format\"). In accordance with the German legal requirements, this audit only covers the conversion of the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report into the ESEF format, and therefore covers neither the information contained in these electronic reproductions nor any other information contained in the file identified above.\n\nIn our opinion, the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report prepared for publication contained in the file identified above meet, in all material respects, the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section 328 (1) HGB. Beyond this audit opinion and our audit opinions on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and on the accompanying combined management report for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023 contained in the \"Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\" above, we do not express any assurance opinion on the information contained within these electronic reproductions or on any other information contained in the file identified above.\n\n#### Basis for the Audit Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit of the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report contained in the file identified above in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB and on the basis of the IDW Auditing Standard: Audit of the Electronic Reproductions of Financial Statements and Management Reports Prepared for Publication Purposes Pursuant to Section 317 (3a) HGB (IDW AuS 410 (06.2022)). Our responsibilities in this context are further described in the \"Group Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the ESEF Documents\" section. Our audit firm has applied the requirements of the IDW Quality Management Standards.\n\n{229}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/229/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit on the ESEF documents in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.\n- evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e. whether the file containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the balance sheet date, on the technical specification for this electronic file.\n- evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable a XHTML reproduction with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and to the audited combined management report.\n- evaluate whether the tagging of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with the requirements of Articles 4 and 6 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815, in the version in force at the balance sheet date, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML reproduction.\n\n#### Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation\n\nWe were elected as Group auditor by the annual general meeting on 6 May 2022. We were engaged by the supervisory board on 28 April / 4 May 2023. We have been the Group auditor of Deutsche Post AG, Bonn/Germany, since the financial year 2023.\n\nWe declare that the audit opinions expressed in this auditor's report are consistent with the additional report to the audit committee pursuant to Article 11 of the EU Audit Regulation (long-form audit report).\n\n{230}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/230/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

The background is yellow.\n\n### Other matter – use of the auditor's report\n\nOur auditor's report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report as well as with the audited ESEF documents. The consolidated financial statements and the combined management report converted into the ESEF format – including the versions to be submitted for inclusion in the Company Register – are merely electronic reproductions of the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report and do not take their place. In particular, the ESEF report and our audit opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the audited ESEF documents made available in electronic form.\n\n#### German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement\n\nThe German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement is Prof. Dr Frank Beine.\n\nMunich/Germany, 16 February 2024\n\nDeloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nProf. Dr. Frank Beine Dr. Hendrik Nardmann *Wirtschaftsprüfer Wirtschaftsprüfer*  (German Public Auditor) (German Public Auditor)\n\n{231}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-231-0\"></span>Image /page/231/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

In accordance with our engagement, we have performed a reasonable assurance engagement on the indicators presented in the combined nonfinancial statement\n\n- Logistics-related GHG emissions (million metric tons of CO2e): Scope 1-3\n- Realized decarbonization effects (million metric tons of CO2e)\n- Total (group-wide) energy consumption (Scopes 1 and 2) (million kWh)\n- Share of energy consumption from renewable sources (%)\n- Total energy consumption from renewable sources (Scopes 1 and 2) (million kWh)\n- Greenhouse gas intensity (grams of CO2e per euro of revenue)\n- Total GHG emissions (logistics-related) (million metric tons of CO2e)\n- Progress achieved compared to base year 2021 concerning sustainability-linked bond (%)\n- Employee engagement (%)\n- Response rate in the employee opinion survey (%)\n- Employees: full-time equivalents at year-end and yearly average (number including trainees), headcount at year-end and yearly average (number including trainees)\n- Unplanned employee turnover (%)\n- Staff costs (€)\n- Share of part-time employees average for the year (%)\n- Lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) per 200,000 working hours (work-related accidents resulting in at least one working day of lost time)\n- Working days lost per LTI (number)\n- Number of fatalities due to workplace accidents (number)\n- Sickness rate (%)\n- Share of women in middle and upper management (%)\n- Share of women in workforce (%)\n- External employees subject to the control and direction of the Group: full-time equivalents average for the year\n- Performance-based remuneration in line with market standards and free of discrimination\n- Approval rate: I am proud of my company's contribution to society (%)\n- Share of valid compliance training certificates in middle and upper management (%)\n- Internal audits carried out by Corporate Internal Audit (number)\n- On-site audits carried out (number of countries)\n- Internal audits carried out by Corporate Internal Audit with regard to respecting human rights (number)\n- Share of valid training certificates in middle and upper management relating to the training \"Raise employees' awareness for respecting human rights\" (%)\n- BitSight cybersecurity rating (points)\n\n{232}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/232/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.

Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n(hereafter \"the indicators\") and performed a limited assurance engagement on all disclosures other than the indicators contained in the combined nonfinancial statement.\n\nNot subject to our assurance engagement are the external sources of documentation and expert opinions as well as prior-year key ratios mentioned in the combined nonfinancial statement.\n\n#### Responsibilities of the Executive Directors\n\nThe executive directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the combined nonfinancial statement in accordance with the requirements of Sections 289c to 289e German Commercial Code (HGB), Section 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB and Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on establishing a framework to facilitate sustainable investment and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (\"EU Taxonomy Regulation\") and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder, as well as for making their own interpretation of the wording and terms contained in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder, as set out in the section \"EU Taxonomy\" of the combined nonfinancial statement (hereafter \"interpretation\").\n\nThese responsibilities of the executive directors of the Company include the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the combined nonfinancial statement and the use of assumptions and estimates for individual disclosures which are reasonable under the given circumstances. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of a combined nonfinancial statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder contain wording and terms that are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainties and for which clarifications have not yet been published in every case. Therefore, the executive directors have disclosed their interpretation of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts adopted thereunder in the section \"EU Taxonomy\" of the combined nonfinancial statement. They are responsible for the defensibility of this interpretation. Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of the interpretation is subject to uncertainties.\n\nThe preciseness and completeness of the environmental data in the combined nonfinancial statement, which include the indicators, is subject to inherent existing limitations associated with the manner in which the data was collected and calculated as well as assumptions made.\n\n#### Responsibilities of the Independent Practitioner\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion with reasonable assurance on the indicators disclosed in the combined nonfinancial statement and a conclusion with limited assurance on all disclosures other than the indicators in the combined nonfinancial statement in each case based on our work performed within our assurance engagement.\n\nOur audit firm applies the IDW Quality Assurance Standard issued by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW): Quality Assurance Requirements in Audit Practices (IDW QS 1). We have complied with the German Public Auditor Act (WPO) and the Professional Charter for German Public Auditors and German Sworn Auditors (BS WP/vBP), including the requirements on independence.\n\nWe conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement so that we\n\n• can conclude with reasonable assurance whether the indicators disclosed in the combined nonfinancial statement of the Company for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2023 have been presented, in all material respects, in accordance with Section 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB by the executive directors, and\n\n{233}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/233/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The DHL part of the logo is in red and consists of three horizontal lines on the left, followed by the letters D, H, and L. To the right and below the DHL part of the logo is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n• can conclude with limited assurance whether matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that all disclosures other than the indicators in the combined nonfinancial statement of the Company have in their entirety not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Sections 289c to 289e HGB, Section 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder.\n\nThe procedures performed in the limited assurance part of our engagement are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. The choice of assurance work is subject to the practitioner's professional judgement.\n\nWithin the scope of our limited assurance engagement, we notably performed the following activities:\n\n- Gaining an understanding of the structure of the Group's sustainability organization and stakeholder engagement,\n- Inquiries of relevant employees involved in the preparation of the consolidated nonfinancial statement about the preparation process, about the internal control system related to this process and about disclosures in the combined nonfinancial statement,\n- Identification of likely risks of material misstatements in the combined nonfinancial statement,\n- Analytical evaluation of selected disclosures in the combined nonfinancial statement,\n- Reconciliation of selected disclosures with the corresponding data in the consolidated and annual financial statements and combined management report,\n- Assessment of the presentation of the combined nonfinancial statement,\n- Assessment of the process to identify taxonomy eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic activities and the corresponding disclosures in the combined non-financial statement.\n\nIn the course of our reasonable assurance engagement part on the indicators disclosed in the Company's combined nonfinancial statement, we have performed the following assurance procedures and other activities in addition to those described above:\n\n- Assessment of the concept and implementation of the systems and processes for determining, processing and monitoring the disclosures on the indicators,\n- Assessment of the risks,\n\n• Tests of details on the basis of samples.\n\nIn determining the disclosures in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the executive directors are required to interpret undefined legal terms. Due to the immanent risk that undefined legal terms may be interpreted differently, the legal conformity of their interpretation and, accordingly, our assurance engagement thereon are subject to uncertainties. In particular, these uncertainties also relate to quantifying performance indicators when they are measured or evaluated.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.\n\n{234}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/234/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo. The logo consists of the letters \"DHL\" in red, with three horizontal red lines to the left of the letters. Below the letters is the word \"Group\" in red.\n\n#### Practitioner's Conclusion\n\nIn our view, the indicators disclosed in the combined nonfinancial statement of the Company for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2023 have been presented, in all material respects, in accordance with Section 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB by the executive directors.\n\nBased on the work performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that all disclosures other than the indicators in the combined nonfinancial statement of the Company for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023 do not comply, in all material respects, with the requirements of Sections 289c to 289e HGB, Section 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB and the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the Delegated Acts issued thereunder as well as the interpretation by the executive directors as disclosed in the section \"EU Taxonomy and its implementation at Deutsche Post AG\" of the combined nonfinancial statement.\n\nNot subject to our assurance engagement are the external sources of documentation and expert opinions as well as prior-year key ratios mentioned in the combined nonfinancial statement.\n\n#### Restriction of Use and Reference to Limitation of Liability\n\nWe issue this report as stipulated in the engagement letter agreed with the Company (including the \"General Engagement Terms for Wirtschaftsprüfer und Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaften [German Public Auditors and Public Audit Firms]\" dated 1 January 2017 of the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany). We draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was conducted for the Company's purposes and that the report is intended solely to inform the Company about the result of the assurance engagement. Consequently, it may not be suitable for any other purpose than the aforementioned. Accordingly, the report is not intended to be used by third parties for making (financial) decisions based on it.\n\nOur responsibility is to the Company alone. We assume no responsibility with regard to any third parties. Our conclusion is not modified in this respect.\n\nMunich/Germany, 16 February 2024\n\nDeloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nProf. Dr Frank Beine Sebastian Dingel *Wirtschaftsprüfer*  (German Public Auditor)\n\nebastian Dingel\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-235-0\"></span>Image /page/235/Picture/0 description: The image shows the DHL Group logo.
