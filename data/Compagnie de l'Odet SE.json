CSR GOVERNANCE**\n\nIn terms of corporate governance, the Bolloré Group refers to the French Corporate Governance Code for listed companies established by Afep (French association of private enterprises) and Medef (network of entrepreneurs). It also takes into consideration the expectations of its stakeholders, including the recommendations of ESG rating agencies and investors.\n\nAt its meeting of March 14, 2023, the Board of Directors (see the composition of the Board of Directors in section 1.4.2 – Members of the Board of Directors as at March 14, 2024) was invited to consider the changes made in the new version of the Code published in December 2022 aimed at ensuring that the Board of Directors incorporates the CSR strategy in its duties. CSR topics are now handled by the Audit Committee and, as such, the independent directors received initial training on environmental and climate issues provided by a third-party organization in March 2023 and October 2023.\n\nWith regard to the creation of a dedicated CSR Committee, after reiterating that the Audit Committee reviews non-financial risks as part of its current duties, the Board members decided that the Board of Directors will continue to refer to the work of the Audit Committee, whose responsibilities were extended to all CSR issues in 2023.\n\n# **1.1.3.1. THE GROUP CSR DEPARTMENT**\n\nThe Group CSR Department defines the framework of the CSR strategy, plays a role in awareness-raising and mobilization, coordinates action plans, steers annual reporting, and analyzes and enhances performance. The CSR Department reports to the Group Finance Department on a weekly basis to define the Group's position concerning these key questions, seize opportunities and ensure implementation of the measures needed to control the Group's CSR risks.

The CSR Department also relies on a network of CSR managers for each division and contributors at the level of each legal entity.\n\nVivendi's CSR policy, supported by the Management Board and the Supervisory Board, is at the heart of the Group's governance. In the interest of strategic coherence and to ensure the Group honors its CSR commitments, Vivendi's CSR Department reports directly to the Chairman of the Management Board. The Supervisory Board is also involved in the governance of the Group's non-financial performance. In accordance with its internal procedures, it regularly monitors the progress of our CSR policy, and is kept informed by the Management Board via a quarterly activity report. For more information on the Vivendi group's CSR governance, see section 1 – 2.1. A CSR strategy implemented by the management bodies.\n\nLegal, etc.). Its role is to assist the subsidiaries in risk control and in the promotion of CSR objectives, to formalize procedures and policies and to define common indicators to reinforce coherence and steering of the CSR strategy, despite the wide diversity of activities and geographic locations. The CSR Department is also represented on the Risk Committee, once a year. In 2022, the Head of CSR shared the duty of care plan and the action plan. This committee not only raises awareness, but also informs top management of the actions taken on these topics.\n\n# **1.1.3.2. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE**\n\nIn 2023, the Audit Committee's remit was extended to all CSR topics. The CSR Department organized two awareness-raising sessions on CSR issues for independent directors. The sessions, which emphasized environmental issues, were led by external subject matter experts. The strategic guidelines were presented to the Audit Committee at its July 2023 meeting. At a special meeting on climate issues held in October 2023, the independent directors of the Audit Committee and the Chief Financial Officer, Vice-Chairman of the\n\n# **1.1.3.3.

This Committee is responsible for monitoring the objectives and implementing decisions taken within the framework of the strategic guidelines defined by the Board of Directors. This Committee, made up of 12 members, including six women (50% women) reflects\n\n# **1.1.3.4. THE ETHICS – CSR AND ANTICORRUPTION COMMITTEE**\n\nThe primary task of the Ethics – CSR and Anticorruption Committee is to ensure the compliance and results of the actions taken in terms of the promotion and respect of the Group'S values and commitments, and in particular the strict application of the ethical principles published in the Ethics and CSR Charter and the Code of Conduct. Under the authority of the Chairman of the Ethics – CSR and Anticorruption Committee appointed by the Chairman of the Bolloré Group, this body meets once or twice a year.

The Committee therefore approves the strategy, reviews performance and determines the prospects, projects and action plans with regard to the Group's priority risks and opportunities.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.1.3.5. THE RISK COMMITTEE**\n\nThe Head of CSR attends the meetings of the Risk Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, Vice-Chairman of the Group, and whose agenda includes the assessment of social and environmental risks. The CSR strategy with a risk-based approach was mentioned, as were the actions implemented to control those risks and the Group's duty of care plan. This Committee meets twice a year.\n\n# **1.1.3.6. THE CSR NETWORK: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GROUP CSR STRATEGY IN EACH BUSINESS LINE**\n\nThe CSR Department relies on a network of CSR directors and managers within the divisions, with whom it communicates on an ongoing basis to ensure that the policy adopted by the Group is applied in each division. The Department also works closely with the functional departments of the entire Group (Legal, Finance, Human Resources, Purchasing, Communication, etc.). The CSR Departments of the divisions and subsidiaries, which work closely with their own Management Committees, business experts (QHSE, HR, Purchasing, Sales & Marketing Department, etc.) and their network of local CSR delegates to roll out the Group CSR strategy in each entity and report essential non-financial information concerning the Bolloré Group.

These contributors report the indicators related to their non-financial performance to the Group CSR Department each year as part of the annual CSR reporting campaign.\n\n# **1.1.3.7. CROSS-FUNCTIONAL GOVERNANCE**\n\nImage /page/59/Figure/8 description: The image is a diagram illustrating a company's CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) structure and processes. It is divided into several sections, each representing a different aspect of CSR management.

PERFORMANCE MONITORING**\n\nNon-financial performance is monitored throughout the year by coordinating the Group's various priority projects (for example, work prior to the drafting of the Group's climate strategy, the mapping of human rights risks or the application of the Taxonomy Regulation, etc.). Risk management interviews are conducted by the head office CSR Department with the business line officers who are responsible for managing priority risks and locally, targeted thematic questionnaires (e.g. human rights questionnaire and analyses of energy consumption) also contribute to the assessment of the performance of both the Group and its divisions. The annual results are consolidated during the non-financial reporting campaign in Group entities around the world (see sections 1.3.1.1. – Methodology note for social reporting and 1.3.2.1. – CSR reporting methodology note) whose robustness, completeness and reliability have been significantly enhanced over the last ten years. The list of performance monitoring questions and indicators was updated in 2019 to best illustrate the management of the Bolloré Group's priority CSR and social risks, then was finalized in 2020. They are the subject of dedicated analysis to continue to strengthen their reliability each year. The indicators are, where relevant, provided to the Group and/or tailored specifically to the divisions according to their particular challenges. In accordance with the reporting requirements and disclosure of information on the company's CSR performance, the compliance of the Bolloré Group's DPEF with regard to the CSR priority risks identified and the fairness of the information presented is verified by an accredited independent third-party (quantitative audits and qualitative interviews) (see section 1.4. – Report by the independent third party on the consolidated non-financial performance statement).\n\nIn 2021, the Bolloré Group defined an initial set of measurable objectives, validated by the members of the Ethics – CSR and Anticorruption Committee, enabling it to strengthen the management of its CSR policy and establish a continued improvement approach. These commitments embody the Bolloré Group's CSR policy, implemented on a daily basis in each core business. Since 2021, the team at the Group CSR Department has focused its efforts onissues relating to the fight against climate change and ensuring Group compliance with regulations covering duty of care, taxonomy reporting and the CSRD.\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.1.4.1. SUMMARY OF OBJECTIVES AND PROGRESS OF THE CSR STRATEGY**\n\nThe summary table below shows the Group's objectives for each of the four pillars of its CSR strategy, as well as their progress on a consolidated scope including the Bolloré Logistics division, which was sold on February 29, 2024. The scope of engagement of the Group CSR strategy will be reviewed in 2024 to take into account two recent significant disposals (Bolloré Africa Logistics in 2022 and Bolloré Logistics in 2024), as well as the new expectations of the new European CSRD. This will involve setting new objectives with regard to a dual materiality analysis.\n\n| Pillars of the CSR strategy                                                          | Review of commitments

LISTENING TO ITS STAKEHOLDERS TO OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE**\n\n# **1.1.4.2.1. A GROUP THAT IS ATTENTIVE TO ITS STAKEHOLDERS**\n\nThe Group and its divisions are committed to taking into account the expectations and concerns of their internal and external stakeholders at all levels of the organization. The divisions and subsidiaries maintain ongoing dialog with their stakeholders (local communities, customers, suppliers, etc.), adapted to their local and operational contexts (see section 1.2.4.2.3. – Building and maintaining dialog with stakeholders). Moreover, in 2023, nearly 100% of Group entities completing the CSR reporting declared they were certified or had at least one site that was ISO 9001 certified. As part of this approach, a mapping of relevant stakeholders is required for the entities concerned.\n\nEvery year, the Group is attentive to the requirements of its external stakeholders. In 2021, the Group undertook an external stakeholder identification process (banks, funders, investors, customers, etc.). Exhaustive identification of their priorities and expectations and their level of influence on the Group was carried out. Taking local expectations into account strengthens the effectiveness of its due diligence mechanisms, which helps build a relationship of trust over the long term in areas such as:\n\n- **requirements and obligations arising from public authorities and regulatory and market institutions** (non-financial performance statement, law on the duty of care, Sapin II law, General Data Protection Regulation, the law on combating tax evasion, European taxonomy, Afep-Medef Code, AMF recommendations, etc.);\n- **investors:** the CSR Department, reporting to the Finance Department, works hand-in-hand with the Investor Relations team to integrate the requirements and respond to the expectations and questions sent to the Group;\n- **ESG rating bodies,** with which the Group strengthens its discussions each year in a bid to improve its ESG performance and better meet their expectations. Dialog with these rating bodies enables the Group to identify areas for improvement on ESG aspects, as well as to better understand its sector positioning. The Group Finance Department pays particular attention to this information, which is reported to the various Committees in which the CSR Department is represented each year (see 2023 main results in section 1.1.4.2.2 – Bolloré Group's non-financial performance ratings).\n- **customers** of its business units for whom it undertakes to provide the best quality products and services in compliance with its CSR commitments over its entire value chain (see section 1.2.4.2.3. – Building and maintaining dialog with stakeholders);\n- **suppliers and subcontractors** (see section 2.3.3. Duty of care approach in the supply chain, Group duty of care plan);\n- **local communities** with which the divisions conduct a structured dialog approach (see section 1.2.4.2.3. – Building and maintaining dialog with stakeholders);\n- **major multilateral institutions and agencies** (United Nations Global Compact);\n\n# • **media;**\n\n• associations and NGOs**.**\n\nThe Group also engages in an ongoing dialog with its internal stakeholders, such as employee representative bodies, in order to guarantee and promote a high-quality social dialog over the long term. This deployment occurs within the Group as part of negotiations with employee representatives or in other forms, depending on the laws of each country in the network. The Group's subsidiaries undertake to facilitate the expression of employees in countries where the International labour organization (ILO) conventions on the freedom to organize have not been ratified (see section 1.2.1.2.2. – Promoting social dialog and quality working conditions).\n\nIn 2021 Vivendi worked with a specialized firm to conduct a materiality analysis to measure the expectations of all its stakeholders regarding the CSR issues specific to its activities. The materiality analysis was developed in accordance with the risk universe of the non-financial risk map, after consultations with a sample that includes Vivendi's major stakeholder categories (business partners, authorities, civil society members, talent, employees and management). Nearly 3,300 responses from around 15 countries were analyzed (see section 1 – 1.3 – Ongoing dialog with stakeholders, and section 2 – 2.1 – The process for prioritizing CSR commitments, in Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document).\n\n# **1.1.4.2.2. BOLLORÉ GROUP 2023 NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS**\n\nOver the past three years, the ESG score assigned to the Group by the various bodies has stabilized and increased thanks to:\n\n- clarifications of the CSR strategy through various communication materials (non-financial performance statement, CSR report, charters, etc.);\n- the implementation of more consistent policies and relevant monitoring indicators;\n- more structured dialog between the CSR team and ESG analysts.\n\nESG rating agencies are selected according to several criteria:\n\n- the widespread use of their analyses by investors;\n- the publication of ESG scores on financial platforms;\n- a comprehensive assessment methodology that enables performance to be improved for all ESG aspects.\n\n|              | CDP                                                                                                                | Moody's ESG                                                                                                     | ISS ESG                                                                | Sustainalytics                                                                                                                                                           |\n|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Rating scale | Rating by tier:<br>• D- to D: Disclosure<br>• C- to C: Awareness<br>• B- to B: Management<br>• A- to A: Leadership | Performance level:<br>• Weak (0 to 29)<br>• Limited (30 to 49)<br>• Robust (50 to 59)<br>• Advanced (60 to 100) | ISS ESG Rating:<br>rating scale from 1 (low risk)<br>to 10 (high risk) | Rating scale:<br>• Severe (score above 40)<br>• High (score of 30 to 40)<br>• Medium (score of 20 to 30)<br>• Low (score of 10 to 20)<br>• Negligible (score of 0 to 10) |\n| 2023 rating  | • \"Climate Change\" = B<br>• \"Supplier Engagement\" = A-                                                             | • ESG score = 54/100<br>– Robust level                                                                          | • ISS ESG Rating:<br>– Score = 1 for E and S<br>– Score = 9 for G      | • ESG Score: 12.5 - Low Risk<br>• Sector rank (media): 31st out of 298                                                                                                   |\n\nThe Group's divisions are also regularly called upon by non-financial rating agencies:\n\n- Bolloré Logistics' CSR performance was assessed at Platinum level in 2023 by EcoVadis, which places the division in the top 1% performing companies assessed according to the EcoVadis standard;\n- with regard to industrial activities, the subsidiaries IER and Automatic Systems were awarded the Gold level in 2023 and ranked among the top 5% of companies assessed by the agency.\n- the Bolloré Energy division's performance was also assessed by EcoVadis and awarded a Silver medal in 2023.\n\nIndependently of the Bolloré Group's responses, Vivendi is still committed to communicating transparently with analysts and investors on ESG topics, and also endeavors to respond to the questionnaires from the main ESG rating agencies, in order to enable investors to better understand the Group's profile and the results of the CSR program *Creation for the Future* (see 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 1.3.1. – Constructive dialog with the financial community).\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.1.5. ANALYSIS OF THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE BOLLORÉ GROUP'S ACTIVITIES WITH REGARD TO THE EUROPEAN TAXONOMY**\n\nUnder the European Union's Sustainable Finance Action Plan launched in 2018, European Regulation 2020/852 of June 18, 2020 (the Taxonomy Regulation) introduces a single classification to establish whether an economic activity is environmentally sustainable, the aim being to encourage sustainable investments and redirect capital flows to meet European requirements for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving the climate neutrality target at European level by 2050.\n\nAn economic activity is said to be \"sustainable\", if it contributes substantially to one of the six environmental objectives of the Taxonomy Regulation, does not harm the other five objectives and respects minimum safeguards.\n\nIn accordance with this regulation, for fiscal year 2021, the Bolloré Group was subject to the obligation to publish the share of revenue, capital expenditure (Capex) and operating expenses (Opex) of activities eligible under the two climate objectives. In 2022, the activities defined as eligible were subject to an assessment to determine whether they are aligned with the technical criteria for climate change mitigation, do not cause significant harm to the other five environmental objectives and that they meet minimum safeguards.\n\nOn June 13, 2023, the European Commission published the Delegated Acts relating to the four other environmental objectives (transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and reduction, sustainable use and protection of aquatic and marine resources, protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems). For fiscal year 2023, the disclosure requirements concern the\n\n# **1.1.5.1. METHODOLOGY APPROACH**\n\n# **1.1.5.1.1. IDENTIFICATION OF ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES**\n\nTo meet this new reporting obligation, the Bolloré Group's CSR and Finance departments organized meetings on taxonomy reporting for the third consecutive year, in association with the CSR and Finance departments of each of the divisions and with the support of a specialized firm. The objectives of these meetings were to:\n\n- raise awareness and train the teams on the principle of taxonomy reporting;\n- identify eligible business segments within the meaning of the taxonomy;\n- analyze existing accounting standards and information at Group/division/ entity level;\n- present the technical alignment criteria expected for the main business segments identified as being eligible.\n\nThe identification of eligible business segments was updated in 2023 based on a methodological approach including a detailed analysis of the Group's activities with regard to the eligible economic activities described in the annex to the regulation. Furthermore, as a business activity sold in February 2024, Bolloré Logistics was excluded from taxonomy reporting pursuant to the rules of the European Commission under IFRS 5 (Delegated Act on article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation).\n\nThe eligibility and alignment analysis was conducted at a granular operational level such that there is no risk of double counting within the same taxonomy objective. Activities potentially eligible for several taxonomy objectives have been specifically identified and are presented in the \"Codes\" column of the regulatory tables.\n\nIn summary, the following Bolloré Group activities were considered as eligible:\n\n- at the Industry division, the manufacture of electric vehicles, automotive components and mobility components, high-, medium- and low-voltage electrical equipment for electricity transmission and distribution, research, development and innovation close to the market, electricity storage (identified respectively through activities 3.3, 3.18, 3.20, 9.1 and 4.10 in the annexes to the regulation) in respect of the climate change mitigation objective, as well as the provision of data-based IT/operational solutions through activity 4.1 and the manufacture of plastic packaging through activity 1.1 under the circular economy objective;\n- following the publication of the new activities by the regulation, the Group adopted a new interpretation of eligibility, identifying a more relevant activity concerning the manufacture of plastic packaging 1.1, which replaced activity 3.17 in 2022. As recycled materials, scraps and biosourced\n\neligibility and alignment of activities in respect of the first two environmental objectives as well as eligibility in respect of the four new environmental objectives.\n\nIn addition, the Commission has made targeted amendments to the Delegated Act on the climate component of the EU Taxonomy to extend its scope to economic activities contributing to climate change mitigation or adaptation that had yet to be included, concerning in particular the manufacturing and transport sectors. The Energy, Industry and Communications divisions have all been impacted by these changes.\n\nThe Vivendi group, which represents the Communications sector of the Bolloré Group, is also subject to the application of the Taxonomy Regulation. The results of the work are detailed in Vivendi's Non-Financial performance statement (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2, section 2.4. – European taxonomy).\n\nIn view of the immaterial nature of the alignment rates of investment expenses relating to rights of use published by the Lagardère group for fiscal year 2022 in its Non-Financial performance statement, and considering that the long-term portion of all property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and rights of use prior to January 1, 2022 as immaterial, given the proximity between the date on which Vivendi acquired control and the closing date of the fiscal year, the Lagardère group's sustainable investment expenses were excluded from the calculation of the long-term portion of Vivendi's investment expenses.\n\nor biochemical materials still account for a low share of the activity, the revenue of plastic packaging manufacturing (activity 1.1) has been classified as ineligible;\n\n- at the Energy division, capital expenditure (Capex) related to activities 6.6 and 7.3, respectively road freight transport and the installation, maintenance and repair of equipment promoting energy efficiency under the climate change mitigation objective;\n- for all divisions, individual Capex (activity 7.2) enabling the renovation of existing buildings as part of the climate change mitigation objective;\n- at the Communications Division, Vivendi's activities related to the production, broadcasting, programming of audiovisual content and the promotion of shows and music recordings are considered eligible for the climate change adaptation objective (activities 8.3 \"Programming and broadcasting\", 13.1 \"Creative, artistic and live entertainment activities\" and 13.3 \"Production of cinematographic films, videos and television programs; sound recording and music publishing\", as specified in appendix II of the Climate Delegated Act of June 4, 2021). In 2023, the set-top box rental business was considered as eligible under the circular economy transition objective (activity 5.5 \"Products as services and other circular service models focused on use and results\").\n\nThe following Bolloré Group activities were considered as ineligible:\n\n- under the European taxonomy, the transport of fossil fuels and biofuels cannot be eligible. As Bolloré Energy's economic activities relate to oil logistics and distribution, they do not fall within our scope of analysis for revenue;\n- regarding the Industry division, the production of dielectric films included in the composition of capacitors that can ultimately be used in the batteries of electric vehicles cannot be directly linked to a taxonomy-eligible activity;\n- regarding the FAQ of April 2021, activities in the agricultural sector are excluded. As the economic activities relating to olive groves and vines held by the Bolloré Group relate to this sector, they do not fall within the scope of analysis for revenue. No individually eligible investment expenditure was identified during the analysis;\n- at the Communications division, under current regulations, some Vivendi group activities are not eligible for the taxonomy, chiefly advertising, publishing, video games and magazines. Similarly, the activities of Lagardère Publishing, the Lagardère textbook publishing branch and Lagardère Travel Retail are not considered as eligible.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.1.5.1.2.

The work carried out established that 44% of the revenue generated by the Bolloré Group (including Vivendi) in 2023 is eligible and 1% is aligned under the three objectives of the European taxonomy (climate change mitigation and adaptation and the circular economy). Among the Industry division activities identified as eligible, only revenue related to \"Manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transportation\" (activity 3.3) can be considered as aligned with the climate change mitigation objective.\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\nThrough its clean transport solutions production activities at its subsidiary Blue Solutions, the division is supporting the energy transition by enabling the development of low-carbon transport services. This activity meets the criteria for substantial contribution to the climate change mitigation objective listed in the Delegated Act (see section 1.1.5.2.4. – Compliance with technical review criteria).\n\nRegarding Vivendi, the aligned portion of revenue for activity 8.3 \"Programming and broadcasting\" was determined based on a sample of the number of broadcasting hours of sustainable content relative to the total number of broadcasting hours of live programs. The aligned share of revenue for activity 13.3 \"Production of cinematographic films, videos and television programs; sound recording and music publishing\" was determined based on the amount of investments in \"green\" programs relative to all the investments made for theatrical releases in 2022.\n\nBy way of comparison, the Bolloré Group's consolidated revenue in 2022 amounted to 13,580 million euros (revenue at December 31, 2022 including Communications, restated for Bolloré Logistics). The work carried out in 2022 established that 43% of the revenue generated by the Bolloré Group in 2022 is eligible and 1% aligned under the two environmental objectives of the European taxonomy related to climate change. The slight increase in eligible activities between 2022 and 2023 is explained by the fact that, following the publication of new activities, the Group identified more eligible activities this year and extended the scope of analysis to other divisions of the Group.\n\n# **1.1.5.2.2.

This includes 100% of the Capex related to \"Manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transportation\" (activity 3.3) by the Industry division. Battery and electric vehicle manufacturing activities meet the criteria for a substantial contribution to the climate change mitigation objective listed in the Delegated Act (see section 1.1.5.2.4. – Compliance with technical review criteria).\n\nWith regard to the Communications sector, part of the Capex for three activities was considered to be aligned, namely activities 8.3 \"Programming and broadcasting\", 13.3 \"Production of cinematographic films, videos and television programs; sound recording and music publishing\" and 7.7 \"Acquisition and ownership of buildings\" under the climate change mitigation objective. By way of comparison, the Bolloré Group's consolidated taxonomy Capex at December 31, 2022 amounted to 2,799 million euros (data at December 31, 2022 including Communications, restated for Bolloré Logistics). The work carried out in 2022 identified that 77% of the Bolloré Group's Capex was eligible and 2% of eligible Capex was aligned with climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives. The increase in eligible Capex between 2022 and 2023 is explained by the fact that, following the publication of new activities, the Group identified more individually eligible Capex this year and extended the scope of analysis to other Group divisions.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.1.5.2.3. BREAKDOWN OF OPERATING INVESTMENTS (OPEX) FOR THE 2023 FISCAL YEAR**\n\nIn fiscal 2023, operating expenses (Opex), as defined by the Taxonomy, represented 332 million euros, i.e. less than 10% of the Bolloré Group's total consolidated operating expenses (including Communications). Given the expense items covered (the sum of unfunded research and development costs, building renovation costs, short-term leases and asset maintenance\n\n# **1.1.5.2.4. COMPLIANCE WITH TECHNICAL EXAMINATION CRITERIA**\n\nAt workshops organized in the second half of the year, the CSR and Finance Departments of each of the divisions determined the substantial contribution to the six objectives of the taxonomy for each activity identified as eligible and took stock of the existing policies and assessment processes that meet the DNSH criteria.\n\n# Substantial contribution criteria\n\nRegarding substantial contribution criteria, the eligible activities of the Bolloré Group contribute substantially to the objectives of climate change mitigation and adaptation through the following activities:\n\n- Activity 3.3 \"Manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transportation\": in accordance with the analysis carried out for alignment, the Bolloré Group considered that, through its clean transport solutions production activities at its subsidiary Bluebus, the division supports the energy transition by enabling the development of low-carbon transportation services offers and thus complies with the criteria for a substantial contribution to the climate change mitigation objective listed in the Delegated Act.\n- Activities 8.3, 13.3, \"Programming and broadcasting\" and \"Production of cinematographic films, videos and television programs; sound recording and music publishing\" respectively: in accordance with the analysis carried out for alignment, the Bolloré Group considered that, through its programming, creation, production and distribution activities at its Communications division, it raises awareness of climate change and its consequences through the development of sustainable program offers. Some content contributes to efforts to adapt other activities or other populations by raising awareness of climate change and its consequences.\n- Activity 7.7 \"Acquisition and ownership of buildings\": a review of compliance with the criteria on the substantial contribution of activity 7.7 \"Acquisition and ownership of buildings\" was carried out for the new office sites, based on the energy performance of the buildings according to the date of construction (energy performance certificate of at least class A or within the threshold of the top 15% of assets by country and according to the nominal capacity of the heating, ventilation or air conditioning equipment of the premises). These analyses revealed that the Bolloré Group complies with the criteria for a substantial contribution to the climate change mitigation objective listed in the Delegated Act.\n\n# Principle of not causing significant harm (DNSH)\n\n#### 1. **Climate change adaptation**\n\nThe Bolloré Group has assessed the exposure of all its eligible activities to physical climate risks according to two global warming scenarios (RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 of the IPCC) by 2030 and 2050.\n\nVivendi has conducted a map of physical climate risks covering all its activities, in particular capital expenditure (Capex) on real estate (economic activity 7.7).\n\nand repair costs), this indicator is not material in relation to the Group's activities and no eligibility or alignment analysis has been carried out. For the regulatory details of the key performance indicators by activity including the Communications sector, see section 1.1.5.2.6. – Details of key performance indicators – Regulatory tables.\n\nExamination of compliance with DNSH for activities 8.3 \"Programming and broadcasting\" and 13.3 \"Production of cinematographic films, videos and television programs; sound recording and music publishing\" was conducted via the mapping of physical climate risks carried out by the Vivendi group and the implementation of adaptation solutions, in accordance with the recommendations of the TCFD (TaskForce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures).\n\nBased on this mapping, the Vivendi group deploys appropriate adaptation solutions for each site, depending on the extent of the risks identified and the location of the asset in question.\n\nThe analysis of physical climate risks with respect to activity 3.3 \"Manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transportation\" did not reveal any\n\nabsolute exposure to physical risks at Bolloré Bretagne by 2050 (RCP 8.5). The Bolloré Group has therefore responded to the DNSH adaptation for all its aligned activities.\n\n#### 2. **Sustainable use and protection of hydrological and marine resources**\n\nAt the Industry division, an environmental impact assessment was carried out for all eligible battery and electric vehicle production sites (activities 3.3) to identify the risks related to the preservation of water quality and the prevention of water stress. Water pollution risk is a key risk identified for the division and is subject to specific mitigation measures (see section 1.2.3.2.2. – Preventing local pollution risks and industrial accidents).\n\n#### 3. **Transition to a circular economy**\n\nAt the Industry division, waste generated by eligible battery and electric vehicle production activities (activity 3.3) is managed by the sites in accordance with a formally drafted management plan. As part of an ecodesign approach, environmental assessments such as life cycle assessment, governed by ISO 14040, have been carried out since 2013 on Bluebuses (see section 1.2.3.2.3. – Optimizing waste management and promoting the circular economy).\n\n#### 4. **Pollution prevention and reduction**\n\nIn accordance with annex C, the Industry division's eligible electric vehicle production activities (activity 3.3) do not lead to the manufacture, marketing or use of the substances listed in the regulation and therefore meet the criterion of Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) to pollution prevention and control.\n\n#### 5. **Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems**\n\nIn accordance with annex D, all eligible electric vehicle manufacturing sites (activity 3.3) conducted an environmental impact study or impact assessment to assess the likely adverse impacts on biodiversity, particularly on protected species and habitats, as part of the facility authorization process. Where appropriate, these studies include measures to avoid, reduce and compensate for adverse environmental impacts and a description of alternative solutions.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.1.5.2.5. COMPLIANCE WITH MINIMUM SAFEGUARDS**\n\nAs part of taxonomy reporting, the Group's compliance with minimum safeguards is based on the analysis and verification of the due diligence process implemented to prevent, address and remedy human rights violations committed in connection with its own operations or activities that are part of its value chain.\n\nThe four key topics listed in the OECD guidelines, namely: bribery/corruption, human rights including workers' rights, fair competition, and taxation, have been targeted in the compliance analysis. The items mentioned in various international standards were summarized in an analysis grid to verify the Bolloré Group's compliance with each of the points required under the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nThe analysis shows that the ethical measures implemented by the Group comply with the criteria set in the most stringent standards:\n\n- human rights: the Group has established due diligence processes based on a process of mapping and identifying human rights issues (see section 1.2.2.2. – Promoting human rights in our value chain);\n- fair competition: the rules of competition law defined by States, the European Union and all international organizations apply to all Bolloré Group companies. Compliance with competition rules is enshrined in the Group's Code of Conduct and applies to all its employees and partners (see section 1.2.2.1. – Sharing the same business ethics and ensuring compliance with the strictest standards);\n- anticorruption programs: the Group's commitment is reflected in its zero tolerance policy for corruption risk (see section 1.2.2.1. – Sharing the same business ethics and ensuring compliance with the strictest standards);\n- taxation: to ensure compliance with the tax rules applicable in the countries where the Group operates, legal and tax teams are deployed centrally and locally to monitor the conduct required to comply with these rules. Compliance with these rules is set out in the Group's Code of Conduct to raise the awareness of all employees and business partners (see section 1.2.2.1.3. – The fight against tax evasion).\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.1.5.2.6.

Four key pillars of a sustainable commitment**\n\nWithin its four strategic areas of commitment, the Bolloré Group integrates all the resources implemented to manage its priority non-financial risks and seize opportunities. It therefore promotes, in all of its divisions, the implementation of virtuous and vigilant approaches to ensure that the policies, processes and improvement plans in place ensure its long-term nonfinancial performance. The Bolloré Group's management of priority risks is explained below.\n\nThe description of the Group's commitments provides summary details of Vivendi's policies, which mainly correspond to the Bolloré Group's Communications sector. However, the quantified indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding Vivendi. Consolidated Group data including Vivendi are presented, where available, in the social indicator summary tables (see section 1.3.1. – Summary tables of social indicators). Comprehensive information on Vivendi's policies and action plans is available in Vivendi's nonfinancial performance statement.\n\n# **1.2.1. UNITING AND PROTECTING PEOPLE, THE COMPANY'S GREATEST STRENGTH**\n\nThe Bolloré Group's activities are particularly exposed to the risk of workplace accidents. Accordingly, the health and safety of employees, subcontractors, and all persons indirectly exposed to the Group's activities is a major priority. In addition, the Group strives to be a leading employer, placing employee commitment and skills at the heart of its performance, by implementing specific actions to recruit the talent of the future in its various core businesses.\n\n# **1.2.1.1. PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND ENSURING THE SAFETY OF THE WOMEN AND MEN EXPOSED AS PART OF OUR ACTIVITIES**\n\n# **1.2.1.1.1. THE HEALTH AND SAFETY RISKS OF EMPLOYEES AND THIRD PARTIES**\n\n# Health and safety of employees and third parties(1)\n\n# *Prioritization of risks related to the health and safety of employees and third parties*\n\n| Transportation and logistics | Oil logistics  | Industry |       |         | Communications |\n|------------------------------|----------------|----------|-------|---------|----------------|\n| Bolloré Logistics            | Bolloré Energy | Blue     | Films | Systems | Vivendi        |\n\n(1) Priority non-financial risk.\n\nIn blue: priority non-financial risk at the division level.\n\nTransportation and logistics and industrial activities operate in environments with potentially high risks of accidents, and call for specific vigilance depending on the region. The issue is particularly material with regard to industrial activities, such as handling, production and assembly, construction, freight and passenger transport, and the handling and transportation of hazardous goods. As for its employees, one of the Bolloré Group's priority risks is ensuring the health and safety of partners and subcontractors working on its sites, as well as local communities which could be impacted by its activities. The risks relating to the safety of third parties in the context of freight and passenger transport operations are particularly material. For Vivendi, these risks materialize in limited activities (production, logistics related to the printing and distribution of books) or in connection with employees' travel abroad. The management of the priority CSR risks identified for Vivendi is explained in chapter 2 – Non-financial performance in Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document: Occupational health and safety risks for employees (see sections 4.3.1. – Improving quality of life at work and adapting to new working methods and Preserving health, safety and well-being at work and section 4.3.1.1. – Recognizing talent and growing together), and risks related to the health and safety of customers and users of products and services (see sections 1.3.2. – Listening to customers, 4.2.3. – Encouraging responsible content, 4.2.3.3. – Providing a protected environment to ensure a safe entertainment experience, and 4.3.3.3. – Simplifying customer engagement).\n\n# **1.2.1.1.2. LEADING MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THIRD PARTIES**\n\n# Group policy\n\nThe Group implements management systems based on recognized standards such as ISO 45001 on occupational health and safety management in all of its activities and locations. The implementation of these management systems ensures that the health and safety of Group employees is taken into account on a daily basis within a virtuous duty of care cycle, framed by appropriate policies and procedures to control this risk (see section 2 – Bolloré Group's duty of care plan). The Group is committed to investing in the prevention of workplace hazards and accidents, to improving working conditions and to training and raising awareness among its employees and stakeholders working on-site (e.g. subcontractors, external companies, partners, suppliers, customers, etc.).\n\nThe QHSE (Quality, Hygiene, Safety, Environment) Department of each division occupies a predominant place within the organizations and its main tasks are to:\n\n- coordinate, design, review and manage the continued improvement and service quality programs;\n- accompany development of the HSE culture and best practices, and;\n- guarantee maintenance of business line certifications leading to improved performances and a measure of confidence for customers.\n\nThe performance of QHSE policies is supervised by the Executive management teams of each division, which ensure that the resources required to implement, maintain and continually improve their QHSE management system are available. They set the objectives at their level, monitor application of action plans and ensure that any discrepancies are corrected through the analysis of incidents/accidents, audits, inspections and performance analysis to measure the efficiency of the QHSE management system.\n\nThe rules with which subcontractors must comply are also established and are subject to specific contractual requirements.\n\n# Objectives and progress\n\nTo standardize the divisions' policies, monitoring indicators and the implementation of targets at Group level, a set of indicators relating to employee and third party health and safety risk, shared by all divisions (excluding Vivendi) has been implemented since 2019 (see table – Indicators on the rollout of the Bolloré Group's HSE management system). This work was further reinforced by the setting of reasonable targets, validated in early 2021 by Executive management (members of the Ethics – CSR and Anti-Ccorruption Committee), and presented in the following table.\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.2.2.2.4. RESPECT OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORS CLOSE TO OUR OPERATIONS AND CONSTANT EFFORTS TO MAKE A POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY**\n\nAs part of an exercise to map risks and contextualize its human rights challenges, the Bolloré Group has identified this as a pillar of its commitment since its operations are liable to impact local populations and communities close to its operating sites, particularly in developing countries. In line with the procedure set out in its duty of care plan, Bolloré Group entities apply a process of reasonable diligence towards these external stakeholders in order to:\n\n- ensure their security with regard to the Group's activities (see section 1.2.1.2.2. – Promoting social dialog and quality working conditions);\n- offer them open dialog to ensure that they have a right to free and informed consent as well as collaboration opportunities (meetings with public authorities and neighboring communities) and in addition, provide them with a system through which they can raise concerns and file complaints, if necessary (see \"Establishing a whistleblowing and reporting system\" in the Group duty of care plan);\n- promote the right to a healthy environment by protecting the environment and preventing impacts on air and soil quality, access to drinking water and natural resources and other disturbances (see section 1.2.3. – Innovating in response to major environmental challenges).\n\nThe Group is also working on a progress initiative that sees it taking all reasonable and appropriate measures to optimize the positive external impacts of its operations throughout the value chain. In addition, the commitment to regional development is a major focus of the Group's CSR strategy (see section 1.1.2. – The Bolloré Group's non-financial risk mapping). As the Group is sometimes the leading employer in regions heavily impacted by development challenges (unemployment, infrastructure shortage, etc.), it is reinforcing its positive societal footprint, particularly through its sponsorship initiatives (see section 1.2.4.3. – Sponsorship policy), but also through its activities, which contribute to the opening up of territories, innovation and economic dynamism (local purchases, taxation and taxes, transfer of skills). More than 99.6% of employees are recruited locally. Moreover, the Bolloré Group relies on numerous partnerships with the schools and universities in its regions of operation, thus contributing to the dynamism of the regions in which it does business. Its training policy – open to employees of subcontractors in some regions – and the health coverage and vaccination campaigns it offers employees in regions lacking health facilities, also further its positive societal contribution.\n\n# **1.2.3. INNOVATING IN RESPONSE TO MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES**\n\nIn order to anticipate major societal changes and support the adaptations necessary for sustainable development, such as a reduction in the footprint of human activities on the environment or the promotion of the energy transition, the Bolloré Group is deploying mitigation measures for its adverse impacts, strengthening its climate strategy by setting goals for itself and investing for the long term in order to offer innovative low-carbon products and services. To support this approach, for more than ten years, the Group has relied on environmental reporting that covered 95% of the workforce (excluding Communications) and has drawn on a network of more than 300 contributors. To measure its performance and the efforts made to reduce negative environmental externalities related to its activities, the Group monitors the following indicators on an annual basis:\n\n- changes in direct and indirect energy-related GHG emissions (scopes 1 and 2), including the measurement of GHG emissions related to fuel, electricity and heating consumption;\n- changes in indirect GHG emissions related to the Group's operations (scope 3 and any scope 3 item deemed representative with regard to the activities is recognized), including the measurement of GHG emissions related to purchases of raw materials, freight, waste and business travel;\n- governance of environmental issues by the entities (policies, management systems, certifications, etc.), pollution and accident management, waste treatment and recyclability management, water management, share of consumption of electricity from renewable sources, etc. (see section 1.3.2.1 – CSR reporting methodology note).\n\n**Through its** *Creation for the Planet* commitment, Vivendi aims to help curb climate change and is pursuing a carbon reduction trajectory validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative. The group is also committed to getting its partners and suppliers involved in its approach and, thus further contribute to the global offsetting of carbon emissions. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 4.1. – *Creation for the Planet:* our environmental roadmap.\n\n# **1.2.3.1. REDUCING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AND ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\nTo clarify the Group's commitments, the presentation of \"Climate change risks and opportunities\" is aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Therefore, the Group has analyzed the main risks related to climate change in accordance with the international reporting framework (see section 1.3.3.2. – TCFD crossreference table).\n\n# **1.2.3.1.1.

In blue: priority non-financial risk at the division level.\n\nThe Bolloré Group has identified the challenges associated with climate change as priorities for all of its activities. The challenges raised by climate change concern the entire Group: the increase and intensification of extreme weather events are likely to significantly disrupt all of the Group's operations. For this reason, the Bolloré Group has continued and refined its transition risk analysis in order to strengthen its resilience approach in its business strategy (see section 1.2.3.1.3. – Management of the Group to reduce the impact of its operations on climate change), as well as an analysis of physical risks, which is needed to formalize adaptation plans.\n\nThe Vivendi group also identified the fight against climate change and adaptation strategies as major issues in its materiality matrix (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 2.3. – The main risks related to climate change).\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Key climate change transition risks and opportunities associated with the energy transition\n\nIn 2020, climate risks and opportunities were mapped for Bolloré's activities excluding Vivendi and, separately, for Vivendi's activities. Independently, the two groups were assisted by expert firms to identify the main risks for each business line. The conclusions are as follows:\n\n| Bolloré Logistics                  |                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Transition risk<br>and opportunity | Impact of carbon pricing<br>on operations                                                            | Strengthening control of GHG emissions, particularly through the carbon tax and emissions trading<br>system, both by countries and organizations (such as the International Maritime Organization and<br>the European Union's emissions trading system for air and maritime transport) could have an<br>impact on the transport and logistics sector.

The study was conducted based on the IPCC's RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 scenarios for 2030 and 2050. The Group decided to use the RCP8.5 scenario, the most pessimistic scenario regarding the concentration of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, to identify its main risks of exposure by 2050. Exposure was not assessed for the hazards identified as not presenting a significant perceived risk. These hazards were modeled for all of the Group's sites (offices and branches, warehouses, industrial and logistics sites), excluding Vivendi, which conducted its own assessment with an expert firm (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 2.3.1. – Overview of the main risks related to climate change), i.e. 350 sites divided into three types (tertiary site, industrial sites, logistics sites) with the support of an expert firm.\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor example, the \"heat wave\" hazard corresponds to the number of days a year with a \"wet bulb temperature\" greater than 30 °C, i.e. a temperature that makes working outside unbearable. It was considered that from ninety days a year exceeding this temperature, the level of risk exposure would\n\nFor each of these hazards, each site's exposure was determined by combining two components:\n\n- 1. absolute exposure: comparison of the site's exposure at different time horizons compared to physical risk thresholds, and;\n- 2. relative exposure: change in the site's exposure at different time horizons compared to the historical period.\n\n# *Number of sites with a very high level of exposure to various climatic hazards*\n\n|                                                            | Type of risk                                                                        | Office/Branch | Warehouse | Industrial site |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Number of very high risks<br>recorded at the various sites | • Extreme weather events (avalanches, storms, forest fires,<br>cyclones, tornadoes) | 7             | 0         | 0               |\n|                                                            | • Hydrographic hazards (flooding, landslides, heavy rainfall)                       | 1             | 0         | 0               |\n|                                                            | • Water risks (water stress, drought)                                               | 46            | 8         | 0               |\n|                                                            | • Thermal risks (thermal stress, heat waves)                                        | 43            | 15        | 0               |\n| Number of sites exposed<br>to at least one very high risk  |                                                                                     | 90            | 21        | 0               |\n| Number of sites                                            |                                                                                     | 263           | 62        | 25              |\n\nbe very high.\n\nThis site exposure analysis is a first step in the analysis of physical climate risks, which shall be supplemented by an analysis of the sites' vulnerability to these risks in order to assess whether observed high levels of exposure translate into a real risk in terms of working conditions, security or business continuity. The aim of this vulnerability analysis will also be to quantify the financial impacts of the aforementioned risks, taking into account the book value of the assets and the impact on operating expenses. This work was initially scheduled for 2023, but has not been carried out given the planned sale of Bolloré Logistics, which accounts for 91% of the sites analyzed and the vast majority of the most exposed sites. The final step will be to establish dedicated adaptation plans by exploring all the measures to be implemented at the individual site level in order to mitigate its vulnerability to physical climate risks.\n\n# **1.2.3.1.2. GROUP CLIMATE STRATEGY: MAKING THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT CENTRAL TO OUR BUSINESS LINES**\n\nRecognizing the important role the private sector plays in combating climate change, the Bolloré Group has been taking steps for several years to monitor, control and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Continuing the carbon footprint analysis it began in 2021 to define a carbon reduction trajectory, the Group strengthened its commitment in 2023 by setting medium-term targets.\n\nThe carbon reduction plan for Vivendi's activities, which sets out carbon emission reduction targets validated by SBTi in March 2023, aims to reduce these emissions by 2035 compared with a baseline year of 2018. The objectives set cover Vivendi's most significant areas of activity in order of their contribution to its carbon footprint. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 4.1.2.2. – Science-Based Targets commitments and carbon reduction objectives.\n\n# Group governance in the face of climate-related risks and opportunities\n\nReporting to the Finance Department, the Bolloré Group CSR Department coordinates the CSR strategy with the assistance of specialized committees, and through the Head of CSR's presence at the meetings of the Audit Committee, Executive Committee, Risk Committee, and Ethics – CSR and Anticorruption Committee.\n\nIn terms of corporate governance, the Bolloré Group refers to the French Corporate Governance Code for listed companies established by the Afep and the Medef. At its meeting on March 14, 2023, the Board was invited to consider the changes made in the new version of the Code published in December 2022 aimed at ensuring that the Board of Directors integrates the CSR strategy in its duties. With regard to the creation of a dedicated CSR Committee, after reiterating that the Audit Committee reviews non-financial risks as part of its current duties, the Board members decided that the Board of Directors will continue to refer to the work of the Audit Committee, whose responsibilities were extended to all CSR issues.\n\nAs part of the implementation of this recommendation, the following meetings were held in 2023:\n\n- on March 6, 2023, the independent directors, together with the Head of CSR, convened for an initial training on environmental and climate issues provided by a third-party organization;\n- on July 26, 2023, the Head of CSR presented the CSR strategic guidelines (including a focus on the climate strategy) to the Audit Committee;\n- on October 11, 2023, the independent directors met with the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Head of CSR and experts from an outside firm.\n\nThis work showed that the Group needed to be able to present targets for reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and to specify the trajectory to which it is committed in order to meet the expectations of its stakeholders. A firm of experts assisted in analyzing the carbon footprint and identifying carbon reduction opportunities, and a strategy with precise objectives was defined for a given timeframe.\n\nOn 20 October 2023, the Board of Directors approved the climate strategy submitted to it by the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Head of CSR. In addition, the analysis of the physical risks associated with climate issues initiated in 2022 was taken into account in the Bolloré Group's risk management processes in order to comply with the new European regulation concerning the classification of \"sustainable\" economic activities under the taxonomy (see section 1.1.5. – Analysis of the sustainability of the Bolloré Group's activities with regard to the European taxonomy).\n\n# Climate objectives and trajectory\n\nIn 2023, with the help of a specialized firm, the Bolloré Group carried out work to implement a decarbonization strategy. This structured approach will determine quantified reduction targets in light of an action plan and investments to reduce the impact of all activities on the climate in the medium term (five to ten years). This work was carried out in compliance with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) methodology for the carbon footprint and carbon reduction target calculations. This process consisted of the following three phases:\n\n# • **phase 1: analysis of the Group's carbon footprint to identify the areas generating the most GHG.**\n\nTo calculate its carbon footprint, Bolloré essentially follows the methodology of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, an international protocol aimed at providing a regulatory framework for accounting and reporting GHG emissions. The Group publishes figures for its direct and indirect emissions linked to the energy consumed by the Group (scopes 1 and 2), as well as a portion of its indirect emissions under scope 3 deemed significant with regard to its activities (see section 1.3.2.2 – 2023 environmental data). The carbon footprint reviewed during 2023, on the basis of 2022 GHG emissions, led to several observations: the Group's scope 3 emissions (excluding Bolloré Logistics) account for 99% of total emissions, concentrated mainly on the sale of petroleum products by Bolloré Energy (80%). Scopes 1 and 2 emissions are generated by electricity consumption by the Communications(1) (67%) and Industry (20%) divisions.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n• **phase 2: identification and quantification of decarbonization drivers.** Following the analysis of the 2022 carbon footprint and the interviews\n\nconducted with the divisions, the main efforts to reduce GHG emissions will focus on the following carbon reduction drivers:\n\n- continuing Bolloré Energy's product diversification strategy, which entails investing in the development of biofuels that emit fewer greenhouse gases than traditional petroleum products;\n- purchasing electricity from renewable sources for all Group divisions, especially the Communications and Industry divisions;\n- purchasing low-carbon vehicles for the Bolloré Energy fleet.\n\nFurthermore, in line with the Group's commitments, all activities are adapting their business strategies to take account of climate-related risks and opportunities (see the paragraph below, Resilience of the organization's strategy).\n\n• **phase 3: development of a decarbonization roadmap and definition of reduction targets.**\n\nAfter measuring the capacity of its businesses to reduce their emissions, and integrating Vivendi's quantified commitments (see section 4.1.2 – Reducing the carbon footprint of our businesses in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement), the Group defined its reduction targets. The results of the research were analyzed in the light of the requirements of the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n\nOn October 20, 2023, the Board of Directors of Bolloré SE approved the climate strategy as follows:\n\n# *Climate strategy targets for 2030 compared to 2022*\n\n| Scopes 1 and 2 objective | 42% reduction taking into account the commitments made by Vivendi in March 2023 and in line with the Paris Agreement<br>trajectory to limit global warming to 1.5 °C. |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Scope 3 objective        | 30% reduction in the \"combustion of petroleum products sold\" post thanks in particular to Bolloré Energy's investments<br>in biofuels.                                |\n|                          | This objective will contribute to a 19% reduction in scope 3 emissions for the entire Group in 2030 compared to 2022.                                                 |\n\nEach significant change in the Group's scope will trigger a recalculation of the carbon reduction targets presented above, taking into account the requirements of climate strategy standards (Greenhouse Gas Protocol and Science-Based Targets initiative), which call for reassessment of GHG emissions for the baseline year whenever there is a significant change in the scope of consolidation.\n\n# Concrete initiatives to develop low-carbon products and services in each of the activities\n\nThe Group is involved in long-term investment processes. The diverse range of its activities strengthens its resilience to the vagaries of the market and allows it to create employment by adjusting its business lines and making low-carbon solutions an opportunity for the development of its products and services aligned with major energy transition and climate change challenges. The Group's commitment is illustrated by the concrete initiatives taken by its divisions and by investments to develop low-carbon products and services.\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\n# Bolloré Logistics\n\nGenerating more than 34% of the Bolloré Group's scope 3 GHG emissions, Bolloré Logistics has made CO2 reduction commitments, in particular for its downstream scope 3 emissions, corresponding to carbon emissions linked to the execution of its transportation services, in order to contribute to the decarbonization of the transport and logistics sector.\n\n# *Scope 3 commitments and objectives*\n\nBolloré Logistics set targets to reduce GHG emissions linked to the performance of transport services starting from 2020. To strengthen its climate plan, Bolloré Logistics officially committed to the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 2022 via a commitment letter and submitted its new reduction targets in October 2023, taking into account the sale of its activities in Africa at the end of 2022. The process to obtain SBTi validation is scheduled for the first half of 2024. Based on the latest SBTi sector-specific recommendations and methodologies, the target was calculated with the SDA method for air and sea and the ACA method for road freight; it is aligned with the 1.5 °C trajectory. The objective is a 22% reduction in GHG emissions on its downstream scope 3 in absolute terms by 2030 for its entire network (baseline: 2022).\n\n# *Roadmap*\n\nThe roadmap already drawn up for this scope and described below generated even greater involvement from our teams in 2023. All Bolloré Logistics business lines are concerned and involved, including purchasing, operations, trade, innovation, CSR, QHSE, legal and customs experts. Every day, teams are focused on improving the standardization of environmentally-responsible transportation solutions for all customers and on delivering bespoke carbon reduction plans for key accounts. All carbon reduction solutions are considered across all segments of the supply chain.\n\nThe approach followed by Bolloré Logistics for several years focuses on the design and offering of services aimed at CO<sup>2</sup> efficiency for Transportation and logistics solutions. The company is continuously strengthening its action plans in line with its increasingly strong commitments, as well as those of its customers, importers and exporters, in three ways:\n\n**1. Strengthening the low-carbon approach in the value chain**\n\n• **Participate in ecosystem initiatives and assist customers to reduce the environmental impact of their supply chain:** In 2023, alternative fuels with better carbon efficiency were further developed across the entire Bolloré Logistics network and all modes of transport. To successfully implement a customized reduction plan, Bolloré Logistics offers its customers the Powering Sustainable Logistics PACT, which seeks to define common CO2 reduction targets, including for issues related to packaging. To contribute to its downstream scope 3 commitments and better help its customers create value through decarbonization, in early 2023 the Europe CSR Department launched an initiative called \"Beyond Carbon\" founded on active listening and codevelopment with customers to find more carbon efficient transportation solutions (see section 1.2.4.2.3. – Building and maintaining dialog with stakeholders, paragraph on \"Illustration of dialog with stakeholders\"). Everywhere it operates, Bolloré Logistics regularly organizes customer events to build awareness around the environmental impact of transport and existing low-carbon solutions. For example, customized coconstruction workshops were held within the network, particularly in the B'Lab innovation centers, and Climate Fresk events were organized with customers in the various regions of the company's network.\n\n- **Systematically incorporating environmental performance criteria into the listing, selection and assessment of transport suppliers and subcontractors:** shipping companies and airlines are subject to an annual ESG assessment whose score directly impacts the purchasing policy integrated into internal service design support tools. The environmental aspect is also integrated into the service level and is subject to regular business reviews. At the start of 2023, the weighting of this assessment was increased in the overall score. Furthermore, carriers must list themselves on a digital platform that includes compliance, safety and environmental criteria. Only subcontractors declared active are operational, after first being approved internally in a clearly established circuit. Carrier QHSE audits round out this system.\n- **Training sales teams, the first advisors on Bolloré Logistics' sustainable supply chain solutions for customers:** to provide the best possible support for customers in their choice of low-carbon transport and logistics solutions, Bolloré Logistics is focused on building the skills of the company's sales teams. To achieve this, the second edition of the B'Sustainable Supply program for global sales teams was held in early 2023. It adopts a gamification strategy to better integrate the environmental challenges of the supply chain and low-carbon alternatives. The CSR community organized more than 45 live webinars in each region around the world. At the end of this second edition, more than two-thirds of salespeople, freight buyers and contractual logistics managers committed to this voluntary training program, enabling the gradual formation of a network of green champions within the sales teams.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.3.3.2. TCFD CROSS-REFERENCE TABLE**\n\nBolloré Group supports the recommendations of the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures). The TCFD is a working group that focuses on climate-related financial disclosures, created as part of the G20's Financial Stability Board during the COP21.

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.*\n\nTo the General Assembly,\n\nIn our quality as an independent third party, accredited by the Cofrac under the number no. 3-1681 (scope of accreditation available on the website www.cofrac.fr), we conducted our work in order to provide a conclusion expressing a limited level of assurance on the compliance of the consolidated non-financial statement for the year ended December 31, 2023 (hereinafter the \"statement\") with the provisions of article R. 225-105 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)* and on the fairness of the historical information (whether observed or extrapolated) provided pursuant to 3° of I and II of

misstatements that would call into question the fact that the consolidated non-financial statement is not presented in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements and that the information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the guidelines, in all material respects.\n\n# **PREPARATION OF THE NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT**\n\nThe absence of a generally accepted and commonly used framework or established practices on which to base the assessment and measurement of information allows for the use of different, but acceptable, measurement techniques that may affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\nTherefore, the information should be read and understood with reference to the guidelines, the significant elements of which are presented in the statement.\n\n# **LIMITATIONS INHERENT IN THE PREPARATION OF THE INFORMATION**\n\nThe information may be subject to uncertainty inherent in the state of scientific or economic knowledge and the quality of external data used.\n\n# **THE ENTITY'S RESPONSIBILITY**\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Management to:\n\n- select or establish appropriate criteria for the

commercial code *(Code de commerce)* and the French code of ethics of our profession *(Code de déontologie de la profession de commissaire aux*\n\n# **MEANS AND RESOURCES**\n\nOur verification work mobilized the skills of six people and took place between September 2023 and March 2024 on a total duration of intervention of about eight weeks.\n\n# **NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE WORK**\n\nWe planned and performed our work taking into account the risks of material misstatement of the information.\n\n- In our opinion, the procedures we have performed in the exercise of our professional judgment enable us to provide a limited level of assurance:\n- we obtained an understanding of all the consolidated entities' activities and the description of the principal risks associated;\n- we assessed the suitability of the criteria of the guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability, with due consideration of industry best practices, where appropriate;\n- we verified that the statement includes each category of social and environmental information set out in article L. 225-102-1 III of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)* as well as compliance with human rights and anticorruption and tax avoidance legislation and includes, where applicable, an explanation for the absence of the information required under article L.

all the consolidated entities' activities, including where relevant and proportionate, the risks associated with its business relationships, its products or services, as well as its policies, measures and the outcomes thereof, including key performance indicators associated to the principal risks;\n- we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to: – assess the process used to identify and confirm the principal risks as well as the consistency of the outcomes, including the key performance indicators used, with respect to the principal risks and the policies presented, and,\n- corroborate the qualitative information (measures and outcomes) that we considered to be the most important presented in appendix 1; concerning certain risk (corruption and influence peddling, risks and opportunities related to relations with local communities, risks related to attracting and retaining external talent, risks related to the cultural\n\n*comptes).* In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and the ethical requirements.\n\nWe

Canal+ Polska SA, Canal+ UES, Havas Health Inc., Havas Media Group Spain, Shobiz Experiential Communications Pvt Ltd, Gameloft Vietnam – Ho Chi Minh, Gameloft Spain – Barcelona, See Tickets BV, GVA Gabon;\n\n- we verified that the statement covers the scope of consolidation, i.e. all the consolidated entities in accordance with article L. 233-16 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)* within the limitations set out in the statement;\n- we obtained an understanding of internal control and risk management procedures the entity has put in place and assessed the data collection process to ensure the completeness and fairness of the information;\n- for the key performance indicators and other quantitative outcomes that we considered to be the most important presented in appendix 1, we implemented:\n- analytical procedures to verify the proper consolidation of the data collected and the consistency of any changes in those data,\n- substantive tests, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the proper application of the definitions and procedures and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. This work was carried out on a selection of contributing entities and covers between 14.5% and 49.2% of the consolidated data relating to the key performance indicators and outcomes selected for these tests (14.5% of the workforce, 48.5% of electricity consumption, 49.2% of non-hazardous waste, 26.5% of the number of workplace accidents with work time lost);\n- we assessed the overall consistency of the statement based on our knowledge of all the consolidated entities.\n\nWe believe that the work carried out, based on our professional judgement, is sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.\n\nParis-la Défense, April 12, 2024\n\nFrench original signed by: Independent third party EY & Associés\n\nPhilippe Aubain Partner, Sustainable Development\n\n",

undergone two major transformations over the past year:\n\n- it left the logistics sector,\n- it acquired the Lagardère group.\n\nAfter selling our African logistics business to MSC, the world's leading shipping company managed and controlled by our friends, the Aponte family, we have now reached an agreement to sell our freight forwarding business to CMA CGM, managed and controlled by the Saadé family, whom we have known for over thirty years. We know that these two families will continue to grow these wonderful businesses. These transactions have also been well received by the employee representatives.\n\nAfter more than two years of analysis and the authorization of the European Commission, Vivendi was able to acquire around 60% of the Lagardère group. Founded by Jean-Luc Lagardère, and managed by Arnaud for the past eighteen years, both friends of our family, the group has significant global business activities in two sectors: publishing and travel retail, in which the group ranks among the top three worldwide.\n\nThese profound changes are not unusual for our Group. From paper to plastics, transport, oil, communications, we have continually sought to develop new sectors and then pass them to new partners, better placed than us, to develop them further. All this, of course, while creating significant value for our Group.\n\nAs we write these words, the Group is entering its 203rd year. Let us hope that, despite a concerning international environment, we will continue on our positive path, never forgetting to support charitable initiatives, and thanking all those who work for Compagnie de l'Odet and the Bolloré Group for their past performance and for their future vigilance and solidarity.\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/0 description: A man with white hair is wearing a blue scarf and a black and blue jacket with yellow trim.

The foreground features several security turnstiles with white posts and transparent barriers, some accented with a green stripe. These are arranged in a row, suggesting a controlled access point. Behind the turnstiles, a large, abstract sculpture stands prominently, catching the light and reflecting the surrounding environment. The building's architecture includes a high ceiling with a grid-like structure, possibly a skylight, allowing natural light to flood the space. The walls are made of reflective material, likely glass or polished metal, which adds to the brightness and openness of the area. The floor has a warm, reddish-brown tone, contrasting with the cooler colors of the walls and ceiling. Text at the bottom reads \"4 Compagnie de l'Odet – 2023 Annual report\".\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/0 description: The image shows a close-up of a dark brown surface with a vertical white line on the left side.

The stability of its shareholder base enables it to follow a long-term investment policy. Ever since it was founded, the Group has stood out thanks to its ability to adapt to innovative services and solutions, and its international diversification strategy, while ensuring that it has positive social and environmental impacts. Today, armed with a solid financial structure, it makes investments within its own business lines (oil logistics, communications and industry), and perhaps tomorrow in new business sectors.\n\nImage /page/7/Picture/3 description: The image shows several statistics. There are more than 76,000 employees. The company operates in 91 countries across 5 continents. The revenue in 2023 was 14 billion euros. The adjusted operating income (EBITA) in 2023 was 1 billion euros. The equity at the end of 2023 was 33 billion euros.\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/1 description: The image shows a white line drawing of a delivery truck with a clock on top of it. The truck is facing right and has lines behind it to indicate motion. The background is a teal square.\n\n# **Oil logistics**\n\nBolloré Energy is a major player in oil distribution and oil logistics in France and in Europe. Since 2018, Bolloré Energy has diversified its product range to offer its customers cleaner alternatives and enable them to significantly reduce CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/4 description: The image is a purple square with a white icon of two overlapping speech bubbles. The larger speech bubble is on the left, and the smaller one is on the right. The speech bubbles are outlined in white.\n\n# **Communications**\n\nThe Bolloré Group's Communications division is based on its holdings: – in Vivendi, with: Groupe Canal+, no. 1 in pay-TV in France, Lagardère, the world's third largest book publisher for the general public and educational markets and no. 1 in France. The world's fifth largest retailer in transport hubs and the second largest retailer in airports, Havas, one of the largest communication groups in the world, Prisma Media, a leading bi-media group in France ranking number one in magazines, online video and daily digital audience ratings; Gameloft, a leader in mobile video games; – in Universal Music Group, the world leader in musical entertainment.\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/7 description: The image shows a blue square with rounded corners. Inside the square is a speech bubble shape, also in blue. Within the speech bubble is a white battery icon with a lightning bolt symbol inside it.\n\n# **Industry**\n\nThe Blue division brings together the Group's industrial activities, alongside Blue Solutions, Bluebus and Bluestorage. The Films division specializes in ultra-finish retractable packaging films and dielectric films for capacitors. The Systems division relies on the know-how and expertise of several Bolloré Group entities brought together around a shared objective: offering an optimization ecosystem for flows of people, materials and data.\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/10 description: The image shows a blue speech bubble with three white circles inside. The circles are arranged horizontally in the upper part of the bubble.\n\n# **Other assets**\n\nAlongside its three core businesses, the Bolloré Group manages a portfolio of financial investments representing holdings that totaled around 16.6 billion euros at the end of 2023, including the Compagnie de l'Odet and Bolloré portfolio (Universal Music Group, Socfin group, etc.), worth 9.0 billion euros, and the Vivendi portfolio (Universal Music Group, Telecom Italia, MediaForEurope, FL Entertainment), worth 7.6 billion euros.\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Key figures\n\n# Profit and loss statement\n\n(in millions of euros)\n\n|                                                                                         | 2023(1)    | 2022(1)    | 2021(2)    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Revenue                                                                                 | 13,678     | 13,634     | 16,638     |\n| EBITDA(3)                                                                               | 1,369      | 1,607      | 1,386      |\n| Adjusted operating income (EBITA(3))                                                    | 981        | 1,078      | 822        |\n| Operating income<br>of which operating equity methods(4)                                | 753<br>313 | 806<br>373 | 426<br>130 |\n| Financial income                                                                        | (114)      | (1,066)    | (49)       |\n| Share of net income of non-operating companies<br>accounted for using the equity method | (76)       | (346)      | (583)      |\n| Taxes                                                                                   | (198)      | (83)       | (278)      |\n| Net income from discontinued operations<br>and assets held for sale                     | 155        | 3,396      | 20,673     |\n| Net income                                                                              | 520        | 2,706      | 20,189     |\n| Of which Group share                                                                    | 122        | 1,904      | 3,264      |\n\n(1) In accordance with IFRS 5 and to ensure the comparability of results, reclassifications into discontinued operations or operations\nheld for sale concern the Group's Transport and logistics activities outside Africa in the 2022 and 2023 fiscal years (these activities have been earmarked for sale since May 8, 2023).

It sold its port and logistics activity in Africa to the MSC group in December 2022, and the international freight forwarding and logistics business (Bolloré Logistics) was sold to CMA CGM in February 2024. These two disposals have helped to strengthen the Group's financial capacity, and it plans to make new investments in its existing business lines and/or in new business segments. The Group will remain family-owned and will continue to develop its three business sectors: (i) Oil logistics; (ii) Communications and (iii) Industry.\n\nA strategy for the Group to diversify into the oil distribution market with, by 2028, a range of alternative fuels contributing to the energy transition.\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/4 description: A wide shot shows a large, white storage tank with the words \"BOLLORE ENERGY\" written on it in blue and green. A metal staircase leads up the side of the tank, and a person is walking up the stairs. In front of the tank is a white truck with the word \"BOLLORE\" written on the side. A person is standing next to the truck. In the background, there are other storage tanks and trees. The sky is blue and clear.\n\n# **Oil logistics**\n\nBolloré Energy is a key player in oil distribution and oil logistics in France, Switzerland and Germany. Bolloré Energy is also a player in the consolidation of the oil products distribution sector in France (see the acquisition of Sicarbu and a dozen businesses every year) and is also continuing to invest in its network of service stations in Germany.\n\nTo cope with the structural decline in the oil distribution market, Bolloré Energy is pursuing a strategy to diversify into the storage of petroleum products (launch in 2018 of the Dépôt Rouen Petit-Couronne activity – storage capacity of nearly 600,000 m3) and has also continued to invest in the development of alternative fuels such as biodiesel (B100), synthetic diesel (HVO) and bio fuel oil containing 30% biofuel in order to reduce its carbon footprint and thereby contribute to the energy transition. Lastly, it has established isglö, which specializes in improving the energy efficiency of homes and buildings.\n\n# **Communications**\n\nIn September 2012, the Group acquired a stake in Vivendi of which it became the leading shareholder and in which it currently owns a 29.9% interest. Vivendi has been fully consolidated by Bolloré since April 2017.\n\nSince 2014, Vivendi has built a global content, media and communications group based on a strategic roadmap focused on transformation, internationalization and the greater integration of its business lines. To that end, Vivendi is continuing to develop its three main businesses. In the audiovisual and media sectors, Groupe Canal+ has set itself a target of reaching 30 million subscribers by 2025. Achieving this objective will require it to continue increasing its international subscriber base, either through organic growth or acquisitions. Groupe Canal+ has therefore acquired significant stakes in MultiChoice in South Africa and Viu in Asia, the second largest OTT service in terms of number of subscribers (more than 12 million) in this region. After M7 in 2019, in 2023 it also acquired SPI, which operates in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nIn communications, Havas Group is continuing with its policy of making targeted acquisitions in order to strengthen its presence in strategic geographical regions and/or in specific business lines. Since 2015, the company has made between five and nine acquisitions on average per year and is expected to continue at this rate over the next few years.\n\nThe Vivendi group is also looking to continue growing its publishing business in order to become a global player in promoting creation, authors, knowledge and culture. Following its public tender offer for Lagardère, which closed in June 2022, Vivendi holds more than 60% of its share capital. In order to obtain the European Commission's authorization to acquire Lagardère, Vivendi sold Editis, the second largest publisher in France (acquired in 2019), together with the magazine *Gala*, owned by Prisma Media. The closing of these transactions on November 21, 2023 enabled Vivendi to finalize its combination with Lagardère.\n\nIn order to fully unlock the development potential of all its business activities, Vivendi, in December, proposed reviewing the possibility of splitting Vivendi into several entities, each of which would be listed on the stock market and structured around four entities: Groupe Canal+, Havas, a company combining the publishing and distribution assets (Lagardère and Prisma Media),\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/1 description: The image shows a page from a document. The page is divided into two parts. The left part features a poster for the TV show \"Mister Spade\". The poster has a group of people at the top, and a man standing in a pool of water at the bottom. The text \"Le calme attendra\" is written above the man. The title of the show, \"Mister Spade\", is written in large letters at the bottom of the poster. The right part of the page contains the text \"OVERVIEW OF THE GROUP AND ITS ACTIVITIES 1\". Below this text is a paragraph that reads, \"With more than 500 electric buses on the road worldwide, the Group is one of the preferred partners of carbon-free transport players, thanks in particular to its 'solid-state' LMP® batteries.\" Below the text is a picture of a bluebus vehicle 100% electrique.\n\nCanal+ has set itself a target of reaching 30 million subscribers by 2025. Promising original creations for\n2024 include: *Mister Spade* by Scott Frank.\n\nand a company holding listed and unlisted financial interests in the culture, media and entertainment sectors. This project, if completed, would create value for all the Group's stakeholders and would create independent pure players with the necessary human resources and financial agility to pursue their own growth trajectory in an international context marked by numerous investment opportunities.\n\nLastly, following the listing and distribution of Universal Music Group (UMG) in September 2021, the Bolloré Group holds an 18% stake in UMG, while Vivendi holds 10%. UMG is the world leader in recorded music. It will continue to rely on the growth in streaming and its proximity to artists in growing its worldwide revenue and its unrivaled catalog.\n\n# **Industry**\n\nThe Industry sector comprises: (i) Blue, with the Group's e-mobility activities including LMP® electric batteries, the production of clean transport solutions and the marketing of energy storage solutions; (ii) Films, which includes the production of polypropylene films for capacitors and films for food and industrial packaging; (iii) Systems, which offers a range of solutions and equipment to optimize flows of people, equipment and data.\n\nThe Bolloré Innovative Thin Films division is continuing to develop new high-tech products, particularly in recyclable ultra-thin retractable packaging films, which will enable it to continue growing its commercial activities internationally. As part of this commercial strategy, it is also continuing to make industrial investments, within its capacities, in order to increase the proportion of films it produces with higher added value.\n\nThe Group has made Blue Solutions' activities a major priority for development, thanks in particular to its innovative \"solid-state\" batteries, which are based on proprietary Lithium Metal Polymer (LMP®) technology, and whose commercial applications currently cover 6-meter and 12-meter electric buses, in particular through contracts with the RATP and a number of major urban areas in France and Belgium, as well as electricity storage. Since 2022, the Group has been stepping up its R&D efforts through strategic collaboration agreements with university laboratories in France and Switzerland in order to develop, ahead of its competitors, a new battery (Gen4) that can be used in the automotive industry. Blue Solutions is working with automotive manufacturers and suppliers to fine-tune technical developments and ensure that the technology directly addresses the needs of their upcoming electric vehicle platforms.\n\nWithin the Systems division, Automatic Systems (AS), the global leader in automated secure entry control (pedestrian, vehicle, passenger access), is developing successfully, thanks in particular to its product innovations and the quality of its experts. IER benefits from the dynamism of the self-service equipment business and biometric registration terminals, and the EASIER solutions, which combine AS's and IER's products and services and continue to demonstrate their worth by winning major calls for tender for public transport projects in France and abroad.\n\nLastly, the Group will continue to manage its portfolio of financial investments and its agricultural assets (vineyards, olive groves, etc.) while reviewing the possibility of using its new financial capacities to make new investments.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Business model\n\n— Systemic and synthetic representation of the Group, its creation of economic value and the sharing of that value between its various stakeholders in 2023 and its contributions to society.\n\n# Our resources Our activities\n\n# **Human**\n\n76,206 employees in 91 countries 85% full-time workforce 88.7% of workforce on open-ended contracts 20.5% turnover\n\n# **Strong regional roots**\n\nDetailed knowledge of local stakeholders thanks to strong regional and cultural roots.

This launch, alongside *Mortelle Adèle* and *Les Clés de mon énergie*, the acquisition of *Côté Maison* and the acquisition of a majority stake in *Milk Magazine*, have consolidated Prisma Media's position as the leader in magazine and digital publishing in France.\n\n# Vivendi also has a unique portfolio of listed and unlisted investments in the media, entertainment and culture sector valued at 7.6 billion euros as\n\nof December 31, 2023. It includes holdings in UMG, Telecom Italia, MediaForEurope, FL Entertainment, Telefónica and Prisa.\n\nVivendi has successfully supported the transformation and the internationalization of its assets, which have become leaders in their respective business sectors. However, since the listing and distribution of Universal Music Group in 2021, the group has suffered from a very high conglomerate discount. In order to fully unlock the development potential of all its activities, on December 13, 2023, Vivendi's Management Board proposed to the Supervisory Board that it review the possibility of splitting Vivendi into several entities, each of which would be listed on the stock market. This project would be structured around Groupe Canal+, Havas, a company combining the publishing and distribution assets (Lagardère and Prisma Media), and a company holding listed and unlisted financial interests in the culture, media and entertainment sectors.\n\nSince this announcement, the group has been reviewing the feasibility review. In any event, if the Supervisory Board authorizes the Management Board to go ahead with the project, a number of important steps will have to be taken. These include consultation with the employee representative bodies of the entities concerned, before which no decision in principle will be taken, obtaining the necessary regulatory authorizations, the required approvals from the group's creditors and the consent of Vivendi's shareholders at a General Meeting. As indicated on December 13, such a transaction would take between twelve and eighteen months to complete.\n\n# **CONTENT, MEDIA, COMMUNICATIONS, RETAIL STORES IN TRANSPORT HUBS** GROUPE CANAL+\n\nOperating in more than 50 countries and with nearly 7,600 employees in 2023, Groupe Canal+ is a major global player in content creation and distribution. In 2023, in a constantly growing video market (in terms of consumption, number of subscribers and average subscription prices), Groupe Canal+'s positions on the markets in which it operates strengthened, and it entered into major partnerships covering new content, distribution channels and regions. It now has 26.4 million subscribers worldwide, with a diversified geographical presence mainly on three continents, with strong positions and an attractive value proposition both in more mature markets (Europe) and in growing markets (Africa and Asia). Thanks to subscription revenues that represent around 80% of the group's revenue, distribution across all broadcasting channels (Satellite, ADSL, TNT and Digital) and \n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\nboth linear and non-linear offerings, Groupe Canal+ enjoys a resilient business model that allows it to seize the growth opportunities on offer in its various markets.\n\nWith 3.5 billion euros invested in premium content each year, it is a key player in sport (the leading financier of football and rugby in France, and the principal partner of UEFA and EPL internationally), cinema (the leading financier in France and Poland), series (more than 50 original series per year in more than 15 languages) and entertainment (documentaries, comedy and shows). This generalist model, based on a number of thematic pillars (sport, cinema, series, entertainment and youth) and with strong local roots, sets it apart from its main competitors, in particular global streaming players. Groupe Canal+ also offers more than 2,000 thematic channels, including 130 produced in-house. With the support of its subsidiary Studiocanal, which owns 14 production companies – 13 in Europe and one in the United States – Groupe Canal+ is the leading producer and distributor of feature films and TV series in Europe. It holds the largest catalog in Europe, with around 9,000 titles, from more than 60 countries. These titles include those of Orange Studio, since OCS was acquired by Groupe Canal+ on January 31, 2024. Studiocanal also owns and develops successful international franchises, with the best known being *Paddington*.\n\nHistorically at the cutting edge of technological innovation in the distribution of its content in optimal market conditions, the group has developed an omnichannel distribution model, epitomized by myCanal, its cross-platform app (Web, Mobile, Smart TV, proprietary TV player and third-party TV players). This app, which was developed in-house, offers a user experience in line with the highest standards available on the market and on all connected equipment. This has resulted in a strong commitment among, and strong growth in the number of, subscribers of this service. Its international roll-out has accelerated with a presence in more than 40 countries and territories to date.\n\nIn a fast-changing environment with multiple operators, Groupe Canal+ stands out from its competitors as a result of its technological, commercial and content-related expertise, and its unique ability to forge partnerships with all players. In content, for example, Groupe Canal+ has entered into agreements with a number of third-party thematic channels, as well as long-term agreements with the main players and partnerships with global content platforms (Netflix, Disney+ and Paramount+). It has also signed a unique, exclusive and multi-territory partnership with AppleTV+. The group has also extended several agreements in the field of sport, including its agreement with the English Premier League, and has signed a new agreement with the sports streaming service, DAZN. After a number of accretive acquisitions and their successful integration in recent years (M7 and SPI, in particular), in 2023 Groupe Canal+ acquired significant stakes on the three continents prioritized for its growth: MultiChoice Group in English-speaking and Portuguesespeaking Africa, Viu in Southeast Asia and Viaplay in Northern Europe. These investments are consistent with the Group's stated ambition to help to consolidate the sector and thereby become one of the world's leading operators, eventually with between 70 and 100 million subscribers.\n\nOn February 1, 2024, Groupe Canal+, the largest shareholder in MultiChoice Group, announced that it had crossed the threshold of 35% of its share capital, and that it had submitted to MultiChoice Group's Board of Directors a non-binding indicative offer to acquire all the issued ordinary shares in the company that it did not already hold. This offer was rejected by the MultiChoice Group's Board of Directors on February 5, 2024. On February 28, 2024, the TRP (Takeover Regulation Panel), the regulatory committee for takeover bids in South Africa, ruled that Groupe Canal+ was required to launch a public tender offer for all the shares in MultiChoice Group that it did not currently hold. On March 5, 2024, in a joint statement with MultiChoice Group, Groupe\n\n*Soudain seuls,* adapted from the novel by Isabelle Autissier.

MultiChoice Group has entered into an exclusivity agreement with Groupe Canal+, which submitted its mandatory offer of 125 rands per share on April 8, 2024. Groupe Canal+ reiterated its commitment to listing MultiChoice Group on the JSE, as well as its support for MultiChoice Group's high BBBEE (certification of fair practices in South Africa) rating and its recognition of the importance of Phuthuma Nathi (a largescale shareholding scheme at MultiChoice Group for South African shareholders considered to be historically disadvantaged).\n\n# **LAGARDÈRE**\n\nFounded in 1992, Lagardère is a global group with 36,159 employees in more than 40 countries.

The teams of the various entities and branches work together with agility and in perfect synergy to offer tailor-made, innovative solutions to their customers from a wide variety of sectors such as consumer goods, healthcare, automotive, telecommunications and luxury goods, among others.

All the Villages are interconnected and augmented by data, new technologies and artificial intelligence.

Concert halls in France and cinemas in Africa fall outside the scope of this decision. A number of promising expressions of interest have been received. A sale may occur in the first half of 2024. Vivendi's strategy involves prioritizing business lines in which it has reached a significant critical mass and has strong positions, particularly at the international level. This project comes follows the sale by the group of its music businesses in 2021, which are by their very nature closely linked to festivals and ticketing.\n\nSince 2010, Vivendi has been developing, through acquisitions and organic growth, a significant group of ticketing companies in ten or so countries in Europe and the United States (under a single brand, See Tickets).

It is made up of the Compagnie de l'Odet and Bolloré portfolio of 9.0 billion euros and the Vivendi portfolio worth 7.6 billion euros at the end of 2023. The Group also has various agricultural assets.\n\n> While developing each of its operational activities, the Group's strategy has sought to maintain industrial capital in the form of assets that can be sold if needed or form the basis of new activities or partnerships.\n\n# **Shareholdings**\n\nThe stock market value of the Group's portfolio of listed securities stood at 16.6 billion euros at December 31, 2023, versus 16.2 billion euros at the end of 2022.\n\nThe portfolio held directly by Compagnie de l'Odet and Bolloré was worth 9.0 billion euros at the end of 2023, compared with 7.6 billion euros at the end of 2022. This increase was mainly due to rising share prices, mainly the share price of UMG. It notably includes holdings in UMG, Bigben and Socfin:\n\ng Universal Music Group (UMG)(1): following the listing of UMG on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and the distribution of 60% of UMG's capital to Vivendi's shareholders in September, 2021, the Group has a 18.4%(2) stake in UMG, valued at 8,660 million euros at December 31, 2023.\n\nVivendi's equity portfolio was worth 7.6 billion euros, compared with 8.6 billion euros at the end of 2022. This fall was due to it ceasing to hold the stake in Lagardère following full consolidation from December 1, 2023. This was partially offset by the increase in the share prices of its other holdings, including UMG and Telecom Italia. Vivendi's equity portfolio includes investments in UMG, Telecom Italia, MediaForEurope, FL Entertainment, and MultiChoice:\n\ng Universal Music Group: following the sale of 20% of UMG's share capital to a consortium led by Tencent and 10% to the Pershing Square group, as well as the distribution of 60% of the share capital to Vivendi's shareholders in 2021, Vivendi now has a 9.98% stake in UMG(4).

Socfin is one of the leading independent planters worldwide and manages almost 190,000 hectares of plantations.\n\nIn Asia, Socfin is present in Indonesia through Socfindo, which farms 45,000 hectares of oil palms and rubber trees, and has expanded into Cambodia, where it has undertaken the planting of 7,000 hectares of rubber trees, of which more than 6,000 hectares are now mature. In Africa, Socfin has numerous plantations in various countries, such as Cameroon, where Socapalm and SAFA Cameroun manage 44,000 hectares of oil palms and rubber trees, Côte d'Ivoire, where Société des Caoutchoucs de Grand Bereby (SOGB) farms 23,000 hectares of oil palm and rubber tree plantations, and Nigeria (26,400 hectares).\n\nRedlands Farm Holding also owns 3,300 hectares across three farms in Georgia and Florida.\n\nThe 2023 olive harvest was adversely affected by winter frost. In addition, following the conclusive tests carried out in 2022, the cultivation of the estate's land to produce self-sufficient levels of sunflower seeds for the purposes of its extra-virgin sunflower oil business, continued in 2023.\n\nAfter the initial success achieved in 2022, the rapid commercial expansion of the Fresh Press Farms brand continued in 2023 in the United States, with its products now sold in around 4,000 supermarkets. Alongside this expansion, more intensive efforts are being made to develop new products aimed at exercising logistical and commercial leverage in the distribution points acquired. These developments should also help to establish Fresh Press Farms as an innovative brand in the eyes of consumers and as a contributing factor to an improved diet.\n\nThe Group is also a shareholder and operator of a vineyard in southeastern France: Domaine de La Croix which bottles \"cru classé\" wines in the \"Côtes de Provence\" appellation area. The vineyard has a total area of 242 hectares, including 110 hectares carrying viticultural rights, which produce approximately 650,000 bottles per year.

Chaired by Marie Bolloré, the Fondation de la 2e chance helps people aged 18 to 62 who have faced extreme hardship and who presently\n\nlive in a vulnerable situation, but who have a real desire to get their lives back on track. It provides financial and personal support for a realistic and sustainable professional project:\n\ng creating or buying a business (up to 8,000 euros in funding);\n\ng completing training leading to a qualification (up to 5,000 euros).\n\nThis financial \"leg-up\" is accompanied by professional and emotional sponsoring provided to the beneficiary, until the project reaches a successful conclusion.\n\nThe Foundation's continued activities are supported by a team of employees and volunteers. Six employees coordinate all those involved in the Foundation at the head office, hosted by the Bolloré Group. A network of 1,000 active volunteers acts as on-site representatives, instructors and sponsors throughout France. Since its creation, Fondation de la 2e chance has helped over 9,255 people to bounce back.\n\nIn 2023, 243 new candidates were given support, with average aid per case of 2,971 euros. 70% of candidates received help via training and 30% for creating a company.

Being able to give back a part of what we have had the good fortune to receive is a value deeply rooted in the Bolloré Group's DNA. It is the reason why the Group has chosen to prioritize youth empowerment and education, while maintaining its commitment to respond to humanitarian and public health emergencies.\n\nIn 2023, the Group contributed to the economic independence of around 10,000 beneficiaries in 14 countries, via charities working mainly in education, health, and student vulnerability. For example:\n\ng 50,000 euros in support for the Solucham association, which promotes education and health in the mountain valleys of Nepal and the Solukhumbu region; in Europe, to combat growing levels of student hardship, the Group launched an international solidarity scholarship program, \"Room for Success\", co-designed with the Cité internationale universitaire de Paris. Having received the Earthtalent by Bolloré label, this program provides financial support to students. This year, scholarships were made available to around twenty students living in poverty.\n\nWhile young people are the priority of the Earthtalent by Bolloré solidarity program, they are not the only population to receive support. The Group also takes action in the event of humanitarian emergencies, which was the case in 2023 following the earthquake in Turkey. In support of the NGO Acted, basic necessities, including hygiene kits, were transported to distribution sites.\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe paper manufacturing plant in Odet, Brittany.

Non-financial performance statement**\n\nSince its creation, the Bolloré Group has been driven by a very determined commitment to entrepreneurship and innovation. With a strategy of diversifying its activities, it is listed on the stock exchange and benefits from a stable and family-owned shareholder base, which allows it to make longterm investments(1). It has a long history of transmission from generation to generation, based on a corporate culture and strong values, shared by all its employees, which include humility, excellence, courage, solidarity, agility and innovation. The Group's commitments are reflected in its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy based on the four fundamental pillars described below. Given the great diversity of the Bolloré Group's activities and CSR challenges, and in the interest of conciseness, the non-financial performance statement (DPEF) presented below explains the mitigation techniques implemented by the Group to manage its priority CSR risks relating to the activities of the Logistics, Oil logistics and Industry sectors. The priority CSR challenges associated with the activities of the Vivendi group are described in its universal registration document. However, the summary of consolidated priority risks for Bolloré and Vivendi is available in section 1.1.2. – The Bolloré Group's non-financial risk mapping. Furthermore, consistent with the scope of financial consolidation, Vivendi's priority CSR issues are summarized in the body of this document, and the consolidated view of the main social and environmental performance indicators is\n\n# <span id=\"page-55-1\"></span>**1.1. CSR challenges and strategy**\n\n# **1.1.1. THE BOLLORÉ GROUP'S CSR STRATEGY**\n\nThe Group is committed to following the principles of respect for human rights and has been a member of the United Nations Global Compact for twenty years. This commitment is reflected in the Bolloré Group Ethics and CSR Charter, as well as in the human rights Charter backed by international standards such as the OECD guidelines for multinational companies, the fundamental conventions of the International labour organization (ILO) and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. All employees of the Group's divisions and subsidiaries are bound by the commitments expressed in these Charters. The Bolloré Group CSR strategy described below was developed in view of the results of the materiality analysis of the Group's challenges carried out in 2016. This analysis made it possible to determine the most material issues, through their identification and prioritization, during specific interviews with internal stakeholders in each of the Group's activities, while taking into account the expectations of external stakeholders (customers, employees, public authorities). Updated to include Vivendi on its integration in 2017, the materiality matrix identifies seven major priority challenges in four fundamental pillars that shape the Bolloré Group's CSR strategy. These commitments are upheld by all of the Group's divisions to make CSR part of everyday life in their core business and to create value and connections between the men and women in the company, their environment, and stakeholders. Note that this mapping will be fully updated in 2024 to meet the new regulatory requirements arising from the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the change in the scope of our activities.\n\nIn 2017, the Group consolidated its results as part of its response to decree no. 2017-1265 of August 9, 2017 implementing order no. 2017-1180 of available in the summary tables presented at the end of this chapter 2 (see section 1.3. – Summary tables of the Bolloré Group's non-financial performance indicators). The non-financial performance statements of both Bolloré and Vivendi are subject to verification by an approved independent third party<sup>(2)</sup>.\n\nThe Bolloré Group's 2023 non-financial performance statement includes the activities of the Bolloré Logistics division, which was sold in February 2024. These activities were held by the Bolloré Group for all of 2023. They had been classified as held-for-sale activities since May 8, 2023 in accordance with the IFRS 5 standard, and were therefore excluded from the presentation of the Group's activities and risks in the 2023 management report. However, non-financial reporting standards do not provide for any special treatment of activities that have not yet been sold. Thus, the non-financial performance of the Bolloré Logistics division is included in the Group's non-financial performance statement but presented distinctly on a separate line in the reporting tables. The risk management policies and action plans for future years are less in depth than for the rest of the Group given the recent sale of these activities. Finally, to facilitate reading and allow for quick identification of the activities sold off, it was decided to lighten the font pertaining to Bolloré Logistics data in the following sections.\n\nJuly 19, 2017 on the publication of non-financial information by companies, and to the duty of care law. These regulatory obligations have introduced an analytical perspective based on the management of priority non-financial risks. The Bolloré Group promotes the implementation of virtuous due diligence measures in all its business sectors to ensure that the policies, processes and improvement plans in place guarantee its non-financial performance over the long term. Anticipating and responding to customer expectations by mitigating the risks around business ethics, protecting human capital by implementing a health and safety policy conducive to a lasting relationship with employees, safeguarding environmental assets by investing in the development of innovative products and services, and being an actor in the development of society and the communities where the Group operates – these are all factors that will create value.\n\nThe Vivendi group, which mainly represents the Bolloré Group's Communications business, is part of this approach. In 2020, it redefined its own CSR commitments in line with its corporate mission: *Creation Unlimited* – unlocking creation by valuing all talents, ideas and cultures and sharing them with as many people as possible. Vivendi's CSR program, *Creation for the Future*, was rolled out to all of its business lines in 2021. It was partially adjusted in 2022 to take into account the insights revealed by the results of the CSR risk mapping and the materiality survey (see Vivendi universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 2.1.1. – A materiality survey to analyze priority issues), *Creation for the Future* sets the course and defines a framework for action common to all Vivendi group entities. It enables creative energies to come together to contribute to building more sustainable, open, inclusive and responsible societies.\n\n# **1.1.1.1. ALL RESPONSIBLE AND COMMITTED – THE BOLLORE GROUP'S ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM**\n\nThe Bolloré Group's desire to fulfill its stakeholders' expectations and to play an active role in responsible development are currently reflected in four areas of commitment:\n\n# **UNITING AND PROTECTING PEOPLE, THE COMPANY'S GREATEST STRENGTH**\n\n- Protecting the health and ensuring the safety of the women and men exposed as part of our activities.\n- Attracting talent and developing the skills of our employees.\n- Maintaining social dialog and promoting well-being in the workplace.\n\n(1) For further details on the Bolloré Group, its activities and business model, please see chapter 1 of this universal registration document.\n\n(2) For more information on Vivendi, its activities, business model and non-financial performance statement, please refer to Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **ACTING WITH INTEGRITY IN OUR BUSINESS CONDUCT AND PROMOTING HUMAN RIGHTS**\n\n- Sharing the same business ethics and ensuring compliance with the strictest standards.\n- Promoting human rights in our businesses and supply chains.\n\n# **INNOVATING IN RESPONSE TO MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES**\n\n- Reducing our carbon footprint and adapting to climate change.\n- Placing the control of our carbon footprint at the heart of our products and services.\n- Preventing pollution and reducing environmental impacts related to our operations.\n\n# **COMMITTING OVER THE LONG-TERM TO REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT**\n\n- Contributing to and promoting local employment.\n- Revitalizing regions.\n- Building and maintaining dialog with stakeholders.\n- Undertaking societal actions for the benefit of local populations.\n\nThe commitments of the Bolloré Group are in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Its actions have a direct or indirect positive impact on 151 of the 169 targets.\n\nA summary of the main performance indicators relating to these major commitments is available in chapter 1 of this universal registration document (see chapter 1 – CSR Performance in brief).\n\n# **1.1.1.2.** *CREATION FOR THE FUTURE* **– VIVENDI'S CSR PROGRAM**\n\nIn 2021, Vivendi deployed its CSR program, which includes all its activities in a framework of unified positive action. The program is named *Creation for the Future* and expresses Vivendi's raison d'être: *Creation Unlimited.* It contributes to the success of Vivendi's mission, \"to unleash creation by revealing all talent, valuing all ideas and cultures, and sharing them with as many people as possible\". Deployed to the entire Vivendi group in 2021, the *Creation for the Future* program is based on three pillars that put environmental, societal and social impacts into perspective at all levels of Vivendi's activities and set new ambitions by 2025.\n\n- *Creation for the Planet:* aims to help to curb climate change and incorporates a reduced carbon trajectory validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative. The Group is also committed to getting its partners and suppliers involved in its approach and, thus further contribute to the global offsetting of carbon emissions;\n- *Creation for Society:* aims to inspire change by working to make culture, a vector of emancipation and social ties, accessible to as many people as possible and foster the emergence of more inclusive, sustainable and responsible realms of imagination. To imagine the society of the future, and drawing on its role as a leading cultural player, the group intends to do its part to ensure that everyone can access diverse and inventive cultural offerings that help them grow as individuals and better understand others, the world and themselves.\n- *Creation with All:* reaffirms the principle of collective commitment and the importance of each person's role in building a more sustainable and inclusive society together. The group's employees are the most implicated,\n\nbut this also applies to its artistic talents in all their diversity and all around the world, and to other stakeholders (customers, business partners, suppliers). Each person, at their own level, can act and have a positive impact. To build a more responsible world together, Vivendi strives to discover and develop a wide array of talent to ensure the cultural relevance of its content. Vivendi creates conditions conducive to their development with an attractive and inclusive working environment, where their creations and commitments are valued.\n\nThis approach, which is at the highest level of the group, is a performance driver at the heart of Vivendi's strategy and creates value shared with all stakeholders. It is built on an organization in charge of steering the roadmap, which sets out each of the pillars of commitment in Vivendi's various business lines. It is shared with all employees, who are its leading ambassadors.\n\nThe implementation of the strategic program is also based on a foundation of respect for ethical values and an integrity culture that underpins the conduct of business within the group. This is reflected in the group's overall compliance policy, which helps to maintain trustworthy relationships with its many partners and, in particular, its customers. To govern its activities, Vivendi has its own ethical measures, applicable to its subsidiaries and adapted to their businesses (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2-2.2. Main non-financial risks and opportunities).\n\nThese commitments are in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 1.1.3. – Vivendi's contribution to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals).\n\n# **1.1.2. THE BOLLORÉ GROUP'S NON-FINANCIAL RISK MAPPING**\n\nIn accordance with the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), in 2017 the Group mobilized the members of the Management Committees of all of its divisions to map the CSR risks and opportunities associated with its transport and logistics activities and industrial activities. The subsidiaries organized workshops on risk-scoring, led by a consultancy firm and using software to rank the risks identified and ensure the effectiveness of the method used. A universe of 16 CSR risks and opportunities, covering the themes defined in the NFRD, was first defined and explained for each Group division. These risks are inherent to the Group's activities and were considered throughout the value chain (procurement, operations, use of products and services sold), taking into account all stakeholders (employees, customers, suppliers, subcontractors, public authorities, investors, etc.). Each risk was rated according to its frequency and severity. The frequency was defined as the probability of the risk occurring over the next five years. The severity corresponds to the impact of the occurrence of the risk on reputation, turnover or operations. This methodology was constructed in line with the Bolloré Group's general risk mapping. The fundamental principle of considering the expectations of stakeholders has been implemented, for example by gathering perceptions of these expectations from operational teams with full knowledge of the field. Corruption risk and conflicts of interest, a priority area, was scored by the Compliance Department in collaboration with all divisions.\n\nVivendi carried out its own CSR risk mapping in 2018 and updated it in 2022. The management of the CSR strategy, as well as the action and mitigation plans for identified non-financial risks are monitored by the Vivendi group's CSR Department (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – sections 2.1 – The process for prioritizing CSR commitments, and 2.2. – Main non-financial risks and opportunities).\n\nThe mapping of Vivendi's non-financial risks has been pooled with the Bolloré Group's mapping to obtain a consolidated view shown in the following table. The mapping, updated in 2021 in line with the work performed by the divisions, regulatory changes and changes in the scope of the Bolloré Group's activities, is in line with the Group's priorities identified during the materiality analysis. These priority risks are a natural fit with the four key pillars of the Bolloré Group's CSR strategy.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                             |

Issued by Bureau Veritas, this certification covers entities located in the Europe, Americas, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and South Asia regions. Some 300 sites in over 54 countries were covered by the triple certification in 2023. The aim of this certification is to harmonize the network's current procedures at the global level. It will enable Bolloré Logistics to continue rolling out common operational processes to meet its customers' requirements and improve its management methods and tools to move towards greater performance.\n\nBolloré Logistics implements a QHSE management system at all its entities, all of which are ISO 45001 certified.\n\nIn addition, the QHSE Corporate Department continued to support the use of B'Excellent, its steering platform dedicated to quality, health, safety, security and environment activities, which was launched in 2019. The platform is intended for the QHSE network as well as all managers. It provides for improved control of the management of HSE activities, data management thanks to various dashboards (HSE reporting, incident recording and monitoring, progress with the action plan, inspection schedules and implementation, business continuity plans, etc.), and the analysis of the QHSE performance of Bolloré Logistics entities worldwide.\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n# Bolloré Energy\n\nAt Bolloré Energy, the health, safety and environment policy, which was updated in 2019, covers the risks associated with occupational health and safety issues. Bolloré Energy puts all its efforts into meeting the expectations of its customers. It has compiled a database of best practices to manage occupational health and safety risks, particularly in transport, in the context of the delivery of its products and services to individuals. In addition, an HSE Management Committee meets once a month. Since 2021, to centralize the process for identifying workplace accidents, an online workplace accident reporting tool has been put in place, making the data more reliable. Note that Seveso sites are subject to specific and particularly strict health and safety rules and are subject to inspections by France's regional environmental, planning and housing agency (DREAL), The high thresholds are checked each year and the low thresholds every three years. Every five years, regulatory inspections are carried out on sites classified as ICPE (facilities classified for environmental protection). These accounted for 25 inspections at Bolloré Energy sites in 2023.\n\n# **• Industry**\n\n#### Blue and Films\n\nAll of Blue's subsidiaries and the Films packaging activities apply health and safety policies specific to their industrial activities. They are implemented through improvement programs presented and validated by the employee representative bodies each year. The plastic packaging films production site is certified BRC and ISO 22000, ensuring the safety of food packaging. Blue Solutions' battery production sites are certified according to the IATF 16949:2016 automotive quality management standard, reinforcing safety, traceability and the technical specifications required for automotive production. Finally, the activities of the Blue and Film divisions are certified 9001:2015.\n\nAll sites have a system that implements ISO 45001 principles, although the need to commit to a formal certification process has not been identified for the entities at this time.\n\nIn addition, safety tours are carried out on the Industry sector scope by specially trained managers. In 2023, 100 safety tours were conducted within the Films division, 125 within Blue Solutions and 50 within Bluebus.\n\n## Systems\n\nIER and Automatic Systems (Systems entities), cover the occupational health and safety issues of employees and third parties, deploy a HSE management system and are subject to evaluation audits. The HSE management system includes:\n\n- publication of documentation: the single health and safety document, risk prevention program, improvement of working conditions, safety instructions and sheets, etc.;\n- raising awareness and training on the prevention of risks to which employees are exposed: electricity certification, manual handling, chemical risk, etc.;\n- systematic analysis of the causes of workplace accidents at all sites, and;\n- the implementation of action plans and proposals for corrective action, and publication for stakeholders. Occupational health and safety actions are formalized in a general action plan that is continuously monitored, which gives rise to an annual assessment validated by the employee representative bodies (CSE).\n\nIn addition, the after-sales/worksite Department of Automatic Systems Belgium has been VCA certified (Belgian health, safety and environmental certification) since 2008, giving it the means to control the safety risks it encounters at each new facility or intervention site (maintenance, repair). The ISO 14001 and VCA certifications were renewed in 2023 following the audits carried out on the of Automatic Systems Belgium scope in 2022.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n# *HSE management system rollout indicators(1) at the Bolloré Group(2)*\n\n| (as a percentage)                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Bolloré Logistics | Bolloré Energy | Industry | Others | 2023 Total | 2022 Total* |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------|--------|------------|-------------|\n| Proportion of employees covered<br>by an HSE management system(2)                                                                                                                                                    | 100               | 92             | 83       | 85     | 97         | 98          |\n| Proportion of entities having installed<br>an HSE management system(2)                                                                                                                                               | 96                | 25             | 80       | 33     | 87         | 97          |\n| Proportion of entities having<br>undergone a QHSE audit                                                                                                                                                              | 83                | 50             | 80       | 0      | 77         | 80          |\n| Proportion of entities having at least one site<br>with health and safety certification by at least<br>one of the following standards: ISO 45001<br>SQAS, ICMI, ISPS, TAPA FSR, ISO 22000 or<br>Pedestrian Free Yard | 100               | 50             | 100      | 0      | 98         | 75          |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from CSR reporting (see section 1.3.2.1. – CSR reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding Vivendi.

PREVENTING ACCIDENTS AND OCCUPATIONAL RISKS AND IMPROVING WORKING CONDITIONS**\n\n# Group policy\n\nObjectives and progress\n\nWithin the context of the QHSE management systems, occupational risks related to Group activities and business lines are subject to specific health and safety analyses. As such, the entities regularly update their occupational risk mapping, in close collaboration with local managers, social partners, occupational physicians and other stakeholders.\n\nBased on these findings, ergonomic principles and risk mitigation techniques are then implemented. Regular audits and the incident and accident analysis implemented by Group entities lead to improvement plans incorporating preventive and corrective measures. Each entity identifies and naturally\n\n# complies with the applicable external requirements, be they regulations or contractual clauses. Visits to workstations make it possible to assess occupational risks in collaboration with the occupational health teams. External companies that have to carry out work regularly on site are subject to prevention plans and work permits with the aim of guaranteeing the protection of workers and communities in terms of health and safety. Health and safety audits and inspections are conducted internally to reinforce prevention through regular monitoring of sites, facilities and equipment and by external inspection bodies for facilities and equipment subject to a regulatory audit requirement.\n\n| Area of action                                                                        | Group objectives

2024.\n\n# Preventing accidents and occupational risks and improving working conditions in the Group's activities\n\nWithin each division, the occupations and workstations, which are sometimes extremely specialized and high-risk, are analyzed to prevent occupational risks and accidents and optimize working conditions for our employees. In the Transportation and logistics business, appropriate policies are implemented, monitored, and regularly reviewed to prevent major risks (e.g., general driving rules, drugs and alcohol policy, etc.). Employees such as forklift operators, locomotive drivers and drivers of specialized vehicles (identified as the business lines most at risk) undergo routine testing for at-risk behavior stemming from the use of medication, drugs or alcohol prior to taking up their position.\n\nAwareness-raising initiatives and health and safety policies are adapted to each activity and region, mainly focused on the professional risks associated with handling, storage and transportation operations, taking into account the task, workload, physical effort, the working environment, and individual suitability. Ergonomics rules and risk reduction methods are implemented and specific measures are required to adapt to the health and safety issues associated with each activity.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\n#### Bolloré Logistics\n\nAt Bolloré Logistics, the main professional risks relate to handling, storage and transport operations. As such, operators are trained in the right actions and postures before carrying out manual handling operations, and their training is renewed as often as necessary. Any accidental event is recorded in a database in order to learn from it, be able to trace it, and to summarize all the corrective actions implemented (training/information, review of procedures, changes to working methods or equipment, etc.). In 2023, approximately 13,100 HSE audits and inspections were conducted in the Bolloré Logistics network. This year, a health and safety event was organized by the Bolloré Logistics Corporate QHSE Department. The \"Go Safe\" challenge was an opportunity to highlight the various initiatives implemented by the division's sites to prevent risks and improve working conditions while mobilizing managers and employees. More than 200 initiatives, including numerous collaborative actions, have been launched:\n\n- 44% relate to health and safety training and awareness;\n- 26% cover measures to reduce occupational risks, and;\n- 14% are linked to fostering a health and safety culture.\n\nFurthermore, these initiatives are shared across the network and the best of them were rewarded at the end of 2023.\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n#### Bolloré Energy\n\nIt should be noted that the main accident risks in Oil logistics activities pertain to transportation linked to the distribution of petroleum products. The flammability of heating oil and diesel is triggered at very high temperatures (over 65 °C), which is why the main accident prevention actions focus on mitigating fire risks.\n\nA major accident prevention policy, updated in 2022, is in place on the most at-risk sites of Bolloré Energy, helping to protect employees, third parties (subcontractors and temporary workers on-site) and customers. The main risks identified are fire risks, road traffic risks and risks associated with gestures and postures, various corrective and mitigation measures are implemented such as:\n\n- regular fire prevention exercises carried out to avoid possible emergency situations (for example, a fire at the loading station). Nine exercises were carried out in 2023;\n- creation of a fire defense plan at distribution network depots;\n- improved safety for the delivery and unloading of additives, hazardous oil products: Bolloré Energy installs new dedicated tanks every year;\n- appointment of a heating services controller and a heating services technical trainer to support our technicians in this activity, which involves a range of specific risks (use of cutting tools, chemicals, etc.);\n- annual employee training (e-learning, seminars, etc.) on various topics: occupational health and safety, chemical risks, prevention of risks related to the transportation of dangerous goods by road (ADR, FCO, road safety training), etc.;\n- an online ordering platform for protective equipment specially designed to be adapted to the business lines was set up in 2020 and updated in 2022 to include new equipment, and;\n- the deployment of prevention plans (information on the site risks in view of the work to be carried out) and, potentially, the issuing of a fire permit to prevent risks for external companies.\n\n# **• Industry**\n\n#### Blue and Films\n\nThe occupational risks identified at industrial sites include chemical risks, moving machine risks, cutting risks (cutting machinery, blades), electrical risks, and the risks involved with heavy parts (lifting means).\n\nAmong the flagship accident prevention initiatives, the industrial sites have put in place systems allowing staff to make suggestions to involve teams more in risk prevention and launch actions to improve safety at workstations.\n\nThe French sites have adopted a policy for the prevention of arduous working conditions through commitments and actions incorporated in the occupational risk prevention process, in collaboration with the company physician. All arduous factors have been analyzed since July 2016, beyond the legal obligation. Shift work, which is inherent to the activity, is the only issue that cannot be addressed by prevention. That is why, since 2016, people who have worked shifts for most of their careers have benefited from an early retirement plan to compensate for the fact that the personal hardship account (additional time deposited in the time savings account) does not apply retroactively.\n\nOther specific measures to prevent accidents were implemented in 2023. Blue Solutions made several investments, including:\n\n- new purchases of personal protective equipment (PPE) adapted to the chemicals used in the new-generation batteries (Gen4);\n- purchases of filtration hoods for the R&D teams\n\nThe Bluebus division continued its study to improve load bearing, with a conclusive trial of a neck support system. It implemented various measures, including a fall arrest system for operators (protective barrier, secure ladder), and updated the organization of its internal fire teams.\n\nIn the Films division, various studies aimed at improving the risks associated with carrying loads were also rolled out in 2023. The sites also implemented measures to prevent the risk of falls and to prevent the risk of electrocution and fire on production equipment.\n\nIn 2023, accident prevention was illustrated by specific training initiatives (see 1.2.1.1.4. Informing, training and raising awareness).\n\n#### *LMP® battery safety*\n\nThe issues of exposure to and handling of hazardous products are identified in the context of lithium battery production. While lithium is not toxic, it can be dangerous due to its corrosive and flammable nature. The design of the facilities (e.g. dry air conditioning in the workshops), fire risk prevention measures, operating instructions, staff training and personal protective equipment are all adapted to the specific risks of lithium metal.\n\nBlue Solutions specializes in \"solid-state\" battery technology. In the event of piercing, there is no release of hazardous liquids or formation of explosive atmospheres in a confined environment. LMP<sup>®</sup> batteries are exempt from SVHC (substance of Very High Concern) rules under the European REACH regulation and CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction) rules under the CLP regulation.\n\n#### Systems\n\nIER, a Systems division subsidiary, is engaged in a professional risk prevention process, in close collaboration with social partners, members of Occupational Health and Safety Committees (CSSCT), and occupational health and other stakeholders. The main risks identified are those caused by handling activities and by the carrying of loads. To prevent risks, the locations of the production and storage lines of IER, Automatic Systems and EASIER plants have been optimized for processes such as those implemented in Besançon since 2017 which have reduced the probability of occurrence of occupational diseases such as musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in general. Health, safety and working condition improvement plans are monitored with year-end completion rates of more than 80%. Entities in the Systems division are organizing initiatives specifically dedicated to improving working conditions and employee well-being. For example, in 2022 IER undertook a diagnostic of psychosocial risks with the aim of improving quality of life and working conditions. After this diagnostic, actions were taken to limit the risks identified.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Preventing health and safety risks to third parties (subcontractors and neighboring communities)\n\n# **Subcontractors**\n\nEmployees of subcontracting companies are bound by the same requirement criteria as the standards applied to Group employees. They are subject to the same health and safety analysis and performance indicators, whether these arise from regulations or contractual clauses. Risks linked to concurrent activities with external companies are also analyzed and specific prevention and protection measures are identified. The issue is addressed at weekly meetings of the Ethics and Compliance Committee of the Transportation and logistics division, composed of Executive Committee members.\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\n#### Bolloré Logistics\n\nFor Bolloré Logistics, a subcontractor management process is established to ensure a high level of HSE quality. This process leads to the accreditation, selection and monitoring of subcontractors.\n\nIn 2023, approximately 342 HSE audits and inspections were conducted with Bolloré Logistics' subcontractors.\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n# Bolloré Energy\n\nBolloré Energy relies on its major accident prevention policy to mitigate and manage health and safety risks that could apply to third parties. This policy is subject to strict processes conforming to recognized standards (Seveso, ICPE, ISO 14001 and ADR [European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road]).\n\n#### *The Bolloré(2) Group's accident rate indicators(1)*\n\n# **• Industry**\n\n#### Blue and Films\n\nThe Industrial entities make very little use of subcontractors. The third-party workers that could be impacted by the health and safety issues relating to bus, plastic film or battery production activities are temporary workers. Accident monitoring has been implemented, and there were no accidents in this category in 2023.\n\n## **Neighboring communities**\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n# Bolloré Energy\n\nAs part of the identification of major accident risks that might have an impact on neighboring communities, only Seveso sites could be concerned. As a result, these sites are subject to appropriate and specific monitoring of the potential issues identified: 100% of Seveso sites are covered by a major risks prevention policy. In this respect, special intervention plans (PPIs) are drawn up by the departmental prefect, in collaboration with Bolloré Energy. These plans set forth the appropriate measures to deal with the consequences for the local community if an accident occurred at a site posing a technological risk. In 2023, three Seveso depots were covered.\n\nBolloré Energy's oil depots are not located in areas with high population density. Local residents in the area are still informed of the risks associated with oil depots through several information and awareness-raising actions.\n\nIt should also be noted that all Bolloré Energy sites are self-sufficient in mitigating fire risks, with appropriate equipment and processes. Ten internal health and safety audits were carried out on Bolloré Energy's activities in 2023.\n\n|                                                          | 2023 | Of which<br>Bolloré Logistics | 2022* |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------|-------------------------------|-------|\n| Number of workplace accidents with lost-time             | 155  | 75                            | 137   |\n| Lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) (x 1,000,000)(3) | 4.87 | 2.80                          | 4.33  |\n| Lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) (x 200,000)(4)   | 0.97 | 0.56                          | 0.87  |\n| Severity rate of workplace accidents (x 1,000)(5)        | 0.15 | 0.10                          | 0.16  |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from social reporting (see section 1.3.1.1. – Social reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding Vivendi.

INFORMING, TRAINING AND RAISING AWARENESS**\n\nTraining and awareness-raising initiatives on health, safety and environment topics are organized for employees and subcontractors according to the same principles of compliance with safety regulations enshrined in the entities' QHSE policies. Subcontracting companies must also ensure that their staff are qualified and certified to perform the requested tasks. With respect to daily operations, the teams remind subcontractors of the basic safety rules for dayto-day operations (e.g. handling heavy loads, hazardous products, transportation and traffic regulations).\n\n# Objectives and progress\n\n| Area of action                                      | Group objectives                                                                                                                                            | Horizon                       | Progress at 12/31/2023                                                                                                                                         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| HSE training for<br>employees and<br>subcontractors | • Monitoring of the number of HSE training<br>hours by QHSE and/or HR                                                                                       | Annual                        |                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Informing and<br>raising employee<br>awareness      | • Display of HSE policy on the premises<br>by 100% of the legal entities included<br>in the CSR reporting scope(1)<br>• Mandatory information for newcomers | 2022 carried<br>over to 2023* | • Reported methods used to communicate<br>on the HSE policy:<br>• 94% of entities report posting it on the premises<br>• 86% report that they inform newcomers |\n\n(1) See section 1.3.2.1. – CSR reporting methodology note.\n\n\\* The 2022 targets were renewed in 2023 due to two significant disposal projects and anticipated work related to the CSRD in 2024.\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Training adapted for each activity\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\n#### Bolloré Logistics\n\nIn Bolloré Logistics entities, training and awareness programs adapted to the nature of the activities carried out (training in PPE, hazardous substances, fire-fighting, work at height, etc.), take various forms:\n\n- \"15-minute safety\" sessions or \"talks\" provided to small groups of employees in the field. They instill dialog with employees through a set of questions and answers and encourage the feedback of information from the field that could lead to the implementation of areas for improvement (e.g. modification of traffic flows or identification of hazardous zones, etc.);\n- regular on-site HSE meetings at which key messages are provided to participants or safety moments are organized.\n\nNew employees receive training in the main health, safety and environment rules to be controlled within the framework of their working environment (governance and QHSE actors, risks and precautions related to manual handling, driving forklifts, handling and storing hazardous goods, organizing fire rescue, etc.).\n\nEvery year, Bolloré Logistics publishes a QHSE review covering all of the operational challenges and issues (KPIs, certification, specific actions deployed on sites, projects, etc.).\n\nIn 2023, three hours of training and information on average were provided per employee.\n\n#### *World Day for Safety and Health at Work 2023*\n\nThe Transportation and logistics division and its subsidiaries observed World Day for Safety and Health at Work, like every year, by organizing events and activities around the world to promote safety and the prevention of workplace accidents and occupational diseases.\n\nThis year, the Bolloré Group wanted to focus on the theme \"a safe and healthy working environment\".\n\nBolloré Logistics employees came together around the world and several initiatives were carried out, including:\n\n- sessions to raise awareness and prevent occupational risks and share best practices;\n- emergency drills such as first aid procedures, chemical spills, use of fire safety equipment, fire/emergency evacuation exercises, etc.;\n- preventive actions to promote occupational health, notably through fun games (such as \"find the mistake\");\n- health check-ups.\n\nThis event, which brought together more than 4,600 employees around the world in the Bolloré Logistics scope, also reminded everyone of the Bolloré Group's values and health and safety culture.\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n#### Bolloré Energy\n\nAt Bolloré Energy, awareness-raising initiatives on health and safety risk prevention related to the environment were also organized within the framework of ISO 14001 and new arrivals systematically receive training. In addition, extensive training plans are regularly organized for employees and third-party companies working on site (e.g. external drivers loading vehicles at Bolloré Energy sites).\n\nIn 2023, the following were organized:\n\n• initiatives on the prevention of chemical risk (e-learning module) and the launch of a new platform for ordering protective equipment;\n\n- prevention actions related to well-being at work and stress management for employees and managers (e-learning), and;\n- training in rational and preventive driving.\n\nIn 2020 a prevention and safety program was launched for delivery drivers (practical preventive driving exercises, intervention techniques for delivery incidents, or in the event of a fire). Developed with the Association for Prevention in the Transport of Hydrocarbons, this program enabled 38 drivers to be trained in 2023. Training will continue in 2024.\n\nSpecial training is offered to temporary workers and some suppliers for carriers that load on site because there is a safety protocol and a specific delivery procedure that must be followed. All carriers of hazardous materials are required to abide by the Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR) for road transport. This training, received by all Bolloré Energy service providers, refers to all the provisions that road carriers must apply to prevent risks related to the transport of hazardous materials.\n\nAlthough there is not yet any comprehensive tracking of the HSE training completed by subcontractors at the level of the Bolloré Energy division, it should be noted that all carriers working at Seveso sites must undergo safety-related training.\n\n# **• Industry**\n\nAll entities involved in Industry activities display their health and safety policy on site and systematically inform new arrivals of the rules for preventing health and safety risks.\n\n#### Blue and Films\n\nA large number of health and safety training courses are provided to train employees and new recruits: first aid at work training and refresher courses; explosive atmospheres (Atex) training; manual handling; correct posture and movement; laser or radiological risks; fire training (first and second responders); product emergency intervention (Blue Solutions); and electricity certification.\n\nSpecialized training was provided in 2023: conducting safety inspections, ergonomics of production workstations, movements and posture, management of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), chemical risks, harassment officers, and addiction prevention.\n\nIn addition, emergency training (evacuation, fire, accidental spills, etc.) is carried out every year through crisis management exercises at the various sites, in particular with the internal response teams as part of their training.\n\n#### Systems\n\nThe IER and Automatic Systems France entities also inform all new hires of environmental risks (chemicals, ecofriendly actions, waste sorting, etc.) at their workplaces, through e-learning courses. In addition, the chemical risk prevention program, initiated in 2013, is rooted in the day-to-day life of IER to manage the introduction of hazardous products at the company with regard to the product safety sheet and to implement adequate awareness for employees for their use and storage.\n\nFurthermore, as part of awareness-raising on occupational health and safety, all managers in the Systems division received training on psychosocial risks in 2023.\n\nFor subcontractors, the prevention plan signed by both parties covers the subjects of online training and includes risk identification. Further training is provided in small groups if specific needs are identified.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n# *Health, safety and/or environment (HSE) training indicators at the Bolloré Group(1)*\n\n|                                                                                             | 2023              |                |          |        |            |        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------|--------|------------|--------|\n|                                                                                             | Bolloré Logistics | Bolloré Energy | Industry | Others | 2023 Total | 2022*  |\n| Number of hours of training<br>on the topics of health, safety<br>and/or the environment(2) | 53,781            | 10,567         | 10,397   | 1,475  | 76,220     | 59,918 |\n| HSE training hours for subcontractors(3)                                                    | 1,300             | –              | –        | –      | 1,300      | 11,300 |\n\n(1) These indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding Vivendi.

PROTECTING HEALTH**\n\nThe Bolloré Group protects its employees from physical and mental harm. The Group's occupational health objectives are as follows:\n\n- protecting the health of everyone in the workplace;\n- providing a framework to identify and minimize health risks;\n- reducing health risks related to our activities, and;\n- complying with all regulatory and legal requirements.\n\nThe health of employees is assessed and monitored through several actions: • pre-employment medical check-up;\n\n- \n- increased monitoring of staff potentially exposed to high risks, and;\n\n• immunization or disease prevention programs, where necessary. The Bolloré Group also offers effective welfare protection. It is reflected in the implementation of programs to access care and prevention according to the location of its activities.\n\nNearly 92% of Bolloré Group entities offer more favorable health coverage than required by legal obligations and local practice in the countries in which it operates. Protecting human capital is a real growth and recognition challenge for the Bolloré Group which is therefore committed to providing its employees with high-end guarantees in terms of social protection.\n\nWhen local health services are deemed inadequate or too far from operational sites, the divisions and subsidiaries implement the necessary resources (medical centers, medical personnel, ambulances and medical equipment) to ensure the health of their employees, their families and, where necessary, subcontractors.\n\n# Specific health challenges related to the Group's activities\n\nDue to their presence in sensitive geographic areas, the QHSE Departments and the medical services of Group entities are particularly attentive to preventing illnesses, pandemics, epidemics and local health crises. Managers are informed of the introduction of special procedures (e.g. daily reminders of safety rules and training for employees and subcontractors).\n\nEach year, the Group raises employee awareness, for example, with initiatives around World AIDS Day and Pink October for breast cancer prevention.\n\nThe divisions also place specific emphasis on health risk prevention related to drug and alcohol use, including strict controls (drugs and alcohol policy) for road carriers in particular.\n\nFurthermore, the approach to preserving employee health is clearly illustrated by the identification and management of psychosocial risks, and the development of quality of life and working conditions initiatives.\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n# Bolloré Energy\n\nTraining on psychosocial risk prevention in 2023 focused on the following topics:\n\n- working together to fight unconscious bias;\n- dealing with abusive phone calls;\n- psychosocial risk awareness.\n\nAs as a provider of services to individuals, the customer relationship was also identified as a potential source of stress may. As such, Bolloré Energy is deploying training on managing customer aggressiveness to its sales teams. In 2023, a total of 515 hours of training were provided within the Bolloré Energy entity and the La Charbonnière-LCA entity for a total of 74 people trained.\n\n# **• Industry**\n\n# Blue and Films\n\nPsychosocial risk prevention measures are deployed through training to enable managers and team managers to prevent and measure stress in their departments. In 2023, 16 employees completed the \"managerial mindset\" training at Blue.\n\n# Systems\n\nIn 2023, IER organized the second edition of its week for issues related to well-being at work during the QVCT Week. The programming included awareness-raising sessions, such as a nutrition and well-being workshop, workshops with time for discussion and reflection on quality of life at work, and a variety of activities, including sports.\n\nIER also launched a psychosocial risk prevention approach in 2023, partnering with an organization that specializes in preventing these issues. The initiative is organized into different stages:\n\n- completion of a preliminary diagnostic within the entity to collect existing data relating to its operation and especially its management of healthrelated issues, with the aim of quantifying work issues within the company;\n- creation of a joint steering committee to convene various functions (HR, occupational psychologist, QHSE, etc.). The committee's aim is to ensure the project runs smoothly, to confirm progress made and main actions, to monitor the proper implementation of the measures to be selected, and to disseminate information to all staff;\n- creation of dedicated working groups to serve as spaces for discussion to identify and propose concrete solutions to the issues identified;\n- distribution of a questionnaire to identify psychosocial risk factors, the results of which will be presented to the steering committee, which will work on a summary to report on the results, prioritizing the risk factors for the working groups to focus on;\n- reporting of actions identified for priority attention by the steering committee, and definition of an implementation schedule and monitoring tools.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\n## *Employee health care coverage indicators(1) at the Bolloré Group(2)*\n\n|                                                                                         | 2023 Total | Of which<br>Bolloré Logistics | 2022 Total* |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------|-------------|\n| Percentage of employees eligible for social security coverage                           | 94         | 93                            | 93          |\n| Percentage of entities where health coverage extends to employees' beneficiaries        | 82         | 78                            | 82          |\n| Percentage of entities where the health coverage is more favorable than required by law | 92         | 94                            | 94          |\n| Percentage of employees eligible for regular medical checkups provided by the company   | 81         | 78                            | 81          |\n| Percentage of entities where medical services are offered to employees free of charge   | 91         | 85                            | 89          |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from social reporting (see section 1.3.1.1. – Social reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding Vivendi.

To meet the requirement for quality excellence in our services and ensure the sustainability and growth of our activities, attracting then retaining and developing the skills of the company's women and men is a major lever for operational efficiency and innovation. Our actions are based on seven pillars: relationships with school, recruitment, diversity, mobility, training, professional support and compensation.\n\nAt Vivendi, the group's entities offer attractive working environments and new, more inclusive organizational methods to promote collaboration and a sense of togetherness. The group is also committed to recognizing the diversity of career paths and to offering opportunities to grow, learn and take initiative. Our talented employees, in all their diversity, contribute to the originality of content and services, and respond to the sensitivities of different audiences. External talent is vital to the activities of the Vivendi group: these talents are identified and supported by multicultural teams who can analyze trends, build trusting relationships, drive incubation programs and find new ways to detect talent. Earning their loyalty depends in particular on the ability to offer them a range of services (content promotion, copyrights management, brand partnerships, etc.). See chapter 2 of Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document on Risks related to attracting and retaining talent. See section 4.3.2.1. – Identifying and nurturing artistic talents worldwide in all their diversity. For more information on the management of priority CSR risks in the Communications sector, see section 2.2. – Main non-financial risks and opportunities.\n\n# Group policy\n\n# **• School relations: building long-term partnerships**\n\nRelationships with schools are a key pillar of the recruitment policy for the long term. Their main purpose is to attract trainees and apprentices, create privileged gateways for new graduates, and help train future generations. By sharing our business lines, challenges, values and opportunities we help students envision their future with the Group. These exchanges also allow us to better understand their professional expectations and thus offer appropriate experiences. The challenge in selecting and managing our partnerships is not so much to attract young people from the most reputable training courses, but to find promising profiles that match the Group's culture, while forging a lasting bond between the company and the students most in line with its needs.\n\n#### Strategic, lasting school partnerships\n\nDespite the global crisis, the Group committed in 2023 to maintaining its long-term partnership strategy and to help schools in this particular context. The number of school partnerships continued to grow, reaching 184 schools. The diversity of our business lines and geographic regions leads each entity to develop its own target school portfolio and strategy. In the Transportation and logistics division, seven strategic partnerships are ongoing and several initiatives (forums, conferences, HR workshops, case studies, etc.) are also carried out each year in other target schools. Kedge Business School has been one of the division's preferred partners since 2016 for two reasons: its supply chain, logistics and purchasing profiles, and its presence outside France with campuses in Shanghai and Suzhou. Likewise, Edhec is an essential partner, particularly for the quality of the financial profiles it trains. As a result, these two schools are the main sources of students hosted in internships and work-study programs at the Group's Headquarters.\n\nBlue is very committed to local partnerships with schools such as IUT de Quimper, École supérieure d'ingénieurs en agroalimentaire de Bretagne atlantique (Esiab), IUT de Lorient, École supérieure de logistique industrielle de Redon (Esli), Le Likès high school in Quimper and the Union des industries et métiers de la métallurgie Bretagne (UIMM) school. In the Systems division, Polyconseil, the Group's consulting business with highly-skilled engineering profiles, relies more on the principle of co-opting by capitalizing on the very active networks of top French schools. In 2023, Polyconseil continued its work with major engineering universities (Polytechnique, Télécom Paris, CentraleSupélec, Mines Paristech and Ponts Paristech) and with Epita, Epitech and Ada Tech (an inclusive and feminist IT school open to all). The various initiatives that began before the pandemic resumed in 2022. The HR teams and operational representatives of each of the business lines were able to resume relations with schools by regularly participating in recruitment forums and business line round tables, and by participating in thematic workshops (conferences, case studies, business projects, examination juries, HR coaching, etc.). The Transportation and logistics division thus maintained its engagement with schools, organizing 63 initiatives, including 23 in person. Our employees also contribute directly to the teaching processes. This is the case at Blue and at Polyconseil, where employees teach courses in our target schools.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\nVivendi also cultivates partnerships with the best schools and universities based on the areas of expertise it is seeking and with the aim to diversify profiles. At the end of 2023, Vivendi (excluding Lagardère) had 264 partnerships of this type.\n\nSee Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – section 4.3.1. – Offering all talent an attractive and inclusive work environment.\n\n# The intern experience rewarded with the HappyIndex<sup>®</sup> Trainees label\n\nThe Transportation and logistics division offers a structured internship and work-study policy focused on students' professional development. This involves various points: missions with responsibility and quality tutorial support, an orientation morning, follow-up throughout the internship and events to strengthen cohesion and knowledge of the company. The objective is to ensure that the internship or work-study experience at the company is a constructive part of the development of the students we host. This program was digitalized in 2021 to maintain the quality of the reception and onboarding of all students despite the context of remote working. In 2022, the experience evolved once again by adopting a hybrid mode of operation and offering a face-to-face experience to establish a collective dynamic and several digitalized business conferences which facilitated sharing with all students, regardless of the pace of their work-study programs. This\n\n*The Bolloré(2) Group's school relations indicators(1)*\n\ncommitment was once again rewarded with the renewal of the HappyIndex® Trainees label in 2023. In particular, this survey assesses the reception and support provided to interns and work-study participants in the workplace. With a recommendation rate of 78% in 2023, students have emphasized the responsibilities assigned, the trust granted and the educational character of the proposed missions. This anonymous questionnaire is also a valuable source of information with a view to continuously improving our HR processes and policies vis-à-vis interns and work-study participants.\n\n**Our interns and work-study program students, a future talent pool:** each year, Bolloré offers thousands of internships and work-study programs through initiatives carried out in schools. It offers opportunities in operating positions (supply chain, logistics, transport, shipping, civil engineering, port, rail, industrial project management, R&D projects, trade, etc.) and in support functions (finance, law, information systems, human resources, marketing, etc.). At the Group's head office and the Bolloré Transportation and logistics division, 117 interns and work-study participants were hosted in 2023. Given the quality of the experience offered by the company, recognized by the renewal of the HappyIndex<sup>®</sup> Trainees label for the third consecutive year, 60% of master's students were offered a position within the Group on completion of their course.\n\n|                                                                                   | 2023  | Of which<br>Bolloré Logistics* | 2022* |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------|-------|\n| Number of interns and work-study program students                                 | 1,188 | 985                            | 1,201 |\n| Number of interns and work-study program students recruited                       | 318   | 301                            | 300   |\n| Number of school partnerships                                                     | 184   | 143                            | 148   |\n| Number of interns and work-study program students recruited from our partnerships | 44    | 40                             | 59    |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from social reporting (see section 1.3.1.1. – Social reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding the Communications sector to improve legibility in terms of the action described in this chapter.

More information on the policies and action plans implemented in the Communications sector is available in Vivendi's non-financial performance statement.\n\n\\* Data for the 2022 scope excluding Bolloré Africa Logistics following the sale of this business line.\n\nVivendi's business lines are also committed to offering a high-quality, attentive experience during the recruitment and onboarding process for employees and interns, by increasing discussions prior to their arrival within their teams, developing a managerial culture around one-on-ones and feedback, establishing internal mentoring programs, arranging meetings with managers and offering them an introduction to activities. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 4.3.1. Offering all talent an attractive and inclusive work environment.\n\n# **• Recruitment: a marker of our employer promise**\n\nIn 2022, the number of new hires gathered pace (increase of more than 20% compared to 2021) in all Group entities due to the economic recovery and the very favorable global employment environment (the Great Resignation in the United States, etc.). In this context, the Group's attention to ensuring an efficient, transparent and non-discriminatory hiring process remained intact. The situation stabilized in 2023 with a substantial volume of hires in line with the pre-pandemic years, as the global recruitments market becomes less competitive again.\n\nRecruitment contributes decisively to the company's performance by bringing in the best profiles in line with the Bolloré Group's culture and values and with our operating needs. In this context, the Group relies on a shared recruitment system to:\n\n- promote consultation between recruitment actors to define the needs in response to the company's development challenges;\n- communicate needs through the most relevant media, both internally and externally;\n- make the selection of talents more objective through the use of assessment tools that help gain a better understanding of the applicants' three key\n\ndimensions, namely their abilities, their technical and behavioral skills and what motivates them, and;\n\n• guarantee equal opportunities for all profiles, with the firm conviction that diversity is a source of productivity and creativity in companies.\n\n## Ensuring the excellence of our recruiters\n\nIn order to maintain skills and ensure business excellence, our two-year commitment with LinkedIn will enable us to deepen the initiatives undertaken over the last two years to create a community of recruiters, with three priorities: expertise in existing tools and their upgrades, the implementation of better recruitment techniques, and the development of business skills. In 2023, therefore, 128 HR staff involved in recruitment processes in France and abroad were required to complete various modules on how to use the tools offered by LinkedIn, which is the largest source of applications. In addition, several modules on taking diversity and inclusion into account in our recruitment processes were also rolled out.\n\n#### Language tests for objective assessment\n\nIn an international Group like Bolloré, where intercultural collaboration is needed, over the past years, the Transportation and logistics division has defined a common level expected in terms of English language fluency. Based on this common reference framework and in order to strengthen the excellence of our processes, in 2023, the Group's head office confirmed the use of language tests when hiring executives involved in international relations. These tests make it possible to ensure that candidates meet the required level of English fluency and thus facilitate objectification and fairness in decisions. New hires find it easier to integrate and taking up their new position faster.\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Ensuring a better understanding of who we are\n\nBeyond effective processes, our external actions to ensure a better understanding of what the Group is, in all its diversity, and its promise as an employer are also critical. In 2023, the Transportation and logistics division continued to carry out various video content creation projects in order to promote its businesses, activities and corporate culture through interviews and business videos, in partnership with Jobteaser. Blue continued the initiatives undertaken in terms of visibility by opening the doors of all its sites to its\n\n# *The Bolloré(2) Group's recruitment indicators(1)*\n\nemployment providers to ensure they have a perfect understanding of its business lines and needs. The division also increased its visibility on social media by regularly publishing information and videos on LinkedIn. Recruitment capsule videos were also made for publication on LinkedIn. In 2023, IER continued to communicate regularly on social media to promote the Group's employer brand and develop its attractiveness, by communicating in particular on the various actions carried out internally (HR coffee mornings, Welcome Day, engagement weeks, etc.).\n\n|                                                                 | 2023  | Of which<br>Bolloré Logistics | 2022* |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------------------------------|-------|\n| Number of external hires with permanent or fixed-term contracts | 3,837 | 3,325                         | 4,609 |\n| Number of external hires on permanent contracts                 | 2,790 | 2,383                         | 3,242 |\n| Number of external management recruits on permanent contracts   | 266   | 219                           | 354   |\n| Number of hires on fixed-term contracts                         | 1,047 | 942                           | 1,367 |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from social reporting (see section 1.3.1.1. – Social reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding the Communications sector to improve legibility in terms of the action described in this chapter.\n\nConsolidated Group data including the Communications sector are presented, where available, in the social indicator summary tables (see section 1.3.1. – Summary tables of social\n\nindicators).

More information on the policies and action plans implemented in the Communications sector is available in Vivendi's non-financial performance statement.\n\n\\* Data for the 2022 scope excluding Bolloré Africa Logistics following the sale of this business line.\n\nFor the Vivendi group, the various business lines are developing and strengthening their attractiveness as part of a dynamic, engaged employer brand policy aimed at promoting its values and activities. The business lines enjoy significant visibility on social media thanks to regular postings that celebrate their achievements and innovations, reflecting their social, societal and environmental commitments and depicting the shared emotions generated by the group's content. The careers sites, which express the group's DNA, history, know-how and human capital through employee testimonials and podcasts about the career fields make it possible to create an initial connection with future employees. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 4.3.1. Offering all talent an attractive and inclusive work environment.\n\n# **• Promoting diversity: a major focus of the Group's HR policies**\n\nIn order to remain a diversified, international and innovative Group we have to consider the societies where we are located. The Diversity and Inclusion Charter, in line with the ILO conventions and with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, formalizes the ambitions, approaches and resources that the Group intends to implement.\n\nThrough this Charter, the Bolloré Group undertakes to ensure: • non-discrimination;\n\n- the recruitment and integration of people with disabilities;\n- the promotion of equality between men and women;\n- the professional integration of young people, particularly in connection with the sponsorship policy. (see section 1.2.4.3. – Sponsorship policy).\n\nThis Charter is gradually being rolled out through action plans covering all the stages of our employees' life cycle such as recruitment, promotion, mobility, and training, with measurable results and visible initiatives that reflect the Group's ambitions to improve in these areas.\n\nPromoting diversity and creating an inclusive environment are integral parts of the Vivendi group's DNA. Vivendi recognizes that everyone's differences are a source of enrichment, and emphasizes individual skills as the foundation of collective performance. The group's growth derives from the diversity of its business lines, employees, cultures, generations and talents. Diversity, equity and inclusion are strategic values embodied at all levels of the Group so that they are a reality for all employees, a managerial commitment and a daily priority for the HR teams.\n\nSee Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 4.3.1.2. Fostering an inclusive environment and diversity, essential to the group's DNA.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Raising awareness and strengthening non-discriminatory practices\n\nAn awareness-raising program to combat all forms of discrimination was launched in 2020 and is still ongoing. This course, consisting of various e-learning modules to raise awareness of discriminatory criteria in companies such as physical appearance, disability or age, was first deployed to the HR community. In 2021, the rollout of this system was expanded to include managers and HR teams in the holding company and the Industry division (in addition to the persons previously targeted in the Transportation and logistics division) in France. During its last rollout, the overall completion rate was just over 60%. More specifically, in 2023, a module addressing unconscious bias was rolled out to all employees across the Group's various entities.\n\nIn 2023, a special module developed as part of a new diversity campaign was launched on March 8 to coincide with International Women's Rights Day and raised awareness among 84% of employees.\n\nTo create an environment in line with its culture, values and priorities, the Vivendi group strives to promote inclusion and diversity by training its employees on these subjects and by giving its managers non-discrimination training. In addition, the diversity of Vivendi's talent, which guarantees the cultural relevance of its content, makes it possible to give audiences content that reflects them and brings them together.\n\n## Structuring our initiatives for people with disabilities\n\nIn addition to complying with legislative requirements, the recruitment and onboarding of people with disabilities is a strong source of social cohesion in the company. The Group's approach is based on two objectives:\n\n- adapt job profiles to optimize the recruitment of people with disabilities, and;\n- develop a working environment that is suitable for the onboarding of people with disabilities.\n\nIn 2023, the number of employees with disabilities increased in the Group and in France. These recruitments are the result, among other things, of the inclusive scheme: in France, 83% of work-study participants with disabilities were hired at the end of their training under this scheme. A disability agreement was finalized and the Group maintained the initiatives for people with disabilities in France launched in 2022, in consultation with all divisions. An Agefiph agreement is scheduled to be signed in early 2024.\n\nIn 2023, IER established a disability committee (made up of an HR officer and volunteer employees), the role of which is to inform, guide and support persons with disabilities, whether or not they have been recognized as disabled. A disability charter was therefore drawn up, and a number of awareness-raising initiatives were carried out with employees (conferences, games during the European Week for Employment of People with Disabilities (SEEPH), etc.).\n\n#### *Indicators(1) of persons with disabilities employed by Bolloré Group(2)*\n\n|                                                                                                                                   | 2023 | Of which<br>Bolloré Logistics | 2022* |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|-------------------------------|-------|\n| Number of employees with a disability                                                                                             | 315  | 236                           | 294   |\n| Number of employees with a disability in France                                                                                   | 271  | 195                           | 250   |\n| Percentage of employees with a disability/Group's total workforce                                                                 | 1.7  | 1.6                           | 1.6   |\n| Percentage of employees recruited with a disability/Total workforce recruited externally on<br>permanent and fixed-term contracts | 0.5  | 0.3                           | 0.6   |\n| Percentage of employees with a disability trained/total Group workforce trained                                                   | 1.5  | 1.4                           | 1.4   |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from social reporting (see section 1.3.1.1. – Social reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding the Communications sector to improve legibility in terms of the action described in this chapter.\n\nConsolidated Group data including the Communications sector are presented, where available, in the social indicator summary tables (see section 1.3.1. – Summary tables of social\n\nindicators).

Its various business lines work fully together and are committed to promoting the inclusion of people with disabilities (whether motor or psychic) and non-discrimination against them by implementing a responsible, sustainable policy, taking into account the specificities of the business lines and local legislation. This policy is notably reflected in regular awareness-raising campaigns for employees and managers, partnerships with associations to promote the employment and integration of people with disabilities, as well as the creation of conducive conditions for employees to report their disability so that appropriate accommodations can be made for positions and workstations.

The Group has set itself three objectives:\n\n- increase the presence of women in jobs where, for equal skills, women are poorly represented;\n- promote women's access to positions of responsibility, through the selection of more women for management training programs;\n- support women in their career development.\n\nIn 2023, the percentage of women in the Group remained stable compared with 2022. It accounted for almost half of the total workforce (47%).\n\nThe percentage of women hired on permanent contracts was equivalent to 2022 (45%). Blue is also working in this area by promoting the accessibility of positions to both men and women. Several women were recruited to production positions in 2023.\n\nThe percentage of women trained remained stable in 2023 and above the percentage of women in the workforce.\n\nIn 2023, the percentage of women with managerial responsibilities rose slightly compared with 2022 and is nearing women's representation at the company. The Group's Management was one of the major promoters of this progress with the reworking of the Group Executive Committee and the appointment of seven women directors, thus ensuring an Executive Committee at near parity (eight directors). All of these initiatives, including recruitment, training, promotions and remuneration, are reflected in France in an improvement in the gender equality index published in France. The gender equality index in France, implemented since 2019 for all Group entities with more than 50 employees, enabled us to monitor the results of the actions taken to diversify our talents, particularly with respect to women in the Group's activities. Thanks to the actions taken to ensure greater gender equality in the Bolloré Group, many entities have managed to improve or stabilize their ratings and all entities scored above 85/100.\n\n### Bolloré Logistics: a paragon of diversity\n\nThe notion that \"Cultural diversity is a driving force of development\" is not our idea, but rather UNESCO's. Bolloré Logistics is proud to have been named European Leader in Diversity by the *Financial Times* for the second year in a row. This prestigious award underlines the company's continued commitment to Inclusion and diversity within its teams.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\n## *The Bolloré Group gender equality index*\n\n|                               | 2023 | 2022 |\n|-------------------------------|------|------|\n| BL Guadeloupe                 | 92   | 99   |\n| Nord Sud                      | NC   | 94   |\n| IER                           | 88   | 90   |\n| BIS                           | 86   | 89   |\n| UES Telecom                   | 88   | 89   |\n| Bolloré Energy                | 91   | 86   |\n| Bolloré Logistics             | 85   | 85   |\n| Sogetra                       | 89   | 84   |\n| UES Bolloré                   | 88   | 83   |\n| Foresea Technologies          | 85   | 82   |\n| BTLC                          | 87   | 79   |\n| UES La Réunion                | 86   | 75   |\n| Bolloré Solutions Logistiques | 93   | 72   |\n\nFor the Automatic Systems and Nord Sud entities, although they are subject to index calculation, the representativeness criteria by category imposed by the index methodology do not make it possible to calculate it.\n\n# *The Bolloré(2) Group's gender equality indicators(1)*\n\n| (as a percentage) | 2023 | Of which<br>Bolloré Logistics | 2022* |\n|-------------------|------|-------------------------------|-------|\n| Women(3)          | 46.6 | 51.1                          | 46.8  |\n| Women managers(4) | 40.1 | 42.5                          | 39.1  |\n| Women recruits(5) | 45.1 | 47.8                          | 48.2  |\n| Women trained(6)  | 47.6 | 52.2                          | 48.8  |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from social reporting (see section 1.3.1.1. – Social reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding the Communications sector to improve legibility in terms of the action described in this chapter.

As a result, Vivendi places the utmost importance on diversity and gender diversity within its Management teams, with the goal of increasing the proportion of women at the highest level in all of the group's entities, and implementing specific actions to promote women and gender parity. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 4.3.1.2. Fostering an inclusive environment and diversity, essential to the group's DNA.\n\n# **• Mobility: a winning approach for employees and the organization**\n\nEmployee mobility is both a priority and a practical reality within the Bolloré Group. It may be geographical (national or international) or functional with a change of position within the same business line, to another business line or even through the creation of bridges between our different activities. It is an opportunity for employees to continue their development and strengthen their employability, and for the organization to build on the experience already acquired and promote cross-functionality.\n\nThe main keys to the success of mobility actions are proximity and the quality of the discussions the employees have with their managers and human resources managers to help them develop their career project, its feasibility and implementation. It was through this proximity and quality of dialog that, in 2023, in a context of fluctuating activity levels, changing organizations, and the sale of the Transportation and logistics business, the Bolloré Group was able to move 302 employees identified in Career Committees.\n\nHowever, policies and processes are required to encourage and facilitate internal mobility. In 2023, in line with the commitments made in 2022, three key actions were carried out illustrating the Group's desire to position mobility as a driver of employee performance and development.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n## A common mobility policy\n\nThe internal mobility policy drafted in 2019 continues to be rolled out and is more visible to employees. Note that the mobility policy is based on two main principles: it applies to all levels of the organization and all business lines, and it gives priority to internal applications in our recruitment process. As a result, job vacancies are widely published.\n\nIn order to maintain our actions on this subject, a pilot project has been launched in the Bolloré Transportation and logistics division at the Corporate level, aimed at recording, automating and harmonizing the Career Committee process in a system common to all divisions.\n\n# *The Bolloré(2) Group's internal mobility indicators(1)*\n\n## A network of business line HR officers ensuring cross-functionality\n\nIn order to implement the policy and continue to make progress on internal mobility, HR officers have been identified for each business line and tasked with providing an overview of the vacancies and the employees on mobility assignments across the Group. These HR officers participate in the business line Career Committee meetings, as well as in the bimonthly meetings of the mobility network. This participation allows them to better understand employees and their development challenges across all divisions, and to be proactive throughout the year on open positions or successions to be prepared.\n\n|                                                                                                 | 2023 | Of which<br>Bolloré Logistics | 2022* |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|-------------------------------|-------|\n| Internal mobility from another legal entity in the Bolloré Group (employees joining the entity) | 162  | 124                           | 146   |\n| Internal mobility towards another legal entity in the Bolloré Group (employee departures)       | 140  | 120                           | 146   |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from social reporting (see section 1.3.1.1. – Social reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) Tese indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding the Communications sector to improve legibility in terms of the action described in this chapter.\n\nConsolidated Group data including the Communications sector are presented, where available, in the social indicator summary tables (see section 1.3.1. – Summary tables of social indicators). More information on the policies and action plans implemented in the Communications sector is available in Vivendi's non-financial performance statement.\n\n\\* Data for the 2022 scope excluding Bolloré Africa Logistics following the sale of this business line.\n\nInternal mobility is a strategic element in the Vivendi group's human resources development policy to help employees grow professionally and to build loyalty. It also addresses organizational challenges (flexibility, decompartmentalization of functions, diversity of profiles within a team) and individual needs (revitalizing career paths and enhancing employability). At the group level, an Internal Mobility Charter has existed for over fifteen years, as well as a platform to collect and share job offers from French entities open to mobility. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 4.3.1.1. Recognizing talent and growing together.\n\n# **• Training policy**\n\nAnticipating the skills required for our business lines, in a rapidly changing and increasingly competitive environment, is still essential to ensure the excellence of the Group's services and products. Our investment in developing our employees' skills is key to achieving this.\n\n- In 2023, a total of 2,067 registrations were recorded for in-person and remote training, and more than 152,090 registrations for all-digital training.\n- Some 65 training projects were launched across the Group in 2022, and more than 50 internal and external trainers took part in these projects.\n- Main topics:\n- Management and talent;\n- Onboarding;\n- Business and customer relations;\n- Freight forwarding;\n- Soft skills.\n\nThe B'University Online training platform recorded more than 329,675 connections in 2023; traffic remains very high.\n\nIn 2023, women accounted for 50% (8,716) of employees receiving training and men made up 50% (8,700) to achieve perfect parity.\n\nOverall, 31,538 training enrollments were by managers and 120,552 by employees without managerial functions.\n\n# The Bolloré corporate university: B'University\n\nAs the Group undergoes profound transformation in a complex environment (international conflicts, climate and energy crises, inflation, the importance of meaningful work, hybrid work, etc.), the training offer must provide a strategic and operational response in line with those of the Group's Executive management, Finance Department and Human Resources Department.\n\nLaunched in 2020, the corporate university, B'University, is committed to driving these transformations and supporting employees in their development and employability.\n\nB'University has its own facilities in Suresnes (training rooms, codevelopment, etc.), which are greatly appreciated by employees and partners alike. The team specializes in project management and training engineering, content design and creation, and digital learning.\n\nIn 2021, B'University obtained ISO 9001:2015 certification in the fields of design, animation and deployment of training solutions, as well as the Qualiopi certificate. These certifications, a guarantee of quality, were renewed in 2023.\n\n## The multi-source format is prioritized\n\nInternal business lines and learners now prefer new training programs to be offered as \"blended learning\" opportunities. The assimilation of digital training continued with growing collective awareness that it is possible to learn effectively remotely. Drawing on this observation, using the B'University brand, the Group is continuing to accelerate its move towards more digital training aimed at developing employees' skills in the short, medium and long term. This draws on two strategic priorities:\n\n- the quality of training, combining efficient and diversified solutions to ensure efficiency and acquisition;\n- the experience of learning via fun (gamification) and immediately accessible methods.\n\n# Rollout of training on B'University Online, the Group's training platform\n\nIn 2023, B'University provided customary support for the launch of all mandatory training campaigns (Compliance, IT Security, GDPR, etc.).\n\nB'University introduced new options to the catalog of training courses focused on soft skills and building Office 365 proficiency. Employees expressed an average satisfaction rate of 3.4 out of 4 for this training offer.\n\nAt the end of October 2023, out of the 73 modules available in digital format, employees expressed an average satisfaction rate of 4.2 out of 5.\n\n#### Tailor-made training programs\n\nIn 2022, as remote working became increasingly widespread, the Group set up training on hybrid management to help employees adapt managerial practices and manage a team in a hybrid working context; this training continued in 2023.\n\nIn addition, a \"Train the Trainer\" course was launched and is proving a great success with employees who want to share their knowledge internally or support the rollout of internal projects.\n\nTEKAs, the training program dedicated to Bolloré Logistics' contract managers launched in 2021, was a great success. Its aim is to increase efficiency in day-to-day practices while remaining customer-centric.\n\nIn 2023, B'University supported the \"Globe Shippers\" project, whose goals include providing Bolloré Logistics' most loyal customers with a training benefit. To this end, they receive training sessions on the fundamentals of transport and logistics are run by B'University, as well as customized program design sessions.\n\nB'University also supported strategic training projects for the Bolloré Group, such as assistance with deploying the Transport Management System worldwide and the project to create a global business line onboarding pathway.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\nA B'Tomorrow class of 101 talented young people selected by region began in March 2023. B'Tomorrow is an advanced development program for talented young people that aims to improve behavioral skills, develop the network at the regional level, extend Group knowledge, and build strong professional relationships. With the integration of a self-assessment tool (DISC) in 2023, the program continues to expand, and will include a public speaking module in 2024.\n\n#### Training our managers to better prepare future generations\n\nOur managers play a key role in the Group's performance. Four major training programs support them, starting from the role of team manager to country\n\n# *The Bolloré(2) Group's training indicators(1)*\n\nand regional management functions. The Proxy, Most, Maps and Smart Leaders programs have a proven track record. With a pragmatic approach, they also build a shared managerial practices and a strong network of ambassador-managers in a company increasingly focused on learning. Each course comprises common foundations aligned with the Group's values. As such, they incorporate a virtuous managerial chain, encouraging the sharing of best practices. With these programs, the aim is to help managers develop skills in their role at each stage of their career. Participants are mixed with managers from the Group's various entities. IER has continued to develop its managers by drawing up a managerial charter to enable each manager to strengthen their practices and better support their teams.\n\n|                                                | 2023    | Of which<br>Bolloré Logistics | 2022*   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------|---------|\n| Number of employees trained                    | 17,666  | 14,621                        | 16,459  |\n| – France                                       | 7,177   | 4,821                         | 6,628   |\n| – Africa                                       | 0       | 0                             | 0       |\n| – Asia                                         | 6,227   | 6,092                         | 5,635   |\n| – Americas                                     | 1,992   | 1,734                         | 2,042   |\n| – Europe (excl.

More information on the policies and action plans implemented in the Communications sector is available in Vivendi's non-financial performance statement.\n\n\\* Data for the 2022 scope excluding Bolloré Africa Logistics following the sale of this business line.\n\nFor the Vivendi group, skills development and training tackle today's challenges and anticipate challenges on the horizon. For each of the group's companies, this means deploying the strategy and its needs, anticipating the transformation and evolution of its businesses (GEPP, or job and career management) and responding to employees' demands to grow and learn. Training is a priority, enabling us to foster all three aspects of an individual employee's human capital: skills, experience and personal development. Collectively, the main training areas chosen by the company support the deployment of its strategy and meet its needs. In this time of rapid transformation, the Group prioritizes training in changing professions, managerial skills, new organizational methods, quality of work life, health and safety prevention, and awareness of diversity, equity and inclusion. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 4.3.1.1. Recognizing talent and growing together.\n\n# **• Professional development support**\n\nThe annual appraisal: a key process for quality employee/manager discussions The annual appraisal is a key process implemented in all countries and for all employees.\n\nThis exchange is a special moment between employees and managers to review the past year and plan for the coming year. It involves addressing the employee's performance and skills, as well as expectations for the coming year and the associated resources. This time is also used to assess collaboration and see how it can be further improved. The purpose of the discussion is to encourage the development of skills and talents as a means of better meeting the goals and needs of employees and short- and medium-term organizational challenges. The content of this discussion is therefore key to supporting the employee and nurturing numerous HR processes such as mobility, training plans and Career Committees.\n\nThe rate of completion of annual appraisals held steady in 2023 (83%) compared with 85% in 2022.\n\n#### More development to improve performance\n\nDespite the context, because the Group is convinced of the importance of this exchange, the process has been adapted to strengthen its practice and impact. Three main changes have been implemented:\n\n- 1. the introduction of a shared core of behavioral skills in line with the Group's values;\n- 2. performance and development are addressed simultaneously with a \"challenge and support\" approach;\n- 3. ongoing dialog with the possibility of monitoring objectives during the year in order to be as close as possible to the business momentum.\n\nTo assist employees and managers in the exchange, a digital toolbox has been updated, with around twenty sources of content offering diverse educational methods (guides, fact sheets, videos, etc.). These tools are intended to help with the content of the exchanges, as well as with active listening, reformulation, and feedback techniques, etc.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Towards a common digital platform for managing appraisal meetings\n\nOver the past few years, the Group has been committed to an HR transformation plan to increase digitalization. The roll-out of the digital platform used by part of the Transportation and logistics division, the holding company, and Systems in 2021 was confirmed in 2022, with the aim of integrating the ASPAC region by 2024. The use of this platform makes it easier to capture and monitor exchanges over time. Moreover, this shift towards a common system is a real driver of improvements in mobility, training and Career Committees process through easy access for the HR community. It also allows for better follow-up via indicators.\n\n## Career Committees for cross-functionality and anticipation\n\nCareer Committees are used across the Group. Committee meetings follow a process ranging from the first levels of management to the highest levels. They aim to anticipate, through a collective discussion between managers and human resources, changes in the organization, to discuss the profiles of the talented employees identified, and to establish appropriate succession plans and development actions to be implemented. The challenge they face is to guarantee proactive management of jobs and skills.\n\nMeetings are organized at the division level as well as at the Group level by business line. The momentum remains strong, with 57 Career Committees organized, a stable figure compared with 2022 (excluding the Africa division).\n\n# **• Pay and compensation policy**\n\nThe Bolloré Group has set a clear course for its compensation policy. Its aim is that wages should be aligned with local markets in each of the countries where it operates and that the benefits it offers its employees should compare favorably with established practice in each market. It has therefore continued to implement the infrastructure needed to achieve this ambition. A system for weighing up job requirements has been adopted on a test basis in Asia and at the head office. Furthermore, a \"living wage\" study on the duty of care scope was completed in several countries (see section 1.2.2.2. – Promoting human rights in our value chain).\n\nThe Vivendi group strives to offer employees attractive and motivating compensation based on their skills and their personal contribution to the company's performance. The group's remuneration policy is based on principles of fairness and non-discrimination and rewards both individual and collective performance. The HR teams participate in benchmarking surveys and regularly analyze compensation to ensure compensation is pertinent internally and to compare it with the market so the business lines are able to retain their talent and attract potential new talent. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 4.3.1.1. Recognizing talent and growing together.\n\n# **• Conclusion**\n\nIn response to the risks identified, the Group seeks to ensure that it has the right skills at the right place and at the right time to support its strategy. The policy rolled out is one of acting proactively to meet the challenges that lie ahead. The implementation of combined actions is seen as a factor of success and competitiveness, but also as a driver of forward-looking management and decision-making. Its purpose is to:\n\n- optimize recruitment, training, mobility, and leveraging of key know-how;\n- contribute to the implementation of the talent management and future skills development strategy.\n\nThese systems also allow us to respond to:\n\n- risks related to issues of attractiveness: strengthening the employer brand, improving recruitment, adapting jobs to changes in the environment and corporate strategy, anticipating internal issues related to the age structure and affirming the Group's added value on the market by the coherent development of the businesses;\n- risks related to retention issues: promoting internal mobility, revitalizing and motivating employees by valuing skills and supporting professional projects, finding new drivers of loyalty for the key skills of our structure and facilitating the transmission of knowledge and know-how so as not to lose key skills.\n\nTo measure the effectiveness of our initiatives in terms of attracting and retaining talent, the permanent-contract turnover indicator has been used since 2019. Since 2020, it has been enriched with a specific focus on voluntary turnover (resignations only).\n\nIn the Systems division, at IER, employee retention and engagement initiatives have been implemented: HR coffee mornings, sustainable development weeks, quality of life at work, implementation of an onboarding pack (introductory booklet and integration seminars), and interviews following voluntary departures.\n\nPolyconseil has made kindergarten places available to its employees in order to limit turnover.\n\n#### *Staff turnover indicators(1) at the Bolloré Group(2)*\n\n| (as a percentage)                                           | 2023 | Of which<br>Bolloré Logistics | 2022* | Change<br>2023/2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|------|-------------------------------|-------|---------------------|\n| Turnover(3) (all reasons for permanent contract departures) | 18.5 | 19.3                          | 21.3  | -2.8 pt             |\n| Turnover(4) (permanent contract resignations only)          | 11.3 | 12.1                          | 13.7  | -2.4 pt             |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from social reporting (see section 1.3.1.1. – Social reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding the Communications sector to improve legibility in terms of the action described in this chapter.

The Bolloré Group, like most of the major groups, was faced with these tensions, particularly in certain business lines (logistics experts, IT experts including developers and data scientists, production operators and certain finance specialists). Despite carrying out two major disposal projects in 2022 and 2023, the Bolloré Group managed to contain overall turnover, which now stands at 18.5% and 11.3% on the basis of resignations alone, with a decrease of two points versus 2022.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.2.1.2.2.

In gray: non-priority non-financial risk at the division level.\n\nThe Bolloré Group businesses operate in different countries where local standards in terms of working conditions and social dialog can vary, representing a risk not only to employee development, but also to business continuity, potentially preventing us from delivering our services within the timeframe and to the standard expected by our customers.\n\nAt the Vivendi group, the risks associated with the challenges of social dialog have not been identified as major but are described as having the potential to engender additional operating costs in the event of employee absences, loss of confidence in the company or deterioration in the social climate and reputational impact that could damage the group's attractiveness and employee loyalty. Questions pertaining to social dialog and working conditions are detailed in Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 4.3.1. Offering all talent an attractive and inclusive working environment, in the passage \"Promoting continuous exchanges and social dialog\". For more information on the management of CSR priority risks in the Communications sector, see Vivendi's 2023 Universal registration document in chapter 2 – 2.2. Main non-financial risks and opportunities.\n\n# Group policy\n\nThe Bolloré Group is committed to guaranteeing and promoting quality social dialog over the long term, combining economic reality and response to internal social expectations to ensure collective corporate performance without jeopardizing existing balances. This is a central plank of the construction of a corporate social responsibility approach, making it the focus of special attention.\n\nSpecific features include:\n\n- promotion of social dialog;\n- development of company-specific agreements and, more specifically, working conditions as the driver of the company's performance, and;\n- defense of any action aimed at combating discrimination and promoting professional equality.\n\nThe Human Resources teams implement these guiding principles and common values throughout the world, taking care to adapt them to:\n\n- the specific nature of each country as regards prevailing legal provisions;\n- the economic reality and strategy of each company (determining the scopeof company-specific agreements possible depending on the structure concerned);\n- inter- and intra-business unit diversity, and;\n- human resources management and development priorities (retention of existing employees and/or attractiveness for job applicants through qualitative company agreements).\n\nThis policy gives rise to a rich and lively social dialog organized within the Group as part of negotiations with employee representatives or in other forms, depending on the laws of each country in the network.\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries undertake to facilitate the expression of employees in countries where the International labour Organization (ILO) conventions on the freedom to organize have not been ratified.\n\nThe development of industrial relations as a vector for the construction of a body of company-specific agreements is a subject of constant concern, with the aim of maintaining a peaceful social climate and ensuring ongoing dialog with employee representatives.\n\nBest practices, successful experiences and difficulties encountered on industrial relations matters are shared between central and local functions in direct exchanges and at HR seminars and workshops. Regular communication between local Human Resources teams and Industrial Relations Departments and the Group Human Resources Department is reflected in ongoing change to and development of the employee management approach in a continuous improvement process.\n\nSocial dialog and company-specific agreements must be a source of genuine social engineering for the company, allowing it to adapt labor standards to its requirements in terms of business productivity. In other words, they must facilitate organization and adaptation to ongoing transformations resulting from economic globalization while ensuring a fair redistribution of profits to employees in the form of benefits and salary gains.\n\nAs part of its social policy, and in accordance with the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organization, Vivendi's priority is to have a permanent and constructive dialog with employees and their representatives. Accordingly, the group conducts a social dialog and consultation process at all levels to find collective solutions, particularly on issues relating to working conditions, organizational changes and occupational health and safety. At the group level, social dialog is pursued through two bodies. One is national, the group Works Committee, and the other European, the European Works council. As regards working conditions, Vivendi promotes working times and modes that help to improve the quality of life and well-being of its employees. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 4.3.1. Offering all talent an attractive and inclusive work environment, in the passage \"Promoting continuous exchanges and social dialog\".\n\n# Action plan and areas of improvement\n\nThe actions and objectives for 2023 in this area were as follows:\n\n- the first is to continue applying the procedure for consolidating the various collective agreements in place and to develop it so as to maintain a comprehensive approach to social dialog and the specific agreements covering all entities in the scope;\n- the second is to promote shared approaches to social dialog while ensuring the preservation of the specificities of legal entities in respect of their country of location, their business, their economic results or their management and human resources development priorities, and;\n- the third is to define performance indicators with associated objectives to measure progress and plan corrective actions in the event of non-progression.\n\nFor social dialog and the development of company-specific agreements in the operating entities, it has been decided to present a focus by geography (using three areas) rather than by business so as to take into account the specificities of laws applicable in each country, which naturally impact internal company standards.\n\n# **• Americas, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and South Asia**\n\nThese areas, with a few exceptions, tend to have national labor regulations rather than agreements specific to each entity.\n\nMany entities establish unilateral internal industrial relations arrangements that reflect their own priorities, including equality of treatment and nondiscrimination.\n\nOther entities, less numerous, have conducted negotiations giving rise to a collective agreement.\n\nNoteworthy achievements include:\n\n- in India, Bolloré Logistics organized sports events (cricket, self-defense, yoga, etc.) in 2023, awareness-raising sessions (breast cancer, harassment, fire and safety procedures, etc.), AcTogether initiatives, CSR actions (recycling of wooden pallets and cardboard, reduction of lighting, etc.) and various events (women's rights day, retirement, etc.);\n- in the ASPAC region, Bolloré Logistics has implemented measures to improve the quality of life at work (variable working hours, remote working), renovated many offices and purchased new offices and carried out health and well-being initiatives;\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n- in 2023, Bolloré Logistics financed a vaccination campaign for employees and their families in South Asia and participated in the Green Globe action (exchange of used paper for plants);\n- in the Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Pakistan, Bolloré Logistics once again organized a week of employee well-being (physician, nutritionist, sports, motivation, etc.) in 2023. As there are no employee representatives in this region, a Social Committee has been set up to work on company life and propose social projects based on employee surveys;\n- in 2023, Bolloré Logistics USA continued to pursue several health-related initiatives (dentist, wellness training, mammograms, etc.);\n- in the LATAM region, Bolloré Logistics continued to organize charity events and tree-planting days, as well as several wellness initiatives for employees (mental health awareness, gym, nutrition, women's health, etc.), and;\n- Bolloré Logistics Canada carried out a number of initiatives to fight stress and promote psychological well-being in the workplace (retirement workshops, community vegetable garden).\n\n# **• Europe**\n\nIn 2020, the Group and the representatives of its European workforce agreed to set up the Bolloré Group European Corporations Common Committee (BECCC), to establish social dialog.\n\nThe objective is to make the BECCC a forum for giving the labor force in each European country a fuller vision and understanding of the strategy, economic situation and common human resources and training policies of the Group\n\n## *The Bolloré(2) Group's social dialog indicators(1)*\n\nin Europe. The social dialog in the BECCC at the European level is in no way intended to take the place of national social dialogs. It does aim, however, to help enrich the national discussions through a better understanding by the representatives of how the directions taken and the projects established in each country are inspired by and further the broad strategy and plans of the Group in Europe.\n\nIn 2023, the BECCC met several times. These sessions included discussions on the Bolloré Group's CSR strategy, as well as the strategy of its Transportation and logistics division in Europe, including the planned sale to the CMA CGM group of all the freight forwarding and logistics activities grouped under Bolloré Logistics. In addition, the BECCC representatives received legal training in 2023 to deepen discussions within this body.\n\nThe following noteworthy agreements were reached in 2023:\n\n- agreements following mandatory annual negotiations for 2023 in all of the Group's main subsidiaries in France;\n- an agreement on workplace gender equality, quality of life at work and working conditions signed at Bolloré Energy on May 2, 2023 and at IER on November 28, 2023;\n- a Bolloré telecommuting agreement for Bretagne branches on September 28, 2023;\n- IER modulation amendment on May 31, 2023;\n- Bolloré Logistics, Bolloré Logistics Martinique, Bolloré Logistics Guyane, Bolloré Logistics Guadeloupe, UES Bolloré Logistics La Réunion, BTLC, B'IS, Bolloré Energy and Nord Sud CTI agreements on professional elections.\n\n| (as a percentage)                                                                                              | 2023 | Of which<br>Bolloré Logistics | 2022* | Change<br>2023/2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|-------------------------------|-------|---------------------|\n| Percentage of entities where employees can benefit from union<br>representation and/or staff representation(3) | 36.1 | 36.8                          | 39.3% | -3.2 pt             |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from social reporting (see section 1.3.1.1. – Social reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding the Communications sector to improve legibility in terms of the action described in this chapter.\n\n- Consolidated Group data including the Communications sector are presented, where available, in the social indicator summary tables (see section 1.3.1.

ACTING WITH INTEGRITY WHEN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESS AND PROMOTING HUMAN RIGHTS IN OUR ACTIVITIES**\n\nThe intensification of regulatory and societal expectations has led the Group to phase in due diligence processes, in all its operations and as part of its business relationships. The Group is thus committed to an ethics policy based on commitments shared by all its subsidiaries, and it makes every effort to institute a framework that guarantees ethical practices that respect human rights in its business conduct.\n\n# **1.2.2.1. SHARING THE SAME BUSINESS ETHICS AND ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THE STRICTEST STANDARDS**\n\n# **1.2.2.1.1. SHARING THE SAME BUSINESS ETHICS**\n\n# Group policy\n\nThe Bolloré Group has been committed since its creation to an ethical approach based on commitments shared across all its subsidiaries.\n\nA signatory of the United Nations Global Compact since 2003, the Bolloré Group has undertaken to support the fundamental principles of the Global Compact relating to human rights, working standards, the environment and the fight against corruption. As a signatory, the Group undertakes to include the 10 principles of the Global Compact into its strategy, culture and day-today operations but also to clearly inform its employees, partners, customers and the public of its commitment.\n\nThe Bolloré Group condemns corruption, influence peddling and anticompetitive practices. It ensures financial transparency, compliance with economic sanctions programs and the protection of personal data. It avoids attacks on the environment, human rights and the fundamental freedoms, health and safety of people. Lastly, it fights against all forms of discrimination and harassment.\n\nThe Bolloré Group's Code of Conduct reiterates these commitments and details the behavior expected of any person acting on its behalf.\n\nBecause individual actions must not compromise the collective commitment, it is the responsibility of each of the employees, agents and business partners of all Group companies to join it. The Bolloré Group does not tolerate any breach of its Code and encourages its stakeholders to report any action that would be contrary to it. The perpetrators of prohibited behavior are subject to disciplinary sanctions or legal proceedings in accordance with applicable law.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Corruption and influence peddling(1)\n\n#### *Prioritization of risks related to corruption and influence peddling(1)*\n\n| Transportation and logistics | Oil logistics  | Industry |       |         | Communications |\n|------------------------------|----------------|----------|-------|---------|----------------|\n| Bolloré Logistics            | Bolloré Energy | Blue     | Films | Systems | Vivendi        |\n\n(1) Priority non-financial risk.\n\nIn blue: priority non-financial risk at the division level. In gray: non-priority non-financial risk at the division level.\n\nThe Bolloré Group condemns all forms of corruption and influence peddling. Persons acting on behalf of the Group must refrain from offering any benefit whatsoever to any person (in particular public officials) to persuade them to perform or refrain from performing an official function, or to persuade them to exercise their influence with a view to obtaining an undue decision for the benefit of a Group company<sup>(2)</sup>.\n\nThe French Sapin II law of December 9, 2016 requires French companies with at least 500 employees and with revenue or consolidated revenue in excess of 100 million euros to take measures to prevent and detect corruption and influence peddling.\n\nAs such, the Group has implemented a compliance program inspired by the highest international standards in business ethics, and ensures that it is integrated into the operational and organizational processes of all Group subsidiaries, supported by a network of compliance officers at all levels of the organization.\n\nThis risk has not been identified as one of the priority risks of the Communications sector, given the nature of its activities. For more information on the management of CSR priority risks in the Communications sector, see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document in chapter 2 – 2.2. Main nonfinancial risks and opportunities.\n\n# International export controls and sanctions\n\nThe Bolloré Group complies with all sanctions, including those issued by the United Nations Security Council, the European Union and the United States of America, whether they be restrictive measures against a State, an individual or an organization. All persons acting on behalf of the Group must refrain from participating in transactions that could violate an embargo, sector-specific sanctions or asset freezes<sup>(3)</sup>.\n\n# **1.2.2.1.2. ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE STRICTEST STANDARDS**\n\nWithin the Bolloré Group, a dedicated organization ensures the effective implementation of a program based on the best standards in this area(7) in the three areas of compliance: the prevention of corruption and influence peddling, the prevention of anticompetitive practices and compliance with export controls and economic sanctions programs.\n\nThe management of corruption risks at the Vivendi group is based on the deployment of an anticorruption system that includes appropriate measures and procedures in support of four objectives: risk identification, risk prevention, risk detection and implementation of control measures. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 3.2.1. The anticorruption system\n\n# Governance of compliance\n\nCompliance with the Bolloré Group's commitments is based on an effective and consistent system, common to all activities, implemented in particular by an organization responsible for ensuring its application:\n\n• the Board of Directors' Audit Committee, which monitors the three areas of compliance as part of its oversight of the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems;\n\nThe Bolloré Group(4) must observe the international, community and national regulations on export controls and economic sanctions that apply to the Group's business lines. Such regulations are enacted and updated actively by political entities at different levels: international organizations such as the UN, political and economic unions such as the European Union for their Member States, the countries themselves such as France and the United States of America.\n\nThe objective of export controls is to prevent goods from being diverted from peaceful civilian use, to control war materials and, for some States, to control strategic exports.\n\nEconomic and financial sanctions are an instrument of foreign policy of States and groups of States. They are intended to prohibit, restrict, or impose trade in targeted goods, technologies and services and may include measures for persons or entities related to States or groups of States. This includes territories, and natural or legal persons likely to represent a danger, and goods, equipment, or products classified as \"at risk\".\n\n# Compliance with competition provisions\n\nA healthy competitive environment conducive to innovation allows us to offer the best products and services to our customers.\n\nThe Bolloré Group does not engage in any practice aimed at unfairly distorting, hindering, suppressing or restricting free competition. Such practices include price fixing and dividing up market share and invitations to tender(5) .\n\nCompanies in the Bolloré Group(6) must comply, wherever they operate, with the rules of competition law laid down by States, the European Union and all international organizations. The rules prohibit, among other things, understandings, agreements, projects, formal and informal arrangements, or coordinated behavior between competitors whose purpose is to set their prices, the distribution of their territories, market shares or their customers.\n\n- Executive management sets the Group's targets and overall strategies, ensuring that all staff are informed of them;\n- the Ethics CSR and Anticorruption Committee, which defines and coordinates the implementation of the CSR approach in the Group and, as such, closely monitors the implementation and effectiveness of the Group's compliance system as described above, and;\n- the Group Chief Compliance Officer, who is responsible for implementing the compliance program, reports on the effectiveness of program to the Group's Audit Committee and the Ethics – CSR and Anticorruption Committee, and to the Group and division Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers.\n\nThe Compliance Department, created in 2008, oversees the effective implementation of the compliance program in all Group subsidiaries. Its staff of 10 includes managers, analysts, assistants and work-study students. To carry out its mission, it works in close collaboration with all operational and support functions (human resources and purchasing in particular) and relies on a network of compliance officers at all levels of the organization.\n\n- (1) The company itself and all its subsidiaries, within the meaning of article L. 233-1 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)*, or the companies it controls, within the meaning of article L. 233-3 of the same Code.\n- (2) Bolloré Group Code of Conduct, Anticorruption (p. 8).\n- (3) Bolloré Group Code of Conduct, Compliance with International Sanctions (p. 10).\n- (4) The company itself and all its subsidiaries, within the meaning of article L. 233-1 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)*, or the companies it controls, within the meaning of article L. 233-3 of the same Code.\n- (5) Bolloré Group Code of Conduct, Combating Anti-Competitive Practices (p. 10).\n- (6) The company itself and all its subsidiaries, within the meaning of article L. 233-1 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)*, or the companies it controls, within the meaning of article L. 233-3 of the same Code.\n- (7) In particular the recommendations of the French Anticorruption Agency (AFA) and those of the main regulatory authorities in these fields.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Compliance program for the fight against corruption and influence peddling, combating anticompetitive practices and compliance with international sanctions\n\nThe Bolloré Group is committed to satisfying all its stakeholders' expectations concerning business ethics, especially the prevention of corruption and influence peddling, the prevention of anticompetitive practices, and compliance with international sanctions.\n\nTo prevent, detect and deter breaches of its commitments, the Bolloré Group has deployed a compliance program inspired by the highest international standards(1) .\n\nThis program is founded on the following pillars:\n\n# **• Senior management's commitment**\n\nAt the highest level, the Group's senior management promotes a culture of integrity, transparency and compliance.\n\nIn terms of fighting corruption, the recommendations of the French Anticorruption Agency (Agence française anticorruption, AFA) supplement the system established by the Sapin II law and, as such, constitute the French Anticorruption standard, which the Bolloré Group applies.\n\nThis commitment is reflected in the Group's Code of Conduct. It relies in particular on a zero-tolerance policy for the risk of corruption, the inclusion of anticorruption requirements in procedures and policies, validation of the risk mapping, governance of the anticorruption prevention, detection and remediation program, and the implementation of a specific communications policy.\n\nThe same applies to the fight against anticompetitive practices, compliance with international sanctions and export controls in terms of approval of arrangements, codes of conduct, integration in procedures and policies, program governance and the implementation of a specific communication policy.\n\n# **• Risk mapping**\n\nThe mapping of corruption and influence peddling risks aims to identify, assess, prioritize and manage the inherent risks of corruption and influence peddling, taking into account the specific characteristics and diversity of our organizations in terms of business sectors, business lines or the geographical areas in which the Bolloré Group's activities and divisions operate.\n\nThe objective of the corruption and influence peddling risk mapping is to contribute to the management of risks covering all of the Group's managerial, operational and supports processes by giving compliance players the visibility necessary to establish proportionate prevention and detection measures adapted to the risks identified, so as to facilitate the implementation of these measures and any necessary remedial measures. The risk mapping was updated in 2022.\n\n# **• Risk management,through prevention, detection and remediation**\n\n# **Prevention**\n\n**• The Code of Conduct:** The Bolloré Group's ethical approach is based on values and principles embodied each day by all its executives and employees worldwide.\n\nThe Bolloré Group Code of Conduct details, for all employees and partners, the behavior expected in at-risk situations.\n\nIn particular, it reiterates the Group's zero-tolerance policy on corruption, its rejection of anticompetitive practices and its commitment to comply with all international sanctions. The Bolloré Group Code of Conduct applies to all persons acting on its behalf. It is incorporated into the internal regulations of all Group subsidiaries; employees who violate it are subject to disciplinary actions in accordance with applicable law. It can be found on the Group's website and must be distributed to all its partners, as an integral part of its expectations.\n\nThe Bolloré Group does not tolerate any breach of its Code and encourages its stakeholders to report any action that would be contrary to it via the professional whistleblowing system.\n\n**• Awareness-raising and training:** The Bolloré Group deploys a training system to ensure that all its employees have a good understanding of its Code of Conduct, in particular its zero-tolerance policy on corruption, its rejection of anticompetitive practices and its commitment to comply with all international sanctions programs.\n\nIn addition, employees in business lines identified as being at risk are subject to additional training through e-learning sessions on specific risks (gifts, bribery) and procedures aimed at preventing them.\n\nThis mandatory training path must be completed by all new employees and repeated every two years. The completion of these training courses is reviewed during annual appraisals.\n\n**• Third-party assessment:** the Bolloré Group ensures that its intermediaries, suppliers, subcontractors and customers adhere to the same business ethics.\n\nSpecific procedures for each activity, developed using a risk-based approach and a mapping of the types of third parties involved, are designed to ensure their integrity, and to verify and secure all business relationships upstream, within the normative framework of the AFA's recommendations. The teams who carry out this work ensure all third parties strictly comply with the values set out in the Bolloré Group's Code of Conduct and adhere to the regulations in force. The Group's objective is to instill in the DNA of its exposed managerial and operational teams, the absolute necessity of adopting and adhering to the anticorruption due diligence rules, an essential protective shield for the reputation and respectability of the Bolloré Group.\n\nTo this end, the dedicated procedures established for intermediaries and suppliers include a questionnaire and the collection of documents that will enable the required due diligence work to be carried out.\n\nThis consists of assessing a company's legal, social, shareholder and professional standing – in short, its reputation – and its strict compliance with national and international laws and regulations on anticorruption. It is prohibited to enter into any business relationship before obtaining approval from the Compliance Department (see chapter 2 – Bolloré Group duty of care plan).\n\n# **Detection**\n\n**• Whistleblowing system:** a mechanism that enables employees of the Bolloré Group companies and its external and occasional partners to alert it of a crime or an offense, a breach of the law or regulations, a threat to the general interest, or a failure to follow the Bolloré Group's Code of Conduct resulting from the activities of Group companies or of their subcontractors or suppliers.\n\nThis system, which can be accessed from the Bolloré Group's website and at alert.bollore.com, enables individuals to report actions that go against its anticorruption policy or that violate human rights.\n\nIn principle, the use of this system requires the identification of the whistleblower, unless the report provides sufficient details to establish the severity of the facts.\n\nReports are processed by specially authorized persons covered by an obligation of confidentiality.\n\nThe Group protects whistleblowers who act in good faith from any form of reprisal.\n\nThis whistleblowing system supplements but does not replace other internal reporting methods (such as the managerial reporting line).\n\n**• Anticorruption accounting controls and financial controls:** identified using the corruption risk map, specific anticorruption controls are in place at different levels of the organization. With respect to sanctions, financial controls are carried out on our transactions to ensure compliance with sanctions.\n\n**• The system's internal control and evaluation mechanism:** a three-level control system is applied to ensure the effectiveness of the anticorruption compliance program, which is subject to specific controls by the Group's Internal Audit Department.\n\n(1) Notably the guidelines of the AFA, the American FCPA, the American OFAC and the British Serious Fraud Office.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Remediation**\n\n**• Definition of corrective measures and disciplinary regime:** the updating of the mapping and the detection system through program controls and internal system assessments give rise to specific action plans ensuring the necessary remediation. In disciplinary terms, the perpetrators of prohibited behavior are subject to disciplinary sanctions or legal proceedings in accordance with applicable law.\n\n# Highlights\n\nThe French Anticorruption Agency continued its monitoring activities in 2023 under the judicial public interest agreement (CJIP). This monitoring, which applies to the company itself and all its subsidiaries, within the meaning of article L. 233-1 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* or the companies it controls, within the meaning of article L. 233-3 of the same Code, was completed in March 2023.\n\nFor more information, refer to chapter 3 on risk factors and internal control (see chapter 3 – 1.3. Legal risks).\n\nIn addition, in 2023 as in previous years, the many requests from third parties during the year led the Compliance Department to take action to meet the expectations of stakeholders in the field of anticorruption as well as regards controls on exports and compliance with international sanctions, which were again a major issue during the fiscal year.\n\n# Results and performance indicators\n\nThe results for the year are broadly in line with the deployment targets set.\n\n# **• Senior management's commitment.**\n\n#### This commitment includes:\n\n• expressing the managing body's commitment to the fight against corruption, as every year since 2018, on International Anticorruption Day (December 9). For the occasion, Marie Bolloré, Chief Executive Officer of the Systems division, and Fabricio Protti, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Bolloré Group, reaffirmed the Bolloré Group's determination to fight this scourge.\n\nThe awareness-raising initiative involved more than 2,500 employees around the world in webinars aimed at reviewing the challenges of the fight against corruption and the Group's work in this area;\n\n- monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of the anticorruption compliance program, compliance with competition rules and international sanctions by the three governance bodies, namely the Group Audit Committee, the Ethics – CSR and Anticorruption Committee and, month after month, by the Group's Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers and its activities; by the communications made by these same governing bodies at the head office and in the field;\n- assessing the performance of the main managers of the subsidiaries in the Transportation and logistics division, and setting up and holding Anticorruption Committee meetings. These committee meetings are the local point of contact for the commitment of senior management in each of the Group's entities;\n- reinforcing momentum in this area by updating the corruption risk mapping for all the Group's activities, the impacts identified by this update, in particular on the prevention tool in the form of the Code of Conduct, the detection of anticorruption accounting controls and remediation through specific action plans resulting from this updating of the mapping.\n\n# **• Corruption and influence peddling risk mapping**\n\nThe Group updated its mapping to apply a standardized methodology to allow consolidation at Group level.\n\nThis risk mapping update began in 2022 and continued in 2023 using the following methodology:\n\n• inventory of all operational and supports processes and sub-processes applicable to the various Bolloré Group activities;\n\n- central risk inventory: the risk scenarios to which the Bolloré Group is exposed were identified during individual interviews or workshops conducted with Group employees;\n- inventory of control resources: following individual interviews, workshops and contribution reports, the Compliance Department conducted internal work sessions aimed at identifying, with the relevant managers, the elements contributing to the control system implemented in the Bolloré Group. This work supplemented the business control environment already identified by the Group's employees questioned for the update;\n- development of a matrix to identify all identified risks and their ratings;\n- local risk inventory: the Compliance Department asked Group subsidiaries to decide on the processes and sub-processes identified, as well as the related risks. In 2023, 63 subsidiaries were surveyed. This exercise will continue until 2024, and;\n- inventory of action plans: identification of risk scenarios requiring action plans, definition of action plans and the central implementation method in the subsidiaries.\n\n# **• The Code of Conduct**\n\nThe Group's Code of Conduct, updated in 2020, is appended to the internal rules of procedure of all Group subsidiaries that have internal rules. The Code of Conduct was distributed to Group employees as described below (see Awareness and Training). A new update is planned for 2024 on the themes identified during the update of the mapping begun in 2022.\n\n# **• The whistleblowing system**\n\nEmployees are informed about how the professional whistleblowing system works and the terms and guarantees of use – in particular the protection of whistleblowers acting in good faith from any form of reprisal.\n\n# **• The awareness-raising and training system**\n\nThe Bolloré Group Code of Conduct and all components of its compliance program can be viewed on the dedicated intranet space. It is also distributed in print form, in emails and in posters during communication campaigns.\n\nTo assess the level of employee awareness, the following question was added to the annual appraisal form: \"Are you aware of the Bolloré Group's Code of Conduct and whistleblowing system?\" According to the analysis of the 2022-2023 campaign, 98% of the staff polled were aware of it.\n\nThe Code of Conduct and the whistleblowing procedure are also disseminated via the Code of Conduct e-learning module, which was updated in 2023 and completed by 12,485 employees (i.e. 95% of the target workforce). They are also publicized during awareness-raising actions (webinars to coincide with International Anticorruption Day), after which more than 2,500 participants were invited to vouch for their understanding of the Code of Conduct and the whistleblowing system.\n\nAn additional seven-module training campaign targeted employees belonging to business lines considered at risk (gifts, bribery, etc.) and focused on the corresponding procedures meant to prevent the specific risks. This second campaign resulted in 23,667 enrollments and a completion rate of 90%.\n\n# **• Third parties**\n\nAll of the Group's procedures have been reviewed and deployed in the Group's divisions and subsidiaries.\n\nA mapping of the Group's third parties was carried out and all third parties (intermediaries, suppliers and customers) eligible for an anticorruption assessment based on their category were screened and analyzed. Thus, this due diligence work initiated in 2020 and 2021 for some of the third parties was repeated this year in accordance with the three-year review rule included in the procedures (which of course excludes third parties whose alert systems require annual review).\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **• Anticorruption accounting controls**\n\nAs the process of identifying the controls to be carried out based on the risk mapping and the drafting of action to be carried out during these controls at the various levels of the organization were finalized in previous exercises, these controls were deployed in 2021. A number of missions to assist in implementing Sapin II accounting controls were carried out and level three anticorruption accounting controls were rolled out during field audits of the subsidiaries from spring 2021.\n\n# **1.2.2.1.3. THE FIGHT AGAINST TAX EVASION**\n\nFurther to the enactment of law no. 2018-898 of October 23, 2018 on the fight against tax, social security and customs fraud and the provisions of article L. 22-10-36 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* the Group has launched several actions to comply with the requirements of this new law.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Bolloré Group fulfills its tax obligations in compliance with local and international laws in force, pursuant to Code of Conduct and its Ethics and CSR Charter. The Bolloré Group does not tolerate any breach of these commitments.\n\n# Management of tax risk at the Bolloré Group level\n\nIn accordance with its commitments as set out in its tax policy and Code of Conduct, the Bolloré Group expects each subsidiary and each employee to strictly comply, in all circumstances, with the laws and regulations in force in the countries where the Group operates and with applicable international conventions. The Bolloré Group Tax Department is responsible for enforcing these commitments.\n\nSatisfactory organizational methods have been set up at the Group's Finance Departments to avert tax risks and to ensure that tax is calculated and paid correctly within the time limits in the States where it is owed and that tax filing requirements are met.\n\nBecause of its business model, the main risks that Bolloré Group entities are likely to encounter are reporting (late or inaccurate tax filing) and technical (misinterpretation of a regulation, unexpected legislative change, etc.) risks. These tax topics, which contribute to the quality of financial and accounting information, are regularly reviewed by the chief financial officers of each Bolloré Group entity, particularly during calls for tenders and when giving financial reports, whether during monthly meetings or during the preparation of interim or annual financial statements. The CFOs report directly to the Chairmen, members of the Boards of Directors, if any, or to the competent body of their reporting entity, as well as to the CFO at the next organizational level. They must ensure that financial data are prepared in accordance with the standards, principles and procedures in force and that they are reported reliably in accounting systems, which are themselves regularly monitored.\n\nWith the exception of the logistics activity, which by its nature involves operational flows between the various entities, cross-border intra-Group flows are limited and insignificant. They mainly consist of trademark fees, Bolloré SE services, and short- and medium-term financing for operational or external growth needs. The invoicing principles applied in this respect are in line with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) principles applicable to transfer pricing. These principles notably incorporate the recommendations issued as part of the 2015 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (Beps) project and take into account value creation, in addition to compliance with the arm's length principle.\n\nIn the context of their operational activities and/or investments, subsidiaries may be assisted by the Group Tax Department and/or by external tax advisors for any tax-related matters. When an outside consultant is involved, it undertakes to respect the commitments of the Bolloré Group.\n\nAn update made necessary by the mapping exercise carried out in 2022 identified the adaptations that will be implemented in 2023. Compliance with international sanctions is monitored through existing financial controls.\n\n# **• Internal control and evaluation system**\n\nBased on a specific audit of the general anticorruption compliance system aimed at assessing its various components, a level three control system was established in 2023 with a dedicated compliance auditing team within the Internal Audit department and presented at the meeting of the Ethics – CSR and Anticorruption Committee held on July 18, 2023.\n\nWhen a tax risk is identified, solutions are developed, scaled and implemented, in conjunction with the Group Tax Department and the appropriate Finance Departments, in order to minimize the risk. These analyses and solutions are regularly re-evaluated as projects evolve and laws and regulations change. Where appropriate, they are discussed and reviewed with auditors and/or competent tax authorities. The Group expects its subsidiaries to maintain transparent and constructive relations with the tax authorities in the countries in which they operate.\n\nWhen a company in the Group is the subject of a tax audit, the appropriate personnel and/or outside advisers are assigned to the tax audit to ensure that it is carried out without complications and is completed as quickly as possible.\n\nThe Bolloré Group also ensures that the following principles are respected:\n\n- transparency with tax authorities to foster quality relations to avoid any risk to the Group's reputation when local legislation and practices allow this. The Bolloré Group considers that such relationships engender longterm benefits for both the Group and local tax authorities;\n- fighting tax evasion by refusing to locate profits in tax havens. Localization is possible in States with beneficial tax systems if this is economically justified, i.e. the motivation is not mainly fiscal, and;\n- compliance of its tax policy with its sustainable development strategy by prohibiting any operation for which the main purpose is essentially to seek a tax gain, unless expressly allowed by the legislator.\n\nFor the last two points, the Group may use options provided for by local regulations in order to mitigate its tax or administrative burden. Thus, the Bolloré Group uses the legal provisions of the research tax credit (in France) and may create tax consolidation groups in countries where the law allows it. Nevertheless, in all cases, the Group undertakes to act with integrity in the conduct of its business and to fight tax evasion. Accordingly, then the Bolloré Group does business in a country whose taxation is considered preferential or which appears on the French list of non-cooperative countries or territories or on the European black or gray list of tax havens, it is solely because of its operational activities. When financial flows are being considered with one of these countries or States, the Group's Tax Department must be informed without delay.\n\n# Actions and procedures set up to combat tax evasion\n\nA tax section has been added to the Group's Code of Conduct in order to make public the Group's policy to combat tax evasion and the behaviors to be followed in order to meet these commitments.\n\nFurthermore a dedicated website is accessible to the Group's employees and commercial partners. It is part of the Group's professional whistleblowing system to issue alerts concerning actions that constitute or are liable to constitute tax evasion.\n\nThe Group continues to raise awareness among all Group staff and its business partners about preventing and combating tax evasion.\n\nThe Bolloré Group's legal and tax teams have already been deployed at central and local levels to advise and assist the Group's operational staff on a daily basis to ensure proper compliance with the applicable laws and regulations, in particular as part of the fight against tax evasion. They can also obtain advice from outside legal and tax experts, especially law firms.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.2.2.2. PROMOTING HUMAN RIGHTS IN OUR VALUE CHAIN**\n\n# **1.2.2.2.1. RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS**\n\n# Risks related to human rights(1)\n\n#### *Prioritization of human rights risks*\n\n| Transportation and logistics | Oil logistics  | Industry |       |         | Communications |\n|------------------------------|----------------|----------|-------|---------|----------------|\n| Bolloré Logistics            | Bolloré Energy | Blue     | Films | Systems | Vivendi        |\n\n(1) Priority non-financial risk.\n\nIn blue: priority non-financial risk at the division level. In gray: non-priority non-financial risk at the division level.\n\nOwing to its strong international presence, the Group hires many people, directly or indirectly, in institutional contexts that vary from one country to another, where human rights are at times threatened. That is why respect and promotion of human rights have been defined as a priority for the Group, covering issues such as guaranteeing decent working conditions, promoting social dialog and freedom of association of trade unions, the principle of non-discrimination (respect of the rights of individuals regardless of their origin, gender, sexual orientation, political or trade union membership, or their state of health, etc.) and the fight against all forms of harassment. It should be noted that forced labor and child labor represent an absolute priority for the Group in terms of prevention and action. These risks are controlled by the measures and internal controls set up to hire employees.\n\nThe identification and handling of these risks are subject to measures aimed at the Group's internal scope, its external stakeholders, and its supply and subcontracting chain. These measures are detailed in the chapter on the Group's duty of care plan (see chapter 2 – Bolloré Group's duty of care plan).\n\nThe human rights risks related to the activities of the Communications sector mainly cover issues around discrimination and harassment (psychological and sexual) of employees in their working environment, and those related to lack of information and support for consumers with using products and services marketed by the Vivendi group (for more information, see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 3.2.2. – duty of care plan).\n\n# Group policy\n\nThe Group strives to implement governance that reflects its values in the countries in which it operates in full compliance with local and international regulations. As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact since 2003 and having made this issue a fundamental pillar of its CSR strategy, the Bolloré Group has formally included dedicated commitments in its Group ethics system, consisting of the Code of Conduct, the Group Ethics and CSR Charter, the Responsible Purchasing Charter, the Diversity and Inclusion Charter and the Human Rights Charter.\n\nThe Code of Conduct sets out the expected behaviors of all persons acting on behalf of the Bolloré Group and formalizes recommendations to prevent, identify and report contrary actions. The Ethics & CSR Charter, signed by Cyrille Bolloré, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Group, identifies the major commitments associated with the Group's strategy, including \"Acting with integrity in our business conduct and promoting human rights\". It forms the basis of the Group's fundamental commitments from which the more in-depth policies or procedures are derived according to the issues identified as priorities. As such, the Group's Charter of Human Rights and the Group's Responsible Purchasing Charter integrates and strengthens these ethical measures by structuring a specific approach backed by international standards, particularly:\n\n- the International Charter on human rights;\n- the UN Guiding Principles on Business and human rights;\n- the OECD guidelines for multinational companies;\n- the International Labor Organization's core conventions, and;\n- the recommendations of the French Anticorruption Agency.\n\nThe commitments expressed in the Group's Human Rights Charter are also among the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and are rolled out under three main themes:\n\n- respect for the rights of workers throughout our value chain;\n- respect for the fundamental rights of communities close to our operations, and;\n- constant efforts to make a positive contribution to society.\n- In order to meet the commitments expressed in the Charter, the approach is based on a division of missions between:\n- the Group, which has a role of awareness-raising, training, mobilization, steering, pooling and reporting via the Group CSR Department, and;\n- the divisions and subsidiaries, which are responsible for operational implementation by including elements specific to their own business lines, as well as the necessary adaptations for their regions, entrusted to a division, or a CSR or Ethics Officer reporting to their Executive management.\n\nThe governance of ethical challenges is handled by Executive management through the Risk Committee and the Ethics – CSR and Anticorruption Committee, which meet once or twice a year to set guidelines that will be applied by the departments concerned and rolled out to the operational services (see chapter 1 – section 1.1.3. – CSR governance). The governance of ethical issues and more specifically human rights is ensured at the operational level through Human Rights Steering Committees bringing together the CSR, Group Compliance, and Group Human Resources Departments and the legal and purchasing business lines depending on the matters addressed.

RESPECT FOR WORKERS' RIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE VALUE CHAIN**\n\nTo promote human rights and ensure they are respected, the Group has always considered health, safety and the quality of working conditions as a major issue across the whole of its value chain. The Group's first human rights action plan to formalize this approach in accordance with regulations was rolled out over the 2019-2020 period and was built with a cyclical approach based on three key aspects (communication, awareness-raising and formalization). This action plan:\n\n• structured the Group's human rights approach;\n\n• incorporated new processes in the conduct of its operations, and;\n\n• continued the deployment and proper appropriation of these issues.\n\nSince then, the approach has been to strengthen the culture of vigilance among employees and the systems deployed for suppliers and subcontractors.\n\n# Employees\n\nRespect for workers' rights is based on the following issues: the health and safety of persons involved in the Group's activities, compensation, management of working hours and paid leave, diversity and the fight against discrimination, employee representation, and the fight against forced labor and child labor. These issues are set out and illustrated by indicators in the Group's duty of care plan.\n\nTo guarantee the proper appropriation of its principles and commitments among employees, the Group organizes human rights awareness-raising actions, including awareness-raising training modules (a specific human rights module and a module dedicated to compliance with the Code of Conduct, which also addresses human rights) have enabled more than 90% of employees to be informed about these issues.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nSince 2021, the Human Rights Steering Committee, including the CSR contacts of the Group's divisions and subsidiaries, as well as the support functions (legal, human resources, purchasing, compliance, etc.) has focused on the identification of a human rights priority scope (see section 2.3.2.1. – Human rights priority scope, within the Bolloré Group's duty of care plan) for the deployment of its approach and the action plans selected. Through dedicated bimonthly committee meetings, the CSR Departments and Group HR Department are working together to formalize a common framework to codevelop human rights roadmaps and action plans. In 2023, the strategy was organized around three types of actions:\n\n• the definition of an internal audit schedule, and;\n\n• the deployment of a project to address living wages.\n\nIn view of the change in its scope after the Bolloré Group sold all its activities on the African continent in December 2022, the human rights priority scope has refocused on freight forwarding activities in the Asia region. In 2023, of the 76 Bolloré Logistics entities, 31 entities were identified as priorities (see Duty of care plan 2.3.2.1 Human rights priority scope). These entities are located in 22 countries, more than half of which are in Asia-Pacific. The priority human rights scope will once again change in 2024, following the announcement in 2023 of the planned sale of Bolloré Logistics.\n\n• the implementation of specific measures in response to the challenges identified (the prioritization of issues relating to work time management was chosen in 2022);\n\n# *Human rights awareness module indicators*\n\n| (as a percentage)                                          | Americas | Asia/Pacific | Europe and<br>Middle East | France and overseas<br>departments, regions<br>and authorities | 2023 Total |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Percentage of employees trained in the human rights module | 88.9     | 94.6         | 91.8                      | 87.9                                                           | 90.8       |\n\n# **1.2.2.2.3. MAIN ACTIONS CARRIED OUT IN 2023**\n\n# **• Creation of a network of human rights officers**\n\nIn accordance with the pledges made in 2022, to strengthen the Group's organization and the cascading of its commitments locally, the Human Rights Steering Committee appointed dedicated officers among the teams in the local Human Resources Departments. These officers are essential points of contact for the head office and are responsible for:\n\n- ensuring that the Group's social and human rights commitments (defined in the Human Rights Charter and Diversity and Inclusion Charter) are applied to direct employees of the Group and its subcontractors;\n- reporting high-risk situations or conduct internal investigations.\n- implementing concrete due diligence measures and action plans developed at the head office;\n- contributing to the collection and reporting of local information from the HR and CSR Departments, as part of regulatory disclosures, and;\n- coordinating social compliance audits of clients to support local teams. This network of officers was finalized in 2023. It comprises more than 38 employees who have been educated on social compliance issues through various workshops and webinars, particularly in the Asia, Pacific and Middle East region. On-site training was organized in 7 countries (Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) to reinforce the awareness-raising effort.\n\n# **• Deployment of an internal audit approach**\n\nIn 2023, various assessments and surveys were carried out internally, particularly with regard to the priority issues identified by the Steering Committee, such as compensation and monitoring of working hours. The team in charge of social issues and human rights within the Human Resources Department has developed a social compliance audit questionnaire for the local staff to conduct self-assessments and internal controls within their operational scope, combined with document reviews and site visits within the priority scope. In the Asia-Pacific region, this covers Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. These self-assessments, inspired by the methodologies employed by international audit firms, address all social compliance topics and include various questions on the following issues: job security, working hours, living wages, social dialog, freedom of association, existence of works councils and workers' rights to information, consultation and participation, collective bargaining (including the percentage of the company's workforce covered by collective bargaining agreements), work-life balance, health and safety, gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value, training and skills development, employment and inclusion of people with disabilities, measures to combat violence and harassment in the workplace, diversity, child labor, forced labor, adequate housing, and privacy.\n\nIn 2023, 16 on-site self-assessments were carried out, including the head offices and main warehouses of the 7 selected countries. This approach did not identify any major non-conformities, and various areas for improvement were reported to the local departments. In the first half of 2024, Bolloré Logistics' Human Resources Department will set up a monitoring unit at the head office to coordinate the deployment of corrective actions.\n\nIn addition, an alert management protocol was put in place in 2023 to strengthen Bolloré Logistics' ability to manage any alerts on social and human rights issues and requests for external audits.\n\n# **• Deployment of a long-term project on living wages**\n\nIn line with the commitments announced in 2022, the Steering Committee approved the launch of a pilot project on living wages. This project, which was rolled out in 2023, helped develop the Group's requirements on certain social issues. As a catalyst for lifting people out of poverty and as a means of guaranteeing and respecting human rights, the question of a living wage has been identified as a priority issue in the Group's CSR commitments.\n\n# Methodology\n\n- While there is no universal definition of living wages, the project relied on the following definition: a living wage is a wage that allows workers to meet their basic needs and those of their families, and to have discretionary income to deal with other expenses. It takes into account factors such as the cost of housing, health care, education and other basic needs. A living wage is often higher than the legal minimum wage and reflects the cost of living in a given place.\n- For this initial exercise, the study focused exclusively on direct employees, looking at the wages earned for full-time equivalent working hours (excluding part-time work and overtime), and was carried out by the Group Human Resources teams with help from the network of human rights officers.\n- The 10 countries(1) selected for the project account for approximately 33% of Bolloré Logistics' total workforce. They were picked from the priority human rights scope based on their representativeness of the diversity of freight forwarding operations. The different regional socio-economic contexts were taken into account to define the thresholds that correspond to a living wage for each region, as the real cost of living can be very different from one place to another within the same country.\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\n- The methodology was based on:\n- wage levels established in existing international, national or sub-national legislation, as well as, where applicable, official standards or collective bargaining agreements aligned with an assessment of the wage level necessary to achieve a decent standard of living;\n- where applicable, on the national or sub-national minimum wage established by laws or collective bargaining;\n- in the absence of, or in addition to, the benchmarks defined by the Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDH), including applicable benchmarks compatible with the Anker methodology or provided by the WageIndicator Foundation or the Fair Wage Network, provided that they guarantee the primacy of collective bargaining for establishing the terms and conditions of employment.\n- The expert firm also referenced:\n- external data and benchmarks aligned with the Anker methodology to identify local living wage thresholds, making it possible to overcome the various gaps in existing benchmarks that are not systematically updated and, for example, do not necessarily take into account recent inflation or lack territorial granularity;\n- a guided process ensuring effective internal engagement to collect, aggregate and compare actual salary data internally, and understand what may or may not be eligible.\n\nThe expert firm was able to consult with the human rights officers in the Human Resources Department at the head office, who leveraged the network of Bolloré Logistics officers and held awareness-raising workshops and presentations on the methodologies. The purpose of this internal approach was to involve the local human resources teams in collecting the information necessary to carry out the study. Their participation and full involvement in the approach was identified as essential for data collection.\n\nDuring the study, it was observed that in most of the countries analyzed, the Group's employee benefits are what make it possible to reach or exceed the living wage threshold. Examples include medical insurance (which is sometimes extended to family members) that covers personal accidents, disability, outpatient consultations, emergencies, hospitalization or serious illnesses, as well as the 13th month contractual bonus granted to employees in some regions.\n\nHowever, some employee benefits related to annual leave, personal events such as weddings or religious holidays, and non-contractual bonuses (e.g. seniority and performance bonuses) are not included in the living wage calculation, even though they are often a significant source of income.\n\n# Results\n\nThis understanding of the various thresholds acquired by applying the Anker methodology will enable Bolloré Logistics to launch an initiative within the Human Resources Department in 2024 to work on the compensation structure for 146 employees identified during this pilot project whose analysis considered direct employees, or 4,349 staff members.\n\nThis initiative showed:\n\n- that internal staff are proficient in the data collection and processing methodology and calculation tools;\n- a detailed analysis of the various remuneration structures and confirmation of the Group's best practices.\n\n# Suppliers and subcontractors\n\nThe Group is focusing its efforts on the implementation and deployment of measures to enable it to exercise reasonable duty of care with regard to suppliers and subcontractors, in line with the measures in place for its own employees. The Human Rights Charter states that the Group's contractors and business partners must adhere to its principles, which are also reiterated in the Responsible Purchasing Charter. The implementation of the responsible purchasing approach is reflected in particular in:\n\n- a due diligence approach in the selection of suppliers and subcontractors, which systematically receive information on the Group's ethical measures before entering into the contractual relationship so that they can comply with them. Although the supplier selection and evaluation process is not consolidated in a single management tool, the Group Purchasing Department and the subsidiaries take account of ethical and compliance criteria in their purchasing process, above and beyond the standard financial, administrative and technical criteria required to fulfill the Group's commitments; a policy for assessing the integrity of suppliers and subcontractors, formalized by the Compliance Department;\n- a Responsible Purchasing Department working in particular to strengthen human rights aspects in ethical procedures;\n- the drafting and inclusion of a CSR clause and an anticorruption and compliance clause in contracts, illustrating the implementation of the Group's responsible purchasing approach, and;\n- the development of guidelines and the organization of specific information meetings to support company lawyers and purchasing teams in negotiations with business partners regarding the inclusion of this clause.\n\nThe training campaign for human rights officers designated for the priority scope in 2023 in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, covered due diligence topics such as the working conditions to implement, especially when using local employment agencies. The employment of migrant workers was a key focus. As such, employees of subcontracting companies were included in the self-assessments conducting on the priority scope in 2023. Furthermore, preventive and corrective actions were deployed follow up on this approach, including the integration of part of the management of indirect employees into the operational and HR internal control mechanisms. One example is the updating of working time monitoring processes in certain priority countries, where connected biometric systems have been installed to replace the physical time-clock machines used by subcontracting companies to monitor their workers. This made it possible to include subcontractors in the automated HR information system dedicated to payroll and working time management. These measures were put in place after educating and collaborating with local employment agencies, and make the monitoring and control of working hours and remuneration more reliable.\n\nActions tackling the specific risks associated with migrant workers were also implemented. During the audits carried out in 2022 at industrial sites in Malaysia, this issue was identified as requiring special duty of care efforts. Thus, the local and regional HR teams held discussions and worked with the employment agencies identified as using foreign workers to order to validate the guarantees provided in connection to hiring and accommodation conditions. In particular, a team organized a trip to Nepal, which is a country of origin for many foreign workers employed by Malaysian service providers. The team conducted an in-depth due diligence initiative and deployed measures to prevent the risk of debt bondage (e.g., verification of contracts, verification of hiring procedures, verification that the agency charges no upstream fees, confirmation that the terms of the contract are written in a language understood by the worker, etc.).\n\n# *In 2023*\n\n- All subcontractors and suppliers managed centraly by the Group Purchasing Department received the Group's Responsible Purchasing Charter. As stipulated in the Charter, the Bolloré Group expects the signatory to take all reasonable measures to ensure that its own supply chain complies with these commitments.\n- 98% of purchasing staff were made aware of human rights and ethical issues through awareness-raising modules or dedicated sessions.\n- All new contracts include the CSR clause.\n- The Bolloré Group's responsible purchasing strategy is described in the duty of care plan.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\n- **2. Innovating and deploying digital data measurement and exploitation solutions**\n- **Refining and strengthening the relevance of transport carbon impact data:** Bolloré Logistics has implemented a CO2 dashboard directly linked to the transport management IT system, which allows customers to obtain performance indicators and a detailed view of each shipment of goods (CO2 eq emissions by segment and mode of transport, by origin/destination, as well as the main atmospheric pollutants). Continued improvement work continued over the period.\n- **Developing digital tools to help with decision-making and optimize the logistics system:** Bolloré Logistics continued to develop its digital tools based on environmental data, gradually making it possible to systematically consider CO2 criteria from the design of transport services, and upstream of the carbon indicator included in the quote sent to the customer. The work undertaken in 2023, a decision support tool was put in place to suggest alternative transportation plans (change of carrier or mode, alternative fuel option) after automatically analyzing different scenarios based on the customer's CO2e reduction commitments.\n\n# **3. Innovating and implementing alternative transport solutions**\n\n- **Developing partnerships with airlines and shipping companies to promote alternative fuels:** for air transport, Bolloré Logistics is working through its partners to offer its customers sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which allows for a 70% to 95% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The Bolloré Logistics AIRsaf offer is available on any commercial route for all shipping modes, regardless of the airline, thanks to its \"book and claim\" system. The framework of this offer complies with the guidelines of the Smart Freight Center and the GHG Protocol, and applies restrictive selection criteria to promote a second-generation alternative fuel that does not compete with food production. Its traceability and carbon accounting are ensured by certification issued by an independent third party. In 2023, the Group signed six partnerships with strategic airlines as part of the AIRSaf offer, making it possible to avoid nearly 24,000 metric tons of CO2e.\n- For maritime transport, at the end of 2021, Bolloré Logistics launched its SEAalternative offer, which allows its customers to opt for sustainable maritime fuel, in line with the mass balance concept. This option was updated at the end of 2023 to follow the same book and claim principle used for aviation to facilitate the use of biofuel to decarbonize sea freight by up to 84%.\n- **Developing road partnerships to accelerate the deployment of lowcarbon fleets:** throughout 2022 and 2023, Bolloré Logistics entities increased their partnerships with their subcontractors to replace transport services using only diesel fuel. In parallel with these initiatives, each region is continuing to update the local mapping of carriers with a fleet of lowcarbon vehicles. These initiatives are constantly enhanced by the carrier listing tool Link Partner.\n- **Proposing new multimodal transport options:** Bolloré Logistics is developing the use of river and rail routes and the deployment of regular service lines, for example between China and Europe. In France, in order to accelerate the use of multimodal solutions, the company has set a target of reducing emissions generated by road transport by 25% by 2025. A digital solution was also developed at the end of 2023 to promote available river and rail services by displaying the carbon indicator.\n- **Advancing the integration of cutting-edge technologies:** with its various research projects, Bolloré Logistics is helping to develop innovative means of transport. For example, Bolloré Logistics organized the door-to-door transport of a satellite and its parts from its client's site in Toulouse to the Guiana Space Center in Kourou on a next-generation sailing cargo ship. Depending on speed, this wind-propelled mode reduces carbon emissions by 20% to 30% compared with an equivalent conventionally-propelled vessel.\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n#### Bolloré Energy\n\nThe latest technological advances make it possible to guarantee a liquid and storable fuel that is more environmentally friendly. Since 2018, Bolloré Energy has diversified its range of products to offer its customers cleaner alternatives by reducing the portion of fossil fuel products it distributes in order to align its strategy with the energy transition.\n\n# *Biofuel oil*\n\nAs a pioneer in the distribution of biofuel oil in France with the launch of Biofioul Évolution (F5) in 2019, Bolloré Energy has been offering its customers an F30 biofuel oil containing 30% biofuel, Calorza, since January 2022. Biofuel oil is a bioliquid for heating consisting of rapeseed oil, produced in France, and mineral fuel oil, as well as an additive that alone **reduces energy consumption by 7%.** Based on data from the carbon calculator published by Ademe (French environment agency), increasing the proportion of rapeseed oil in the product made it possible to meet the government's demands by remaining below the threshold of 250 grams of CO2 per kilowatt hour announced at the Citizen's Climate Convention. Composed of plant matter, this biofuel oil represents an alternative to domestic fuel oil and is compatible with all heating systems for individuals and professionals. Bolloré Energy is working to spread this innovative product throughout France.\n\n# *Biofuels*\n\nBolloré Energy is also a pioneer in the development and promotion of lowcarbon liquid alternative fuels, in particular through the following solutions:\n\n- Bolloré Energy has sold its Koolza100, a B100 biodiesel produced solely from rapeseed and processed in France, since 2021. As an ecological alternative to fossil diesel with equivalent autonomy, Koolza100offers professionals, such as carriers or the rail industry, an immediate environmental solution as it reduces CO<sup>2</sup> emissions by 60% and fine particle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional diesel.\n- Bolloré Energy also distributes Izipure, its 100% renewable synthetic biofuel throughout the country. Made from organic waste, this biodegradable, odorless biofuel reduces CO2 emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional diesel and is compatible with almost all new or older diesel engines. To promote the use of its low-carbon fuels, in September 2022 Bolloré Energy signed an exclusive seven-year contract with transport company LK Kunegel. 350 buses will now use Izipure, which will reduce the carrier's carbon footprint by up to 10,000 metric tons of CO<sup>2</sup> and 10 metric tons of particles (nitrogen oxide) each year.\n- To develop its low-carbon liquid fuel offering and strengthen its position as a committed player in the energy transition, Bolloré Energy entered into a partnership in 2023 with the world's leading biofuel producer, the Neste Group, to distribute HVO100 Neste MY Renewable Diesel on the French market starting in 2024.\n\nBolloré Energy uses certified biofuel suppliers. Its Koolza100 comes from a supplier with 2BSvs certification, a voluntary protocol aimed at the energy market and recognized by the European Commission. The 2BS certification system, which is applicable worldwide, demonstrates sustainability criteria from the production of biomass to the collection of inputs, all the way through to the processing and production of biofuels, bioliquids or combustibles. Izipure comes from a producer certified under ISCC (International Sustainability Carbon Certification). ISCC is a certification system that can be applied to all biomass to verify the responsible nature of supply chains for agricultural biomass or biogenic waste and residues. It addresses the issues of reduced greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable land use, protection of natural biospheres and improved social sustainability.\n\n#### *Distribution of alternative oil products*\n\nBolloré Energy is also committed to promoting the use of biofuels with carriers that the company calls on to distribute its petroleum products.\n\nIn 2023, 88% of fuel deliveries to Bolloré Energy's retail depots were made by vehicles running on biofuel (HVO100 or B100), whereas they accounted for around 30% of such deliveries in 2022. Bolloré Energy is aiming for 100% next year.\n\nBolloré Energy would also like to extend this approach for deliveries to its key accounts via its Trading network.\n\n# *The development of low-carbon products and services*\n\nSince 2020, a specific sales organization has been dedicated to the promotion of these new solutions including bio fuel oil, biodiesel (Koolza100), Izipure, B10 diesel and a range of products with additives such as AdBlue© . As a result, Bolloré Energy has identified the need to invest in the training of all of its sales teams and to raise awareness among its customers. In 2023, nearly 30 sales employees at trading agencies completed \"low carbon\" training. In addition, 100% of Bolloré Energy managers were educated on the environmental stakes associated with low-carbon products.\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2022, the Energy Transition Department was created to continue accelerating the deployment of solutions to reduce the environmental footprint of the company's customers and partners and to support them in their energy transition. The actions of Bolloré Energy's Energy Transition Department focus on three areas of action:\n\n**1. Decarbonization,** by offering low-carbon liquid fuels to Bolloré Energy customers.\n\n**2. Support for consumers and users in the energy transition and energy sobriety:** in particular, the teams of technicians repairing boilers in private individuals' homes are also committed to supporting their customers in the energy transition and are now making changes to equipment such as replacing burners.\n\n**3. Reducing consumption** by financing energy efficiency projects. Bolloré Energy funds the following programs:\n\n- energy savings certificates (EECs): Bolloré Energy encourages its customers and consumers to improve their energy performance. Nearly 100 million euros on average will be disbursed under this scheme to finance assistance programs and energy-saving projects in the agriculture, industry, residential, transport, tertiary and other sectors;\n- the support programs approved by the French Ministry of Ecological Transition to support the development of ecomobility and promote low-carbon solutions:\n- Advenir, which helps to install charging stations for electric vehicles,\n- energy savings loans (PEE), offered from 2020 to 2024, with the aim of encouraging microbusinesses and SMBs to initiate projects to improve their energy efficiency, and\n- Alveole Plus, a project whose goal is to speed up the creation of bicycle parking spaces through financing, advisory actions and training on bicycle transit.\n\n# **• Industry**\n\n#### Blue\n\nElectricity storage is a major technological hurdle to cross if we are to meet climate challenges. Electric batteries have driven innovation in mobility and the development of renewable energies.\n\nThrough its LMP® electric battery production activities by its subsidiary Blue Solutions, and the production of clean transportation solutions by its subsidiary Bluebus, Blue is supporting the energy transition, notably by investing 35 million euros in R&D projects in 2023.\n\nConcrete initiatives are being rolled out in each of its activities, by several means:\n\n**1. The development of Blue Solutions' LMP® battery, a unique and environ mentally-friendly technology:** Lithium Metal Polymer (LMP<sup>®</sup>) technology is the culmination of an ambitious R&D program that began almost thirty years ago to bring to the market high-energy batteries that could be used for many applications. The Bolloré Group has invested over 3 billion euros and hired more than 2,000 people to develop this \"solid-state\" technology. Building on its position as a global leader in films for capacitors, the Bolloré Group made electricity storage a major priority for development. Composed of thin films made using extrusion techniques in which the Bolloré Group has significant experience, LMP® batteries are characterized by their high energy density, their safety in use, and their non-sensitivity to external temperatures. These batteries meet the needs of many markets and solve two key challenges of the energy transition: the development of low-carbon transport solutions by incorporating them into electric vehicles (electromobility market), the development of low-carbon transport solutions and the development of stationary solutions for smart energy management.\n\nFurthermore, in line with Blue Solutions' commitment to sustainability, an environmentally friendly approach has been adopted at all stages of the product lifecycle, from raw material sourcing to battery recycling:\n\n# • **Ecodesign:**\n\n- circular economy practices: Blue Solutions takes a circularity-oriented approach to design to ensure that its products are developed with recycling and end-of-life in mind;\n- environmental assessments such as the life cycle assessment governed by ISO 14040 have been carried out since 2013 on LMP® batteries. The\n\nassessment of the new generation of LMP® batteries (IT3) has shown that its carbon footprint based on stored kWh has been reduced by about a third compared to the previous generation (Cradle To Gate scope: from the extraction of raw materials to the doors of the Blue Solutions production plant). This is possible because of the design, which focuses on increasing energy density and optimizing the casing and electronics.\n\n## • **Sustainable sourcing:**\n\n- to deepen its commitment, Blue Solutions has partnered with companies to source raw materials through cleaner and more sustainable methods;\n- for direct lithium extraction, Blue Solutions is working with partners, including Eramet and the government of Chile, on a lithium extraction process that allows for more contained management of water resources.\n\n# • **Advanced recycling processes:**\n\n- recycling of end-of-life batteries: Blue Solutions has developed a unique process to recycle batteries at the end of their life, extracting recycled elements for future use;\n- high-yield lithium recycling: The projected yield from the lithium metal recycling process is 90%. In 2024, Blue Solutions will deploy the second stage of its current pre-pilot line;\n- treatment and recovery of residues: Blue Solutions has established innovative partnerships to recycle black mass and recover precious materials;\n- purification: once recovered, the lithium undergoes a purification process so that it can be reused, thus reducing the need to extract new materials.\n\nBlue Solutions integrates these principles to help ensure that every battery produced contributes positively to a sustainable future, aligning with the vision of leading the way towards safe, sustainable and intelligent e-mobility. Moreover, LMP<sup>®</sup> batteries do not contain cobalt, cadmium, or nickel, and thus have the advantage of being more environmentally friendly than most other battery technologies. To address the individual electric vehicle market, since 2021, Blue Solutions has been focusing its R&D efforts on the development of a new fourth-generation solid-state battery technology. An ambitious R&D plan has been undertaken to take to market a battery adapted to the needs of car manufacturers in terms of performance and environmental quality in 2026. This fourth-generation technology will implement the best design and manufacturing practices, anticipating the recycling and end-oflife stages, and will meet increasingly ambitious European regulations. To further the development of the next generation of its Gen4 batteries, the innovation team is reinforced each year and now has more than 100 employees who advance the work at the company's various sites (Blue Solutions and the lead laboratories CNRS, Grenoble NP-UGA, Nantes Université).\n\n**2. Bluebus, France's leading manufacturer of 100% electric buses:** Blue Solutions is committed to playing a long-term role in the electromobility market by becoming a leader in the electric bus market. The solid-state LMP® battery is popular with urban transport managers for its safety, high range, long life and ease of integration, making it a powerful solution for buses and electric vehicles. In particular, it equips electric buses manufactured by Bluebus, whose ambition is to meet the technological challenges of tomorrow's mobility and support the challenges of the energy transition. A low-carbon, silent public transport solution for urban and suburban areas, Bluebus' sixmeter and twelve-meter vehicles meet environmental requirements. They combine high technology and performance thanks to their latest-generation LMP® batteries. Today, more than 500 Bluebus vehicles are operating in around sixty cities around the world.\n\nThe all-electric six-meter Bluebus is the latest in the range of urban and suburban buses marketed by Bluebus. Equipped with an integrated charger and LMP<sup>®</sup> (Lithium Metal Polymer) solid-state electric batteries with increased density, its range can reach 280 km<sup>(1)</sup>. In addition to being accessible to people with reduced mobility, it can accommodate up to 35 passengers thanks to a floor area that is unrivaled on the market. Because it emits no air pollutants, the six-meter Bluebus can operate in lowemission zones (ZFE), helping to reduce greenhouse gases and improve urban air quality.\n\n(1) Range measured according to the E-SORT 3 cycle (UTAC 09/22 tests) and varies based on conditions of use.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2023, the six-meter Bluebus was added to the catalog of France's national public procurement agency (UGAP), more than a year after its launch. This means that public-sector buyers do not have to go through the competitive tendering process. In addition, several agreements to distribute Bluebus models were signed in 2023, including agreements in Greece with the Syngelidis group, and in Spain and Italy with Indcar.\n\n# Films\n\nThe Films division is organized around two activities:\n\n- production of packaging shrink films, for which it is recognized as one of the world's leading manufacturers. These films are characterized by their extreme thinness, high performance and recyclability, and;\n- the production of ultra-thin plastic films, the main component of high value-added capacitors, which contribute in particular to the optimization of electricity networks and the development of renewable energies (photovoltaic) and parts for electric vehicles (UTF).\n\n**Ecodesign at the heart of packaging solutions:** in its ultra-thin packaging shrink film activity, Packaging Films offers two main ranges, namely Bolphane films for industrial applications and Bolfresh films for food applications, contributing to the protection and conservation of consumer goods and the fight against waste. Packaging Films places ecodesign at the heart of its products through the 3R approach:\n\n- **reduce:** through innovative processes so it can offer thinner but equally resilient and efficient products, enabling manufacturers and consumers to minimize their use of materials and their carbon footprint;\n- **recycle:** 100% of Bolphane's films are recyclable (in the polyethylene flexible packaging stream). Only the Bolfresh sealing film is not yet recylable. But an R&D project is underway, and major investments are planned for 2025 to be able to offer recyclable films on a new, innovative production line;\n- **reuse:** the products use recycled plastic and materials from renewable raw materials.\n\nAll the products developed by Packaging Films follow this approach and these three principles in order to meet the challenges of reduction at source. More specifically, the Bolfresh range aims to offer ever more efficient products and act for the circular economy by reducing the carbon footprint. Its teams aim to work on innovative solutions to achieve a 100% recyclable food packaging range.\n\nPackaging Films' ecodesigned products include:\n\n- Bolphane Bri (recycled inside), made up of 30% of postindustrial regenerated materials derived from manufacturing waste at the Bolloré Quimper plant;\n- Bolphane B-Nat<sup>®</sup> 0: the first biosourced generation consisting of more than 40% polyethylene from ethanol derived from sugar cane. In 2022, Packaging Films developed a second-generation biosourced product from used cooking oil;\n- The OXBTEC\\_RCB<sup>®</sup> (Recyclable Circular-Based) film in the Bolfresh range is the first barrier shrink film that is recyclable, contains circular polymers from advanced recycling of post-consumer plastic waste, and suitable for food contact. The plant is now ISCC+ certified to ensure the use of these alternative resins is compliant.\n\n# Systems\n\nThrough its solutions to optimize flows of people, goods and data, Blue Systems provides a response to the new challenges facing companies and cities, and supports the energy transition by offering innovative solutions to support the mobility of the future. Thus, to meet new challenges (the environment, and population and infrastructure flows), linked to the rapid development of new mobility solutions in cities, Blue Systems has developed an innovative software platform: Smart Mobility Platform. By offering services related to the smart, real-time management of mobility and infrastructure data, Smart Mobility is positioned as a trusted player and helps its partners achieve more connected sustainable mobility. For instance, when pollution levels peak the city can easily impose no-go areas for cars. It can also decide to give priority to soft and zero-emission mobility solutions over combustion engine vehicles.\n\nDeveloped with its subsidiary Polyconseil, this digital intervention system enables the cities to:\n\n- regulate mobility operators;\n- optimize the use of public space and infrastructure, and;\n- plan and synchronize mobility services in a changing situation.\n\nInitially focused on micro-mobility, the Smart Mobility Urban solution now incorporates the supervision of urban deliveries, taxis and private hire vehicles. At the same time, a Curb Management solution has been developed to enable cities to digitize their entire public space, understand usage and potentially optimize it.\n\n## *Smart Mobility: key figures for 2023*\n\n• Number of vehicles supervised: 50,000 (bikes, scooters, shared cars, autonomous vehicles).\n\n#### • Number of trips analyzed: 50 million.\n\n**Ecodesign of products:** from design to end-of-life, IER and Automatic Systems, subsidiaries of the Systems division, seek to design their products sustainably and reduce their environmental impact throughout their life cycle. For example, IER prioritizes the use of parts produced in Europe, thereby significantly reducing the carbon impact arising from their transport.\n\nIn addition, the Systems division designs its products to guarantee the longest possible service life, including maintenance (at least fifteen years), such as ticket vending machines and pedestrian and vehicle crossing equipment.\n\nAutomatic Systems requires R&D to design products that are more than 80% recyclable (according to the international standard IEC 62635). The choice of materials and manufacturing techniques (surface treatment, painting, welding, gluing, etc.) are decisive in guaranteeing this minimum rate and providing products whose environmental impact is optimized throughout their life cycle (until dismantling). In addition, the target energy consumption and noise level of the equipment, at rest or in operation, are set out in the specifications.\n\n**Innovative services to reduce customers CO<sup>2</sup> emissions throughout the supply chain:** through its Track & Trace subsidiary, IER helps its customers optimize their supply chain (warehouses, vehicles, transport, points of sale, public places and roads) with its traceability solutions. For example, in the mass distribution sector, IER has been working for more than fifteen years, in partnership with Auchan and Cogit, on the traceability of the fruit and vegetables sector in order to monitor products from the producer to the end customer, automate logistics operations and migrate from disposable to reusable packaging. Thanks to the RFID system, more than 7 million plastic cages are traced per year, making it possible to have less than 0.5% losses and optimize truck loading.\n\nIt has taken concrete progress measures for its customers, which facilitate the operator's work while respecting the environment:\n\n- the equipping of terminals with native energy saving solutions, i.e. programmed automatic switching on and shutdown or the systematic implementation of energy efficient power supplies;\n- the development of a \"French\" information system offering optimization solutions for delivery rounds to maximize the usage of the vehicle fleet, cover the shortest distance possible while ensuring that time commitments are met and reducing GHG emissions due to local operation, and;\n- the provision of mobile applications for drivers to optimize the transport plan, track packages and maximize the dematerialization of documents.\n\n**Polyconseil** is committed to working towards a digital world that is more energy-efficient, accessible, inclusive and conducive to generating a positive impact for society and citizens, and has enshrined a dedicated CSR strategy in the Polyconseil CSR Charter. The strategy is organized into four areas of focus:\n\n• **training and awareness-raising:** addition of training on sustainable digital solutions to the mandatory pathway followed by newcomers, organization of Climate Fresks;\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\n- **inclusion and diversity:** annual participation in Duo Days, partnership with Ada Tech School to recruit more women in digital professions;\n- **implementation of impact missions via the \"Polyclimate\" initiative:** BRGM's support in developing France's National Waste Register to improve traceability, development of a new \"GreenIT 360\" product to promote the development of ecodesigned digital solutions;\n- **responsible management of IT resources and facilities:** design of flexible infrastructure with dynamic scaling of resources, donation of used computers to Emmaüs Connect.\n\nWith a view to continuous improvement, Polyconseil regularly updates its carbon audit and, in 2023, initiated a partnership with Agence Lucie to help it obtain the label \"Numérique Responsable\" (Responsible Digital label), which will enable Polyconseil to identify new avenues of action.\n\n# **1.2.3.1.3. MANAGEMENT OF THE GROUP TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF ITS ACTIVITIES ON CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\nIn order to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the Bolloré Group has set itself the objective of implementing an energy consumption management approach based on:\n\n- sobriety: optimization of consumption, fight against energy waste, ecofriendly actions, etc.;\n- energy efficiency: investments in energy optimization (LED, presence detectors, renovation of heating/air conditioning systems, etc.), renewal of fleets of vehicles, electrification, etc.;\n- promotion of renewable energy: increase the share of electricity consumption from renewable sources via energy attribute certificates (EAC), such as origin guarantees and renewable energy certificates (RECs) or power purchase agreements.\n\nSignificant efforts are made every day by all divisions to reduce consumption, optimize operating costs and reduce the impact of their activities on climate change. While industrial sites are the biggest consumers and as such are the subject of special attention, the Bolloré Group is also careful to optimize the consumption of its tertiary sites. In addition, the Group and its divisions are also working on sustainable management of the real estate and infrastructure portfolio. 78% of entities covered by a management system including environmental considerations have at least one site certified by recognized environmental standards (HQE, LEED<sup>®</sup>, BREAM<sup>®</sup>, EDGE, ISO 14001, ISO 50001, Green Terminal or Biodiversity Commitment).\n\nFor several years now, the Vivendi group has also been committed to controlling its energy consumption and certifying the environmental performance of its buildings. In line with the 2025 intermediate and 2035 final targets for \"Energy\" and \"Use of renewable energy\" commitments, the Group plans to continue its actions to maintain and confirm this trajectory. In 2023, nearly 60% of electricity consumed by the Group came from renewable sources (versus 37% in 2022). See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 4.1.2.3. – Site energy performance, use of renewable energies and group-wide energy efficiency plan.\n\n# Operational objectives and progress\n\n| Area of action                | Group objectives                                                                                                                                                                                              | Horizon                       | Progress at 12/31/2023                                                                                                                                          |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reduction<br>of GHG emissions | Implement an energy consumption management approach<br>based on:<br>• energy sobriety (consumption, ecofriendly actions, etc.)<br>• energy efficiency (investments in the energy performance<br>of equipment) | 2022 carried over<br>to 2023* | • Continued rollout of various programs<br>dedicated to optimizing consumption: this<br>target will be updated in 2024 in light of<br>the change in Group scope |\n| Renewable<br>energies         | • Increase the share of electricity consumption from<br>renewable energy sources (proof of origin)                                                                                                            | 2022 carried over<br>to 2023* | • Reduction in GHG emissions through the<br>consumption of energy from renewable<br>sources: 13%(1)                                                             |\n\n\\* The 2022 targets were renewed in 2023 due to two significant disposal projects and anticipated work related to the CSRD in 2024.\n\n(1) Indicator calculation excludes Bolloré Logistics and Vivendi.\n\n# Actions adopted in each of the activities to reduce the impact of our activities on climate change\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics** Bolloré Logistics\n\n# *Scopes 1 and 2 commitments and objectives*\n\nentire network (baseline: 2022).\n\nIn order to strengthen its climate plan set up in 2018, Bolloré Logistics officially committed to the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 2022 via a commitment letter and submitted its new reduction targets in October 2023, taking into account the sale of its activities in Africa at the end of 2022. Based on the latest SBTi sector-specific recommendations and methodologies, the target was calculated using the absolute contraction approach and is aligned with the 1.5 °C trajectory. It sets a target to reduce scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 42% in absolute terms by 2030 for its\n\n# *Management of the climate strategy for direct activities*\n\nInitiated in 2018, the overall management of the Bolloré Logistics climate action plan is reflected in monitoring by the regional CSR managers and local country managers. At the central level, a single management tool is deployed to simulate the various reduction actions planned, completed or in progress, according to the scenarios, with an estimate of the quantity of carbon avoided, and the financial investment. Through this shared tool, each regional or local CSR manager records the actions within his or her scope that contribute to reducing carbon emissions (scopes 1 and 2), the scheduling of these actions and the corresponding environmental and financial indicators. Meetings between the Corporate CSR Department and regional CSR managers on the progress of action plans, planning and results with regard to the target trajectory are held quarterly.\n\nAround 100 actions involving an investment were recorded in the management tool, with various means:\n\n# **Investing in low-carbon company-owned road vehicles**\n\nRoad freight transport operated by company-owned vehicles impacting scope 1, accounts for less than 0.5% of total transport covered in terms of CO2 emissions. However, Bolloré Logistics continued to invest in more carbon efficient vehicles. In addition, ecodriving training for drivers of companyowned vehicles, company cars and service cars has been rolled out in several parts of the world.\n\n#### **Extending the use of renewable energies**\n\nIn terms of renewable energies, several investments have been made since 2020, initiated by the Green Hub warehouse in Singapore, which boasted nearly 2,400 solar panels on its roof in 2023.\n\nIn addition to producing renewable energy on site and in parallel with the sobriety and efficiency actions, some sites have opted for renewable energy supply through the purchase of energy attribute certificates (EAC) such as REC, iREC, and GO. In 2023, renewable energy accounted for 14% of electricity consumption\n\nIn addition, in order to ensure best practices within the company's network for the use of energy attribute certificates (EACs), an internal guide establishing guidelines was developed in association with a consulting firm, particularly in terms of processes, rules and the selection of energy attribute certificates (EACs); it has been deployed to the internal CSR community.\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Increasing awareness, training and engagement among teams**\n\nThroughout the period, information, awareness-raising and training activities were carried out across the network. Through the annual AcTogether challenge, an inter-country competition organized via a digital platform using collective gamification techniques, employees are invited to carry out local CSR actions, helping to reduce Bolloré Logistics' environmental impact. Energy efficiency of buildings and equipment and reducing GHG emissions feature prominently in this challenge. Through the fourth edition of AcTogether in 2023, some 175 actions worldwide were recorded over the period concerning employee awareness of the environment (excluding QHSE actions) (see section 1.2.4.2.3. – Building and maintaining dialog with stakeholders).\n\n#### **Tackling the most energy-intensive warehouses**\n\nIn addition to the general climate roadmap sent to its entities, in 2023 Bolloré Logistics defined an action plan specifically dedicated to the most energy-intensive warehouses. In 2022, a total of 20 warehouses were identified across all operating regions, with annual unit electricity consumption in excess of 675,000 kWh. They account for more than 50% of the company's total electricity consumption.\n\nThe components of this action plan are as follows:\n\n- annual reduction in electricity consumption of 5% per year;\n- achieve 100% electricity from renewable sources by 2030;\n- roll out internal certifications;\n- deploy technical building management;\n- increase investments in low-carbon equipment based on energy audit reports;\n- study the feasibility of AI solutions to optimize energy consumption (including HVAC), and;\n- raise awareness among internal and external stakeholders of these issues and solutions.\n\n## *Environmental certification*\n\nIn addition to the ISO 14001 certification already rolled out to nearly 84% of sites, new building construction must follow the principles of the Bolloré Logistics Responsible Building Charter signed in 2019 by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Head of Real Estate and Infrastructure division.\n\nThis document asks local departments to align their investment and operating cost targets with a reduction of their environmental footprint, working on four main interlinked areas:\n\n- reducing the building's carbon footprint during construction and use;\n- incorporating biodiversity and its ecosystem services from the design phase;\n- ensuring quality of work life to enhance well-being, creativity and performance, and;\n- constructing stronger buildings that are more resilient to climate risk.\n\nTo demonstrate its compliance, Bolloré Logistics made a formal commitment to systematically obtaining environmental certification at the construction phase, regardless of the size and location of new buildings. For example, with regard to the construction of major logistics hubs, the construction will always be subject to LEED<sup>®</sup> and BiodiverCity<sup>®</sup> dual certification.\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n#### Bolloré Energy\n\nBolloré Energy works daily on the environmental performance of its sites, from a standpoint of both pollution control (ISO 14001 certification, end-of-life rehabilitation of oil depots, etc.) and site energy performance (e.g., energy optimization of its vehicle fleet, 5% to 8% of which is generally renewed each year). To improve its environmental performance and as part of its ISO 14001 certification, Bolloré Energy has updated its policy for monitoring electricity consumption for its primary warehouses. New indicators have been implemented to ensure more regular and precise monitoring of consumption. Other initiatives have been rolled out, such as ecodriving training for all new employees involved in transport. Refresher sessions are organized each year to ensure the continued use of ecodriving techniques.\n\nA lighting replacement program was launched in the depots to introduce more energy-efficient solutions. LEDs were installed in four depots in 2023. Following the update of the GHG assessment in 2022, Bolloré Energy continued to renew its oil transport fleet: 25 trucks were ordered (Euro 6 standard), representing an investment of approximately 4 million euros. In 2023, 98% of Bolloré Energy's truck fleet met Euro 5 or Euro 6 standards. Bolloré Energy's goal is for 100% of its new fleet to run on HVO.\n\n# **• Industry**\n\n#### Blue\n\nIn a particularly tense electricity market, it was not possible for the plants in Brittany to cover their electricity consumption with renewable origin guarantees in 2023. Blue Solutions Canada consumes almost 100% renewable power from the Hydro-Québec network.\n\n# Films\n\nPackaging Films follows an \"avoid, reduce, compensate\" approach and has embarked on a forest carbon sink project with Alliance Forêts Bois. This project aims to capture, over two years (2023 and 2024), the incompressible carbon emissions arising from the operation of the Quimper production plant for the production of films in the Bolphane R3 range over two years through a local reforestation project in the Finistère department, which has been awarded Bas Carbone (low-carbon) certification by the ministry of Ecological Transition. In 2022, 9,750 trees were planted. This project also enabled the creation of 17 FTE jobs in the forestry sector.\n\n#### Systems\n\nSince 2021, Automatic Systems Belgium has invested heavily in optimizing the energy performance of buildings at the Mercator site in Belgium (LED lighting controlled by presence detectors, acoustic carpets, better distribution of air conditioners, use of local suppliers). Energy consumption is monitored monthly to detect any excesses.\n\nAutomatic Systems is also working to optimize its processes, particularly in its assembly areas. Thus, the subsidiary has moved from classic processes to lean management or one piece flow processes to increase delivery rates while reducing the footprint of each zone.\n\n# Drafting and adoption of sobriety plans\n\nFaced with energy supply tensions, the government called on French companies, and as a priority those in the CAC 40 stock market index, to reduce their energy consumption by 10% by 2024 compared to 2019 via the voluntary adoption of an energy sobriety plan. All of the Bolloré Group's French entities thus formalized energy sobriety plans to ensure the continuity of their activities and services while controlling their consumption. In 2023, these entities increased their efforts to develop solutions to improve the control of their energy consumption and thereby reduce their CO2 emissions.\n\nSupervised by a task force led by the Purchasing and CSR Departments, to consolidate the best practices of all business units and bring together the various energy plans and commitments to ensure business continuity, all the sobriety plans have applied the following measures:\n\n- reduction of heating and air conditioning;\n- restriction of lighting (sign and office lighting automatically shut off at certain times);\n- development and strengthening of consumption management and monitoring instruments (e.g. installation of sub-meters);\n- rollout of ecofriendly initiatives;\n- identification of energy-intensive equipment to control and limit consumption (fitting of clocks on certain equipment), elimination of individual electric radiators;\n- investments: reinforcement of LED rollout, acceleration of the installation of presence detectors, or implementation of technical building management systems;\n- performance of energy audits, and;\n- organization of working time.\n\n# Highlights\n\nFor the head office sites, an \"energy sobriety\" round table was set up in 2023 to monitor low-energy consumption measures, particularly related to lighting.\n\n• **Bolloré Logistics** extended the French sobriety plan to its global entities and, through the AcTogether platform, has initiated an internal challenge to be implemented by the teams on a daily basis to reduce the carbon footprint generated by the energy consumption of warehouses and offices. This initiative is part of the \"energy sobriety\" pillar of the Bolloré Logistics climate plan already initiated (see section 1.2.3.1.2. – Group climate strategy: making the management of our carbon footprint central to our business lines). The entities were asked to implement various measures in order to obtain the internal Energy Saving Office label, which covers the temperature in the premises (heating, air conditioning), lighting, insulation and the right reflexes to adopt with regard to the use of electrical appliances, including computer equipment. A webinar was organized by the head office CSR Department in the second quarter of 2023, a communication kit was sent to local sites and special information was sent to regional CSR managers and ambassadors. In addition, in accordance with local regulations or on a voluntary basis, energy audits \n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\nwere carried out in several countries in 2023, including in the United Kingdom, Canada, La Réunion and France. As France accounted for 29% of Bolloré Logistics' total electricity consumption in 2023, the operational implementation of the tertiary decree reinforces the climate action plan undertaken and extends it to all sites. Furthermore, improving the energy performance of our buildings is one of the key drivers of Bolloré Logistics' climate strategy. As in previous years, energy efficiency initiatives were once again rolled out across the network's buildings in 2023. The measures implemented include:\n\n- reducing air conditioning through the deployment of sun protection equipment or wall insulation, and replacing existing systems with more energy-efficient models;\n- optimizing air treatment to minimize energy consumption, solving the problem of humidity and developing smart solutions such as connected platforms to improve air quality;\n- improvement of electrical consumption measurement systems (BMS devices currently being deployed).\n- **IER and Automatic Systems** have committed to achieving significant energy savings through the implementation of energy audits and energy plans. Initiated in 2016, then renewed and monitored annually, these plans mainly focus on the energy performance of buildings and transport activities (e.g. fleet of vehicles). Among the concrete measures (installation of presence detectors and implementation of company-wide RTT days [time off in lieu of the thirty-five hour working week] to close facilities), energy tension on the national network is monitored through the government's Ecowatt platform and an action plan has been formalized to be\n\nable to act immediately in the event of a risk of power cuts. Efforts to regulate heating and the installation of LED lighting is also continuing.\n\n- In addition, under the 2022 sobriety plan, Systems subsidiaries implemented actions that were continued in 2023, including:\n- turning on heating units as late as possible;\n- reducing the temperature in facilities and workshops to 19 °C;\n- increasing setpoints in air-conditioned rooms (server rooms) from 22 °C to 24 °C;\n- deploying presence sensors everyone (particularly in restrooms);\n- installing LEDs in 2023 and continuing the project in 2024 at all sites;\n- performing energy audits;\n- improving the monitoring of energy consumption, in particular by installing clocks on energy-intensive equipment (compressors, extraction box, water heater);\n- limiting the use of energy-intensive equipment: IT, elevators, lighting, kitchens, hot water tanks, buses, etc.;\n- eliminating energy-intensive systems: replacing Besançon boilers, removing most individual electric heaters, removing sign lighting, etc.;\n- raising awareness of ecofriendly actions, noise, light, energy, waste (\"BLED\") and following up on BLED audits and checking that ecofriendly actions are properly displayed at all establishments.\n- **Blue and Films** have rolled out a study on the energy efficiency of French plants with Dalkia, and on Canadian plants with the service provider C-nergie. For its part, Bluebus has taken actions to control the heating temperatures in its workshop. In addition, the Films division installed LED equipment on its industrial premises.\n\n# **1.2.3.1.4.

The transport and storage of hazardous products and the occurrence of industrial accidents or fires represent major environmental risks and are a top priority for prevention. These risks have not been identified as one of the priority risks of the Communications sector, given the nature of its activities. For more information on the management of CSR priority risks in the Communications sector, see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document in chapter 2 – section 2.2. – Main non-financial risks and opportunities.\n\n# **1.2.3.2.2. PREVENTING LOCAL POLLUTION RISKS AND INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS**\n\n# Group policy\n\nControlling the environmental footprint of the Group's sites requires the deployment of Environmental Management Systems (EMSs) or specific measures and controls in accordance with recognized standards such as ISO 14001 for environmental management or standards that comply with strict regulations such as Seveso or ICPE for industrial sites. The sites are subject to industrial and environmental risk analyses, which constitute a decision-making tool for identifying the preventive or corrective actions to be put in place (e.g. prevention measures in the event of the transport or storage of hazardous materials, inventory of hazardous waste sources, measurement and analysis of emissions into air, water and soil). This continued improvement approach is at the heart of the environmental due diligence cycle implemented in the Group's entities in order to prevent the risks of local pollution and industrial accidents.\n\nThe activities are also subject to regular internal and external audits carried out pursuant to regulations and as part of certification processes. The defined processes make it possible to report, analyze, record and correct incidents, accidents and compliance failures that can lead to pollution.\n\nEven though the policies implemented and performance indicators are becoming increasingly standardized at the Group level, they inevitably retain the features specific to the challenges of each business line and activity. Each division implements emergency response plans based on the results of its risk maps. To ensure environmental performance monitoring, the divisions' Executive management teams set objectives and targets that are measurable and consistent with the QHSE policy for the relevant functions and levels in the organization. The achievement of targets is monitored at Executive Committee meetings and the annual QHSE Department Review.\n\n# Objectives and progress\n\nIn order to standardize the policies and indicators for monitoring the Group's various activities, a set of indicators relating to environmental risks used by all divisions (excluding Vivendi) has been deployed since 2019 (see \"The Bolloré Group's environmental management monitoring indicators\" and \"The Bolloré Group's environmental incident monitoring indicators\"). This work was further reinforced by the setting of reasonable targets, validated in early 2021 by Executive management (members of the Ethics – CSR and Anticorruption Committee), and consistent with the continued improvement process that is the focus of existing policies.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Area of action                                                                                          | Group objectives                                                                                                                                                                                        | Horizon                       | Progress at 12/31/2023                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Commitment of senior<br>management to monitor<br>the Group's performance to<br>preserve the environment | • 100% of divisions must have<br>an environmental policy signed<br>by Management                                                                                                                        | 2022-2025                     | • 87% of legal entities included in CSR<br>reporting(1) declare that they have an<br>environmental policy                                                                                                               |\n| Implementation<br>of environmental<br>management systems                                                | • 100% of the workforce of legal entities<br>included in the CSR reporting scope(1)<br>covered by a management system that<br>takes into account the environment                                        | 2022 carried<br>over to 2023* | • 94% of the workforce is covered by an<br>environmental management system(1)                                                                                                                                           |\n| Certification<br>of management systems                                                                  | • 70% of legal entities(1) covered by<br>an environmental management system<br>have at least one site certified under an<br>environmental standard (e.g. ISO 14001,<br>ISO 50001, Green Terminal, etc.) | 2022 carried<br>over to 2023* | • 93% of legal entities(1) covered by an<br>environmental management system have<br>at least one site certified under an<br>environmental standard (e.g. ISO 14001,<br>ISO 50001, etc.)                                 |\n| Prevention of local pollution<br>and management of hazardous<br>materials                               | • 100% of legal entities required to store or<br>transport hazardous materials equipped<br>with a pollution prevention mechanism                                                                        | 2022 carried<br>over to 2023* | • 39% of entities declare that they are<br>required to handle and/or store hazardous<br>materials<br>• 81% of which declare that they are<br>equipped with a pollution prevention<br>system                             |\n|                                                                                                         | • Mapping and/or assessment<br>of environmental risks to be carried<br>out on at least 100% of entities<br>reporting industrial sites                                                                   | 2022 carried<br>over to 2023* | • 83% of entities that specify that they have<br>industrial sites, report that they have<br>carried out an environmental risk mapping<br>or environmental analysis (assessment of<br>significant environmental aspects) |\n\n(1) See section 1.3.2.1. – CSR reporting methodology note.\n\n\\* The 2022 targets were renewed in 2023 due to two significant disposal projects and anticipated work related to the CSRD in 2024.\n\n# Prevention measures adapted for each activity\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\nThe Transportation and logistics activities are especially exposed to risks from local pollution and hazardous goods transport and storage.\n\nEmergency response plans are prepared in accordance with Executive management directives. Each entity implements performance monitoring processes and corrective monitoring processes and objectives similar to the division's. Each subsidiary ensures that employees, including subcontractors working on-site, are properly informed of the emergency response procedure.\n\n#### Bolloré Logistics\n\nAt Bolloré Logistics, environmental management is governed by the QHSE policy, in accordance with ISO 14001. The award in 2020 of the multi-site triple SMI certification (including ISO 14001, ISO 9001 and ISO 45001) certification for all entities in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific further strengthened its commitment. In 2023, the triple certification covered 300 sites in 54 countries.\n\nDue to the challenges associated with local pollution risks, Bolloré Logistics pays special attention to the prevention of industrial accidents and scrupulously supervises its storage and transport activities for hydrocarbons, cyanide and other hazardous materials throughout its entire supply chain in Africa. The management of hazardous goods is strictly governed by the division's QHSE policies and manual, which integrates risk assessment, risk prevention and control strategies, regulatory authorizations, reception procedures, segregation, control and handling of goods, as well as instruction and training of employees. Bolloré Logistics has spill prevention and control measures in place during all chemical handling operations (loading/unloading, storage, transfer, etc.) to minimize the effects of chemical spills on health and the environment, both on and off-site.\n\nDepending on the activity, area of operation or specific features of the site, specific measures are introduced. For example, chemical storage areas have means of containment of spills in order to control accidental spills and kits containing absorbent products (pellets, pads, socks) are made available. Contaminated materials are safely and adequately treated through a specialized hazardous waste treatment service provider. Retention trays are available to hold containers with leaks.\n\nWarehouses and yards operated by Bolloré Logistics have internal prevention, protection and intervention resources that include:\n\n- fire protection resources (fire extinguishers, fire hoses, smoke evacuation, etc.) based on the level of risk presented by the activities;\n- procedures to ensure the overall condition and maintenance of the facilities;\n- regular internal inspections to verify the good condition and accessibility of fire-fighting resources and emergency systems, compliance with safety rules, etc.;\n- specific procedures such as issuance of work permits before performing certain risky operations (e.g. hot-spot work), and;\n- procedures to secure facilities against the risk of malicious acts.\n\nIn addition, Bolloré Logistics has formalized its basic QHSE requirements for warehouse design and yards: a manual lists the QHSE and safety standards that must be followed when new warehouses are built, facilities are expanded or modified, or warehouses are rented. Training on the handling and transportation of dangerous goods is also provided to staff (IMDG, IATA, ADR, CFR49, etc.).\n\nIntervention exercises are conducted by the entities to test the effectiveness of the procedures and the emergency equipment available and proper knowledge of the rules to be followed by employees. Crisis management exercises with simulation of spills are also carried out. Members of the local crisis management cell work in concert with the highest civil, administrative, police and specialist military authorities.\n\nSubcontractors responsible for transporting dangerous goods are selected according to the list of qualified suppliers registered in the Link Partner platform, the selection of which is based on several criteria according to the vendor management procedure (compliance with regulations, quality of service, staff qualifications, equipment made available in good condition, appropriate, properly maintained, etc.). Depending on the sensitivity of the dangerous goods that may be transported, a pre-qualification audit may be carried out to verify the information provided by the subcontractor.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n# Bolloré Energy\n\nSubject to very strict mandatory regulations relating to its activity (Seveso sites, ICPE, etc.), Bolloré Energy implements an environmental management system on a daily basis to manage environmental risks, such as the risk of spilling hydrocarbons during loading or unloading, as well as the risk of fire on premises and the storage of hazardous products. These issues are governed by Bolloré Energy's general environmental, health and safety policy, which is based in particular on ISO 14001 certification.\n\nSince 2017, Bolloré Energy has been working on voluntary certification under ISO 14001:2015 for all its Seveso oil depots, going beyond the minimum regulatory requirements. Thus, 100% of its massive depots are covered by an environmental management system and a specific environmental policy. As part of the certification, five ISO 14001 audits were carried out in 2023.\n\nThese strategic procedures have enabled Bolloré Energy to reduce its environmental impact and provide accountability for environmental issues and to guarantee confidence for its stakeholders.\n\nIn addition, Bolloré Energy has put preventive technical controls in place at all of its facilities to allow more in-depth monitoring of depots and correct any anomalies. Crisis management exercises are carried out every year, complementing the exercises linked to the Seveso internal operation plan, enabling employees to gain practical experience in best practices. These exercises mobilize operational staff on site as well as external personnel (fire fighters, etc.). \"Crisis cell\" exercises are also organized, notably involving head office personnel.\n\nEight internal operation plan exercises were carried out in 2023.\n\n# **• Industry**\n\n## Blue and Films\n\nThree main risks have been identified for Blue activities and are subject to specific mitigation measures:\n\n- fire risks: extinguishing and detection systems, training and fire exercises including accidental spill scenarios. There were 21 exercises in 2023;\n- water pollution risks: storm basins to contain polluted water in the event of a fire or accidental spill. Any liquids stored are placed in retention tanks;\n- air pollution risks, managed in particular by systems that treat emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by thermal oxidation at battery manufacturing sites (France and Canada).\n\nIn addition, the factories producing LMP<sup>®</sup> batteries in France and Canada, electric buses (Bluebus) and plastic films (Bolloré Packaging Films) are covered by an environmental management system and are ISO 14001 certified. In 2023, 15 internal environmental audits were carried out on the Blue and Films scope.\n\nIt should also be noted that “solid-state” LMP<sup>®</sup> battery manufacturing technology has the advantage of eliminating the environmental risks associated with the release of hazardous liquids. LMP® batteries are exempt from SVHC (Substance of Very High Concern) rules under the European REACH regulation and CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction) rules under the CLP regulation.\n\nPeriodic inspections of facilities are carried out in accordance with the regulations in force. Service providers and carriers on our sites are subject to prevention plans and security protocols.\n\nIn addition, a safety advisor manages the transport of hazardous goods for all activities. His or her role includes advising management and ensuring compliance with the requirements for the transport of hazardous goods, including the shipment of products and waste covered by those regulations.\n\nIn 2023, 28 people were trained in the transport of hazardous materials in relation to Blue and Films activities. Awareness sessions on environmental issues are regularly held at the Group's sites (publication of dashboards, news flashes, etc.).\n\n#### Systems\n\nAll IER and Automatic Systems entities deploy an environmental management system. The main Automatic Systems production sites in Belgium have ISO 14001:2015 certification. In 2023, this certification process was extended to the French and Canadian sites, then it will be further expanded to IER in 2024 and Automatic Systems France in 2025.\n\nA new risk mapping was carried out as part of this process, identifying:\n\n- production of hazardous waste: soiled rags, WEEE (Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment), soiled empty packaging, empty aerosols, batteries, etc., and;\n- use and storage of cleaning products that may present environmental risks.\n\nCurrently, all French IER and Automatic Systems sites are equipped with chemical storage and treatment solutions (cleaners, detergents, aerosol, deicing agents, etc.). In addition to the health and safety measures implemented for employees, IER and Automatic Systems issue specific instructions for the management of chemicals and rules tailored to business lines for the management of occupational risks.\n\nInternal information campaigns are carried out to make employees aware of the environmental approach, including environmentally-friendly actions, the dissemination of the IER environmental Charter, the 5S project, citizens' days and the WEEE (Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment) campaign.\n\nInternal security audits are also carried out regularly. An internal audit is also carried out each year at Automatic Systems Belgium and IER France, as part of the deployment of the BLED solution (noise, light, energy, waste) where each process manager is responsible for assessing certain environmental issues.\n\n# The Bolloré Group's environmental management monitoring indicators\n\n# *Environmental management systems indicators(1) at the Bolloré Group(2)*\n\n|                                                                                                                                                               | 2023              |                |          |        |            |             |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------|--------|------------|-------------|\n| (as a percentage)                                                                                                                                             | Bolloré Logistics | Bolloré Energy | Industry | Others | 2023 Total | 2022 Total* |\n| Percentage of the workforce covered by<br>an environmental management system                                                                                  | 96                | 92             | 80       | 85     | 94         | 99          |\n| Proportion of entities with an<br>environmental management system                                                                                             | 87                | 25             | 70       | 33     | 78         | 98          |\n| Including the percentage of entities with<br>at least one site certified by an<br>environmental standard (e.g. ISO 14001,<br>ISO 50001, Green Terminal, etc.) | 96                | 100            | 71       | –      | 90         | 87          |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from CSR reporting (see section 1.3.2.1. – CSR reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators relate to the Bolloré Group scope excluding Vivendi, as the risk of local pollution related to the transport and/or storage of hazardous materials has not been identified among the priority risks with regard to the activities of the Communications sector.\n\n- Data for the 2022 scone excluding Bolloré Africa Logistics following the sale of this business line\n\n\\* Data for the 2022 scope excluding Bolloré Africa Logistics following the sale of this business line.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\n# *Environmental incident indicators(1) at the Bolloré Group(2)*\n\n| Transportation and logistics (excluding Bolloré Energy)(3) | Bolloré<br>Logistics | Bolloré<br>Energy(4) | Industry(5) | Others | 2023 Total | 2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|--------|------------|------|\n| Number of environmental incidents                          | 7                    | 0                    | 0           | –      | 7          | 52   |\n\n(1) These indicators cover the scope of CSR reporting (see section 1.3.2.1. – CSR reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators relate to the Bolloré Group scope excluding Vivendi, as the risk of local pollution related to the transport and/or storage of hazardous materials has not been identified among the priority risks with regard to the activities of the Communications sector.\n\n(3) Gradual event (Ports and Rail scope), incidental and/or accidental event (product spillage, emissions of product vapor or gas, off-site disposal of products with no treatment prior to being discharged into the natural environment, etc.) that could damage the ecosystems or natural resources.\n\n(4) Number of accidents reported to the hazardous goods transport safety advisor that require declaration to the supervisory body.\n\n(5) Number of environmental accidents that caused pollution.\n\n# **1.2.3.2.3. OPTIMIZING WASTE MANAGEMENT AND BOOSTING THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY**\n\n# Group policy\n\nThe Group pays particular attention to the monitoring of its waste at the various sites in France and abroad, whose management is part of the measures taken to reduce its risks of local pollution (notably the storage of hazardous materials). The monitoring centers on \"hazardous\" waste (waste that, by virtue of its radioactivity, flammability, toxicity or other hazardous properties cannot be disposed of in the same way as other waste without endangering people or the environment) and \"non-hazardous\" waste (which in no way endangers people and the environment). The results of the reporting are used to monitor the production of hazardous and nonhazardous waste from the industrial sites of entities included in CSR reporting (see section 1.3.2.1. – CSR reporting methodology note) and identify the recovered or recycled portion. They have been included in the calculation of the Bolloré Group's scope 3 emissions since 2020.\n\nHazardous waste comes from Transportation and logistics activities, including Bolloré Energy (oil depots where residual hydrocarbons are either treated by thermal recovery or buried), and the Industry division (battery production plants, and WEEE at IER). The entities engaging in Transportation and logistics activities make every effort to have all of their waste retreated by contractors approved by the Ministry of the Environment of the countries in which they operate to obtain the best level of treatment available in the region in question.\n\nSince 2017, the Bolloré Group has strengthened its waste reporting process by refining its analysis mesh by waste sub-categories (more than 30 categories of waste identified such as paper, wood, metals, used oils, etc.) thereby ensuring a more detailed traceability of reported waste and improving the indicator's coverage rate.\n\nFor Vivendi, the topics of waste and the circular economy are addressed under its environmental risk duty of care work (see section 2.3. of Vivendi's non-financial performance statement). In 2023, Vivendi maintained its efforts to promote the circular economy and to protect forest resources with regard to paper-consuming activities (see section 4.1.2.5. of Vivendi's nonfinancial performance statement), and continued its initiatives to limit emissions by acting on all scope 3 categories, with the first benefits visible in waste management and certain leased and sold products. In 2023, Vivendi became the main media partner of Plastic Odyssey. With 20 metric tons of plastic pouring into the oceans every minute, the Plastic Odyssey is spending three years sailing the coasts most affected by plastic pollution to spark local waste processing initiatives, develop the recycling economy to create jobs, and raise local awareness among citizens.\n\nSee Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – sections 3.2.2.2 – Duty of care risks, 4.1.2.1. – The group's carbon footprint, 4.2.2.1. – Support the development of high-impact content.\n\n# Objectives and progress\n\n| Area of action                                  | Group objectives                                          | Horizon | Progress at 12/31/2023                                     |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Waste management<br>and the circular<br>economy | • Implement 4R strategies: reduce, repair, recycle, reuse | 2023    | • 81% of hazardous waste recovered or recycled in 2023     |\n|                                                 | • Increase the share of recycled or recovered waste       | 2023    | • 73% of non-hazardous waste recovered or recycled in 2023 |\n\n# Specific features of waste management and the circular economy in the Group\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\nThe entities of the Transportation and logistics division make every effort to have all of their waste retreated by contractors approved by the Ministry of the Environment of the countries in which they operate to obtain the best level of treatment available in the territory in question.\n\n#### Bolloré Logistics\n\nAt Bolloré Logistics, waste is processed in accordance with local regulations and waste management procedures defined by the company, following the directives set by the QHSE Corporate Department. Each entity implements and maintains a waste management plan. The waste is entrusted to specialized companies in charge of transporting and treating it (recovery, disposal, etc.). Before collection, waste is placed in suitable packaging and kept in storage areas provided for that purpose.\n\nIn parallel with the improvement in waste monitoring, sorting, and recovery processes in the entities, Bolloré Logistics' waste management approach has several drivers. Actions across the entire network have increased over the past two years:\n\n• **reducing waste:** in 2023, there was an increase in the re-use of consumables, such as wood and cardboard, in the warehouses, resulting in less waste. At some entities, paper is recovered to be shredded and reused as a replacement for plastic to pad shipped products. Upcycling awareness-raising workshops are also held for employees. Other initiatives are being implemented, such as a recycling solution for empty toiletry and cosmetic containers. This program has saved 810 metric tons of CO2e since it was launched. In May 2023, Bolloré Logistics received an award for the project in the \"Logistics – Sustainable Development\" category at the Singapore Business Review (SBR) Award 2023;\n\n• **promoting circularity:** as part of its ecoresponsible supply chain solutions, Bolloré Logistics continued to develop its REcycle offering to promote the reuse of packaging and consumables employed in transport and logistics. To drive the REcycle program, the teams have developed a dedicated digital application to enable the management of these consumables (booking of packaging according to needs, visibility of the stock of reusable packaging around the world, support in the management of customs operations, etc.). All these consumables have a unique barcode, allowing them to be tracked via the REcycle application. After registering more than 1,600 circular services in 2022, the REcycle digital platform continued to advance in 2023, with a 40% increase in the reuse rate compared to the previous year. In another win for circularity, the teams at the Bolloré Logistics head office joined the circular POS marketing program set up by Fabrique Circul'R in order to develop circular economy solutions to improve the management of POS marketing campaigns in several industries that use this type of product, such as large retailers and the agri-food sector;\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n• **optimizing packaging solutions:** the optimization of references is also an area for improvement. At the Cricquebœuf site in France, a significant investment was made in 2023 to install an automatic packaging machine that adapts the size of cardboard packaging to the product. In Singapore, where the contractual logistics business is very significant, many solutions related to packaging and the supply of ecofriendly consumables have been implemented. More than 400 consumables are monitored in a dedicated tool and sustainability is one of 6 criteria subject to an annual analysis of the performance of the main suppliers; nearly 79% of the total weight of consumables purchased comes from recycled or reused sources.\n\nAs part of the annual AcTogether challenge, more than 200 actions related to waste management, promoting the implementation of the 4R policy (reduce, reuse, repair, recycle) or focused on ecofriendly packaging, were finalized in 2023. Teams also worked on processes, including in the offices (ramping up the move to paperless offices, improving recycling, donating to allow for reuse, awareness of ecofriendly actions). A webinar for all employees on how to start reducing waste was organized in October 2022 (nearly 300 participants).\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n# Bolloré Energy\n\nBolloré Energy has set up service contracts with hazardous waste recycling and recovery companies. In 2023, Bolloré Energy worked with three service providers to recover its spent hydrocarbons and oils in particular.\n\n# **• Industry**\n\nBlue and Films\n\nWaste from the industrial sites is managed as follows:\n\n- reduction at source;\n- the waste generated is sorted and primarily sent to recycling channels;\n- the various blended waste from the plants in Brittany are directed to energy recovery facilities. No waste goes into a landfill: Blue Solutions calls on recovery and recycling service providers for wood, cardboard and metals. It should be noted that Bluebus entity recycles or recovers all of its hazardous waste.\n\nBlue Solutions Canada implemented additional sorting and awarenessraising actions on waste management in 2023.\n\n#### *Battery recyclability*\n\nThe recyclability of LMP<sup>®</sup> batteries is a priority for Blue Solutions, which is committed to creating a sustainable value chain by adopting a circularity approach and ensuring that products are developed in anticipation of their end of life (see paragraph on \"Concrete initiatives to develop low-carbon products and services in each of the activities\" in section 1.2.3.1.2. – Group climate strategy: making the management of our carbon footprint central to our business lines). The manufacturing process is designed to be as environmentally friendly as possible, for example through the use of a dry, solvent-free cathode extrusion process, the use of ultra-thin anodes and cathodes, and the re-injection of recycled materials into the production line. At this time, there is no solution on the European market for recycling lithium-metal batteries that use Li-Ion technologies. This is why Blue Solutions has been working since 2020 to develop an innovative and patented solution to extract, recycle and reuse lithium metal from end-oflife LMP<sup>®</sup> batteries. The results obtained from the prototype are very promising with more than 80% extraction of lithium-metal and a very high degree of purity.\n\nMore than 440,000 euros have been invested to date, and Blue Solutions is continuing to enhance and develop this process to achieve 90% yield and to deploy it at an industrial scale.\n\nIn terms of packaging and production of dielectric films:\n\n- scraps from the production of dielectric film and certain ranges of packaging films are crushed and re-extruded to transform them into a secondary raw material. These by-products are sold to customers or, in the case of packaging film, may be reused in the manufacturing process (BRi reference using 30% of postindustrial recycled material, a process that was extended to two other references in the Bolphane and Bolfresh ranges in 2022);\n- manufacturing scraps that cannot be transformed into by-products inhouse all have recycling solutions;\n- the development of chemical recycling of plastic waste on an industrial scale represents an additional opportunity to recover postindustrial and\n\npost-consumer film waste. Films Packaging is closely following this development and is contributing to its implementation by already using materials recycled via this technology in some of its products.\n\n#### *Plastic packaging management*\n\nPlastic packaging is subject to various restrictions or prohibitions at European and national level, with the promulgation in France of Act no. 2020-105 on reducing waste for a circular economy (\"Agec law\") which aims to end the marketing of single-use plastic packaging by 2040. Under this law, reduce, reuse and recycling targets will be set by decree every five years.\n\nAll films produced by Packaging Films can be recovered at the end of their life, either by recycling or by energy recovery in accordance with EN 13431. Packaging Films is committed to complying with current and future regulations, adapting its products accordingly, and pressing ahead with its ecodesign strategy (see section 1.2.3.1.3. – Resilience of the organization's strategy: placing the control of our carbon footprint at the heart of our products and services):\n\n- Bolphane R3 range: with 100% recyclable products to date, one BRi product incorporating postindustrial regenerated material, and B-Nat<sup>®</sup> 0 and B-Nat<sup>®</sup> F products incorporating biosourced material;\n- Bolfresh range: with currently one OXBTEC\\_RCB<sup>®</sup> reference, suitable for food contact, recyclable and containing a portion of recycled polymers from post-consumer plastic waste.\n\nFurthermore, the development of advanced recycling of plastic waste on an industrial scale represents an additional opportunity to recover postindustrial and postconsumer film waste, especially for food-contact films. Films Packaging is closely following this development and is contributing to its implementation by already using materials recycled via this technology in some of its products. This approach is applied across its entire range.\n\n# Systems\n\nIER and Automatic Systems do not directly consume raw materials, as their primary activity is assembly. However, they promote the recyclability and management of waste from their products as well as those of their suppliers. For example, Automatic Systems strives to reduce its share of total waste by working with its component suppliers to ensure that their packaging is recyclable and reusable. The subsidiary conducts in-depth monitoring of the overall quantity of waste and reports it annually during the QHSE Department review.\n\nMore than 80% of the products manufactured by these two subsidiaries, often with lifespans of more than fifteen years, are recyclable in the waste market. For example, the new \"FirstLane\" security corridor designed by Automatic Systems meets this objective by having a recyclability rate of 90.7%, calculated according to IEC 62635/2012 and a revaluation rate of 93%.\n\nTo further strengthen its waste management strategy, Automatic Systems also implemented a Product Environmental Profile (PEP) approach in January 2023 to assess the ecological footprint of each of its products, particularly by estimating their recyclability rate.\n\nIn response to regulations (European directive 2002/96/EC), IER is implementing a comprehensive solution for the recovery and reprocessing of its end-of-life products. In 2009, it signed a contract for a treatment solution with a certified and approved company. In France, it also joined a government-approved eco-organization on July 1, 2013. IER also offers its customers the opportunity to benefit from the recycling solutions it has set up with its certified service providers for earlier products not covered by the regulations and for facilities outside Europe. This is the case in North America, where the recycling of end-of-life electronic products is not yet regulated: IER, at the customer's request, offers dismantling, packaging and return of equipment to the factory. The recovered metal is then recycled and electronic waste passed on to specialist organizations.\n\nIn 2023, under the Agec law on reducing waste for a a circular economy, the subsidiaries IER, EASIER and Automatic Systems submitted a prevention and ecodesign plan. This plan fulfills the obligation arising from article 72 and article L. 541-10-12 of the French environmental code *(Code de l'environnement),* which state that manufacturers must draw up a five-year plan containing data on reduction and reuse, the origin of raw materials and the consumption of recycled materials and recyclability.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *Waste monitoring indicators(1) at the Bolloré Group(2)*\n\n|                                                                       | 2023                 |                  |          |                     |        |            |               |                             |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------|---------------------|--------|------------|---------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                                                       | Bolloré<br>Logistics | Oil<br>logistics | Industry | Communi-<br>cations | Others | 2023 Total | 2022 Total(2) | Total 2023<br>coverage rate |\n| Total amount of hazardous waste (in metric tons)                      | 572                  | 618              | 554      | 793                 | 174    | 2,711      | 4,806         | 100                         |\n| Of which hazardous waste recycled or recovered (in %)                 | 97                   | 75               | 67       | 87                  | 98     | 83         | 88            | 100                         |\n| Total amount of hazardous (or nonhazardous) waste<br>(in metric tons) | 8,887                | 42               | 3,984    | 9,214               | 388    | 22,515     | 37,765        | 100                         |\n| Of which non-hazardous waste recycled or recovered (in %)             | 64                   | 51               | 96       | 81                  | 31     | 76         | 79            | 100                         |\n\n(1) The quantities of waste reported by the Bolloré Group (with Vivendi, excluding Lagardère) in the table above only cover companies engaged in industrial activities.\n\n(2) For the Bolloré Group, the 2022 data have been restated to exclude Bolloré Africa Logistics following the disposal of this activity.\n\n# **1.2.3.2.4. OPTIMIZING WATER MANAGEMENT**\n\nGiven the importance of this issue at a global level, the Group is aware of its responsibilities for monitoring and optimizing its water consumption and preventing any risk of water pollution through the treatment of contaminated water. Water management is notably taken into account in the environmental management systems implemented by Group entities (see section 2 – 1.2.3.2.2. Preventing local pollution risks and industrial accidents).\n\nAs part of its environmental reporting, the Group monitors its water consumption closely in a constant effort to optimize resources. As a matter of principle, all critical facilities must be equipped to handle wastewater in accordance with local regulations.\n\n# Objectives and progress\n\n| Area of action   | Group objectives                                                                                 | Horizon                       | Progress at 12/31/2023                                                                   |\n|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Water management | • Implement actions to reduce water<br>consumption and prevent leakage/loss<br>on water networks | 2022 carried over<br>to 2023* | • Continued deployment of systems<br>to continuously monitor changes<br>in the flow rate |\n\n\\* The 2022 targets were renewed in 2023 due to two significant disposal projects and anticipated work related to the CSRD in 2024.\n\n# Specific challenges related to water management in the Group's activities\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\n# Bolloré Logistics\n\nGiven that water use is mainly linked to sanitary facilities and cleaning, water risk has not been identified as material for Bolloré Logistics' activities. Water consumption is monitored in all entities using meters or invoices. A water consumption reduction policy is in place, notably through the installation of rainwater collection tanks on network sites. The optimization of water consumption is also taken into account in new construction, and daily use is the subject of ecofriendly campaigns with employees. In Thailand, the Smile Hub warehouse uses an H2O Air molecular water generator to supply staff with cold water, saving 25% of water, or 60 m<sup>3</sup> per year. In 2023, the Calcutta branch (India) and the Lahore branch (Pakistan) decided to reuse wastewater from the air conditioning system to water plants: in total, more than 150 liters of water are saved each day.\n\nIn addition to efforts to optimize water consumption, the entities have been taking awareness-raising actions on the importance of preserving water resources for two years. In June 2023, to celebrate World Ocean Day, Bolloré Logistics France committed to the fight against water pollution by actively collaborating on an initiative spearheaded by the NGO Swim for Change. Bolloré Logistics Fiji, Oman, Australia and Singapore also organized actions to prevent marine pollution, resulting in over one ton of waste being collected on beaches.\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n# Bolloré Energy\n\nIn 2023, Bolloré Energy consumed 12,027 m<sup>3</sup> of water and collected 484 metric tons of contaminated water, which is classified as waste and treated. Water discharged from industrial activities is regularly tested and each site is assessed at least once a year. In 2023, 97 tests were carried out.\n\n# **• Industry**\n\nBlue\n\nWater consumption is not directly used in Blue's industrial processes. Water is used for cleaning, sanitation and fire-fighting tests and drills. Water conservation and cost-saving measures are implemented at all sites; these include rainwater recovery solutions for sanitary facilities, automatic taps with motion detectors and regular consumption monitoring. This issue is a core component of Blue's health, safety and environment policies, as well as its environmental management system.\n\n# *Water consumption monitoring indicators(1)*\n\n| (in m3)              |                   | 2023(3)        |          |        |            |               |\n|----------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------|--------|------------|---------------|\n|                      | Bolloré Logistics | Bolloré Energy | Industry | Others | 2023 Total | 2022 Total(4) |\n| Water consumption(2) | 206,153           | 12,027         | 16,557   | 7,969  | 242,705    | 250,571       |\n\n(1) This indicator covers the Bolloré Group scope outside the Communications division for the sake of the clarity of the actions presented qualitatively in this chapter.\n\n(2) Includes water from distribution networks and from the environment.\n\n(3) Total 2023 coverage rate: 100% of the Bolloré CSR reporting scope.\n\n(4) For the Bolloré Group, the 2022 data have been restated to exclude Bolloré Africa Logistics following the disposal of this activity.\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.2.3.2.5. PRESERVING BIODIVERSITY**\n\nThe Bolloré Group is aware of the importance of taking biodiversity issues into account in the performance of its activities. This is reflected in various actions such as the biodiversity policy deployed by Bolloré Logistics.\n\n# Measures taken to preserve biodiversity in the Group's activities\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\n## Bolloré Logistics\n\nBolloré Logistics provides services that are not directly dependent on living resources. However, its network of agencies and logistics hubs, positioned at the crossroads of international trade, are all points of contact with biodiversity. For the past ten years, the company has been committed to taking biodiversity into account globally at the business line level, while relying on local adaptations in each of its locations around the world, with the goal of mobilizing all its employees, particularly through its Powering Sustainable Logistics CSR program. Its new Biodiversity Charter is the result of collaborative work by all Bolloré Logistics Departments, backed by the expertise of a biodiversity consulting firm that supports the teams over the long term. The company's objective is to extend its commitment to biodiversity throughout its value chain in response to its priority challenges in four areas:\n\n1. mobilize Bolloré Logistics' global network and oversee the rollout of our biodiversity commitments;\n\n2. model how our activities impact and depend on biodiversity throughout the value chain and identifying areas for improvement;\n\n3. reduce the pressure exerted by Bolloré Logistics' activities on the five causes of biodiversity degradation as defined by IPBES;\n\n4. strengthen the benefits of biodiversity for all stakeholders.\n\nTo do that, a Biodiversity Policy Steering Committee led by an ecologist and comprising more than 100 persons representing key functions in the company, and 40 biodiversity ambassadors, meets every six months to implement the 15 actions of the biodiversity management system, which has held the Ecocert<sup>®</sup> Biodiversity Commitment certification since 2015, and to monitor changes in indicators as closely as possible. One example among the many actions taken: Bolloré Logistics has been compiling an ecological database of its land holdings around the world to define appropriate local action plans in partnership with ecologists. In 2023, the land footprint of the 387 sites in the division's network was studied by an ecologist who established a biodiversity risk score for each of them using a common spatial and ecological analysis methodology (environment, surface area, footprint, land use, protected areas, etc.). Out of 188 sensitive Bolloré Logistics sites, 92 have been recognized as priority sites, i.e. sites with major biodiversity challenges and strategic warehouses for the Climate Plan. These priority sites account for 24% of all the company's sites, making up 52% of the total land footprint, 54% of green spaces and 49.5% of building space. There are a number of objectives: to inform employees about local biodiversity issues near their workplace, to focus support on priority sites by working with them to draw up local biodiversity action plans with recommendations from ecologists, and to measure the \"ecological potential of sites\" score.\n\nThis continuous improvement effort makes it possible to deploy the Biodiversity policy to priority sites as well as projects to build or renovate tertiary buildings in order to support them with an internal \"Site Committed to Nature\" label awarded by the CSR Department and partner ecologists. Since 2020, one of the company's specific commitments has been to implement a biodiversity action plan at 35 priority sites worldwide by 2025. It has now surpassed that goal with 39 \"Site Committed to Nature\" designations covering more than 95,500 m<sup>2</sup> of green spaces managed without pesticides. In addition, the goal to double biophilic indoor spaces in 2025 compared to 2019 levels to promote employee well-being at work was exceeded in 2023 with more than 401,000 m<sup>2</sup> covered by the Interior Design Charter incorporating quality of life at work and the greening of facilities. The goal to have 50% of employees made aware of biodiversity and climate change by the end of 2022 has also been achieved, with almost 19,000 employees educated on biodiversity and climate change in 2021 and 2022. The planning of regular events in the branches (Climate and Biodiversity Fresks, beach clean-ups, coral restoration, tree planting, etc.) in 2023 continued to raise awareness employee at the local level.\n\nMoreover, since 2018 Bolloré Logistics has been publicly committed to the Act4nature initiative spearheaded by the EPE (Entreprises pour l'environnement) association. It publishes an annual report on its biodiversity actions on the Act4nature official website; these actions include its voluntary commitments for 2025, which are audited every two years by the French Office of Biodiversity.\n\nThis makes Bolloré Logistics one of the companies that integrate biodiversity into its strategy, activities and value chain. It is leading the way in the transport and logistics sector with respect to its commitment to the preservation of urban biodiversity.\n\n# **1.2.4. COMMITTING OVER THE LONG-TERM TO REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT**\n\nAs a major global economic player, the Group conducts a proactive policy in the areas of access to education, training and care. It establishes lasting partnerships on themes related to its activities and values, by developing synergies with the local players in the regions in which it operates.\n\n# **1.2.4.1. RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO RELATIONS WITH COMMUNITIES**\n\n*Prioritization of risks and opportunities related to relations with local communities(1)*\n\n| Transportation and logistics | Oil logistics  | Industry | Communications |         |         |\n|------------------------------|----------------|----------|----------------|---------|---------|\n| Bolloré Logistics            | Bolloré Energy | Blue     | Films          | Systems | Vivendi |\n\n(1) Priority risk and opportunity.\n\nIn blue: priority non-financial risk at the division level. In gray: non-priority non-financial risk at the division level.\n\nWith locations in several countries, the Group, through its activities and relationships with local communities, is a key player in regional social and economic development. It must therefore prevent, mitigate and compensate for the negative externalities generated by its activity while maximizing beneficial impacts for local populations and the territories where it operates.\n\nThis risk has not been identified as one of the priority risks of the Communications sector, given the nature of its activities. For more information on the management of CSR priority risks in the Communications sector, see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document in chapter 2 – section 2.2. – Main non-financial risks and opportunities.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.2.4.2. A GROUP COMMITTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF POPULATIONS AND TERRITORIES**\n\n# Group policy\n\nIn all its activities, one of the Group's priority challenges is to contribute to the development of the regions in which it operates. This primarily involves the recruitment and training of local employees, investments, and dialog with the communities around its premises. The Group contributes directly or indirectly to the development of the local economy, and to the development of services. The relationships with local communities and actors enable it to better participate in regional dynamics and be more closely involved in their issues.\n\n- The Group's local social impact policy is broken down into several key points:\n- contributing to and promoting local employment;\n- revitalizing the regions;\n- building and maintaining dialog with stakeholders, and;\n- undertaking societal actions for the benefit of local populations.\n\n# **1.2.4.2.1. CONTRIBUTING TO AND PROMOTING LOCAL EMPLOYMENT**\n\nIn 2023, Bolloré Group measured its impact in terms of local employment and observed that the share of local employees remained stable. Of the Bolloré Group's 18,329 employees as at December 31, 2023, 99.6% were local employees.\n\nThe representativity of managers on each of the continents is in line with the Group's average overall, with a slightly higher rate in France, which is the\n\n#### *Indicators(1) on the workforce by geographic area(2)*\n\nwomen is very good in all regions, with almost equal proportions of women and men.

It engages in direct employment, and has an indirect impact through purchases from local suppliers and service providers (see section 1.2.2.2.3. – Respect of the fundamental rights of communities and neighbors close to our operations and constant efforts to make a positive contribution to society).\n\n# Impacts of investments in the Group's activities\n\n# on regional development\n\nThe Bolloré Group is committed to regional development, through its investments and business, as well as through its commitments to associations and sponsorship of programs promoting job placement. For example, since 2022, the Group has been supporting the rollout of mentoring in France in collaboration with the NGO Proxité. The experience in Proxité's priority neighborhoods and its results with more than 6,500 young people showed the Bolloré Group the power of supporting the association for two years to join forces and have a positive regional impact in Lille, Nantes and Toulouse. It affords employees an opportunity to get involved by sponsoring young people from struggling regions. The assistance is adapted to the needs and expectations of young people to give them the best chance at academic success and promote sustainable professional integration.\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\n#### Bolloré Logistics\n\nAt Bolloré Logistics, local purchases mainly include subcontracting costs (security, guards, rent, etc.), equipment rental and the purchase of fuel. All logistics, industrial and commercial facilities operated with leading partners and states drive job and wealth creation for the company's countries of operation, and contribute to the opening up of territories and their economic dynamism (local purchases and taxes).\n\nBolloré Logistics also contributes to the creation of indirect and induced jobs by prioritizing the purchase of materials and goods in the countries in which it operates and outsourcing appropriate tasks to local companies. As well as creating jobs, the company contributes to improving the employability of local populations through:\n\n- the transfer of knowledge and training;\n- skills development (employee training, solidarity actions to promote the education and training of young people), and;\n- improved performance and the ability of local companies to support economic growth (implementing corporate standards throughout its value chain, solidarity actions for local companies in this area, promotion of cooperation in education, training, and corporate R&D).\n\nAs part of this effort, several Bolloré Logistics branches have taken steps to develop relationships with schools. By way of illustration, in July 2022 the Singapore subsidiary launched a project to improve the inclusion of social and environmental impacts in the assessment of investments based on the Triple Bottom Line approach with a group of students from KEDGE Business School – Paris as part of their master's degree in Sustainability. The goal is to develop an easy-to-use tool that delivers financial performance and aligns with the CSR roadmap. This work is part of their final year project, and will provide an excellent basis for recommendations to address a Bolloré Logistics issue.\n\nFurthermore, Bolloré Logistics Singapore regularly organizes student tours of its B.Lab, an in-house innovation center that deploys its capabilities in digital innovation, robotics and sustainable development initiatives. The tours include presentations of the latest responsible solutions. In May 2023, a larger partnership was signed with Essec in Singapore, and the first two MAPS/Essec cohorts were launched with around 30 participants.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\nMeanwhile, Bolloré Logistics China was the partner of the 10th Trophée des Talents, a talent competition organized by the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China and the French Embassy. This national competition, launched in 2013, is aimed at Sino-francophone students and Chinese students. It provides them with a better understanding of the business world, and gives them access to a platform where they can connect with French companies and showcase their talents, to improve their chances of being recruited. Bolloré Logistics China is also committed to helping students with disabilities, and has officially pledged to offer internship and employment opportunities to students from specialized schools in Shanghai.\n\nSince April 2022, Bolloré Logistics has been supporting the Graine d'Orateur 93 association, which aims to expand public speaking training to schools, associations and/or socio-cultural organizations in the priority neighborhoods of Lille, Lyon and Marseille. The goal is to educate more than 300 young people about citizenship and the foundations of democracy by engaging in debate and public speaking.\n\n# **• Industry** Blue\n\nOut of concern for its impact on the environment and the development of the\n\nlocal economic fabric, Blue relies on local suppliers as much as possible. It works with local sheltered workshops such as CATs (labor assistance centers) and Esats (labor assistance establishments and Services) to purchase office supplies and wooden pallets, maintain green spaces, etc. In 2022, more than 83,578 euros was paid by the division unit as part of partnerships with CATs.\n\nIn addition, the production sites of Bluebus six-meter and twelvemeter electric buses and LMP® Blue Solutions batteries are certified Origine France Garantie (guaranteed French origin). This distinction ensures product traceability by giving consumers a clear and objective indication of origin and certifies that Bluebus vehicles built at the Quimper plant acquire their essential characteristics in France. This strategy of continued improvement of these vehicles also boosts the production line, which currently employs 130 people in Ergué-Gabéric in Brittany for bus production and 240 people for battery production.\n\n# **1.2.4.2.3. BUILDING AND MAINTAINING DIALOG WITH STAKEHOLDERS**\n\nThe Group and its divisions are committed to taking into account the expectations and concerns of their internal and external stakeholders at all levels of the organization. The Group undertook an external stakeholder identification process (banks, funders, investors, customers, ratings agencies, etc.) to take into account their priorities. The divisions and subsidiaries maintain ongoing dialog with their stakeholders (local communities, customers, suppliers, etc.), adapted to their local and operational contexts.\n\nVivendi fully recognizes that, in order to develop sustainably, a company must take into account its ecosystem, which comprises all its stakeholders. The group places great importance on dialog with everyone involved in its activities, and maintains ongoing exchanges with the financial and extrafinancial communities, associations and academic circles, employees and their representatives, and customers (see section 4.3.3.3. of Vivendi's nonfinancial performance statement). This approach was strengthened in 2021 with a materiality analysis that provided a better understanding of the expectations of the group's stakeholders (see section 2.1.1. of Vivendi's nonfinancial performance statement, in particular the stakeholder mapping diagram). See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 1.3 – Continuous dialog with stakeholders.\n\n# Illustration of dialog with stakeholders\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\nTo conduct its activities in the best possible manner and to be a valued and contributing partner of its host communities, the Transportation and logistics division maintains daily dialog with stakeholders in the territories in which it operates.\n\n# Bolloré Logistics\n\nBolloré Logistics is customer-focused, keen to maintain daily dialog to meet customers' current and future needs, to help them achieve sustainable growth. Each year, Bolloré Logistics conducts a customer satisfaction survey so that they can share their feedback and identify areas for improvement by region, country and industry.\n\nThe satisfaction survey was completed by 764 customers in 2023. Regular business reviews with customers and suppliers also allow for discussion and progress on environmental action plans. In addition, innovation workshops with customers, based on a design thinking approach focused on sustainable transport and logistics, are organized at the two B.Lab innovation centers at the Headquarters in Puteaux and Singapore.\n\nSince March 2023, Bolloré Logistics has also helped some of its key customers meet their commitments to reduce their carbon footprint and make carbon reduction a value driver with a codevelopment process called \"Beyond Carbon\". This proactive approach aims to codesign and innovate with them, then develop tools to enhance the value propositions linked to carbon reduction. As part of this process, individual interviews were held with customers' supply chain, CSR, sales and Purchasing Departments. Beyond taking a tailored approach to these key accounts, the aim is to capitalize on the efforts already made by Bolloré Logistics teams, to share methodology and, of course, best practices (see section 1.2.3.1.3. – Resilience of the organization's strategy: placing the control of our carbon footprint at the heart of our products and services).\n\nIn parallel, Bolloré Logistics is continuing its work in the transport and logistics sector. For example, in France teams participate in workshops organized by the sustainable development Commission of the French Federation of transport and logistics (TLF) and the SupplyChain4Good initiative managed by France Supply Chain by Aslog. As well as taking part in local initiatives, Bolloré Logistics participates in various international sector bodies with a common objective to combat climate change such as EcoTransIT<sup>®</sup>, the Clean Cargo Working Group, the Sustainable Air Freight Alliance, the Getting to Zero Coalition, and the Global Logistics Emissions Council. The company is also forging partnerships around packaging and the circular economy: in France, in 2023, it joined the Circul'R Club (a program focused on the challenges of point-of-sale advertising), and in Singapore, Bolloré Logistics is a member of the PPP (Packaging Partnership Programme) and PRAS (Plastic Recycling Association of Singapore) to implement recycling solutions in the country.\n\nBolloré Logistics also engages in initiatives with its stakeholders on societal actions. For example, in 2023, Bolloré Logistics and Earthtalent by Bolloré joined forces to launch \"Los Talentos para el Futuro\", an open call for projects with potential positive impacts in Mexico. This challenge, jointly developed with the Bolloré Logistics Mexico teams, aims to reward community projects with a positive impact on the environment, while promoting the talent and creativity of young Mexicans. The deadline for submitting projects was October 8, 2023, via a questionnaire on the Earthtalent website. Next, the proposals will be evaluated by a jury made up of experts and professionals from the Bolloré Group and its partners, who will deliberate and award the winning project up to 10,000 euros for one year, subject to the conditions set out in the rules.\n\n# *The AcTogether challenge, an inter-country competition that strengthens dialog with internal stakeholders*\n\nBolloré Logistics has stepped up dialog with its internal stakeholders with the introduction in early 2020 of an annual competition called AcTogether. This inter-country challenge aims to engage and unite employees in a quest to meet shared sustainable development targets, directly linked to its Powering Sustainable Logistics CSR program. The collective dynamic invites employees to undertake CSR challenges, individually or as part of a team, and share best practices and local initiatives on a digital platform. This enables Bolloré Logistics to better connect central policies with local network actions in its 65 regions.\n\nFor this fourth edition of the challenge, 1,663 actions were carried out in 50 countries, including 68% environmental actions (waste management, energy efficiency and CO<sup>2</sup> with building performance, low-carbon transport plan, sustainable packaging solutions and circular economy, biodiversity actions) and 21% social actions (well-being at work, preventive healthcare, diversity and inclusion, etc) and 10% GO SAFE actions in connection with the new health and safety challenge. This year's edition made good progress, with a 24% increase in completed actions compared to the 2022 edition. In 2023, Bolloré Logistics Philippines emerged as the winner of the challenge, with 154 actions completed that saved nearly 3,820 metric tons of CO2.\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Bolloré Energy\n\nAt Bolloré Energy, site monitoring commission meetings involving residents' associations and government departments, held at the prefecture, are also organized every year, in accordance with the regulations applicable to Seveso upper-tier sites.\n\n# **• Industry**\n\n# Blue\n\nAmong the Blue division's most important stakeholders are the research and development community and scientific training bodies that specialize in the challenges of the energy transition and the manufacturing of energy storage solutions. As such, Blue Solutions is developing various scientific collaboration partnerships, for example with the Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH) in 2023, and with the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM) in Neuchâtel on projects to improve solid-state lithium metal batteries.\n\nAlso in 2023, Blue Solutions and Bluebus joined forces with Forsee Power to develop the battery of the future in France.\n\n## Systems\n\nCar-sharing activities have been part of Systems' DNA since its creation and the division naturally continues to maintain essential dialog with its stakeholders such as local authorities, as its solution, the Smart Mobility Platform, is specifically designed to support them in the management of mobility services and infrastructure. Thanks to this regulatory tool, the city can offer operators fair access to urban space by balancing the various solutions and by creating a comprehensive and complementary mobility offer to existing transport networks. It enables transport operators to collaborate effectively to maximize the use of city resources and organize mobility services for the benefit of users. As such, the division maintains ongoing trustworthy dialog with the public authorities to which it provides its solutions.\n\n# **1.2.4.2.4. UNDERTAKING SOCIETAL ACTIONS FOR THE BENEFIT OF LOCAL POPULATIONS**\n\nSolidarity is one of the Group's core values. The Bolloré Group's solidarity policy and the related actions carried out each year are built around the Fondation de la 2<sup>e</sup> chance, the Foyer Jean-Bosco, targeted societal actions and the Group's International Solidarity Commitment and Sponsorship Department (see section 1.2.4.3. – Sponsorship policy).\n\nWith the third pillar of its CSR strategy, *Creation with All,* Vivendi reaffirms its belief that everyone has a role to play in building a more inclusive and sustainable society. And the group intends to have a positive impact on the world around it by working with all its stakeholders, both internal and external. See Vivendi universal registration document 2023 – chapter 2 – section 4.3.3 – Acting together to enable everyone to have a positive impact.\n\n# Fondation de la 2<sup>e</sup> chance: combating exclusion and promoting solidarity\n\nSet up in June 1998 at the initiative of Vincent Bolloré, the Fondation de la 2<sup>e</sup> chance has been recognized for its public utility since 2006. Chaired by Marie Bolloré, the Fondation de la 2<sup>e</sup> chance helps people aged 18 to 62 who have faced extreme hardship and who presently live in a vulnerable situation, but who have a real desire to get their lives back on track. It provides financial and personal support for a realistic and sustainable professional project:\n\n• creating or buying a business (up to 8,000 euros in funding), or;\n\n• completing training leading to a qualification (up to 5,000 euros in funding).\n\nThis financial \"leg-up\" is accompanied by professional and emotional sponsoring provided to the beneficiary, until the project reaches a successful conclusion.\n\nThe Foundation's continued activities are supported by a team of employees and volunteers. Six employees coordinate all those involved in the Foundation at the head office, hosted by the Bolloré Group. A network of 1,000 active volunteers acts as on-site representatives, instructors and sponsors throughout France.\n\nOver the past two decades, the Fondation de la 2<sup>e</sup> chance has helped over 9,255 people to bounce back. In 2023, 243 new candidates were given support, with average aid per case of 2,971 euros. 70% of candidates received help via training and 30% for creating a company. Successful beneficiaries aged between 25 and 44 years old accounted for 54% of the projects supported.\n\nBolloré Group employees in Brittany (Nantes, Quimper, Rennes) are committed to the Fondation de la 2<sup>e</sup> chance, supporting the social re-integration of people suffering hardship. In 2023, 22 people with projects were accompanied through professional training and/or retraining.\n\n# Foyer Jean-Bosco\n\nThe Group acquired a building belonging to the Petites Sœurs des Pauvres, built in 1896 and located in rue de Varize, in Paris, in the 16th arrondissement, that was fully restored between 2012 and November 2015. Today, it has more than 160 rooms, mainly used by young students from French provinces and from abroad, but also provides rooms for young people suffering from illness and the elderly. This year, the 140 students and 10 elderly residents represented numerous nationalities from Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The students created a choir and an orchestra and participate each week in charity work in Paris. The Foyer Jean-Bosco is a place of fraternal and intergenerational solidarity. It is an innovative scheme that will allow all participants to develop their talents while learning to live in unison.\n\n# Key societal initiatives in 2023\n\nIn all Bolloré Group divisions, employees support causes they care about and engage in projects that are in line with the Group's values, especially solidarity.\n\n# *Marathon Day, the Bolloré Group's charity race*\n\nThe eighth edition of Marathon Day, the Bolloré Group's charity race, was held on September 28, 2023. On this occasion, employees around the world gathered with the same objective: to cover as many kilometers as possible by walking, running or pedaling. Overall, around 9,000 employees in over 50 countries racked up 40,000 kilometers.\n\nMarathon Day is a major in-house event to bring employees together around a festive charity activity. In fact, the 10 countries that succeeded in mobilizing the largest number of employees in proportion to their workforce will be able to make a donation to a local non-profit of their choice. This year, Chile, Mexico, Hungary, Spain, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Polynesia, the Philippines, New Zealand and India received an endowment to help local communities. In Bangladesh, for example, street children received support from Street Children's Partners, while in Malaysia, women victims of domestic violence were assisted by the Women's Aid Organisation.\n\n# **• Other solidarity events**\n\nIn order to unite employees around major charity events, communications media are created at the head office and then adapted locally to increase team involvement. Best practices are shared between countries and duplicated, for example:\n\n- **International Women's Day, March 8.** This year, the Communications Department created a card game. The so-called \"privilege game\" aimed to educate employees in a fun way about gender equality issues. One hundred card decks were produced and sent to branches around the world. A series of short videos called \"BEquals\" was also introduced in March; throughout the year this series gave our employees a chance to talk about gender equality issues. A training module was also created with the help of B'University to raise employee awareness.\n- **Earth Hour, March 24.** For the fifth year in a row, the Bolloré Group joined in the WWF's global initiative, Earth Hour, inviting employees from all over the world to symbolically switch off their lights for one hour and to take an energy savings knowledge quiz. From France to Lebanon, Italy, Vietnam and Brazil, branches in 17 countries participated in this event. This initiative re-asserted the company's commitment to environmental issues.\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\n• **World Environment Week.** This year, it was not just a week, but the whole month of June that we dedicated to the environment to raise awareness among the employees of the Transportation and logistics division on the major current and future challenges. This gave them an opportunity to better understand how to limit their environmental footprint through events, quizzes and fact sheets.\n\nIn addition, Climate Fresk workshops were offered throughout the year in the subsidiaries, such as IER in Suresnes and Bolloré Logistics in the US.\n\nEmployees organised campaigns to clean up public spaces and sell plant planting in about 10 countries, particularly in Asia and the Americas.\n\n- **Pink October and Movember.** Throughout October and November 2023, employees of Bolloré Logistics and Bolloré Energy organized numerous awareness-raising and prevention actions to support the fight against breast cancer and male cancers. This year the Bolloré Group chose the theme of fighting cancer through sport. There were three workshops at the head office (boxing, yoga and low-impact exercise, yoga) and a session on breast self-exams and breast cancer prevention hosted by a midwife. For example, at Fast Bolloré Logistics in Lebanon, an information session on prostate cancer was held for all staff on November 24. Employees in Indonesia took part in and attended a real sports performance combining high-intensity cardio and weightlifting, on November 16.\n- **Charity collections.** In December, as in previous years, our subsidiaries took steps to help the underprivileged. A donation drive organized at the\n\n# **1.2.4.3. SPONSORSHIP POLICY**\n\nSince 2018, the Bolloré Group's sponsorship policy has been harmonized under the Earthtalent by Bolloré label, which ensures financial transparency and the societal impact of the charitable projects the Group backs to assist local communities.\n\nBeing able to give back a part of what we have had the good fortune to receive is a value deeply rooted in the Bolloré Group's DNA. It is the reason why the Group has chosen to prioritize youth empowerment and education, while maintaining its strong commitment to respond to humanitarian and public health emergencies.\n\nIn 2023, the human, financial and material support provided by the Group benefited almost 10,000 people in 14 countries, including nearly 50% young people through organizations working primarily in education, vocational training and entrepreneurship.\n\n# **2023 KEY FIGURES**\n\n- 89 societal impact projects in 14 countries, 61% of donations benefiting young people.\n- Almost 10,000 beneficiaries, including nearly 50% young people to advance 9 UN SDGs.\n- 41 projects supported in 2023 to advance SDG no. 3 \"Good health and well-being\".\n\n# **2023 HIGHLIGHTS**\n\nIn 2023, Earthtalent by Bolloré and Bolloré Logistics participated, alongside the NGO Acted, in the emergency plan to transport basic necessities by truck to the Hatay region in Turkey to meet the needs of victims of the earthquake that took place on February 6, 2023. The NGO present on site required the support of Bolloré Logistics, in particular to transport health kits, purchased from various suppliers throughout the country, to distribution sites. In addition, Bolloré Logistics handled the transport of an ambulance and medical equipment to Yemen to support the work of the NGO Elise Care.\n\nÎle-de-France and Brittany sites benefited Restos du Cœur. More than 15 boxes of basic hygiene products were donated to the Nanterre branch and more than 3 m<sup>3</sup> of foodstuffs were donated to the Quimper branch in Brittany.\n\nBolloré Logistics Thailand donated supplies, goodies, toys, games and books to 120 children at a local school. On December 15, 22 employees, including the Bolloré Logistics Thailand management team, went to the Samut Prakan Special Education Center to donate collected items.\n\nMeanwhile, Bolloré Logistics Vietnam collected reams of paper; over 1,000 pens, felt-tips and markers; and canned milk, cookies, toys and books, for the 60 children at the Green Bamboo Welfare Center, a non-profit organization that provides a safe haven for underprivileged children in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nEmployees also donated clothing to collection bins for Emmaüs Alternatives throughout 2023.\n\nLastly, the subsidiaries listening to the needs of local communities and schools close to their sites, continue to carry out various actions. In order to facilitate access to education for as many people as possible, kits with school supplies and educational materials are regularly distributed, complementing work to refurbish the school buildings, collection bins and so on.\n\n- **World AIDS Day on December 1.** Once again this year, both in France and abroad, employee awareness campaigns (posters, red ribbons, communications) were carried out in support of this cause.\n- **A room for sucess:** the international social scholarship program to help students in vulnerable situations.\n\nIn 2023, the Cité internationale universitaire de Paris students' residence and the Bolloré Group took action to combat student poverty with the \"A room for success\" scholarship program. Initiated in November, scholarships were made available to around 20 students living in poverty. A targeted response to the specific needs and situations of these students is offered through specific support and care.\n\n- 30 projects supported in 2023 to advance SDG no. 4 \"Quality education\".\n- 37 projects supported in 2023 to advance SDG no. 10 \"Reduced inequalities\".\n- 10 projects for women.\n\nEarthtalent By Bolloré and Bolloré Logistics also rallied to support the Graine d'Orateur association, whose goal is to encourage and build confidence in young people from underprivileged and working class neighborhood by teaching them public speaking skills. A donation of 14,000 euros was made over two years to help the association expand its speech workshops in the Île-de-France region, as well as in Lille, Lyon, Marseille and Toulouse, through the creation of a network of branches.\n\nThe key initiatives carried out in 2023 as part of Earthtalent by Bolloré include 50,000 euros to support the non-profit Solucham, which promotes health and education in the high valleys of Nepal and the Solukhumbu region. The association is currently building and running a training and apprenticeship center in the town of Salleri.\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-117-0\"></span>**1.3. Summary tables of the Bolloré Group's non-financial performance indicators**\n\n# **1.3.1. SOCIAL INDICATOR SUMMARY TABLES**\n\n# **1.3.1.1. SOCIAL REPORTING METHODOLOGY NOTE**\n\n# **1.3.1.1.1. STANDARD**\n\nThe reporting of non-financial indicators is based on the internal standards drawn up by the Bolloré Group: the social data reporting protocol. This was completely redesigned in 2018 to enable the necessary indicators to be\n\n# **1.3.1.1.2. ORGANIZATION**\n\nThe following indicators have been compiled and consolidated using Enablon software for all Group activities.\n\nThe reporting process relies on three levels of involvement:\n\n- at central level: the Group's Human Resources Information Systems and Compensation Department organizes and supervises the reporting of information as it is collected. It consolidates the social indicators of all Group entities;\n- at division/regional level: the representative for the division or geographic area within the division ensures that the process runs smoothly. The representative validates all of the indicators compiled within his/her scope\n\n# **1.3.1.1.3. COLLECTION PERIOD AND SCOPE**\n\nThe data relating to the reporting year are collected in January of the following year for the period from January 1 to December 31.\n\n- This year, due to the sale of Bolloré Logistics, two separate reporting campaigns were organized:\n- the collection of Bolloré Logistics social data was brought forward and deployed across 76 legal entities. The data collected cover the period from January 1, 2023 to September 30, 2023, a reporting period of nine months. To ensure data comparability, the published data have been extrapolated to cover a full year according to a methodology established by the Group and validated by the ITO;\n\n# **1.3.1.1.4. INDICATORS**\n\nSocial reporting counts each employee as one unit, regardless of how long that employee worked during the year.\n\nThe subjects covered in the information collected are workforce, diversity, staff mobility, training, absenteeism, labor relations, organization of working time and professional insertion.\n\nFor certain indicators, it was not always possible to take the whole of the scope into account. In particular:\n\n• new entities that join the reporting scope during the fiscal year are only included in the workforce data;\n\n# **1.3.1.1.5. MONITORING AND VALIDATION**\n\nTo ensure that the indicators are reliable, the Group's Human Resources Information Systems and Compensation Department has established:\n\n- preparatory meetings before compilation commences;\n- a user guide and interactive assistance, and;\n- a hotline providing support to representatives.\n\nThe monitoring and validation objectives are as follows:\n\n- to detect discrepancies recorded in the reporting tool;\n- to ensure the reliability of data by two-level validation (division and local).\n\ncompiled. It allows uniform definitions and rules to be applied throughout the Group for the compilation, validation and consolidation of indicators. It was distributed to all those involved in social reporting.\n\nand acts as the interface between the local level and central level for his/ her area of responsibility in the event of difficulties in reporting the data;\n\n• at the local level: local representatives are responsible for entering the indicators compiled in accordance with the reporting protocol, providing explanations where the indicators differ significantly from those previously reported.\n\nA data validation flow has been set up in Enablon at each level of the organization to ensure that the indicators entered are reliable and the associated explanations are relevant.\n\n• the collection of social data outside Bolloré Logistics has been deployed across 49 legal entities and covers all twelve months of the year. The data are published in consolidated format for 2023 and include data from the Vivendi group. For some indicators, the data are broken down by activity. The collection scope applies to all fully-consolidated companies, from the moment that the company takes on staff.\n\n- for Vivendi, entities with a total workforce under 15 people at December 31 only report workforce data (i.e., not data on training, absenteeism, health and safety or collective agreements).\n- To ensure the comparability of indicators against 2023 data:\n- the 2021 and 2022 social data have been restated to exclude Bolloré Africa Logistics, which was no longer part of the reporting scope as at December 31, 2023;\n- Vivendi's 2021 and 2022 social data have been restated to exclude Editis, which was no longer part of the reporting scope as at December 31, 2023.\n\nTo ensure that the data entered in the reporting tool are consistent, a test is carried out on the relevance of the values entered for the indicators compiled, particularly by comparison with the previous year's compilation.

ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATOR SUMMARY TABLES**\n\n# **1.3.2.1. CSR REPORTING METHODOLOGY NOTE**\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of decree no. 2017-1265 of August 9, 2017 implementing order no. 2017-1180 of July 19, 2017 relating to the publication of non-financial information by certain large companies and groups of companies, and the AMF recommendations on information to be published by companies concerning corporate social responsibility, the Group revised its reporting protocol and drew up a table of significant indicators regarding the risks identified for its diversified activities.\n\nThe principles on which this protocol is based are consistent with, in particular, IFRS guidelines, ISO 26000 and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). This protocol is distributed and applied to all entities that gather and communicate their non-financial information to the Group.\n\nIt is reviewed every year and defines the conditions for the collection and verification of data.\n\nThe universal registration document presents the Group's strategic drivers and major social, environmental and societal commitments.\n\nIt is supplemented by the CSR report, which includes information about the CSR actions of the various divisions.\n\n# **1.3.2.1.1. SCOPE OF REPORTING**\n\nThe scope of companies examined corresponds to the consolidated integrated financial scope (excluding finance and operating companies accounted for using the equity method) established as at December 31, 2022. For 2023, the scope of reporting includes companies that have:\n\n- a workforce of 20 or more, and/or;\n- a revenue greater than or equal to 10,000 euros, and;\n- been in existence for at least one year (i.e., with one full accounting year completed as at December 31)<sup>(1)</sup>.\n\nWith respect to these thresholds, Bolloré's CSR reporting (excluding Communications) covers:\n\n- 70 Group entities (52 Bolloré Logistics entities and 18 non-Bolloré Logistics entities) (versus 125 entities in HR reporting);\n- 95% of the Group's total workforce in 2022 (excluding Communications); • 90% of the Group's 2022 revenue (excluding Communications).\n\nWith regard to the consolidation thresholds relating to Bolloré's CSR reporting and Vivendi's environmental reporting (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 7.1.4.3. Environmental reporting scope), the environmental indicators consolidating the Communications division\n\n# **1.3.2.1.2. REPORTING METHODOLOGY**\n\nThe following points describe the methodology employed for reporting.\n\n# Reporting protocol\n\nThis document details the CSR reporting challenges, describes the respective roles and responsibilities of directors, level one and level two approvers, and contributors as well as the organization of the campaign. It is sent out to all relevant people before the commencement of the campaign. It is also archived and made available to everyone in the reporting system.\n\n# Indicators and standards\n\nA set of indicators has been defined, covering all CSR areas and divided into several themes. The indicators were provided to everyone upon sending out of the reporting protocol.\n\npublished in section 1.3.2.2. Environmental data covered nearly 90% of the Bolloré Group's total workforce (including Vivendi) in 2022.\n\nWhen selecting the entities to be surveyed for CSR reporting, the existence of criteria makes it possible to organize the reporting approach and to focus on the most representative activities of the Bolloré Group in terms of environmental impact. Each year, the Group calculates the impact of defining these criteria in terms of non-covered carbon emissions. For 2023, the noncovered share of entities not included in the reporting scope is less than 5%, an exclusion that is deemed immaterial.\n\nThe Bolloré Group installed specialist CSR reporting software enabling decentralized collection and centralized consolidation of non-financial indicators. This tool is deployed in all entities of the Transportation and logistics and\n\nIndustry divisions in the Holding entities. All of these companies' data are collected in a shared solution, while Vivendi's data are collected in another dedicated tool.\n\nData consolidation is carried out centrally by the Group CSR team.\n\nWaste reporting is only intended for Bolloré Group industrial entities. All entities that do not only carry out office activities are considered to be industrial entities.\n\n# Reporting questionnaire and consistency checks\n\nThe reporting questionnaire is split into five related sections:\n\n- structure of the entity;\n- health and safety;\n- managing our environmental impact;\n- environmental information, and ;\n- waste.\n\nConsistency checks were introduced in response to requests from the Statutory Auditors with a view to making the reporting more reliable.\n\n# Organization and collection period\n\nDue to the sale of Bolloré Logistics, two separate reporting campaigns were organized:\n\n- the Bolloré Logistics reporting campaign was brought forward and deployed across 52 legal entities. The data collected cover nine months. The published data have been extrapolated to cover a full year;\n- the environmental reporting campaign outside Bolloré Logistics was deployed across 18 legal entities and covers all twelve months of the year. For missing data, estimates can be made.\n\n(1) The consolidation scope may be adjusted by the divisions (exclusion of companies that were closed during the year, or for which data was not available, or inclusion of companies below thresholds, etc.).\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.3.2.1.3. CALCULATION OF GHG EMISSIONS**\n\nFor scopes 1 and 2, the greenhouse gas emissions presented in the document are linked to the Group's energy consumption and include those of Vivendi. The calculation methodology used is that of the Ademe (French environment agency) Footprint database as at October 3, 2023. Where emission factors in this database are not available or deemed irrelevant, other recognized sources such as the GHG Protocol (www.ghgprotocol.org), Defra (www.gov.uk/government/publications/greenhouse-gas-reporting-conversionfactors-2022), IEA (www.iea.org) or AIB (www.aib-net.org) may be used.\n\nInternationally, where the emission factors for certain items of energy consumption were unavailable, the French factor was applied. For GHG emissions linked to electricity, when no emission factor was available for a particular country, the highest factor from any of its neighboring countries was applied.\n\nFor 2023 data, the Bolloré Group reported its scope 2 emissions according to the market-based method. Nearly 12 entities reported that they used electricity from renewable sources. The recognized contractual instruments, such as the garantie d'origine renouvelable (renewable energy guarantee), were analyzed for each of these entities. They consist of the following entities: Blue Solutions Canada, Bolloré Logistics Australia Pty Ltd, Bolloré Logistics China Co. Ltd, Bolloré Logistics France, Bolloré Logistics Italy SpA, Bolloré Logistics Malaysia SDN BHD, Bolloré Logistics Singapore Pte Ltd, Bolloré Logistics Spain, Bolloré Logistics Thailand Co. Ltd, Bolloré Logistics Vietnam Co. Ltd, Compagnie de l'Odet, Global Freight Solutions AB. In accordance with the recommendations of the GHG Protocol, an emissions factor communicated by the renewable electricity supplier was used, and/or a residual factor specific to the entity's country was applied, if available.\n\nFor scope 3, the Group identified the largest sources of emissions. In order to satisfy its obligation to post information for customers about its CO<sup>2</sup> emissions from transportation services, the Bolloré Group developed an emissions calculation tool.\n\nAs regards the calculation of scope 3 linked to the combustion of petroleum products by the Bolloré Energy division, the Bolloré Group takes as a basis the volumes sold over the year and applies the emission factors from the Footprint database corresponding to the combustion of its products sold.\n\nThe data relating to employee business travel includes data on plane and train journeys. For plane journeys, the Group split out medium-haul flights (under 2,000 km) and long-haul flights.\n\nFor emissions relating to train journeys, the Group decided to use the emission factor provided in the Ademe Footprint database for diesel TER regional express trains. In sum, scope 3 corresponds to upstream energy, waste, petroleum product combustion and emissions due to the transport of goods in the provision of freight forwarding services and to work-related travel.\n\n# **1.3.2.2.

industrial processes and fugitive emissions linked to refrigerants.\n\n(2) Scope 2 corresponds to indirect emissions associated with energy, such as electricity consumption or steam, cold or heat consumption through distribution networks.\n\n(3) For the Bolloré Group, scope 3 corresponds to upstream energy, waste, petroleum product combustion and emissions due to the transport of goods in the provision of freight forwarding services and to work-related travel.\n\nFor Communications (Vivendi excluding Lagardère), scope 3 corresponds to other emissions produced by the Group's businesses, which are not accounted for in scopes 1 and 2 but which are linked to the entire value chain, such as purchases of raw materials (paper, cardboard, plastics, etc.), management of waste generated by the subsidiaries of Vivendi, employee business travel, etc.\n\nAs the acquisition of control of the Lagardère group was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2023, its environmental data were not yet included in the Group's non-financial reporting for 2023, in line with the reporting protocol.\n\n(4) For the Bolloré Group, the 2022 data have been restated to exclude Bolloré Africa Logistics following the disposal of this activity.\n\n# Scope 3 details\n\n| (in metric tons CO₂ eq)*                                                          | Bolloré<br>Logistics | Bolloré<br>Energy |

of hazardous materials has not been identified among the priority risks with regard to the Communications division's activities. More information on the policies and action plans implemented in the Communications division is available in Vivendi's non-financial performance report.\n\n(2) The 2022 data have been restated to exclude Bolloré Africa Logistics following the disposal of this activity.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.3.3.

Duty of care plan**\n\n# **2.1. Introduction**\n\n**2.1.1. LEGAL CONTEXT**\n\nThe duty of care law pertaining to parent companies and order-giving companies aims to extend the liability of transnational corporations so as to forestall and avoid catastrophes such as what happened at Rana Plaza in Bangladesh in 2013. The companies affected by the law must draw up a \"duty of care plan\". The law operates in several areas where serious offenses may arise from the activities of a company or its supply chain:\n\n- human rights and fundamental freedoms;\n- personal health and safety, and;\n\n• the environment.\n\n# **2.1.2. THE MISSIONS OF THE BOLLORÉ GROUP**\n\nAs one of the world's largest companies, the Bolloré Group has a historical, long-term presence and occupies strategic positions in three business sectors: transport and logistics, industry, and communications.\n\n- Through its transport and logistics activity, the Bolloré Group is an important player in economic development, the opening up of regions, and the circulation of goods, offering an essential, even vital service, in that it provides an offering that makes it possible to import and export goods, even in the most isolated areas. This integrated logistics network is a real driver for the industrial logistics transformation of certain regions.\n- Through its oil logistics business in France, Switzerland and Germany, the Bolloré Group is a major player in the storage and distribution of petroleum products and an energy supplier to local authorities, individuals and professionals (farmers, carriers, etc.), making it essential to the economic activity of the countries in which it operates.\n\nThe law affects subsidiaries directly or indirectly controlled by the parent company, along with the activities of suppliers and subcontractors with whom there is an established business relationship. Note that the Bolloré Group's duty of care plan does not apply to companies in which it holds a stake that does not give control within the meaning of article L. 233-16 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce).*\n\n- Through its industrial activities, the Bolloré Group develops innovative and sustainable solutions to offer a coherent response to the challenges raised by climate change, particularly through sustainable mobility solutions.\n- Its Communication activities are managed by the Vivendi group.\n\nThese activities involve both adaptability and a solid foundation to offer consistent and optimal quality of service regardless of the context, in line with the Group's value of excellence. The Bolloré Group is nevertheless aware of the potential impacts that the conduct of its activities may have on the environment and the day-to-day life of its stakeholders. This is why, through its due diligence approach, the Group aims to identify and control its impacts in order to prevent – and if necessary correct – situations at risk, and maximize positive externalities, with a view to sustainable and shared development.\n\n# **2.1.3. SCOPE OF ACTION OF THE BOLLORÉ GROUP'S DUTY OF CARE PLAN**\n\nIn accordance with the law, the scope of the Bolloré Group's duty of care plan applies to:\n\n- Bolloré Logistics (as of the date of publication of this document, this business has been sold) and Bolloré Energy, and;\n- Industry subsidiaries, including Blue (Blue Solutions, Bluebus), Bolloré Innovative Thin Films (Bolloré Packaging Films and dielectric films) and Systems subsidiaries (IER, Automatic Systems, Smart Mobility, Polyconseil). The following are excluded from the plan:\n- Vivendi: its CSR Department relies on its own ethics and duty of care plan, applicable to its companies, and adapted to their business lines (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 3.2.2. – Duty of care plan.\n\nFor more information on the Bolloré Group's activities, see chapter 1 – Presentation of the Group and its activities;\n\n- financial holdings: note that the Bolloré Group's duty of care plan does not apply to companies in which it holds a shareholding that does not give control within the meaning of article L. 233-16 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce).*\n- The following paragraphs present the 2023 duty of care plan.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-135-0\"></span>**2.2. Methodology**\n\nThe duty of care plan is prepared at the level of the Group CSR Department, which is responsible for researching and drawing up the plan, and the analyses and recommendations that must then be applied by the subsidiaries and business lines concerned by the risks identified – notably the Purchasing, QHSE, CSR, Legal Affairs, Human Resources, and Compliance departments. It presents the general system and approach used to establish and strengthen its culture of care, applied daily by its employees. The illustration in operational activities is explained within the risk management frameworks (policy, action plans, highlights, indicators), published in the Group's non-financial performance statement, whose information is verified and audited annually by an independent third party organization. More than a reporting exercise, the Bolloré Group's non‑financial performance statement describes the risks, action plans, measures and indicators put in place to ensure that social and environmental issues are managed.\n\nThe duty of care plan is updated on a regular basis to present the new tools and processes developed to deploy the Group's due diligence approach across all its activities and its value chain.\n\nIt is based on the Group's ethical framework, which is organized around two core documents: the Group's Ethics and CSR Charter and its Code of Conduct as explained in the duty of care plan report below.\n\n- **The Ethics and CSR Charter** lists the Group's commitments in terms of environmental, social and societal responsibility. It forms the basis on which more specific commitments are adapted, formalized by the Group's charters (Human Rights Charter, Diversity and Inclusion Charter, Responsible Purchasing Charter), distributed to all employees and also available online.\n- **The Code of Conduct** applies to all persons acting on behalf of the Bolloré Group, and sets out the expected behaviors, both in day-to-day operations and in sensitive situations. It formalizes recommendations to prevent, identify and report breaches, particularly through the professional whistleblowing system (described below).\n- The ethical framework is based on the following international standards:\n- the United Nations Guiding Principles and the principles of the Global Compact;\n- the OECD Guidelines;\n- the International Charter on Human Rights;\n- the International Labor Organization's core conventions, and;\n- the recommendations of the French Anticorruption Agency.\n\n# **2.2.1. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE GROUP DUTY OF CARE APPROACH**\n\nBecause of the nature and diversity of its geographical locations and of its activities, the Group's approach to duty of care is based on the following principles:\n\n- ensuring the Group and its business relationships comply with the most relevant international standards and local legislation in force, when the latter is more stringent;\n- paying particular attention to its employees, suppliers and subcontractors, notably through duty of care concerning working conditions and high standards of health and safety for all;\n- preserving the environment by measuring the impact of its activities and those of its business relationships as well as setting up actions to protect against and mitigate environmental risks, and;\n- applying particular duty of care to safety conditions and respect for the fundamental rights of the users of the Group's products and services and people living near our sites of activity.\n\n# **2.2.2. IMPLEMENTATION**\n\n# **2.2.2.1. MAPPING OF DUTY OF CARE RISKS**\n\nThe risks identified in 2017 when the Bolloré Group's first duty of care plan was developed were divided into three major families: health and safety risks for the men and women involved in our activities and our value chain, protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, and protecting the\n\n# **DUTY OF CARE PLACED AT THE HEART OF THE GROUP'S CSR STRATEGY**\n\nThese categories, consistent with the requirements detailed by the regulations, were confirmed in 2018, during the Group CSR risk mapping, carried out as part of the implementation of the requirements set out in the non-financial performance report and proposing a more detailed classification (see section 1.1.2. – The Bolloré Group's non-financial risk mapping). Duty of care risks have been incorporated into the Group CSR risk These principles reflect the Bolloré Group's ambition to operate in line with the best international standards and in accordance with its CSR commitments, the aim of which is to guide all employees and business partners around a common set of values. They are adapted through concrete measures, formalized as part of a methodology based on a continuous improvement approach. Moreover, to optimize its approach, the Bolloré Group has identified its priorities for concentrating efforts in terms of action plans, geographical areas and resource allocation. This approach aims to achieve effective and transposable results which can be gradually applied to all of the Group's activities, wherever they are based, and also reinforce its reasonable due diligence processes.\n\nenvironment. Since more than 97% of the Group's revenues represent BtoB services (excluding Communications) and not production activities intended for consumers, the issues of traceability of raw materials appear to be less material for the Bolloré Group.\n\nuniverse, rated by the members of the Executive Committees and representatives of the support and operational functions, placing the duty of care at the heart of the Group's CSR strategy.

Historically focused on 25 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, this area was defined based on representativeness criteria (staff, Group activities) and on the basis of the Human Development Index of the countries concerned.\n\nThis scope is now updated annually using a methodology developed inhouse. It corresponds to the geographical areas where the human rights criticality index, developed using international standards(1), is below the average score of the countries in which the Group operates. In 2023, the priority geographical area was made up of 22 countries (Pakistan, Myanmar, Cambodia, China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Lebanon, India, Thailand, Brunei Darussalam, Qatar, Taiwan, Philippines, Indonesia, Timor-Leste, Fiji, Mexico, Colombia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates), more than half of which are in Asia-Pacific.\n\nImage /page/137/Figure/4 description: This is a world map with some countries colored in blue. The countries colored in blue are Mexico, Brazil, China, India, and Indonesia.\n\n# **2.2.2.2. ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES, MONITORING OF PERFORMANCE AND OF THE MEASURES IMPLEMENTED**\n\nThrough annual non-financial reporting and the monthly QHSE reports within the divisions, more than a hundred indicators of resources and results are monitored, adjusted and enriched each year, with respect to social, environmental, societal and governance issues. Shared and studied internally with a view to constant improvement and performance monitoring, the most relevant data are published in the DPEF, which presents the risk control frameworks (description, policies and action plans implemented, indicators) in detail. The collection process, updated by the integration of additional indicators, is optimized each year. Annual external audits related to the DPEF make it possible to validate the robustness of the data reported, illustrating the proper application of the Group's various risk management frameworks, based in particular on a duty of care cycle approach.\n\n# **IMPLEMENTATION OF DUTY OF CARE CYCLES**\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/9 description: The image shows a circular diagram with four stages. The stages are \"Identification of risks\", \"Action plans\", \"Monitoring and objectives\", and \"Communication of outcomes\". The stages are connected by arrows, indicating a cyclical process.\n\nWhen it built its duty of care mechanism, the Bolloré Group defined a dedicated approach, in order to meet the key issues identified and to offer an appropriate risk control framework. This duty of care cycle approach is based on the four phases of implementing duty of care: identifying the risks, developing associated action plans, monitoring these action plans and setting targets, and reporting the outcomes of the procedures in use. This methodology is reflected in the management of CSR risks presented in the DPEF (description of risks, policies implemented, indicators, etc.).\n\nThe approach ensures at each stage of the cycle that the appropriate choices have been put in place to provide reasonable and effective duty of care over the issues seen as priority issues. The performance evaluation of the measures deployed is coupled with corrective steps as part of continuous improvement.\n\n(1) Average of the benchmark indices: the Human Freedom Index, the UN Human Development Index, the Global Slavery Index, the Global ESG Index, the Global Gender Gap Index and the Global Freedom score from the NGO Freedom House.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nThis method is also meant to make it easier to teach various audiences concerned about the duty of care procedures, involve them, identify improvements and adapt them where appropriate. The Bolloré Group explains this procedure in the report on its duty of care plan below, using various examples.\n\nIn addition, the preparation, implementation and roll-out of its whistleblowing system equip the Group with new tools to manage its duty of care approach and measure the performance of its approach.\n\n# **IMPLEMENTATION OF A WHISTLEBLOWING AND REPORTING SYSTEM**\n\nIn 2018, the Compliance Department, the Human Resources Department and the CSR Department collaborated on revising the existing whistleblowing system, which now addresses in one place both the issues of corruption and influence-peddling, and those of duty of care, which have been defined and detailed. Since the Sapin II law requires an alert system similar to that required by the duty of care law, both systems were developed on the same platform as a way to pool them and to comply with the requirement of the AFA and the Cnil.\n\nThis alert system has been the subject of consultations with the employee representative bodies to adapt to the Cnil reference standard relating to the processing of personal data intended for the implementation of a professional whistleblowing alerts system.\n\nIts deployment and the processes for collecting and handling alerts are explained in the alert procedure, available on the Group's website.\n\nWhistleblowers' alerts are processed at the head office level and overseen by the Chair of the Ethics – CSR and Anticorruption Committee, which carries out its mission independently. The whistleblowing system is open to everyone: the mechanism allows any employee of Bolloré Group or its commercial partner or any person whose interests are likely to be affected by the Group's activity, to issue an alert regarding any crime or offense, a serious and clear breach of the law or regulations, threat to the general interest or acts which go against the Group's Code of Conduct. As such, the Group's alert and reporting platform can be used for alerts relating to violations or risks of violations of human rights, fundamental freedoms, personal health and safety or the environment.\n\nAlerts issued using the whistleblowing mechanism are screened for admissibility by dedicated contacts, depending on the nature of the alert. Where applicable, the alerts will be investigated in order to establish, within a reasonable time-frame, the materiality of the facts in question.\n\nIf an investigation makes it possible to establish the materiality of a reported breach and the involvement of the alleged perpetrators, disciplinary sanctions and/or legal proceedings are taken against the person(s) in question. The Bolloré Group guarantees confidential processing (see section 1.2.2.1. – Sharing the same business ethics and ensuring compliance with the strictest standards).\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-139-0\"></span>**2.3.

This infographic aims to represent the continuous improvement of the Bolloré Group's duty of care approach in a concise manner. The policies, action plans and indicators used to measure the performance of CSR risk management, particularly in terms of protecting the environment, health and safety of persons, and respect for human rights, are explained and developed in the Group's non-financial performance statement, in accordance with the risk pooling approach.\n\n# **2.3.2. DUTY OF CARE APPROACH ON HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES WITHIN OUR ACTIVITIES**\n\n# **2.3.2.1. HUMAN RIGHTS RISK MAPPING**\n\nThe human rights risk mapping is determined on the basis of the duty of care priority geographical area and pertains to transport and logistics entities located in countries where the criticality index is lower than the average of the countries in which the Group operates. These issues were not deemed major for the activities of the Industry and Oil logistics divisions (see section 2.2.2.1. – Duty of care risk mapping, \"Pooling of DPEF and duty of care risks, cross-reference table\" paragraph).\n\nAs the Bolloré Group sold all its activities on the African continent in December 2022, the human rights priority scope has refocused on freight forwarding activities in the Asia region. In 2023, of the 76 Bolloré Logistics entities, 31 entities were identified within the 22 countries comprising the duty of care priority geographical area (see section 2.2.2.1. – Mapping of duty of care risks, \"Defining a priority geographic area\" paragraph).\n\n# **2.3.2.2. FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF WORKERS**\n\nThe Group is focusing its efforts on the implementation and deployment of measures that enable it to exercise reasonable duty of care with regard to the employees of its suppliers and subcontractors, in line with the measures\n\n# **HEALTH AND SAFETY**\n\nThe Bolloré Group's divisions and subsidiaries have health and safety policies that apply to all people working on the sites and which govern workers' activities based on risk mapping. They ensure the best standards are applied to guarantee a safe working environment and prevent accidents After identifying the human rights priority scope, specific actions were implemented to address the issues identified, in particular the need to: • increase awareness in certain regions;\n\n- strengthen the indicators which illustrate the Group's management of\n- these issues (see section 2.3.5. Table of duty of care indicators), and; • identify long-term projects to tackle specific issues (see section 2.3.4.1.\n\n– \"Working conditions\" duty of care cycle). Reporting on duty of care indicators within this scope continued in 2023, but the scope will change in 2024 with the sale of Bolloré Logistics activities. In the last quarter of 2023, work to update the scope and methodology for mapping human rights issues was organized as part of workshops dedicated to anticipating the requirements of new European directives, and will be continued in 2024.\n\nin place for its own employees. The commitments relating to respect for workers' rights are expressed in the ethical framework (see section 2.2. – Methodology) and are built in particular on the following tenets.\n\nby taking the specificities of each job into account to propose appropriate actions (see section 1.2.1. – Uniting and protecting people, the company's\nrequests for external audits – usually at the request of customers. With greatest strength).\n\n# **COMPENSATION**\n\nThe Bolloré Group's divisions and subsidiaries have compensation policies that respect local minimum wage legislation. The regularity of compensation payments may be an important issue for employees in some countries and subsidiaries ensure that a salary corresponding to the number of hours actually worked is paid regularly. However, the Group has identified the payment of a living wage (which can be defined as the amount that enables a worker and his or her family to live in dignity) as a duty of care priority. The issue of living wages goes beyond mere compliance with a legal minimum wage: indeed, in some countries, the legal wage does not necessarily cover basic needs. Thus, a project devoted to living wages was deployed in 2023 at entities within the priority scope, by the Group Human Resources Department in collaboration with the Group CSR Department and the network of human rights officers (see the \"Deployment of a long-term project on living wages\" paragraph in section 1.2.2.2.2. – Respect for workers' rights throughout the value chain).\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **WORK TIME AND PAID LEAVE**\n\nThe Bolloré Group and its subsidiaries undertake to comply with local laws, and implement systems and measures to ensure the management of working hours and paid leave (remuneration of overtime, work, respect of break times, weekly rest days, granting of parental leave, etc.). The Human Rights Steering Committee has identified these issues, which are explained in the by-laws and the collective bargaining agreements on the different sites, as priority targets for special duty of care effort within the duty of care priority scope and will be subject to dedicated audits, among other measures.\n\nTo this end, in 2023, this topic was specifically monitored as part of the internal audits carried out within the human rights priority scope in Asia-Pacific and various actions were taken to improve the monitoring of working hours, particularly the hours worked by direct employees and subcontractors (see section 2.3.4.1. – \"Working conditions\" duty of care cycle).\n\n# **EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION**\n\nIn addition to complying with local regulations on freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining in the countries where it operates, the Bolloré Group and its subsidiaries are committed to promoting an ongoing, highquality dialog with employees. If legislation is restrictive in this area, the Group\n\n# **THE FIGHT AGAINST FORCED LABOR**\n\nAs regards forced labor, in addition to the actions described in the \"Working hours and paid leave\" paragraph, the Group has noted that using employment agencies could be a risk factor in certain regions within the priority scope. Therefore, it has taken actions to specifically address the risks associated with indirect employees, and migrant workers in particular. For example, in 2023 local HR teams in the Asia-Pacific region worked with the employment agencies that had been identified as having the potential to use\n\n# **THE FIGHT AGAINST THE EMPLOYMENT OF UNDERAGE WORKERS**\n\nAs regards child labor, to address the issues arising from the various legislative, economic and social contexts of the countries in which it operates, the Group prohibits any use of child labor.\n\nIn 2023, the internal human rights audit procedure, which is described in the \"working conditions\" duty of care cycle, highlighted and reiterated the importance and robustness of existing HR processes.\n\nIn addition, through its sponsorship actions, the Group supports various associations and involves its subsidiaries and employees in projects that improve the economic and social situation of young people, thereby increasing access to education – an essential link in the fight against child labor. The company's contribution to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including access to education and training (SDG no. 4), forms the foundation of the Earthtalent by Bolloré action program.\n\nThough the Earthtalent by Bolloré solidarity program, the Group supported around 100 projects advancing education in 2023.\n\nThese projects include the Solucham association, which promotes education and health in the Solukhumbu region of Nepal. Bolloré Logistics helped\n\n# **THE FIGHT AGAINST ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION(1)**\n\nThe Bolloré Group prohibits any discrimination against workers on grounds such as ethnicity, sex, religion, political opinion, sexual orientation and national or social origin. The Group's entities are deploying various local initiatives to promote inclusion.\n\nIn particular, professional gender equality is seen as a lever for transformation, with a potential to bring people together that is common to all the Group's divisions.\n\n- **Development of a dedicated tool:** to disseminate best practices and ensure compliance with the principles of diversity and inclusion, the Group developed a special tool that comprises all internal processes and guidelines, as well as the Group charters. Launched in the first half of 2021, this tool is now intended for the entire HR network and will enable the relaying and proper appropriation of Group commitments and processes to be improved.\n- **Roll-out of a diversity awareness campaign:** the fight against discrimination relies, in particular, on raising awareness among all employees. A diversity e-learning curriculum, with several modules on the various topics,\n\nundertakes to facilitate employee expression and to guarantee that workers involved in representative structures are not discriminated against (see section 1.2.1.2.2. – Promoting social dialog and quality working conditions).\n\nforeign workers, so the agencies could provide more guarantees regarding the conditions of recruitment, accommodation, etc.\n\nFurthermore, the internal human rights audit approach deployed in 2023 within the priority scope in Asia-Pacific, did not identify any non-compliance on this point in the targeted countries. Nevertheless, preventive actions have been taken to update local HR processes and practices. These actions are detailed in the \"working conditions\" duty of care cycle.\n\nfinance the construction of a vocational training center to enable local young people to gain technical and practical skills to find a job locally and avoid having to leave their region. Various associations in India have also received support for their actions in favor of education:\n\n- for example, Jagriti A Pioneering Society provides vulnerable young women with housing, medical care and access to education, and;\n- the Thoughtshop Foundation is creating new means of communication to address societal issues. In particular, the organization works to prevent underage Indian girls from marrying by developing communication strategies and participatory tools for local communities.\n\nFurthermore, for the past five years, Bolloré Asia-Pacific Corporate has helped fund the French organization Passerelles numériques, amounting to more than 400,000 euros in total support. With a presence in Cambodia, the Philippines and Vietnam, the association's mission is to give talented but disadvantaged young people access to education and technical and vocational training in the digital sector.\n\nhas been deployed to HR employees, all managers and executive teams. Work was undertaken in 2022 to update these modules as part of a new awareness campaign. This effort continued in 2023 and led to the launch of a new campaign coinciding with International Women's Day on March 8. At the end of the campaign, 84% of employees had been made aware of diversity issues.\n\nIn addition to the measures taken to promote gender equality, a project dedicated to inclusion for people with disabilities was also launched in 2023. It resulted in the creation of a network of disability officers in France and in all the BUs of the Bretagne, Systems and telecoms, Transportation and logistics divisions. This network, comprising 12 employees, works through the HR reporting lines and organization to carry out specific actions.\n\nIn addition, since 2021 IER has partnered with an Esat (\"labor assistance establishments and services\") to welcome workers with disabilities as part of a service program to offer suitable professional employment in an ordinary setting.\n\n(1) In accordance with the commitments set out in the Diversity and Inclusion Charter published in 2018 (see section 1.2.1.2. – Being an attractive employer).\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **2.3.3. DUTY OF CARE POLICY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN**\n\nThe Group launched a first project to identify the social, human and environmental risks and issues associated with its procurement activities in 2018. This approach, presented in the duty of care plan reports of previous years, has made it possible to draw up an overview of the tools and processes used in the selection phase of service providers, suppliers and subcontractors, according to the Group's different purchasing families. The approach resulted in an initial campaign to raise awareness on the issues surrounding duty of care among buyers, and notably led to the appointment of CSR and ethics representatives in the main purchase families. Workshops are organized regularly in order to assess the existing situation, optimize the development and proper appropriation of new processes and tools, train and raise the awareness of the teams on the issues of duty of care and the Group's CSR strategy.\n\n# **2.3.3.1. STRUCTURING OF THE DUTY OF CARE APPROACH WITHIN THE BOLLORÉ GROUP PURCHASING DEPARTMENT**\n\nIn accordance with the commitments expressed in the last duty of care plan, the CSR Department has organized a project to formalize its \"duty of care purchasing\" approach, jointly with the Group Compliance and Legal departments. This duty of care approach consists of three concrete actions: the publication of the Group Responsible Purchasing Charter, the definition of a CSR clause, and the refinement of the duty of care risk mapping within the supply chain.\n\n# **THE GROUP RESPONSIBLE PURCHASING CHARTER**\n\nDeveloped and signed by the Group Purchasing director, the Responsible Purchasing Charter forms the basis of the duty of care approach to be rolled out across the supply chain. This charter is part of the Group's ethics system and defines:\n\n- principles designed to ensure ethical and lasting commercial relations with subcontractors and suppliers of goods and services; and\n- the Group's various commitments to its business partners. This dual commitment reflects the Group's desire to make every effort to prevent and reduce risks in its value chain through a process of dialog, reciprocity\n\nand support with its suppliers and subcontractors. Available on the website in English, French, Spanish and Italian, this charter is systematically shared when the Group forms new business relationships.\n\nEfforts continued in 2023 to communicate CSR commitments, which were also sent to all existing core suppliers.\n\n2023 dissemination indicators:\n\nintegrating the CSR clause.\n\n• the Responsible Purchasing Charter was sent to 100% of the supplier base as well as 100% of new suppliers, managed centrally;\n\nresulting in the development of guidelines to support the negotiating in\n\nIn 2023, nearly 100% of core suppliers (suppliers managed by the Purchasing Department at the head office level) signed our compliance and CSR clauses. The Group uses a dedicated document management solution to target suppliers with which the business relationship is not formalized in a contract. This solution, which is used for listing purposes, facilitates the management of all documents relating to purchasing processes and the transmission of specific conditions that incorporate aspects of the compliance and CSR clauses for this category of suppliers. In 2022, the tool was deployed to all central purchasing, excluding road freight purchases, and to production purchases related to battery activities, improving the\n\n• 99% of the charters sent out were returned signed.\n\nreliability and monitoring of purchasing indicators.\n\n# **DEPLOYMENT OF THE CSR CLAUSE**\n\nWith a view to favoring business partners that respect its principles, the Group CSR Department has drawn up a CSR clause in collaboration with the Group Legal, Purchasing and Compliance departments. This clause aims to anchor the importance of the commitments described in the ethical system in the contractualization processes.\n\nWhile the purpose of these documents is to establish a common foundation, adapted to the Group's business lines, subsidiaries and locations, the Group Purchasing Department has developed procedures, listing processes and dedicated tools adapted to the organization of its different purchasing families.\n\nWhen contracting with new suppliers, our commitments (charters, etc.) and CSR clauses are systematically discussed and integrated into the processes. To achieve the smoothest and most efficient implementation of the Group's commitments, projects were carried out in collaboration with the purchasing teams and in-house lawyers to ensure that these tools are used properly,\n\n# **GROUP PURCHASING RISK MAPPING**\n\nSince 2017, the Compliance Department has been working on the implementation of a dedicated methodology for mapping corruption risks in the supply chain. The policy for assessing the integrity of suppliers and subcontractors was formalized and implemented in 2021, then updated in September 2022. It is now known as the \"compliance procedure\". The procedure describes the processes for evaluating the specific risk caused by the existing or potential relationship with a given supplier or subcontractor, for the scope of transport and logistics activities initially. It provides for classification into four types of risk: minor, moderate, high and major, and details the actions and procedures to be applied.\n\nWhile it focuses specifically on responding to corruption issues, it is a shared approach under the aegis of ethics and human rights. As it can lead to circumvention of or disregard for laws and regulations protecting social or environmental rights, corruption can have a significant impact on people's ability to exercise their fundamental rights. This is how combating\n\ncorruption helps to safeguard human rights. With a view to optimizing and aligning with existing methodologies, responsible purchasing procedures are being formalized and adapted on the basis of this compliance procedure. This work is already complete for non-production purchases.\n\nIt should be noted that work to refine the purchasing risk map will be carried out in 2024 when the scope of the Group's activities has stabilized following on the significant disposals of Bolloré Africa Logistics and Bolloré Logistics. These efforts will be especially focused on the methodologies required by the new European regulations. Some workshops and projects already took place at the end of 2023 to involve the various governance bodies and support functions such as Human Resources, Legal and Purchasing, to lay the groundwork for the dual materiality analysis. This work will continue in 2024.\n\n# **2.3.3.2. REPORT ON THE DUTY OF CARE APPROACH WITHIN THE GROUP SUPPLY CHAIN**\n\nWhile adhering to Group values and the commitments in its ethical policy is an essential condition for the selection of a partner, the organizational specificities of the various families of Group purchases mean that priority risks must be identified according to the categories and subcategories of purchases and by region, and that appropriate procedures must be deployed. The Group Purchasing Department is divided into four large families of purchases: general or non-production purchases, purchases relating to freight – specific to freight forwarding activities –, building and infrastructure purchases, and purchases of items necessary for operating activities.\n\n2023 Annual report – Compagnie de l'Odet\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **NON-PRODUCTION PURCHASES**\n\n# Scope\n\nThis category refers to supplies used for the company's daily operations not including production activities. The Non-Production Purchasing Department manages the entire Bolloré scope, including Vivendi, in a centralized manner, from head office.\n\n# Subcategories\n\nDigital Infra and Applications, service and facilities, Mobility (vehicles, business travel, telephony), and MICE (meeting, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions).\n\n# Risks\n\nThis category refers to several products and services, which may be associated with significant duty of care issues. For example, purchases relating to travel and vehicle rentals have an environmental impact associated with the issues of greenhouse gas emissions and purchases of services (cleaning, catering or security) may be related to social and human rights issues depending on the geographic area.\n\n# Specific duty of care processes\n\nThe non-production purchasing category is covered by a responsible purchasing policy that describes the CSR and duty of care monitoring processes to be deployed according to the risks identified. Criteria taking CSR and human rights into account are included in an ethics duty of care questionnaire for the Group's suppliers, subcontractors and intermediaries. It is sent prior to the business relationship and consists of some 20 questions (e.g., minimum contractual age for employment, how minimum wages and weekly hours of work are set, the existence of an environmental management system, health and safety, criteria for selecting suppliers, etc.). The analysis of the answers includes a screening identifying any CSR-type controversies that may arise with each company. The questionnaire is sent in priority to suppliers identified as being the most risky according to the mapping chosen.\n\n# Actions carried out in 2023\n\n- Identification and listing of strategic suppliers on the EcoVadis assessment platform:\n- 87% of listed strategic suppliers were assessed;\n\n# Indicators\n\n- 64% of the strategic suppliers assessed have a rating above 64/100 (a rating of 65/100 corresponding to an advanced level of performance);\n- suppliers with a rating of less than 45 are sent a CAP (corrective action plan): in 2023, five strategic suppliers were contacted as part of this improvement process;\n- in 2023, four strategic suppliers did not wish to submit to the EcoVadis assessment.\n- Increased inclusion of the CSR clause in non-production purchasing processes: the Responsible Purchasing Department trains teams in applying the procedure for onboarding new suppliers, which calls for the signature of charters and the systematic inclusion of clauses. In 2023, 91% of central suppliers in the non-production purchasing category included the CSR clause, compared with 80% in 2022.\n- Integration of CSR performance indicators during the annual assessments of buyers.\n- 87% of suppliers returned the signed Responsible Purchasing Charter and 87% of strategic suppliers underwent a CSR assessment.\n- Development and deployment of a CSR questionnaire, incorporating the inclusive, social, carbon impact and supply chain purchasing components that are specific to temporary employment agencies.

The panel of suppliers was given specific areas for improvement on compliance and human rights points. For each of these issues, the resources and standards available to strengthen their actions in these areas were highlighted.\n\n| (as a percentage)                                                                                   | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Percentage of employees in the general purchasing team who have followed the human rights module    | 91   | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of employees in the general purchasing team who have followed the Code of Conduct module | 91   | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of suppliers who received the compliance pack (charters + Code of Conduct)               | 100  | 99   | 100  |\n| Percentage of suppliers who have returned the signed Purchasing Charter                             | 87   | 86   | 73   |\n| Percentage of suppliers whose contract includes the CSR and compliance clause(1)                    | 91   | 80   | 47   |\n| Percentage of strategic suppliers who have undergone an EcoVadis assessment                         | 87   | 84   | 82   |\n| Percentage of suppliers who have received a corrective action plan from among the identified panel  | 100  | 75   | 50   |\n\n(1) This indicator includes suppliers with a non-contractual relationship but formalized by specific processes such as Mutual Recognition Agreements, including the commitments explained in the clauses.\n\n# **FREIGHT PURCHASES**\n\n# Scope\n\nThis category relates to the selection of freight solutions and services and therefore specifically concerns the freight forwarding activities of Bolloré Logistics, a business line that has been sold as of the date of publication of this document.\n\n# Subcategories\n\nSea, air and road transport.\n\n# Risks\n\nWith regard to sea and air freight, the Group deals for the most part with a panel of identified partners, within the framework of comprehensive contracts with several clauses on ethical and CSR matters. With regard to road transport, many regions – including sub-Saharan Africa – have limited infrastructure. This is why road transport purchases have specific issues (more limited choice of suppliers, need to train subcontractor drivers on Group health and safety standards, significant number of partners with extremely varied profiles depending on regions, listing difficulties, etc.).\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Specific duty of care processes\n\nIntroduction of a due diligence procedure (including the provisions of the Sapin II law and the duty of care law) for major suppliers in the sea and air transport sector: mandatory commitment of compliance with documents setting out Group ethical provisions and quarterly (or monthly for suppliers carrying major risks) business reviews which include contractual environmental requirements. A CSR questionnaire has also been developed specifically for the freight forwarding activities, including environmental criteria. This questionnaire is sent out every year, and the results factor into the supplier's overall rating. With regard to road transport providers, the teams use dedicated solution to list all the providers; the tool includes a questionnaire with sections on ethics, sustainable development and QHSE, and requires the submission of documentary evidence. Once compliance is confirmed, a local or country road representative called a \"transport road manager\" validates the carrier's listing. Since the end of 2018, 100% of active road carriers have been listed. In addition to listing via the dedicated solution, each year the QHSE departments of the various countries carry out face-to-face audits of a selection of road carriers with a special focus on regulatory compliance, health and safety.\n\n# Actions in 2023\n\n- 100% of freight (sea, air, road) is subject to full compliance listing.\n- Development of a sustainable offer for sea freight purchasing: ongoing expansion of the sustainable offer with an emphasis on promoting alternative fuels in 2023.\n- Strengthening of the SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) offer for air freight purchases: this process was verified and validated by an independent third party in 2022 and will undergo another audit in the first quarter of 2024.\n- Increased weighting of CSR criteria in the selection questionnaires sent to suppliers.\n- Development of a multimodal offer in France: in 2022, a tool was developed to facilitate the use of rail or barge transport by freight forwarders.\n- Inclusion of all global freight purchasing teams in the B'Sustainable challenge organized by Bolloré Logistics' CSR Department. This challenge, which originally targeted the sales teams, aims to make the sales staff more knowledgeable and skilled on sustainable supply chain offers.\n\n# Indicators\n\n| (as a percentage)                                                                                   | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Percentage of employees in the freight purchasing team who have followed the human rights module    | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of employees in the freight purchasing team who have followed the Code of Conduct module | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of suppliers who received the compliance pack (charters + Code of Conduct)               | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of suppliers who have returned the signed Purchasing Charter                             | 100  | 100  | 45   |\n| Percentage of suppliers whose contract includes the CSR and compliance clause(1)                    | 100  | 100  | 87   |\n\n(1) This indicator includes suppliers with a non-contractual relationship but formalized by specific processes such as Mutual Recognition Agreements, including the commitments explained in the clauses.\n\n# **INFRASTRUCTURE AND BUILDING PURCHASES**\n\n# Scope\n\nThis category is managed centrally for the whole Group for large and/or complex projects involving significant amounts (over 300,000 euros). Smaller projects are managed by teams locally.\n\n# Risks\n\nWhile purchases can sometimes make up a very significant volume within the context of new project launches, the share of this purchasing category in relation to the overall amount is not constant. In addition to the environmental impacts associated with construction projects, there must be specific duty of care for certain geographic areas since services linked to works can, in certain areas, present risks in the area of safety, working conditions and accommodation. In particular, construction projects can involve a lot of labor, local or foreign workers working in health, economic, infrastructure or cultural contexts that may vary considerably from one territory to another.\n\n# Specific duty of care processes\n\nIn addition to appending the traditional codes of conduct and QHSE requirements, most major construction contracts (Fidic type contracts) in and out of France already include duty of care components. Thus, the subcontracting contracts include requirements on the treatment of personnel relating to: AIDS prevention, respecting the rights of foreign workers, measures against insects and pests, prohibition of alcohol, drugs, weapons and ammunition, respect for local religious customs, access to suitable food and water for workers, the terms of payment for funerals in the event of fatal accidents, the prohibition of forced labor and child labor, non-discrimination and equal opportunities, representation of employees and trade unions, etc. In addition, depending on the issues identified, socio-environment al impact studies are carried out upstream of the projects, enabling a review of related topics (the environment, biodiversity, impact on the local economy, etc.).\n\n# Indicators\n\n| (as a percentage)                                                                                                             | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Percentage of employees in the infrastructure and real estate purchasing team who have followed<br>the human rights module    | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of employees in the infrastructure and real estate purchasing team who have followed<br>the Code of Conduct module | 83   | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of suppliers that have received the compliance pack (charters + Code of Conduct)                                   | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of suppliers that have returned the signed Purchasing Charter                                                      | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of suppliers whose contract includes the CSR and compliance clause(1)                                              | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n\n(1) This indicator includes suppliers with a non-contractual relationship but formalized by specific processes such as Mutual Recognition Agreements, including the commitments explained in the clauses.\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **INDUSTRIAL PURCHASES**\n\n# Scope\n\nThis category relates specifically to Industry activities, including the manufacture of batteries and the development of electricity storage and systems solutions at the Blue and Systems subsidiaries.\n\n# Risks\n\nIn terms of the safety of users of Blue Solutions products, particularly regarding the use of the LMP® battery, Blue Solutions is the only company to master \"all solid\" technology for battery manufacturing, which has the advantage of avoiding the environmental risks associated with the release of hazardous liquids, or the formation of explosive atmospheres in confined environments. Its batteries are exempt from SVHC (Substance of Very High Concern) provisions according to REACH regulations and CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction) according to CLP regulations, and also contain neither cobalt, nor nickel or any of the minerals targeted by the European regulation.\n\n# Specific duty of care processes\n\nIn the Industry division, Blue Solutions has created a document listing sustainable development requirements for suppliers, notably including specific human rights issues (in particular forced and child labor). CSR criteria are incorporated prior to the selection of new suppliers selling to Blue, whose purchasing policy includes environmental criteria.\n\nIn accordance with the commitments formalized in the Group's ethical measures and responsible purchasing approach, the battery production\n\n# Indicators\\*\n\n| (as a percentage)                                                                                      | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Percentage of employees in the industrial purchasing team who have followed the human rights module    | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of employees in the industrial purchasing team who have followed the Code of Conduct module | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of suppliers that have received the compliance pack (charters + Code of Conduct)            | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of suppliers that have returned the signed Purchasing Charter                               | 82   | 96   | 82   |\n| Percentage of suppliers whose contract includes the CSR and compliance clause(1)                       | 79   | 97   | 62   |\n\n(1) This indicator includes suppliers with a non-contractual relationship but formalized by specific processes such as Mutual Recognition Agreements, including the commitments explained in the clauses.\n\n\\* Indicator monitoring to be implemented for suppliers in the Industry sector.\n\n# **2.3.3.3. OBJECTIVES**\n\n# **OBJECTIVES SET IN 2022**\n\n# Overall objectives\n\n- Increase the inclusion rate of CSR clauses and the return of the signed Responsible Purchasing Charter:\n- target achieved: the Responsible Purchasing Charter is sent to all new suppliers. The inclusion of the Group CSR clause is part of the processes and is systematically negotiated with suppliers. In 2023, 99% of new contractual relationships included the CSR clause. The goal of the Responsible Purchasing Department is to maintain and sustain these results and to ensure compliance with the processes in place for all new suppliers.\n- Ensure that 100% of new arrivals in purchasing teams complete the human rights awareness module:\n- target partially achieved and carried over to 2024.\n- Finalize the purchasing risk map in order to propose action plans dedicated to the issues identified in the different families, prioritizing categories of suppliers and subcontractors:\n- target not achieved and carried over to 2024: the Group's suppliers and subcontractors are nevertheless subject to ethics and anticorruption risk mapping. In addition, non-production suppliers are subject to CSR analysis through the EcoVadis assessment. It should be noted that the Group's risk map, incorporating the value chain, will be revised in 2024 in line with the methodologies required by European CSRD regulations.\n\n# On non-production purchases\n\ncriteria to the selection of a supplier.\n\n• Team training and raising awareness.\n\nassessment questionnaires).\n\nActions in 2023\n\n• Achieve and exceed an 85% assessment rate on EcoVadis: for listed strategic suppliers:\n\nactivity is subject to a specific duty of care process for the supply of lithium in particular. The accreditation process for selecting lithium suppliers is structured in several stages, which can take up to two years. Suppliers must complete several questionnaires, comprising non-financial aspects (human rights, environment, ethics, health and safety). Blue Solutions is sourcing from one of the market leaders, whose processing sites are certified ISO 14001, ISO 45001 and ISO 9001, and which guarantees the traceability of minerals (mostly from Australia). In addition, human and environmental rights criteria are incorporated as part of the IATF 16949 certification. It should be noted, however, that implementing measures of reasonable duty of care may be challenging given the circumstances in certain regions. It is not unusual that certain suppliers or service providers have no competitors in the local, regional or even national market, as for example in the case of railway construction or the procurement of oils. Thus, the Group's entities may have very restricted influence or latitude in applying CSR\n\n• Organization of working meetings to determine industrial purchasing subcategories and refine risk mapping: work continues to establish due diligence procedures specific to the procurement of raw materials for battery activities (including the formalization of specific supplier\n\n- target achieved, with 87% of listed strategic suppliers in 2023. • Continue efforts to achieve a return rate of 80% for the Responsible\n- Purchasing Charter for strategic suppliers assessed on EcoVadis: – target achieved.\n\n# On production purchases\n\n- Formalize a specific duty of care approach on raw materials sourcing: – target achieved: the procedure carried out is currently being validated.\n- Roll out the document collection platform tool within the scope of production purchases: – target achieved.\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **2.3.4. APPROACH BY DUTY OF CARE CYCLE**\n\nThe duty of care cycle approach (see section 2.2. – Methodology) explains the methodology used by employees to manage the risks identified. It is used to illustrate the Group's approach through various concrete and relevant examples in terms of cross-business issues (environment, social and human rights, health and safety).\n\n# **2.3.4.1. \"WORKING CONDITIONS\" DUTY OF CARE CYCLE**\n\n# **IDENTIFICATION OF RISK**\n\n**Activities:** all Bolloré Group logistics and industrial business lines and activities.\n\n**Identified countries:** entities in the human rights priority scope (see section 2.3.3.1. – Structuring of the duty of care approach within the Bolloré Group Purchasing Department).\n\n**Risks:** due to its robust international presence and the diversity of its locations, the Group employs many people, directly and indirectly, in myriad institutional contexts and in regions where the risks of failing to provide safe and decent working conditions may be amplified by the absence or\n\n# **TREATMENT OF RISK**\n\n**Governance:** these risks are handled at various levels of governance, at the head office and within the entities by the Executive management and the support functions directly concerned, under the coordination and supervision of the HR and CSR departments, in particular by:\n\n- the Executive Committee;\n- the Risk Committee; • the Ethics and CSR Committee;\n- \n- the HR Committee;\n- bimonthly Human Rights Steering Committee meetings that bring together the Group Human Resources Department, the Group CSR Department, the Bolloré Logistics CSR Department and, depending on identified needs, the Compliance Department, the Purchasing Department and the Legal Department.\n\nFor more information on these governance bodies, see section 1.1.3. – CSR governance.\n\n# **Special duty of care tools and processes**\n\n# Creation of a network of human rights officers\n\nThe appointment of human rights officers was decided by the Steering Committee in 2022. In accordance with the commitments announced, the network was finalized in 2023 and 38 officers were chosen among the employees of the local Human Resources departments at all the divisions. Working through the HR reporting lines and organization, these officers act as liaisons to identify and report alerts and high-risk situations relating to operational working conditions, and to execute the action plans drawn up at the head office. They are also responsible for ensuring the application of the Group's social and human rights commitments, as defined in the ethical measures (Group Code of Conduct, Ethics and CSR Charter, Responsible Purchasing Charter, Human Rights Charter, Diversity and Inclusion Charter). The officers may also be required to act as liaisons and coordinators during human rights audits and to conduct internal assessments.\n\n# Deployment of a training campaign for the network of human rights officers in 2023\n\nSeveral workshops and webinars were set up to raise awareness among all officers from the Asia, Pacific and Middle East regions.\n\nThe system was supplemented by the launch of a training campaign on new labor compliance standards. In 2023, this training focused on adopting an internal audit methodology was deployed on site in seven countries (Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore). As a result, the local teams were trained in a human rights self-assessment methodology, and learned how to convey these standards to employment agencies, subcontractors and other suppliers.\n\nweakness of local regulatory frameworks. The priority scope was determined, in particular, by analyzing these factors. Indeed, depending on local regulations and organizations, the lack of supervision or monitoring of HR process implementation could lead to risks of poor tracking of overtime, especially for subcontractors. It is important to ensure that all entities, and more specifically the entities in the priority scope, organize special duty of care measures to address these issues, apply national regulations and internal standards, and ensure that workers are paid a wage that enables them to meet their basic needs and compensates them for the hours worked.\n\n# Deployment of a living wage project in 2023\n\n- In line with the commitments made in 2022, the Steering Committee approved the launch of a pilot project to address living wages. The project was implemented in 2023 to explore and expand the Group's requirements on certain social issues. Because earning a living wage is a catalyst for lifting people out of poverty and promoting human rights, it is a key priority among the Group's CSR commitments. For this initial exercise, the study focused exclusively on direct employees from a selection of 10 countries(1) in the human rights priority scope, taking into account the unique characteristics of regional economic contexts. The study took as its starting point the salary earned for full-time equivalent working hours (excluding part-time work and overtime), and was carried out by the Group Human Resources teams and the network of human rights officers with support from an expert consulting firm, using benchmark criteria aligned with the Anker methodology, or provided by the Wage Indicator Foundation or the Fair Wage Network.\n- The project relied on the following definition: a living wage is a wage that allows workers to meet their basic needs and those of their families, and to have discretionary income to deal with other expenses. It takes into account factors such as the cost of housing, health care, education and other basic needs. A living wage is often higher than the legal minimum wage and reflects the cost of living in a given place. It should be noted that the study excluded employee benefits such as annual leave, perks for personal events such as marriage or religious holidays, and non-contractual bonuses (e.g., seniority and performance bonuses). These factors were not included in the calculation of living wages, even though they are often an important source of income.\n- This understanding of the various thresholds acquired by applying the Anker methodology will enable Bolloré Logistics to launch an initiative within the Human Resources Department in 2024 to work on the compensation structure for 146 employees identified during this pilot project.\n\nFor more information, see the \"Deployment of a long-term project on living wages\" paragraph in section 1.2.2.2.2. – Respect for workers' rights throughout the value chain.\n\n(1) Cambodia, China, Qatar, Malaysia, Indonesia, United Arab Emirates, Mexico, Vietnam, Philippines, Singapore.\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Continuation of the corrective actions implemented as a result of audits carried out in 2022\n\nIn 2023, following on the audits conducted last year at industrial sites in Malaysia, actions were taken to specifically target the risks associated with the monitoring of hours worked and the risks associated with migrant workers:\n\n- issues relating to the management of working time, overtime and rest time were analyzed in an in-depth study that mapped and inventoried laws and practices for all the entities in the priority scope;\n- smart biometric systems have been put in place to replace the physical time-clock machines used by local employment agencies, which improves the monitoring of hours worked by subcontractors, who are now integrated into the automated HR payroll information system. These measures were put in place after educating and collaborating with local employment agencies, and make the monitoring and control of working hours and remuneration more reliable;\n- to address the issues around migrant workers, as part of their discussions and work with employment agencies, local and regional HR teams in the Asia-Pacific region first identified branches that may use foreign workers, then began negotiating to validate the guarantees provided in connection to hiring and accommodation conditions. In particular, a team organized a trip to Nepal, which is a country of origin for many foreign workers employed by certain service providers. The team conducted an in-depth due diligence initiative and deployed risk prevention measures (e.g., verification of contracts, verification of hiring procedures, verification that the agency charges no upstream fees, confirmation that the terms of the contract are written in a language understood by the worker, etc.).\n\nFurthermore, the Steering Committee also deployed a central monitoring tool in 2023 to oversee the corrective action plans implemented when non-conformities are identified during audits:\n\n- the Steering Committee introduced a protocol to manage alerts and • duty of care policy in the supply chain; support from the Executive management of Bolloré Logistics, and the Group CSR and Human Resources departments, this protocol was rolled out to all internal stakeholders, including the network of human rights officers;\n- the goal is to be able to centralize all information about social audits completed, scheduled and in progress, and to assist the local teams with managing these audits and taking any corrective actions required;\n- in 2023, operational sites in Malaysia, Vietnam, France and Germany received support with external audits required by strategic clients.\n\n# Strengthening of internal auditing methodology in 2023\n\nVarious assessments and surveys were carried out internally, with a special emphasis on the priority issues identified, such as compensation and the tracking of working time, based on a special questionnaire that was created as part of the self-assessment methodology development process.\n\nThe team in charge of social issues and human rights at the Human Resources Department provided on-site training to local staff so they could use the questionnaire to conduct formal internal controls and self-assessments of their activities. In 2023, 16 self-assessments took place in several countries within the priority scope – in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore. Where applicable, these analyses included the employees of subcontracting companies present at the sites.\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **2.3.5. TABLE OF DUTY OF CARE INDICATORS**\n\nThe data presented in the table are intended to illustrate the results obtained by the Group's due diligence approach for the Transportation and logistics, excluding Bolloré Energy, as well as in the priority geographical area identified (see section 2.2. – Methodology). These data serve to guide the choices of action plans to be implemented.\n\n• Group scope: 125 entities (including four incoming and two outgoing entities) in 41 countries, with a workforce of 18,329

id=\"page-151-0\"></span>**1. Risk factors**\n\nThe Group periodically evaluates and reviews the risk factors that might have a negative impact on its operations or its financial performance. This review is presented to the Risk Committee. In addition, several factors unique to the Bolloré Group and its strategy, such as the diversification of its activities and its geographical sites, limit the magnitude of risks to which the Group is exposed. The Group has not identified any significant risk besides those discussed below.\n\nThis section reflects the provisions of (EU) regulation no. 2017/1129 of June 14, 2017 (\"Prospectus 3\"), which took effect on July 21, 2019. The risk factors are presented hereafter in decreasing order of importance within each category.\n\nAmong all these risks, the Group considers the financial risks to be the most significant. The risks are presented in order of importance within this category.\n\nThe most significant risks are nevertheless singled out by an asterisk.\n\n# <span id=\"page-151-1\"></span>**1.1. Financial risks**\n\n# **1.1.1. MAIN FINANCIAL RISKS**\n\nThe Group has conducted a review of the risks that could have a material adverse effect on its activity, financial situation or results. Only certain financial risks are liable to impact the Group's overall results.\n\n# **1.1.1.1. RISK ASSOCIATED WITH LISTED SHARES\\***\n\nThe Group holds a large portfolio of listed securities, which exposes it to changes in stock market price.\n\nUnconsolidated securities are valued in the financial statements at 6,838.9 million euros as of December 31, 2023. This includes listed securities worth 2,425.3 million euros.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9 \"Financial instruments\", these equity investments are valued at fair value at year end, i.e. for listed securities at year-end share price, and are classified as financial assets (see note 8.3 – Other financial assets to the consolidated financial statements – chapter 5, section 5.1.).\n\nAt December 31, 2023, a variation of 1% in the stock market price would have an impact of 101.1 million euros on the value of the equity investments in the financial statements, with an impact on profit and loss, of which 42.9 million euros for revaluations of the Group's stakes in Omnium Bolloré, Financière V and Sofibol.\n\nThe valuation of these unlisted securities, which are held directly and indirectly in Omnium Bolloré, Financière V and Sofibol, depends on the stock market price of Compagnie de l'Odet shares (see note 8.3 – Other financial assets to the consolidated financial statements – chapter 5, section 5.1.). As at December 31, 2023, the reevaluated value of these equities was 4,297.2 million euros. The shares of these unlisted companies are not very liquid. The value of unconsolidated companies is regularly monitored under the aegis of the Group's Finance Department. In addition, the value of these\n\n# **1.1.1.2. LIQUIDITY RISK\\***\n\nThe Group's liquidity risk stems from obligations to repay its debt and from the need for future financing in connection with the development of its various lines of business. To deal with liquidity risk, the Group's strategy has been to maintain a level of unused credit lines that will allow it to deal at any point with cash requirements. As at December 31, 2023, the amount of confirmed and unused credit lines was 8,259 million euros (of which 3,792 million euros for the Vivendi group). Additionally, the Group strives to diversify its sources of financing by using the bond market, the banking market and over-the-counter financing (NEU CP).\n\nFor the Group's main syndicated bank financing facilities as at December 31, 2023:\n\n• Bolloré SE has two revolving credit lines. One of 1,300 million euros, of which 13.6 million euros was drawn down at December 31, 2023 (drawdowns in euros and US dollars), maturing in 2025. And another of 400 million euros, maturing in 2028, undrawn at December 31, 2023. They are subject to a gearing covenant that caps the net debt to equity ratio at 1.75;\n\nsecurities is assessed on the basis of the most recent market prices at the year end.\n\nThe Group also owns listed shares in consolidated subsidiaries, such as Vivendi, and in companies accounted for using the equity method, notably Telecom Italia, Universal Music Group, MultiChoice Group and the Socfin group. The valuation of these companies in the consolidated financial statements is based directly on the market price. The drop in the price, accompanied by other indicators, especially deterioration in the prospects for significant and lasting results, is, however, an indicator of impairment, which leads to a review of the value that may lead to the recognition of an impairment in the consolidated financial statements. See notes 7.1 – Goodwill and 8.2 – Investments in companies accounted for under the equity method in the notes to the financial statements – chapter 5, section 5.1.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the market value of the Group's listed companies accounted for using the equity method amounted to 13,352 million euros for Universal Music Group (UMG), 1,071 million euros for Telecom Italia, 597 million euros for MultiChoice Group and 258 million euros for the Socfin group. The valuation of investments in companies accounted for under the equity method is detailed in note 8.2 – Investments in companies accounted for under the equity method to the consolidated financial statements (chapter 5, section 5.1.).\n\n- Compagnie de l'Odet has a credit facility of 1,150 million euros, of which 375.0 million euros was drawn down (in euros) as at December 31, 2023, maturing in 2026.\n- Vivendi SE has a syndicated credit line maturing of 1,500 million euros in January 2026 and eight bilateral credit lines for a total amount of 800 million euros maturing in December 2027;\n- none of these credit lines are subject to compliance with financial ratios and they contain the usual default clauses present in unsecured financing; • Lagardère SA has a syndicated credit line of 982 million euros maturing in\n\nApril 2025. Bonds issued by Vivendi SE are subject to the usual default, negative pledge and pari passu clauses. They also contain an early repayment clause in the event of a change of control (excluding a change of control to the benefit of the Bolloré Group) that would apply if, following such an event, Vivendi SE's long-term rating was downgraded below Baa3.\n\nAs at March 4, 2024, when the Vivendi Management Board met to approve the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, Vivendi's ratings were as follows:\n\n| Rating agency | Type of debt                    | Ratings | Outlook        |\n|---------------|---------------------------------|---------|----------------|\n| Moody's       | Senior unsecured long-term debt | Baa2    | Stable outlook |\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\nApart from the proposed spin-off, the feasibility of which is under review (see note 1 – Highlights), the Group considers that the cash flows generated by its operating activities, its cash surpluses net of sums used to reduce its debt, as well as the funds available via unused bank credit lines, will suffice to cover the expenses and investments necessary for its operation, debt servicing, tax payments, dividend payments, possible share buybacks under existing ordinary authorizations, as well as its planned investments over the next twelve months.\n\nSome other lines may have early repayment covenants connected with respect of financial ratios, generally involving ratios of net debt to equity. These bank covenants and financial ratios were all met as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\nThe portion due in less than one year of loans used as at December 31, 2023 includes 67 million euros of short-term negotiable securities at Bolloré SE, 60 million euros at Compagnie de l'Odet and 561 million euros at Vivendi out of a program of up to 4,550 million euros (of which 3,650 million euros for Vivendi, undrawn as at December 31, 2023) and 21.9 million euros of receivables factoring.\n\n# **1.1.1.3. GOODWILL RISK**\n\nThe Group's financial statements included goodwill of 9,762.4 million euros as at December 31, 2023 (16.3% of the Group's total consolidated assets) and 7,802 million euros restated as at December 31, 2022 (14.4% of the Group's total consolidated assets). Most of the goodwill relates to Vivendi (9,631.5 million euros) itself, mainly relating to Groupe Canal+ for 4,203.4 million euros, Havas Group for 2,431.7 million euros and Lagardère for 2,401.3 million euros.\n\nUnder current regulations, goodwill is not amortized but subjected to an impairment test at least once a year and whenever there is an indication of impairment. This test consists of comparing the book value to the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit (CGU) or group of CGUs. This recoverable amount is generally determined by present-discounting the future cash flows of the CGU or the CGUs group, by using cash flows\n\n# **1.1.1.4. RISKS RELATED TO PRODUCTION PURCHASES**\n\nPurchases of raw materials, energy, services, equipment and components from third parties have a significant impact on the Group's business activity. An unexpected increase in these costs or a disruption in the supply chain may have an adverse effect on the financial situation of one of the Group's All bank lines of credit, both drawn and undrawn, are repayable as follows:\n\n| 2024        | 24%  |\n|-------------|------|\n| 2025        | 22%  |\n| 2026        | 28%  |\n| 2027        | 8%   |\n| 2028        | 17%  |\n| Beyond 2028 | 1%   |\n| TOTAL       | 100% |\n\nprojected from the operating budgets, which are extrapolated over a set time horizon (usually five years), by applying a growth rate appropriate to the potential expansion of the markets in question and using assumptions made by management based on past experience. After the stated time horizon, the terminal value is based on the perpetuity value of the cash flows. The discount rate is determined by basing it on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of each CGU; it includes potential risks specific to each activity (business lines, markets and geographical areas); the rate selected was determined on the basis of information communicated by an outside consulting firm. When impairment is found, the difference between the asset's book value and its recoverable amount is recognized among operating expenses for the fiscal year.\n\nbusiness lines. However, the diversity of the Group's businesses makes it possible to significantly limit the financial impacts on the Group as a whole. In addition, the divisions pass on most of the impact of price increases to the end customer.\n\n| Sector         | Main purchases                                                           | Risk management                                                                                                                                                            |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Oil logistics  | • Oil products<br>• Biofuels/CEE                                         | • Sale price passed on to end customer<br>• Hedging of forward product purchases and sales<br>• Purchases fractioned in relation to the marketing of oil products          |\n| Communications | • Exclusive content<br>and premium rights                                | • See chapter 3 of Vivendi’s 2023 universal registration document<br>– section 1.1.1. “Risks related to the inflation of costs of exclusive<br>content and premium rights” |\n| Industry       | • Resins<br>• Lithium<br>• Energy<br>• Electronic components<br>• Metals | • Policy on supplier diversification and selection<br>• Supply contracts<br>• Sale price passed on to end customer                                                         |\n\n# **1.1.1.5. INTEREST RATE RISK**\n\nGiven its financial debt, the Group is exposed to changes over time in interest rates in the eurozone, primarily on the portion of debt which is at variable rates, as well as to changes in the lending margins of credit institutions. To deal with this risk, Executive management may decide to set up interest rate hedges. Firm hedging (rate swaps, FRAs) may be used to manage the interest rate risk on the Group's debt.\n\nNote 8.5 – Financial debt in chapter 5, section 5.1. of the notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the various derivatives used to hedge the Group's interest rate risk.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, after hedging, fixed-rate gross financial debt amounted to 26% of total gross debt.\n\nIf interest rates were to rise uniformly by +1%, the cost of gross debt would increase by 57.5 million euros after hedging on interest-bearing gross debt. If interest rates were to rise uniformly by +1%, the cost of gross debt would decrease by –1.8 million euros after hedging on interest-bearing debt.\n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.1.1.6. INVESTMENT AND COUNTERPARTY RISK**\n\nSurplus cash is invested in a prudent manner in low-risk liquid products with counterparties featuring a high credit rating.\n\n**1.1.1.7. CURRENCY RISK**\n\nFor the Bolloré Group, the breakdown of revenue by currency area (63% in euros, 10% in US dollars, 5% in CFA francs, 5% in zloty, 4% in pounds sterling, and less than 3% for all other currencies individually) and the fact that a large proportion of operating expenses is in local currencies limit its exposure to operating currency risk.\n\nThe Group is reducing its exposure to currency risk further by hedging its main operations in currencies other than the euro and the CFA franc with large international banks. The management of currency risk is largely centralized at Bolloré SE and Vivendi SE for subsidiaries which are attached to them directly.\n\n<span id=\"page-153-0\"></span>At the Bolloré SE level, at the end of each month, each subsidiary declares its currency positions to be hedged to the Cash Department, which may arrange a firm hedge (forward buy or sell). In addition to these rolling transactions, other hedges may be taken from time to time. Bolloré Energy hedges its positions directly on the market each day.\n\n# **1.2. Risks related to business activities**\n\nEach Group division is responsible for managing its industrial, environmental, market, and compliance risks. The type of risks and the associated management methods are regularly analyzed by each divisional management.\n\nMoreover, Vivendi and Bolloré spread their investments across a number of selected banks and limit the investment amount per vehicle.\n\nWith regard to Vivendi, the Group's foreign exchange risk management policy primarily aims to hedge budgetary exposures for the next year related to monetary flows from operations in currencies other than the euro, as well as external firm commitments entered into in the context of the acquisition of editorial content (sports, TV and film rights, etc.) and certain industrial investments (i.e. set-top boxes) made in currencies other than the euro. The hedging instruments are currency swap, forward purchase or forward sale contracts, the majority of which mature in less than one year. Given the currency hedges in place, an unfavorable and uniform change of 1% in the euro against any of the currencies accounted for at end-December 2023 would have an immaterial aggregate effect on net income.\n\nThey are also supervised by the Group's Risk Committee and Insurance Department.\n\nThe occurrence of one of the following risks may also entail reputational risk from the media storm it might create.\n\n# **1.2.1. PRINCIPAL RISKS RELATED TO BUSINESS ACTIVITIES**\n\n# **1.2.1.1. MARKET RISK (OIL LOGISTICS, FILMS)**\n\nBolloré Energy is exposed to the risk of changes in demand for petroleum products, particularly domestic fuel oil.\n\nCivil society, the government and other stakeholders are calling for a reduction in the consumption of petroleum products and the implementation of a lowcarbon energy mix.\n\nWhile defending the position of domestic fuel oil in the French energy mix, Bolloré Energy is committed to the energy transition by offering new lowcarbon products.\n\nHowever, Bolloré Energy's financial situation and outlook could be impacted by the acceleration of regulatory changes, by constraints related to the policy of encouraging the consumption of biofuels for the diesel sector, by a rapid\n\n# **1.2.1.2. GEOPOLITICAL RISKS**\n\nThe Group has industrial and commercial activities in a large number of countries.\n\nThe breakdown of revenue by geographic area for the 2023 fiscal year (excluding Vivendi) was as follows: France (2.5 million euros), Europe excluding France (0.6 million euros) and the Americas (0.1 million euros).\n\nThe Group may be impacted directly and indirectly by global geopolitical developments, but the diversity of its activities, its mainly European geographical presence and the limited dispersion of the rest of its activities around the world limit the potential economic and operational impacts arising from political, trade, regulatory or health tensions on its results.\n\nThe recent conflicts have not had a significant impact on the Group results and their impact on Vivendi has been limited (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 3 \"Risks associated with conducting operations in various countries\").\n\nThe Group uses internal resources to monitor and anticipate these risks in order to limit their impacts on its order books, supply chain and customer deliveries.\n\ndrop in demand for carbon products, or by the cost of low-carbon energies being deemed too high by consumers.\n\nBolloré Innovative Thin Films is exposed to changes in French (AGEC Law) and European regulations, the pillars of which notably concern reducing, reusing and recycling single-use plastic packaging.\n\nBolloré Innovative Thin Films is also exposed to changes in distributor/ consumer behaviour and technological disruption.\n\nTo meet these challenges, Bolloré Innovative Thin Films has for several years, through investment in industrial equipment and research and development, been offering a broad and deep range of \"biobased and recyclable\" products to respond to these changes.\n\nIn addition, the Bolloré Group has a Safety and Security Department to oversee the protection of Compagnie de l'Odet's, the Bolloré Group's and Vivendi's human and physical assets in France and abroad. Its tasks focus on the following:\n\n- monitoring and analysis of global security events and a proactive approach to crises;\n- crisis management in conjunction with the departments concerned (Executive management, Legal, QHSE, HR);\n- safety audits in France and abroad and the verification of emergency crisis procedures (non-combatant evacuation operations);\n- travel safety based on a rigorous travel policy. This includes the management and monitoring of business trips abroad via a location platform;\n- maintenance of a safety & security network through the consolidation of the Group's security networks in France and abroad and the hiring of local safety and security liaisons.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.2.1.3. CUSTOMER RISK**\n\nThe Group operates several businesses in very diverse sectors, which significantly reduces overall risks.\n\nAs regards risk management, monthly monitoring is carried out by the Bolloré Group's Cash Department, which centralizes the working capital requirement (WCR). In the Group's main divisions, credit risk management is the responsibility of a credit manager.\n\nThe Group has frequent recourse to credit insurance when a receivable is not covered by insurance. The Group performs a forward-looking evaluation of the credit losses expected from its trade receivables. To measure the provision expense for expected credit losses on its trade receivables on origination, the Group assesses the probability of default at the date of initial recognition. Subsequently, provisions for expected credit losses on trade receivables are remeasured in light of changes in the credit risk of the asset during each fiscal year.\n\n# **1.2.1.4. TECHNOLOGICAL RISK (INDUSTRY)**\n\nThe Group is making significant investments in new activities such as electricity storage, the main technological challenge being to make \"all-solidstate\" lithium battery technology a benchmark in both the bus market and in stationary batteries for electricity storage. Even though it is extremely confident about the prospects offered by these new activities, the Group remains prudent given the technological risk that such capital expenditure\n\n# **1.2.1.5. RISKS RELATED TO ACTIVITIES IN THE COMMUNICATIONS SECTOR**\n\nThis sector mainly includes the risk factors related to the activities of Vivendi and its subsidiaries. These are detailed further in chapter 3 of Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document. They primarily comprise:\n\n<span id=\"page-154-0\"></span>• risks related to the cost of key rights and concessions for the Group's various activities;\n\n• risks related to piracy;\n\n# **1.3. Legal risks**\n\n# **1.3.1. MAIN LEGAL RISKS**\n\n# **1.3.1.1. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DISPUTES**\n\nThe activities of the Group's companies are not subject to any specific dependency. In the normal course of their activities, Bolloré SE and its subsidiaries are party to a number of legal, administrative or arbitrational proceedings. The potential costs of these proceedings are the subject of provisions insofar as they are probable and quantifiable. The provisioned amounts are subject to a risk assessment on a case-by-case basis (see note 10.2 – Litigation in progress to the financial statements [chapter 5, section 5.1.]).\n\n# **Togo Guinea inquiry**\n\nOn December 12, 2018, criminal charges were brought in a purely mechanical manner against Bolloré SE for corruption of a foreign public agent, complicity in falsification and use and complicity in breach of trust, following the criminal charges brought on April 25, 2018 against two of its senior executives.\n\nThe allegations at the heart of the judicial inquiry go back to 2009-2010 and concern two operations in Togo and Guinea.\n\nThe inquiry seeks to determine whether the concessions obtained by local subsidiaries of the Group in Togo and Guinea were obtained because of communications services provided by Havas Group in those countries for, respectively, 300,000 euros and 170,000 euros.\n\nBolloré SE is vigorously contesting the alleged facts, which have been the subject of numerous appeals before courts and tribunals.\n\nIn Guinea, the Group was named operator of the concession in 2010 because it had come in second during the international tender offer of 2008, after the default of the operator that had come in first.\n\nTrade receivables are regularly monitored at both Group and division level and are impaired individually when this is deemed necessary.\n\nThe aged balance of past due receivables without provisions at year end, the breakdown of changes in provisions for trade receivables and the expenditure and income in respect of these receivables are shown in note 6.6 – Trade and other receivables in the notes to the consolidated financial statements (chapter 5, section 5.1).\n\nVivendi believes that there is no significant collection risk for operating receivables for its activities: the large number of individual customers, the diversity of customers and markets, as well as the geographical distribution of Vivendi's activities minimize the concentration of credit risk related to trade receivables.\n\nmay present. Accordingly, the efforts devoted to these developments are at all times measured on the basis of the performance of the traditional activities and in such a way that they do not call into question the Group's overall equilibrium. This risk is also addressed directly by Executive management at its monthly meetings.\n\n• risks related to cybercrime;\n\n- risks related to disintermediation and changes in consumption patterns;\n- risks related to data protection;\n- risks linked to talents;\n- risks related to conducting business in different countries.\n\nIn Togo, the concession agreement was signed on August 29, 2001, whereas the facts alleged would have occurred in 2009 and 2010, which is to say ten years later.\n\nIn these two countries, the Group's investments in port infrastructure currently total over 500 million euros.\n\nIn a ruling handed down on September 26, 2019, the Second Examining Chamber of the Paris Court of Appeal canceled the indictment of Bolloré SE (and its two senior executives mentioned above) for complicity in forgery and use of forged documents in Togo, bribery of a foreign public official in Guinea and complicity in forgery and use of forged documents in Guinea.\n\nTo limit the length of these proceedings, Bolloré SE and Compagnie de l'Odet (formerly Financière de l'Odet SE) agreed to sign a deferred prosecution agreement *(convention judiciaire d'intérêt public* or CJIP) with the French National Financial Prosecutor's Office (Parquet national financier or PNF). This agreement, which was signed on February 9, 2021 and validated by the Paris court on February 26, 2021, is neither an admission of guilt nor a guilty verdict. It is a deal under which the PNF agreed to drop the charges against Bolloré SE, which agreed in turn to subject its compliance program to controls by the French anticorruption agency (AFA) for a period of two years and to bear the costs thereof up to 4 million euros. The Group's parent company Compagnie de l'Odet (formerly Financière de l'Odet SE) agreed to pay a public interest fine of 12 million euros (which it paid on time). The CJIP put an end to all charges brought against Bolloré SE.\n\nThe audits and checks carried out by the AFA under the deferred prosecution agreement ended on March 8, 2023. Bolloré SE then received a draft final audit report from the AFA and provided its observations.\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Autolib' vs. the Syndicat mixte Autolib' et Vélib' Métropole**\n\nOn February 25, 2011, Syndicat mixte Autolib' et Vélib' Métropole (\"the SMAVM\") and Autolib' SA entered into a public service delegation for the purpose of installing, managing and maintaining a self-service electric automobile service and electric vehicle recharging infrastructure (\"the agreement\" or \"the concession\").\n\nIn light of the updated 2016 Business Plan and the updated 2017 Business Plan that Autolib' forwarded to the SMAVM, it was clear that the agreement was not economically attractive as defined in its article 63.2.1. and Autolib' notified the SMAVM of this fact on May 25, 2018, in accordance with the agreement.\n\nSince the SMAVM did not wish to pay Autolib' the compensation called for in article 63.2.2 of the agreement in the event the concession should prove economically unattractive, it terminated the agreement per its article 63.3 in deliberation no. 2018-18 of June 21, 2018.\n\nArticle 63.3 of the agreement provides that, should the agreement be terminated pursuant to that article, the indemnification schedule in article 61 of the agreement shall apply.\n\nTherefore, Autolib' sent the SMAVM a letter dated September 25, 2018 with its request for indemnification for a total amount of 235,243,366 euros, calculated in accordance with articles 63.3 and 61 of the agreement. The SMAVM, however, in a letter dated November 27, 2018, expressed its refusal to pay the indemnification referred to in item (vi) of article 61 of the agreement (indemnification and compensation due to Autolib' from the SMAVM since the threshold defined in article 63 of the agreement had been exceeded) by challenging Autolib's right to be compensated due to the threshold having been exceeded and to the agreement thus being recognized as economically unattractive.\n\nGiven this refusal by the SMAVM to pay the compensation called for in item (vi) of article 61 of the agreement, thereby demonstrating a profound disagreement between the SMAVM and Autolib' about the amount of compensation to be paid under article 61 of the agreement, Autolib' notified the SMAVM, in accordance with article 61 of the agreement and in a letter dated November 29, 2018, that it was bringing the matter before the Arbitration Panel mentioned in article 70 of the agreement.\n\nArticle 61 of the agreement provides that: \"The Arbitration Panel may be appealed to by either party in the event of disagreement about the amount of this compensation.\"\n\nArticle 70.1 of the agreement concerning the establishment of an Arbitration Panel provides inter alia that, \"the Arbitration Panel shall consist of three (3) members whose personal and moral qualities and experience in publicprivate arrangements for comparable complex projects is well known.\n\nWithin fifteen (15) calendar days after the appeal to the Arbitration Panel, each party will designate one (1) member, and the third member, who will be Chairman of the Arbitration Panel, will be chosen by common agreement between the two (2) members so designated. Failing an agreement within fifteen (15) calendar days, the Chairman of the Arbitration Panel will be designated by the Chief Judge of the Administrative Court of Paris, at the request of the first party to act\".\n\nTherefore, and in compliance with said article 70.1 of the agreement, Autolib' and the SMAVM each proceeded on their own, on December 11 and 12, 2018 respectively, to designate the two out of three members of the Arbitration Panel.\n\nDespite numerous conversations held and proposals made by the members of the Arbitration Panel designated by the SMAVM and Autolib', the two members were unable to reach an agreement as to the choice of a Chairman of the Arbitration Panel, even more than two months after the appeal to the Arbitration Panel on November 29, 2018.\n\nTherefore, and pursuant to article 70.1 of the agreement, Autolib' appealed to the Chief Judge of the Administrative Court of Paris in a request dated February 12, 2019 so that she might appoint the Chairman of the Arbitration Panel. When the Chief Judge of the Administrative Court recused herself from making that appointment, Autolib' and the SMAVM granted the arbitrators a one-month extension to reach an agreement on the choice of a Chairman of the Arbitration Panel.\n\nHowever, no agreement on the selection of the Chairman of the Arbitration Panel had been reached between the two members of the Panel already appointed as of March 20, 2019.\n\nDespite the lack of agreement by the deadline agreed to between Autolib' and the SMAVM, Autolib' remained keen to give the conciliation one last chance to take place.\n\nAs such, in a letter dated March 22, 2019, Autolib' referred the matter back to a new Arbitration Panel, replacing the Arbitration Panel to which the matter was referred on November 29, 2018.\n\nHowever, unlike Autolib', the SMAVM, in a letter dated March 27, 2019, initially refused to appoint a member to the new Arbitration Panel other than the one originally designated.\n\nIn response to a letter from Autolib' dated March 29, 2019 calling on SMAVM to appoint a new member of the Arbitration Panel and a reminder letter dated April 8, 2019, SMAVM, in a letter dated on the same day, finally agreed to make every effort to appoint a new member to the Panel before April 23, 2019.\n\nHowever, contrary to all expectations, the SMAVM, in a letter dated April 23, 2019, subsequently informed Autolib' that it had been unable to appoint a new member to the Arbitration Panel within the agreed period, and that it intended to designate as a member of the new Panel the person appointed to the first.\n\nAs the arbitration proceeding was manifestly impossible, in the light of all the foregoing, Autolib', in a letter dated May 20, 2019, asked the SMAVM, prior to referring the matter to the Administrative Court of Paris in accordance with article 71 of the Autolib' Public Service Delegation agreement, to pay it the compensation due in accordance with article 63 and article 61 of the Autolib' Public Service Delegation agreement, i.e. the sum of 235,243,366 euros, subject to adjustments, to cover the termination of the agreement.\n\nAs this request was implicitly rejected by the SMAVM on July 20, 2019, Autolib' applied to the Administrative Court of Paris on September 9, 2019, asking it to force the SMAVM to pay it an amount of 235,243,366 euros, for the termination of the agreement, with interest and, where applicable, the compounding of accrued interest.\n\nUnder the terms of a judgment dated December 12, 2023, the Paris Administrative Court rejected Autolib's request while also refusing the requests of the SMAVM and the defendant municipalities made on the basis of article L. 761-1 of the French administrative justice code *(Code de justice administrative).* The court held that the SMAVM was liable to bear the entire share of the operating losses of the concession exceeding the threshold of losses accepted by the concession holder and set at 60 million euros in the contract, but that such a mechanism constituted a gift granted by a public entity, without, however, substantiating this characterization, thereby rendering the contract null and void. Autolib' appealed this judgment and intends to assert its rights in respect of all legal grounds available to it in this context.\n\nThere are no other governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings of which the company is aware that are pending or being threatened and are likely to have, or have had over the course of the last twelve months, a significant effect on the financial situation or profitability of the company and/or the Bolloré Group.\n\nThe main disputes and inquiries in which Vivendi is involved are covered by a description in note 11.2 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n# **1.3.1.2. TAX RISKS**\n\nThe Group's activities are subject to changing and restrictive legislation and regulation. However, these factors are not such that they create particular risks for the Group.\n\nIn the normal course of business, some companies in the Group undergo tax audits. These audits do not raise significant risks or risk factors.\n\nAccounting provisions are regularly set up for the consequences of these audits if they appear probable and indicate a future financial cost to the Group (see note 11.2 – Litigation in progress – Tax disputes to the financial statements [in chapter 5, section 5.1]).\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-156-0\"></span>**1.4. Risks related to corporate social responsibility**\n\nThe management of CSR risks is detailed in chapter 2 – Non-financial performance statement – of the 2023 universal registration document. The risks specific to the Communications sector are detailed in Vivendi's universal registration document (see 2.2. and 2.3. \"The main risks\").\n\n# **1.4.1. SOCIAL RISKS**\n\n# **1.4.1.1. HEALTH AND SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THIRD PARTIES**\n\nBolloré Energy and the Industry sector carry out their business activities in environments with a potentially high risk of accidents. The issue is particularly material with regard to industrial activities, such as handling, production and assembly, and the handling, storage and transportation of hazardous goods.\n\nAs for its employees, one of the Group's priority risks is ensuring the health and safety of partners and subcontractors working on its sites, as well as local communities which could be impacted by its activities. The risks relating to the safety of users and third parties in the context of hazardous goods and passenger transport operations are particularly material.\n\n# **1.4.1.2. ATTRACTING AND RETAINING SKILLS**\n\nThe ability to reveal and support talent is one of the pillars of the Group's performance. Internally, the group develops talented individuals so that they can adapt to today's complex and rapidly changing world and create the conditions for individual and collective success. To meet the requirement for quality in our services and ensure the sustainability and growth of our activities, Bolloré Group\n\n# **1.4.1.3. WORKING CONDITIONS AND SOCIAL DIALOG**\n\nThe Group acknowledges that working conditions and social dialog, if they are not fully taken into account, would constitute a major risk in terms of preserving the health and safety of its employees, attracting new talent, retaining employees and ensuring a calm social climate conducive to the development of the business and the company's performance.\n\nWith a diverse range of activities, business lines and stakeholders, the Group has always considered the development of social status and, more specifically, working conditions, as a priority.\n\nfocuses on attracting then retaining and developing the skills of its employees, who are a real lever for operational efficiency and innovation. These initiatives fall into seven categories: school relations, recruitment, diversity, mobility, training, professional support and compensation.\n\nIt maintains local dialog on the ground to ensure the best possible working conditions and promote permanent social dialog with employee representatives and similar bodies, and facilitates employee expression in countries where the ILO conditions on trade union freedoms have not been ratified.\n\n# **1.4.2. ETHICAL RISKS**\n\n# **1.4.2.1. CORRUPTION AND INFLUENCE-PEDDLING (SEE COMPLIANCE RISK)**\n\nThe French Sapin II law of December 9, 2016 requires French companies with at least 500 employees and with revenue or consolidated revenue in excess of 100 million euros to take measures to prevent and detect corruption and influence-peddling. Corruption risk mapping is intended to respond to a dual challenge: (i) to understand the factors liable to affect the various activities and their performance, with the aim of guarding against the legal, human, economic and financial consequences resulting from insufficient care; and (ii) to foster greater knowledge and in turn better control of these risks. As a tool for managing risks, corruption risk mapping\n\n# **1.4.3. HUMAN RIGHTS RISKS**\n\n# **1.4.3.1. RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS**\n\nOwing to its international presence, the Group hires many people, directly or indirectly, in institutional contexts that vary from one country to another, where human rights are at times threatened. This is why respect and the promotion of human rights have been defined as a priority for the Group, covering such issues as guaranteeing decent working conditions, promoting social dialog and the freedom of association of trade unions, the principle of non-discrimination (respecting the rights of individuals regardless of their origin, gender, sexual orientation, political views, trade union membership, enables corruption risks to be identified, the handling of corruption risks to be compared and assessed, the corruption risks that persist after mitigating strategies have been implemented to be identified and the organization to be mobilized using a common method and system. It is the foundation of the Bolloré Group's strategy for managing corruption risks in accordance with article L. 233-3 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)*. In an endeavor to use a risk-based approach, the same strategy is carried out for all the Group's activities. Attention has been focused on the geographic areas and the exposure of the Group's activities to corruption risks.\n\nor the state of the their health, etc.), and the fight against all forms of harassment. These risks are managed through the measures and internal controls set up when hiring employees, health and safety risk management systems, and through the performance of internal social audits.\n\nThe Group also pays special attention to its supply chain and subcontractors. The Group's duty of reasonable care must be adapted to meet local needs in certain regions: offers and services may sometimes be restricted by a restrictive competitive fabric at local, regional or even national level.\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.4.4. ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS**\n\n# **1.4.4.1. CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES**\n\nThe Group is aware of the physical climate risks of its activities, such as the increase in extreme climate events (rising temperatures, etc.), the transition risks and opportunities linked to changes in the market (carbon pricing, decrease in demand for oil products, etc.) and technology (electric transportation, industrial-scale battery storage, etc.), which is why it positions these challenges at the core of its business development and operational management strategy. It has also analyzed the physical risks linked to climate change. The Group, which is committed to long-term investment processes, increases its resistance to market fluctuations and its competitiveness by diversifying its activities, basing its innovation processes on a strict low-carbon strategy to develop its products and services in accordance with the major challenges of the energy transition and climate change.\n\n# **1.4.4.2. LOCAL POLLUTION, INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS AND MANAGEMENT OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS**\n\nDue to its industrial activities, the Bolloré Group has identified local pollution risks and those related to industrial accidents as priorities. The transport and storage of hazardous products and the occurrence of industrial accidents or fires represent major environmental risks and are a top priority for prevention.\n\n# **1.4.5. LOCAL IMPACT**\n\n# **1.4.5.1. RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO RELATIONS WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES**\n\nThrough its activities and relationships with local communities, the Bolloré Group is a key player in regional social and economic development. It must therefore prevent, mitigate and compensate for the negative externalities generated by its activity while maximizing beneficial impacts for local populations and the territories where it operates.\n\n# **1.4.6. SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO ACTIVITIES IN THE COMMUNICATIONS SECTOR**\n\n# **1.4.6.1. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ATTRACTING AND RETAINING EXTERNAL TALENT**\n\n(See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2, sections 4.3.2.1. \"Identifying and encouraging artistic talent in all its diversity\".)\n\n# **1.4.6.2. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DIALOG WITH CUSTOMERS AND USERS AND THEIR SATISFACTION WITH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES**\n\n(See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2, section 1.3.2. \"Emphasis on customer care\".)\n\n# **1.4.6.3. RISKS RELATED TO THE CULTURAL RELEVANCE OF CONTENT**\n\n<span id=\"page-157-0\"></span>(See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2, sections 1.3.2. \"Emphasis on customer care\", 4.2.1.1 \"Promoting and sharing culture in our activities\", in particular the sections \"Promoting local cultures\"\n\nand \"Preserving and promoting heritage cinematographic works\", and 4.3.2.1. \"Identifying and encouraging artistic talent in all its diversity\".\n\n# **1.5. Risk management and internal control tools**\n\n# **1.5.1. RISK MAPPING**\n\nMeasuring and controlling the risks inherent in the functioning of each entity are the Group's central preoccupations. Since 2005, the Group has adopted a risk mapping exercise, its primary objectives being to:\n\n- identify the major risks that could affect its divisions' operations;\n- initiate/improve the Group's processes so as to reduce and/or eliminate the impact of these risks;\n- analyze the adequacy of the Group's insurance policy and its purchasing of capacity and guarantees;\n- consider the Group's options regarding the transferring of risks to the insurance and reinsurance market, and/or the use of self-insurance;\n- strengthen crisis management and emergency communication procedures.\n\nThe Group has decided to regularly update the risks of all its business lines in order to enable the implementation and monitoring of action plans specific to each division. To this end, the Group is continuing its program of preventative inspections of its sites. Identified risks are the subject of a series of measures detailed in the action plans drawn up by the various \"owners\" of risks who are nominated within each division to manage and reduce the exposure to these risks.\n\nThe updating of consolidated risk mapping, including CSR and ethical risks, is validated every six months by the Risk Committee.\n\nFor its part, Vivendi also regularly reviews risk factors, which are presented to its Audit Committee. The Risk and Vigilance Committee also assesses whether internal procedures are adequate for dealing with potential risks.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.5.2. INSURANCE – COVERAGE OF THE RISKS THE GROUP MAY ENCOUNTER**\n\nThe Group's insurance policy is primarily aimed at enabling the activities of its various companies to continue in the event of any incident, the policy being based on:\n\n- internal prevention and protection procedures;\n- the transfer of risks to the insurance and reinsurance market through international insurance programs, regardless of the branch of activity and/ or the geographic area.\n\n# **1.5.2.1. INDUSTRIAL RISK COVERAGE**\n\nThe Group's industrial and agricultural operating sites and its storage/ warehousing sites are covered by property insurance programs up to their\n\n# **1.5.2.2. CIVIL LIABILITY COVERAGE**\n\nThe Group has taken out a set of civil liability policies given its various activities and its exposure to various risks.\n\nThe civil liability that any Group company may incur as a result of its activities, in particular general and professional civil liability and civil liability due to products, is covered by a Group insurance program adapted to each activity's risk, in all areas it does business.\n\n# **1.5.3. CYBERSECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT**\n\n# **1.5.3.1. CYBERSECURITY RISK GOVERNANCE**\n\nIn recent years, there has been a marked increase in cybersecurity threats against countries, companies or even hospitals and local authorities with the aim of taking control of their infrastructure or steal confidential information. The Group is aware that these attacks may seriously harm the proper functioning of its activities and impact the data it owns or that are entrusted to it. The level of information system security and the robustness of the control processes implemented in each of its divisions are key focuses for the Group.\n\nAs such, the Bolloré Group has established a specific governance structure to support its security systems. The Chair and Chief Executive Officer or, by delegation, the business and cross-functional departments, approves the objectives of the security policy and ensures the allocation of the resources necessary for its proper implementation:\n\n• the Group Chief Information Officer (CIO) informs the CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) of any work likely to impact the security systems in place.\n\n# **1.5.3.2. BOLLORÉ GROUP CYBERSECURITY POLICY**\n\nThe objective of the information security policy drafted by the Information Systems Department is to continuously improve security. The policy is regularly updated to take into account changes in the cybersecurity risk assessment. This policy is applied in all divisions of the Group. All policies and procedures are reviewed annually.\n\nGiven the cybersecurity risks identified by the Group, an Information Security Management System (ISMS) has been set up at head office. The ISMS obtained ISO 27001-2013 certification in December 2021 for Bolloré SE and Bolloré Energy. The certification was renewed for the initial scope in followup audits in 2022 and 2023. The Group's objective is to obtain ISO 27001- 2022 certification and extend it to other sites in 2024.\n\n# **Cyber risk coverage**\n\nThe Group took out a cyber insurance policy in 2014 to guard against risks related to the Group's information systems.\n\nThe Group is covered in all its areas of activity against the consequences of such events that are liable to affect its facilities, in particular its industrial sites. The Group also has civil liability coverage for all its activities.\n\nRegarding customer risk (chapter 3, section 1.2. \"Risks related to business activities\", under the heading \"Customer risk\"), the Group makes widespread use of credit insurance whenever this is indicated.\n\nreconstruction/replacement value. In most cases, they are also covered by \"Operating loss\" insurance for 100% of the annual gross margin.\n\nThis cover is supplemented by an excess insurance capacity covering all Group companies in addition to the above program.\n\nThe Group's entities also have \"environmental damage\" and \"cyber risk\" civil liability coverage.\n\nThe CIO and the CISO work together to ensure security and technological monitoring, in particular by regularly checking the vulnerability of the Group's technical infrastructure;\n\n- the CISO is responsible for the operational implementation of the information security program, in close collaboration with the CIO;\n- the network of local correspondents applies the security policy at the local level. In 2024, this network will be extended to all Group entities.\n\nSecurity is integrated into the Group's control system . Audits are conducted to assess the resilience of information systems to cyberattacks and the results of these audits are reported to senior management at annual management reviews during which action plans corresponding to these risks are presented at which the actions plans associated with these risk are presented.\n\nIn 2021, the Bolloré Group became an associate member of SAS Campus Cyber, a project initiated by the French President with a view to creating a community of public and private players to unlock synergies.\n\n# **Training**\n\nAccording to several studies, human error is responsible for more than 90% of security incidents.\n\nAs such, employees are the first line of defense in reducing the risk of cyberattacks. To raise employee awareness, three mandatory information security e-learning modules were rolled out in 2021 on phishing (the tactic the most commonly used by cybercriminals [in 90% of cases]), social engineering (breach of trust, baiting, manipulation, fraud) and e-mail security.\n\n- The \"Phishing\" and \"E-mail security\" modules have two main objectives: • understanding what phishing is and identifying threats to information security;\n- recognizing and identifying the components of a phishing message and website.\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the last module, \"Social Engineering\" employees learn how cybercriminals gain employees' trust and encourage them to disclose information enabling them to better target their attacks.\n\nThese modules have been made available to all Group divisions via the internal training platform.\n\nIn 2022, two new training modules based on the IT charter were implemented. As at December 31, 2022, 77% of Bolloré Group employees had completed training courses in the importance of cybersecurity. The Group strengthened its phishing campaigns and actively participated in Cybersecurity Month in October:\n\n• internal communication on cybersecurity best practices via a lock screen on Group employees' workstations;\n\n• transfer of communications made available by the French national agency for information systems security (Anssi);\n\n• recurring communications on phishing and ransomware;\n\n• a monthly phishing campaign.\n\nIn 2023, to raise employee awareness, three mandatory information security e-learning modules were rolled out across all our subsidiaries:\n\n- an introductory module presenting the organization and duties of the Cyber Department;\n- a module reviewing the Information System User Charter;\n- a Cyber-resilience module aimed at giving greater visibility on all aspects relating to business continuity and understanding current threats and major risks.\n\nFinally, there is an optional module, \"Ransomware is everywhere\", which raises awareness and provides training in this type of threat.\n\n| Area of action                                                  | Group objectives                                              | Timeframe | Next steps in 2024                                                                                               |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Strengthen, extend, test and learn                              | Protect against the internal threat                           | 2024      | Strengthen IT security, awareness and testing                                                                    |\n| Implement and extend the ISMS                                   | Obtain ISO 27001: 2022 certification                          | 2024      | Implement a holistic approach to security                                                                        |\n| Strengthen our security operations<br>center (SOC) capabilities | Defend against external threats                               | 2024      | Protect our sensitive data<br>Leverage our tools by detecting our threats on the network                         |\n| Strengthen our cyber<br>resilience approach                     | Implement the BCMS (Business<br>Continuity Management System) | 2024      | Assess our resilience through tests, crisis management,<br>business recovery plans and business continuity plans |\n\n# **1.5.3.3. CYBERSECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS**\n\nUsing the IT risk management tool, the Group has identified two major risks and twelve scenarios of internal and external threats that could seriously harm it. This risk mapping tool is used to assess the criticality and occurrence of these threats in an annual review, allowing the Group to align its action plan and investments with these scenarios.\n\nThe Group has put in place an organization and processes to reduce risks and protect itself in the event of a cyberattack.\n\nMeasures taken to reduce these major risks include the assessment of third parties, the integration of security in projects, and the performance of audits and pentests.\n\nIn addition, the Group has invested in the latest generation of defense and supervision tools to ensure it has the capacity to contain any attacks. The system comprises:\n\n• SIEM - Security Information and Event Management: to collect security events and correlate them with security use cases previously established in the identified risk scenarios;\n\n# **1.5.3.4. RESILIENCE OF INFORMATION SECURITY SYSTEMS**\n\nThe Group's resilience process is based on the principles set out in ISO 22301 and on an incident monitoring and detection program. Organizational resources and supervision tools monitor activity at the level of the information systems. In addition, the Group has put in place a process to offset any prolonged shutdown of critical systems and applications.\n\nIn the Cybersecurity Department, the GRC (governance, risk and compliance) team is in charge of cyber resilience, among others. It defines and oversees the implementation of an IT system continuity management system (methodological framework, crisis simulations and tests).\n\n- EDR Endpoint Detection and Response: to respond to cyberthreats using artificial intelligence and behavioral analysis, going beyond traditional antivirus software. The Group's EDR system ranks among the best in the industry according to Gartner;\n- NDR Network Detection and Response: to strengthen the protection of the company's networks and correlate information with the analysis of the activities of computers and servers to counter cyberattacks;\n- Active Directory security monitoring tool: to monitor the company's directory in real time to detect deviations in administration or cyberattacks.\n\nThe Group has also subscribed to a CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) service to identify the threats and risks associated with the exposure of its assets on the Internet.\n\nThrough this service, the Group benefits from very precise monitoring, enabling it to trigger alerts in a very short time and take appropriate actions to ensure the company's peripheral defense. Vulnerabilities can therefore be detected before they are exploited by attackers.\n\nThe Group's IT business continuity plan (IT BCP) is drawn up based on business impacts of crisis scenarios.\n\nRegular reviews are organized to adapt the plan to changes in business line needs and information systems.\n\nThe Group aims to regularly test and adapt its plans and processes for IT business continuity and cybersecurity crisis management with a view to continued improvement.\n\nSimilar actions are carried out within the Vivendi group, which has its own Cybersecurity Department (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 3, section 1.1.3. \"Cybercrime risks\").\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.5.4. PERSONAL DATA RISK MANAGEMENT**\n\n# **1.5.4.1. DESCRIPTION OF THE RISK**\n\n# **Protection of personal data**\n\nThe risk connected with the failure to protect personal data concerns all the Group's companies and is particularly high for divisions whose activities involve individuals. The Group is aware of the issues relating to the\n\n# **1.5.4.2. GROUP POLICY**\n\nThe strengthening of legal provisions on personal data protection in Europe, the emergence of similar legislation internationally and the increasing digitalization of the Group's activities require systems able to reassure individuals (employees, consumers, etc.) that their personal data remain secure and are processed securely.\n\nPersonal data protection is also a major issue for legal entity customers, which are subject to the same transparency and security obligations as Group entities.\n\nIn response to this new data governance, the Group has incorporated personal data protection into its Code of Conduct and has set up a dedicated Steering Committee whose main duties include:\n\n# **1.5.4.3. OUTCOMES AND PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**\n\nSince 2019, new hires at the Group's French companies follow an online training module (elearning) on personal data protection. This module is supplemented by face-to-face sessions with employees, hosted by the divisions' DPOs and tailored to the specificities of the business lines. In 2023, the e-learning course was revamped to raise awareness among Group employees of the main principles governing personal data protection and the procedures to be applied in the event of a possible data breach. It has been rolled out in the European companies and international subsidiaries. 68% of entities in the Group, consisting of Compagnie de l'Odet, Bolloré SE and its subsidiaries (excluding Vivendi), have successfully completed this training.\n\n# **1.5.5. INTERNAL CONTROL**\n\n# **1.5.5.1. ORGANIZATION AND FEATURES OF INTERNAL CONTROL**\n\nIn accordance with the definition provided in the reference framework of the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), internal control is a system within the company, defined and implemented under its own responsibility, with the aim of ensuring:\n\n- compliance with legislation and regulations;\n- application of instructions given and strategies set by Executive management;\n- the proper functioning of the company's internal processes, particularly those helping to safeguard its assets;\n- reliable financial reporting;\n- and, more widely, helping it to manage and carry out its business effectively and use its resources efficiently.\n- Under this framework, internal control covers the following elements:\n- an organization including a clear definition of responsibilities, having adequate resources and skills and using appropriate information systems, operating procedures or methods, tools or practices;\n- the internal distribution of relevant and reliable information, knowledge of which enables each person to carry out his or her duties;\n\nprocessing personal data and the supervision of their use. It has set up dedicated organizational structures and continues to deploy appropriate technical measures within its various companies to reduce or even eliminate the impact of this risk on individuals and entities.\n\n- providing tools and procedures governing the protection of personal data (e.g. register of data processing activities, impact analysis procedure, security incident management procedure, etc.);\n- defining actions/action plans to reduce the risks incurred by the physical persons identified within the scope of personal data processing mapping;\n\n• harmonizing the practices put in place in the various companies. This Steering Committee consists of Data Protection Officers (DPOs) appointed within the Group as well as other representatives (lawyers and representatives from the Information Systems, Human Resources, Purchasing Departments, etc.). It meets regularly to assess the action being taken and to determine the next stages of deployment.\n\nIn 2022, the ISMS used by Bolloré SE to manage security in all subsidiaries worldwide was certified ISO 27001.2013 compliant.\n\nThis certification was renewed in 2023.\n\nIn 2024, a program of audits relating to personal data protection will be established jointly by the Group DPO Department and the Internal Audit Department at Bolloré SE subsidiaries to ensure that the processes and procedures made available to them are duly implemented. Regarding the actions taken by the Vivendi group on personal data protection, please refer to Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 3, section 1.1.5 \"Data protection risks\".\n\n- a risk management system intended to list, analyze and tackle the main identifiable risks with regard to the company's objectives and to ensure that procedures are in place to manage these risks;\n- audit activities proportionate to the issues involved in each process and designed to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to manage risks that may affect the achievement of objectives;\n- operation and permanent monitoring of the internal control system and regular examination to ensure that it is functioning correctly.\n\nAs indicated in the reference framework, however, no matter how well designed and applied it is, the internal control system cannot absolutely guarantee that the company will achieve its objectives.\n\nIn the description that follows, the \"Bolloré Group\" covers the parent company and the consolidated subsidiaries. This description of the internal control system was made from the reference framework devised by the working group led under the aegis of the AMF, supplemented by its application guide.\n\nThe principles and key points contained in this guide are followed where they are applicable.\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.5.5.2. A CONTROL SYSTEM ADAPTED TO THE SPECIFIC NATURE OF THE GROUP'S ORGANIZATION**\n\nThe Group's internal control system is based on the following principles:\n\n# **Separation of functions**\n\nIn order to guarantee the independence of the control function, the operational and finance departments have been systematically separated at every level within the Group.\n\nEach entity's Finance Department is responsible for ensuring that financial information is complete and reliable. All this information is regularly forwarded to senior executives and the operational departments (Human Resources, Legal, Finance, etc.).\n\n# **Independence and responsibility of subsidiaries**\n\nThe Group is organized into operational divisions which, owing to the diversity of their activities, have considerable scope to manage their own affairs. The divisions are responsible for:\n\n- specifying and implementing an internal control system suited to their specific situation and features;\n- optimizing their operational and financial performance levels;\n- safeguarding their own assets, and;\n- managing their own risks.\n\nThis system of delegated responsibility ensures that the various entities' practices comply with the legal and regulatory framework in force in the countries where they are established.\n\n# **1.5.5.3. INTERNAL DISTRIBUTION OF RELEVANT INFORMATION**\n\n# **Compliance with legislation and regulations**\n\nThe Group's operational departments enable it to:\n\n- keep abreast of the various laws that apply to it;\n- be advised, in good time, of any changes to them;\n- incorporate these rules into its internal procedures;\n- keep its staff informed and properly trained to comply with the rules and legislation concerning them.\n\n# **Application of the instructions and directions set by the Group's Executive management**\n\nExecutive management sets the Group's targets and overall strategies, ensuring that all staff are informed of them.\n\nIn this respect, the Group's budget process involves strict undertakings by the entities with respect to Executive management:\n\n- during the fourth quarter of the year, each operational division prepares a budget on the basis of the overall strategic directions set by Executive management; the budget gives a breakdown of forecast profits and cash flow, as well as the main indicators for measuring operational performance levels;\n- once approved by Executive management, this budget, broken down into months, serves as the reference for budgetary control. Discrepancies between this budget forecast and the monthly results are analyzed each month at Results Committee meetings attended by the Group's Executive management, divisional management and the Group's operational departments (Human Resources, Legal and Finance).\n\n# **1.5.5.4. RELIABLE FINANCIAL REPORTING**\n\n# **Procedure for preparing the consolidated financial statements**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared every half-year; they are verified by the Statutory Auditors in a limited review at June 30 and a full audit at December 31, covering the separate financial statements of all entities within the consolidation scope and the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThey are published once they have been approved by the Board of Directors. The Group relies on the following elements for consolidating its financial statements:\n\n- the Group's Consolidation Department, which ensures the standardization and monitoring of bookkeeping in all companies within the parent company's consolidation scope;\n- strict adherence to accounting standards linked to the consolidation operations;\n- the use of a recognized IT tool, developed in 2005 to keep the Group abreast of new information transmission technology and to guarantee secure procedures for reporting information and standardized presentation of the accounting aggregates;\n\n# **Joint support and control functions for all Group companies**\n\nThe Group establishes mandatory accounting, financial and control procedures for the central processes, usually circulated by e-mail to the operating divisions. The latter are responsible for circulating them within their organization. In addition to these procedures that the Group has established for central processes, the operating divisions have their own accounting, financial, administrative and control procedures, collected on an intranet site or regularly sent out to the entities by e-mail in order to disseminate and manage the standard framework created by the Group and the divisions. The Group Internal Audit Department regularly assesses the entities' control systems, especially with regard to their observance of Group procedures and the procedures specific to each operating division. It suggests the best ways to make improvements.\n\n# **Human resources policy fostering a good internal control environment**\n\nThe human resources policy contributes to the enhancement of an effective internal control environment through job descriptions and an appraisal system based particularly on annual reviews and regular training programs.\n\n# **Proper functioning of the company's internal processes, particularly those helping to safeguard its assets**\n\nThe Information Systems Department has introduced safety and security procedures for ensuring the quality and security of the Group's operations, even in the event of major difficulties.\n\nThe process of monitoring all capital expenditure, conducted jointly by the Purchasing, Management Control and Insurance Departments, contributes to keeping a close watch over the Group's tangible assets and safeguarding their value in use through appropriate insurance cover.\n\nAlthough devolved to the various operating divisions, client accounts are nonetheless subject to monthly reporting to the Group's Finance Department, which is responsible for identifying the main client default risks and taking remedial action along with the divisions.\n\nThe Group's cash flow is monitored by:\n\n- daily notification of the divisions' cash flow figures;\n- monthly updates to the Group's cash flow forecasts;\n- optimization of exchange rate and interest rate risks (studied by the Risk Committee, which meets semi-annually under the authority of Executive management);\n- the availability of short-, medium- or long-term credit from financial partners.\n- decentralization of a portion of the consolidation restatements at operational division or company level, allowing the accounting treatment to be positioned as closely as possible to the operational flows.\n\n# **Financial reporting process**\n\nThe Group's Cash and Management Control Departments organize and monitor the reporting of monthly financial information and indicators from the divisions and, in particular, their income statements and net debt reports. Within each division, the financial reporting details are validated by its Executive management and forwarded by its Finance Department. The figures are submitted in a standardized format that complies with the rules and standards for consolidation, making it easier to crosscheck against the items in the half-yearly and annual consolidated financial statements. Specific reports for each of these are forwarded to the Group's Executive management. The monthly financial reports are supplemented by budget reviews throughout the year in order to update the year's targets in accordance with the latest figures.\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.5.5.5. LIMITATION OF RISK RELATED TO PUBLICLY-TRADED SECURITIES**\n\n# **Stock market ethics rules**\n\nIn accordance with European regulation no. 596/2014 of April 16, 2014 on market abuse (known as the MAR) and the AMF \"Guide on ongoing disclosure and management of insider information\", published on October 26, 2016 and updated on April 29, 2021, the Group regularly updates the list of people with access to inside information that, if it were made public, could have a significant influence on the price of financial instruments.\n\nThese individuals (employees, directors or third parties in a close professional relationship with the company) are notified of the ban on using or disclosing such price-sensitive information with a view to any purchase or sale of these instruments.\n\nIn addition, information is regularly disseminated on article 19.11 of MAR, which prohibits any person discharging managerial responsibilities from carrying out transactions on their own behalf or on behalf of third parties during \"closed\" periods.\n\nThese transactions are prohibited for a period of thirty calendar days before the publication of the company's half-yearly and annual financial statements, including the publication date, as well as for a period of fifteen calendar days preceding the publication date of the company's quarterly revenue, up to and including this day.\n\nTo limit exposure to the risks associated with regulations and their changes and litigation, the Group's Legal Department sees to the security and legal compliance of the Group's activities, in liaison with the divisions' legal departments. When a lawsuit arises, the Group's Legal Department ensures that it is settled in the Group's best interests.\n\n# **1.5.6. RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**\n\nIn accordance with the AMF's reference framework definition, risk management is a dynamic system, defined and implemented under the company's responsibility, which enables the company to:\n\n- create and preserve the company's value, assets and reputation;\n- secure decision-making and corporate processes to facilitate the achievement of company objectives;\n- promote consistency between the company's actions and its values;\n- unite company employees behind a shared vision of the main risks.\n\nUnder this framework, risk management covers the following elements:\n\n- an organizational framework that defines roles and responsibilities, a risk management policy and an information system that allows risk information to be disseminated internally;\n- a three-stage risk management process: risk identification, risk analysis and risk management;\n- continuous supervision of the risk management system with regular monitoring and review.\n\n# **1.5.7. CONTROL ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THESE RISKS**\n\n# **1.5.7.1. RISK MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING RULES**\n\nLitigation and risks are monitored by each division. The Legal Department and the Insurance Department, for managing claims, also provide assistance in all major disputes, as well as on every draft contract of major financial significance. Finally, risk management methods are subject to regular in-depth reviews by the Risk Committee.\n\n# **1.5.7.2. SCOPE OF DEPLOYMENT OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**\n\nThe internal control procedures cover all of Compagnie de l'Odet, Bolloré SE and its consolidated subsidiaries, excluding Vivendi, which has its own internal control and risk management system (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 3, section 2. \"Internal control and risk management\"). Regarding acquisitions, in addition to the internal procedures already in place within the companies concerned, procedures are gradually harmonized and internal control and risk management mechanisms are gradually deployed.\n\n# **1.5.8. OPERATION AND MONITORING OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM**\n\n# **1.5.8.1. THE MAIN PARTICIPANTS IN INTERNAL CONTROL AND THEIR TASKS**\n\nThe arrangements for exercising internal control are implemented by:\n\n# **The Board of Directors of the Group's parent company**\n\nThe Board of Directors monitors the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems as determined and implemented by Executive management. If need be, the Board can use its own general powers to undertake such actions and verification work as it sees fit.\n\n# **The Group's Executive management**\n\nExecutive management is responsible for specifying, implementing and monitoring suitable and effective internal control and risk management systems. In the event of any deficiency in the systems, it ensures that the necessary remedial measures are taken.\n\n# **The Monthly Results Committee**\n\nEach division submits a monthly report to the Group's Executive management and central departments detailing, for all companies within its scope, the operational and financial indicators for its business as well as an analysis of the evolving trends with reference to the targets approved by Executive management.\n\n# **The Audit Committee**\n\nThe role, remit and mission of this Committee are set forth in the report of the Board of Directors on corporate governance prepared in accordance with article L. 225-37 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)*. This Committee meets twice a year.\n\n# **The Ethics, CSR and Anticorruption Committee**\n\nThis Committee meets once or twice a year. Its objective is to ratify priorities in terms of ethics and compliance and to review CSR performance. It determines the outlook, projects and action plans to be implemented within the divisions with regard to priority CSR risks and opportunities.\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **The Risk Committee**\n\nThe Risk Committee is in charge of carrying out a regular and in-depth review of risk management methods. This Committee, which meets at least twice a year, consists of the Group's Executive management, the Finance, Legal, Insurance, Compliance, Risk, CSR, GDPR and Internal Audit Departments, and the operational divisions depending on the agenda.\n\n# **Subsidiaries' governing bodies**\n\nThe governing body of each Group subsidiary considers the company's strategy and policies as put forward by Executive management, monitors their implementation, sets operational targets, allocates resources and carries out verification and control work as it sees fit. All officers receive all the information needed to carry out their assignments and may request any documents they consider useful.\n\n# **The subsidiaries' management**\n\nThey apply the directions given by the governing bodies within their own subsidiaries. With the assistance of their management control departments, they ensure that the Group's internal control system operates effectively. They report to their own governing bodies and also to the management committees.\n\n# **Group Internal Audit**\n\nThe Group has an Internal Audit Department, reporting to the Group's Executive management, operating in all entities within the scope (excluding Vivendi, which has its own internal audit department).\n\nThe Department carries out internal audits with a systematic review of financial and operational risks, audits to monitor and implement the recommendations made, and more targeted assignments according to the needs expressed by the divisions or Executive management. It has a dedicated team that performs compliance audits with a short-term objective of assessing the implementation of the Sapin II law, and which will ultimately be responsible for auditing all compliance matters (GDPR, duty of care, CSRD).\n\nIt works on an annual plan put together with the help of the divisions and Executive management, based on evaluation of the risks affecting each subsidiary and a cyclical audit for the whole Group.\n\nAs a priority, it aims to cover the most sensitive risks and to review the other major risks in the medium term for all Group entities. The auditors receive internal training in the divisional business lines so that they can better understand the operational particularities of each one.\n\nIt is the Internal Audit Department's responsibility to assess the functioning of the internal control system and to make any recommendations for its improvement within the scope of its responsibility. Audit reports are sent to the companies audited, the divisions to which they are attached and to Executive management.\n\n# **1.5.9. STATUTORY AUDITORS AND INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES**\n\nIn accordance with their appointment to review and certify the financial statements, and in accordance with their professional standards, the Statutory Auditors acquaint themselves with the accounting and internal control systems. They accordingly carry out interim investigations assessing the operational methods used in the various audit cycles that have been decided on; they guarantee the proper application of generally accepted accounting principles, with the aim of producing accurate and precise information. They submit a half-year summary of the conclusions of their work to the Finance Department, the Group's Executive management and the Audit Committee.\n\n<span id=\"page-163-0\"></span>The Group's financial statements are certified jointly by Wolff et Associés (appointed by the Ordinary General Meeting of May 25, 2022), represented by Patrick Wolff, and AEG Finances (reappointed by the Combined General Meeting of May 29, 2019), represented by Samuel Clochard.\n\nFor the corporate social and environmental transparency obligations, EY & Associés, represented by Philippe Aubain, is the independent thirdparty appointed to verify the non-financial performance statement. This verification consists in verifying the existence of policies, action plans and performance monitoring indicators to ensure an internal due diligence approach that mitigates risks in the conduct of all the Group's activities and in all the areas in which it operates. Following its work, the independent third-party body issues a limited assurance opinion on the compliance of the non-financial performance statement and the truthfulness of the information provided.\n\n# **1.6. Compliance**\n\n# **1.6.1. COMPLIANCE PROGRAM**\n\n# **1.6.1.1. NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT**\n\nThis point is covered in detail in chapter 2.\n\n# **1.6.1.2. ANTICORRUPTION**\n\nThis point is covered in detail in the non-financial performance statement in chapter 2, section 1.2.2.1.\n\n# **1.6.1.3. THE FIGHT AGAINST TAX EVASION**\n\nThis point is covered in detail in the non-financial performance statement in chapter 2, section 1.2.2.1.3.\n\n# **1.6.1.4. DUTY OF CARE PLAN**\n\nThis point is covered in detail in chapter 2, \"Bolloré Group's non-financial performance\", section 2 – Duty of care plan.\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Corporate governance\n\n| 1.    | Administrative and management bodies

This decision must be made in the event of any appointment or renewal of the term of office of the Chairman or Chief Executive Officer.

At its meeting of May 25, 2022, the Board of Directors, having noted the reappointment of Vincent Bolloré as a director, decided to maintain the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as a single office.\n\nIt was considered that this type of governance corresponds to the company's guidelines and its shareholding structure. It is also part of discussions on\n\nthe organization of governance within the Group.\n\n# **1.3. Powers and possible limitations by the Board of Directors of the powers of the Chief Executive Officer (article L. 22-10-10, 3° of the French commercial code** *[Code de commerce]***)**\n\nIf the Board of Directors chooses not to separate the functions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman assumes, under his/her responsibility, the company's Executive management.\n\nSubject to the powers accorded by law to General Meetings and to the Board of Directors and within the scope of the company's corporate purpose, the Chief Executive Officer, in his capacity as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is granted the broadest powers to act in the name of the company in all circumstances. He represents the company in its dealings with third parties.

He/she ensures the proper functioning of the corporate bodies and ensures in particular that the directors are able to fulfill their missions.\n\nOn March 14, 2024, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was granted the authority by the Board to issue bonds, endorsements and guarantees to third parties on behalf of the company for a period of one year for the Group's day-to-day operations, up to an overall limit of two hundred million euros (200,000,000 euros), it being specified that an unlimited amount of bonds, endorsements and guarantees may be granted to the tax and customs authorities.\n\nThe balance of powers within the Board is based on its composition, its diversity, the profiles and experience of its members, as well as those of the two Committees designated to support the Board – the Audit Committee and the Compensation and Appointments Committee. The involvement of the directors, as well as the attendance rate at the meetings, contributes fully to the balance of powers.\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-166-0\"></span>**1.4.

FAMILY TIES BETWEEN DIRECTORS**\n\nSébastien Bolloré, Yannick Bolloré, Cyrille Bolloré and Marie Bolloré are the children of Vincent Bolloré. Cédric de Bailliencourt is the nephew of Vincent Bolloré.\n\n# **1.7.2. CONVICTIONS FOR FRAUD, BANKRUPTCY OR PUBLIC SANCTIONS IMPOSED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS**\n\nTo the best of the company's knowledge, over the course of the last five years, no member of the Board of Directors:\n\n• has been convicted of fraud;\n\n<span id=\"page-170-1\"></span>• has been associated with any bankruptcy, receivership or liquidation;\n\n- has been officially charged or sanctioned by the statutory or regulatory authorities;\n- has been disqualified by a court from serving on a Board of Directors, a Management Board or a Supervisory Board of a company issuing stock or from acting in the management or the conduct of such a company's affairs.\n\n# **1.8. Corporate Governance Code**\n\nThe Group refers to the French Corporate Governance Code for listed companies established by the Afep and the Medef and revised in December 2022.\n\nAt its meeting of March 14, 2024, the members of the Board of Directors, after reviewing the recommendations submitted for annual review, confirmed that the company will continue to use the Afep-Medef Code as a reference tool.\n\nIn accordance with the \"comply or explain\" rule set out in article 28.1 of the Afep-Medef Code, the company considers that its corporate governance structure complies with the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code.\n\nThe Afep-Medef Code makes a distinction between corporate officers (Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Executive Officer, Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and members of the Management Board, managers of limited partnerships) and non-executive corporate officers (separate Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Supervisory Board of public limited companies with a Management Board or of limited partnerships).\n\nThe Code's recommendations must therefore be considered having regard to the precise nature of the position held, it being noted that the term \"corporate officer\" encompasses all the senior executives listed above and, where noted, directors and members of the Supervisory Board.\n\n# **1.8.1. RECOMMENDATIONS SUBJECTED TO A SPECIFIC REVIEW**\n\n# **1.8.1.1. EQUITY HOLDING OBLIGATION**\n\nAt its meeting on March 14, 2024, the Board of Directors recognized that the minimum number of company shares that the corporate officers are required to hold, as decided by the Board at its meeting of March 20, 2014 (i.e. 30 shares), had been met.\n\n# **1.8.1.2. CUMULATIVE MANDATES**\n\nAt its meeting of March 14, 2024, the Board of Directors, having been reminded of the provisions relating to multiple corporate offices, examined the situations of Vincent Bolloré, Chief Executive Officer, and Sébastien Bolloré, Deputy Chief Executive Officer, in this respect.\n\nThe Afep-Medef Code calls for different rules concerning the concurrent holding of offices depending on what position a company officer holds.\n\nFor executive corporate officers, article 20 of the Afep-Medef Code states that the number of directorships that may be exercised by the executive corporate officer in listed companies outside his or her Group, including non-French companies, should be limited to two, it being specified that the limit of two offices does not apply \"to directorships held by an executive corporate officer in subsidiaries and shareholdings, held alone or together with others, of companies whose main activity is to acquire and manage such shareholdings\".\n\nThe application guide for the Afep-Medef Code confirmed the following details previously provided for applying this exemption:\n\n- it is attached to a person, in view of the time that he or she is in a position to devote to exercising an office;\n- it concerns persons who hold a position as corporate officer in a listed company whose main activity is to acquire or manage shareholdings;\n- it applies to each of the listed companies in which the corporate officer holds an office, whenever they are subsidiaries and shareholdings, directly or indirectly held solely or in concert by the company whose main activity is to acquire or manage shareholdings in which he or she exercises a term of office as corporate officer;\n- it does not apply to a corporate officer of a listed company whose main activity is not to acquire or manage holdings (i.e. an operating company) with regard to their offices held in listed companies in which a subsidiary of the company in which they are an executive holds a stake and is itself a holding company.\n\nThe Board of Directors took note:\n\n- that Vincent Bolloré does not hold any other office within the Group's listed companies;\n- that the directorships held by Sébastien Bolloré within the Group constitute an exception;\n- that the directorships held by the corporate officers in listed entities outside their Group fall within the exemption, except for those for which not enough of the share capital is held to characterize them as either subsidiaries or equity investments.\n\nAccordingly, the corporate offices that Vincent Bolloré holds within companies of the Socfin group (39.75% of whose capital is indirectly owned by Compagnie de l'Odet as at December 31, 2023) are covered by the exemption provided in the Afep-Medef Code. The same applies to those exercised by Sébastien Bolloré in Vivendi, Bigben Interactive and Nacon.\n\nAs such, the executive corporate officers of Compagnie de l'Odet, whose purpose is to acquire or manage company holdings, may hold positions in entities outside their group as long as they are Compagnie de l'Odet subsidiaries or holdings (direct or indirect).\n\nAccordingly, the corporate officers' situation is compliant with the Afep-Medef provisions concerning the holding of multiple corporate offices.\n\nMoreover, on March 14, 2024, the Board of Directors noted the compliance of the situation of its corporate officers with regard to the legal provisions governing the non-cumulative nature of offices held applicable to individuals who hold a corporate office in France.\n\nFinally, the Board noted that, in accordance with recommendation 20.2 of the Afep-Medef Code, the corporate officers must obtain the opinion of the members of the Board prior to accepting a new term of office in a listed company outside their group.\n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.8.1.3. AMENDMENTS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS' INTERNAL RULES OF PROCEDURE**\n\n# **Shares owned and held by members of the Board of Directors (article 21 of the Afep-Medef Code)**\n\nAt its meeting on March 20, 2014, the Board of Directors adopted, in its internal rules of procedure, provisions relative to the requirement that directors hold and retain shares.\n\n# **1.8.1.4. DEFINITION OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR**\n\nBeing required to state its view with respect to the independence criteria for directors, the Board, acting at its meeting on March 14, 2024 on a proposal by the Compensation and Appointments Committee, confirmed its previous analysis.\n\nThus, for the determination of the status of independent director, it was decided:\n\n- to set aside the length of service criterion of twelve years since the sole criterion of the term of a director's duties does not, as such, call his/her independence into question;\n- to consider that acting as a director in another company within the Group does not call a director's independence into question.\n- To be classified as independent, a director must not:\n- be an employee or corporate officer of the company/employee, executive corporate officer of a fully consolidated company/employee, executive\n\n# **1.8.1.5. REVIEW OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF DIRECTORS**\n\nOf the 15 members of the Board of Directors and in accordance with the independence criteria confirmed by the Board of Directors at its meeting on March 14, 2024, Ingrid Brochard, Hubert Fabri, Janine Goalabré, Alain Moynot, Olivier Roussel and Martine Studer are considered independent.\n\nTo comply with the internal rules of procedure, each director is required to allocate at least 10% of the compensation received for performing their duties as a director to purchasing Compagnie de l'Odet securities each year until the value of his/her number of shares reaches the equivalent of one year of compensation received.\n\ncorporate officer of the company's parent company or a company that is fully consolidated by that parent company/or have been in the previous five years;\n\n- be a client, supplier, investment banker, corporate banker or advisor: – significant to the company or its Group,\n\t- or for which the company or its Group represent a significant proportion of the business;\n- have a close family tie with a corporate officer/director/member of the Supervisory Board;\n- have been an auditor of the company within the previous five years.\n\nThe provisions of the Corporate Governance Code for listed companies not applied by our company are set out in a summary table in section 4.1.9.\n\nThe summary hereinafter shows the situation (compliant or not) of the directors in relation to the criteria defined by the Afep-Medef Code in relation to directors' independence.\n\n| Independent directors |\n|-----------------------|\n| Ingrid Brochard       |\n| Hubert Fabri(1)(2)    |\n| Janine Goalabré(1)    |\n| Alain Moynot(2)       |\n| Olivier Roussel(1)(2) |\n| Martine Studer(1)     |\n\n(1) Notwithstanding the exercise of a corporate office as director in another company of the Group (or during the last five fiscal years).\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the length of time during which the director has held office.\n\n# **1.8.1.6. LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR**\n\nOn March 14, 2024 the Board of Directors confirmed that it was not appointing a lead independent director.\n\nIt was the view of the Board that the measures already taken ensure that the Board will function properly (including the duties given to the Committees and the Vice-Chairmen, the application of the Board's internal rules of procedure concerning conflicts of interest, and the Board's self-assessment process).\n\nWith respect to interactions with the stakeholders, direct discussions with the Group's senior executives have always been given priority. Communication with shareholders occurs either directly with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or with the departments in charge of financial communications and shareholder relations.\n\n# **1.8.1.7. ASSESSMENT OF THE MATERIALITY OF A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH A DIRECTOR**\n\nThe Board of Directors, at its meeting on March 14, 2024, upon the proposal of the Compensation and Appointments Committee, reaffirmed that the assessment of the materiality of business relationships must not exclusively be based on the amount of the commercial transactions that may be entered into between the Bolloré Group and the company (or the group) in which the director in question holds another position, keeping in mind that the materiality threshold for business relationships decided upon by the Board is deemed to have been attained whenever the amount of commercial transactions exceeds 1% of Group revenue for the fiscal year in question.\n\nThe Board, at its meeting of March 23, 2017, decided that, pursuant to the provisions of AMF Recommendation no. 2012-02, priority would be given to multiple criteria in the process of assessing the materiality of a business relationship with a director, particularly the duration of the relationship, any potential economic dependence, the financial conditions in relation to market prices, the officer's position in the co-contracting company and his/ her involvement in the implementation or performance of the business relationship.\n\nThe Board of Directors, at its meeting on March 14, 2024, in accordance with AMF Recommendation no 2012-02 amended on December 14, 2023, confirmed its position and noted that none of the directors described as independent had significant direct or indirect business relationships with the Group.\n\n{172}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.8.1.8. MANAGEMENT OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST**\n\n<span id=\"page-172-0\"></span>Section 21 of the December 2022 revision of the Afep-Medef Corporate Governance Code, \"Ethical rules for directors\", provides that a director must inform the Board of any conflict of interest, even potential, and must abstain from related discussions and voting on the issue.\n\nTo this effect, the Board of Directors, at its meeting on March 14, 2024, was reminded that these obligations are written into the Board's internal rules of procedure and that the directors are obliged to disclose any situation presenting a conflict of interests, even if it is only potential. It was noted that directors must declare the absence of conflicts of interest at least once a year during the preparation of the universal registration document.\n\n# **1.9. Information on corporate governance (article L. 22-10-10, 4° of the French commercial code** *[Code de commerce]***)**\n\nOn March 14, 2024, the Board of Directors of Compagnie de l'Odet was asked to confirm that the company continued to use the Afep-Medef Corporate Governance Code as a reference.\n\nSome of the recommendations in that Code are reviewed each year by the Board of Directors, and those not selected for application are included in the table below.\n\nThis Corporate Governance Code may be viewed on the Medef website (www.medef.com/fr).\n\n| Afep-Medef Code<br>recommendations

Afep-Medef considers<br>that a director is not<br>independent if he/she has<br>exercised his/her<br>corporate office for over<br>twelve years. | The length of service criterion of twelve years is set aside since the term of a director's duties does not as such call his or<br>her independence into question.<br>The Board of Directors conducts an annual review of each director's situation in this respect.<br>Accordingly, at its meeting held on March 14, 2024, the Board confirmed that, irrespective of the term of directors' duties, it<br>valued the personal qualities, experience, and industrial and financial expertise enabling directors to give useful opinions<br>and advice through exchanges in which they can express their position.<br>Moreover, it should not be forgotten that the length of service improves understanding of the Group, its history and its<br>different jobs within a Group comprising many very technical jobs on an international scale.<br>The perfect understanding of the Group by a director through his length of service is a major asset, particularly when<br>examining the strategic directions of the Group, or the implementation of complex projects or projects involving new<br>businesses without altering the director's capacity with regard to Management's decisions.<br>A length of service of twelve years cannot be associated with a loss of independence. |\n| The same is true if a<br>director exercises a<br>corporate office in a<br>subsidiary company.                                                      | Acting as a director in another company within the Group does not call a director's independence into question.<br>The Board feels that the Bolloré Group, controlled by the founding family, is unusual in that it is diversified across a number<br>of businesses, with operations in France and abroad.<br>One of the Group's strategic directions is to optimize and develop synergies between its various businesses.<br>In order to implement this strategy, it is necessary to have high-level managerial expertise combined with in-depth<br>knowledge of all the Group's businesses and understanding of any geopolitical issues critical to the international<br>operations.<br>In addition, directors holding office in a parent company as well as in one of its subsidiaries are invited to abstain from<br>taking part in decisions made by the Board of Directors of the parent company in the event of a conflict of interest between<br>the parent company and the subsidiary.

ORGANIZATION OF THE BOARD'S WORK**\n\nTwo weeks before the Board meets, a convening notice is sent to each director together with a draft of the minutes of the previous meeting, so that they can make any comments on the draft before the actual Board meeting. This allows the Board meeting to be devoted to discussing the agenda.\n\nFor each Board meeting, a complete report setting forth each of the items on the agenda is submitted to all the directors, who may request any other information that they consider useful. Discussions are conducted with the constant aim of encouraging an exchange between all the directors on the basis of complete information, and with careful attention to keeping the discussion focused on the important issues, especially those of a strategic nature.\n\nDuring the 2023 fiscal year, the Board met five times and was called upon to give its opinion on points that included the following:\n\n# **• Meeting on March 14, 2023 (attendance rate: 100%):**\n\n- review and approval of the consolidated financial statements for the 2022 fiscal year;\n- review and approval of the annual financial statements for the 2022 financial year;\n- management report;\n- 2023 projected income statement 2023 forecast financing plan reports;\n- proposed allocation of income for the fiscal year;\n- governance;\n- compensation policy for corporate officers;\n- review of the extent to which the performance criteria relating to the variable compensation of corporate officers have been met;\n- preparation of the Combined General Shareholders' Meeting convening – agenda set-up – reports – draft Resolutions;\n- implementation of the process for assessing current agreements;\n\n# **1.10.4.

Presentation of the compensation policy for corporate officers, directors and members of the Supervisory Board for the 2024 fiscal year, drafted pursuant to article L. 22-10-8 of the French commercial code** *(Code de commerce)*\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of article L. 22-10-8 section I of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* the compensation policy for corporate officers, directors and members of the Supervisory Board must be in line with the company's corporate interests, contribute to its sustainability and be part of its business strategy.\n\nThe compensation policy for corporate officers, directors and members of the Supervisory Board is set by the Board of Directors based on the recommendations of the Compensation and Appointments Committee.\n\nIn the course of their discussions, the Board of Directors and Compensation and Appointments Committee take note of and rigorously apply to all components of compensation the principles of completeness, balance between compensation components, comparability, consistency the intelligibility of rules and moderation. In accordance with article L. 22-10-8 section II of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* the compensation policy must be the subject of a draft resolution submitted to the Ordinary General Meeting. It must be voted on every year and whenever a major change is made to the compensation policy. If the Ordinary General Meeting does not approve the draft resolution submitted to it and if it has previously approved a compensation policy, then the latter continues to apply and the Board of Directors must submit to the next Ordinary General Meeting a draft resolution containing a revised compensation policy and\n\nstating in what way the shareholders' vote and any opinions expressed by the\n\nMeeting were taken into account. Should the resolution presented be voted down and if no compensation policy has previously been approved, then the compensation shall be set in accordance with that of the preceding fiscal year or, in the absence of compensation granted for the preceding fiscal year, in accordance with the company's existing practices. The Board of Directors must submit to the next Ordinary General Meeting a draft resolution presenting a revised compensation policy.\n\n# **2.1.1. WITH REGARD TO THE COMPENSATION POLICY FOR MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS**\n\nPursuant to article L. 225-45 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)*, the General Shareholders' Meeting may allocate to the Board directors in compensation for their work a fixed yearly sum that the Meeting determines without being bound by statutory provisions or by previous decisions. How it is apportioned among the directors is determined by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe maximum overall amount of compensation that the Board of Directors may allocate to its members during a fiscal year was set by the Ordinary General Meeting of May 28, 2020 at an amount of five hundred thousand euros (500,000 euros).\n\nThe gross amount (before taxes and withholdings) paid to the directors for the 2023 fiscal year was 487,525 euros.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Compensation and Appointments Committee, the Board of Directors voted at its meeting on March 14, 2024, to add to the meeting's agenda a resolution on increasing the annual amount of directors' compensation to 800,000 euros and to renew the terms and conditions for distributing this compensation so that part of it is correlated with the participation in Board meetings and thus to apply the following distribution rule:\n\n• payment of a portion related to membership of the Board (if applicable, pro rata to the duration of his/her term of office over the year in question) equivalent to half of the compensation.\n\nFor 2024 and subsequent fiscal years until a new decision by the Board, this portion is set at 17,000 euros per fiscal year;\n\n• and a portion related to the effective participation of the director in Board meetings.\n\nFor 2024 and subsequent fiscal years until a new decision by the Board, this portion is set at 4,250 euros per meeting.\n\nThe portions tied to membership of the Board and to actual attendance at meetings are capped at a gross maximum amount per director per calendar year.\n\nFor fiscal year 2024 and subsequent years until a new decision by the Board, this cap is set at 34,000 euros per director.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors voted that each member of the Audit Committee will continue to receive specific yearly compensation of \n\n{177}------------------------------------------------\n\n10,000 euros deducted from the total amount of compensation allocated to the Board of Directors.\n\nApart from this compensation, the Board of Directors has the right, in accordance with the provisions of articles L. 225-46 and L. 22-10-15 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* to allocate exceptional compensation to directors for the duties or mandates it entrusts to them.\n\nMembers of the Board of Directors holding an executive corporate office within an affiliated company or holding an employment contract with the company may benefit, if applicable, from the granting of free shares, under the conditions provided for in article L. 225-197-1 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)* or share subscription or purchase options pursuant to articles L. 277- 177 et seq. of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce).*\n\nThe draft resolution on the compensation policy for members of the Board of Directors will be submitted to a vote of the shareholders in the Combined General Meeting of June 14, 2024 under the following terms:\n\n# \"TWELFTH RESOLUTION\n\n**(Approval of the compensation policy for directors established by the Board of Directors – ex ante vote)**\n\nThe General Shareholders' Meeting, acting under the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings and having reviewed the report on the company's corporate governance called for by article L. 225-37 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)* describing the components of the compensation policy for corporate officers, directors and members of the Supervisory Board, approves, pursuant to article L. 22-10-8 section II of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* the compensation policy for directors as it appears in the universal registration document.\"\n\n# **2.1.2. WITH REGARD TO THE COMPENSATION POLICY FOR THE CORPORATE OFFICERS**\n\nThe Board of Directors decided on March 14, 2024 to pursue a compensation policy including a variable component likely to promote the implementation of strategic guidelines and long-term value creation in line with the interests of all stakeholders.\n\nAt its meeting on March 14, 2024, the Board of Directors also decided to maintain the alignment of the compensation structures for corporate officers, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer.\n\n# **2.1.3. WITH REGARD TO THE COMPENSATION OF THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER**\n\nThe compensation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer currently has the following different components:\n\n# **FIXED COMPENSATION**\n\nFixed compensation is determined on the basis of the responsibilities and duties attached to the corporate office.\n\nIt serves as a basis for calculating the maximum percentage of target annual variable compensation.\n\nThe Board of Directors at its meeting of March 14, 2024, having noted the recommendations of the Compensation and Appointments Committee and based on the studies relating to compensation for comparable positions, decided to renew the fixed compensation paid to Vincent Bolloré at an annual gross amount of 900,000 euros for the current and subsequent financial years until a new decision by the Board.\n\nIn addition, entertainment, travel, hospitality and security costs related to the performance of their duties may be reimbursed if supporting documents are provided or paid directly if invoices are provided.\n\n# **VARIABLE COMPENSATION**\n\nAnnual variable compensation seeks to reward officers' performance over the year.\n\nAt its meeting on March 14, 2024, the Board of Directors decided that the annual variable compensation will be based on quantifiable and qualitative criteria. The annual variable compensation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may represent one hundred percent (100%) of the fixed component if the objectives are met one hundred per cent (100%).\n\nAnnual variable compensation is based on the achievement of quantifiable objectives and qualitative objectives. These two types of objectives, set at the beginning of each period in question, are communicated to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and account for 2/3 and 1/3 of variable compensation, respectively.\n\n# **WITH REGARD TO VARIABLE COMPENSATION CRITERIA (QUANTIFIABLE PORTION)**\n\nThe quantifiable financial criteria relate to i) the value of Compagnie de l'Odet's portfolio, both in terms of its own performance and that which is attributable to changes in the SBF 120 index, and ii) Group EBITA, each of which accounts for 1/3 of the \"target\" variable compensation.\n\n# **WITH REGARD TO VARIABLE COMPENSATION CRITERIA (QUALITATIVE PORTION)**\n\nThe qualitative criteria that represent 1/3 of the \"target\" variable compensation are subject to four based on four CSR themes, including one theme linked to the Group's commitment to climate issues.\n\nThese indicators are as follows:\n\n- support for the continuation of Bolloré SE's story, particularly through the dissemination of its culture and the promotion of its values;\n- the company's commitment to a social policy that promotes gender equality at Compagnie de l'Odet;\n- the development of the company's CSR policy, in particular by continuing to immplement its FA Mayday project;\n- the company's commitment to climate issues through training and raising awareness of the issues involved in tackling global warming and reducing its carbon footprint.\n\nEach of these themes is assigned an identical coefficient to determine the level of achievement of the qualitative portion of variable compensation.\n\n# **COMPENSATION RELATED TO HIS PARTICIPATION IN THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS**\n\nThe Chairman and Chief Executive Officer receives, as do all directors, compensation based on participation in the Board of Directors. This compensation allocated to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer shall be distributed according to the same terms as the directors.\n\n# **OTHER BENEFITS OR COMPENSATION**\n\nWithin the framework of his duties, the corporate officer has a company car. The insurance, maintenance and fuel costs are covered by the company.\n\n{178}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **LONG-TERM COMPENSATION**\n\n# **OBJECTIVES OF THE LONG-TERM COMPENSATION POLICY**\n\nAt the meeting of March 4, 2021, the Board of Directors decided, taking into account strategic and organizational guidelines, to strengthen the compensation policy within the company in order to integrate long-term compensation mechanisms to foster the involvement and loyalty of managers.\n\nAs this compensation mechanism was particularly suited to the functions of senior executives, given their involvement and the level of responsibility\n\n# **SYSTEMS IMPLEMENTED**\n\nIn order to be able to implement this policy, the Board has the option, under the authorizations granted by the Combined General Meeting on May 26, 2021, to allocate free shares and options for share subscription (new shares of the company to be issued by way of a capital increase) or the purchase of shares (existing shares of the company) to employees and corporate officers, directors and members of the Supervisory Board of the company and associated companies.\n\nAs such, the Board of Directors has the right to grant corporate officers:\n\n# i) **performance shares.**\n\nThe total number of shares to be granted may not represent more than 2% of the share capital, and shares granted to corporate officers are limited to a sub-ceiling of 1%.\n\nThe allocation of shares to their beneficiaries will be final at the end of a vesting period of two years, which is then not subject to any holding period. ii) **share subscription or purchase options.**\n\nThe maximum number of options that may be granted by the Board of Directors shall not give the right to subscribe or acquire a number of shares attached to their duties, the Board wanted to include a long-term component in the overall compensation of its senior executives that would serve the interests of all stakeholders, including the shareholders, and considered that it would be appropriate to have several long-term compensation mechanisms in order to mix them or choose the most appropriate depending on the circumstances, where applicable.\n\nrepresenting more than 2% of the share capital, and shares granted to corporate officers are limited to a sub-ceiling of 1%.\n\nThe subscription price or the acquisition price by the beneficiaries will be set by the Board of Directors as follows, it being specified that no discount will be applied when the share options are allocated:\n\n- for the subscription options, the price of the share subscription shall be determined on the day on which the options are granted, and shall not be lower than the average opening price of the company's shares listed on the regulated market Euronext Paris, or on any other market used as a substitute, during the twenty trading days preceding the allocation date;\n- in terms of the purchase options, the purchase price of the existing shares shall be determined on the day on which the options are granted, and shall not be lower than the value indicated above or the average purchase price of the shares held by the company pursuant to articles L. 225-208 and L. 22-10-62 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce).*\n\nThe duration of the exercise period of options granted, as approved by the Board, may not exceed four (4) years from the date they are allocated.\n\n# **PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS**\n\nFree shares and share subscription or purchase options allocated to the corporate officer will be subject in their entirety to performance conditions determined by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Appointments and Compensation Committee.\n\n# **ATTENDANCE CONDITIONS**\n\nThe vesting of the performance shares and the exercise of share subscription or purchase options is subject to the condition of the corporate officer's presence in the Group as of the vesting date and the date of exercise of the options.\n\n# **HOLDING REQUIREMENT**\n\nCorporate officers must hold a portion of the shares so granted or vested in registered form until they leave their position. The proportion will be set by the Board of Directors upon delegation.\n\nThe draft resolution concerning the compensation policy of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to be submitted to the shareholders' vote at the Combined General Meeting of June 14, 2024 is as follows:\n\n# \"THIRTEENTH RESOLUTION\n\n#### **(Approval of the compensation policy for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer established by the Board of Directors – ex ante say on pay)**\n\nThe General Shareholders' Meeting, acting under the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings, having reviewed the report on the company's corporate governance referred to by article L. 225-37 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)* describing the components of the compensation policy for corporate officers, approves, pursuant to article L. 22-10-8 II of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* the compensation policy for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as it appears in the universal registration document.\"\n\n# **2.1.4. WITH REGARD TO THE COMPENSATION OF THE DEPUTY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER**\n\nThe compensation policy for the Deputy Chief Executive Officer is as follows:\n\n# **FIXED COMPENSATION**\n\nOn March 14, 2024, the Board of Directors decided to renew the fixed compensation allocated to Sébastien Bolloré, in his capacity as Deputy Chief Executive Officer, at an annual gross amount of 900,000 euros for the current financial year and for subsequent financial years, until a new decision by the Board. In addition, entertainment, travel, hospitality and security costs related to the performance of their duties may be reimbursed if supporting documents are provided or paid directly if invoices are provided.\n\n{179}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **VARIABLE COMPENSATION**\n\nThe annual variable compensation of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer represents one hundred percent (100%) of the fixed component if the objectives are met one hundred percent (100%).\n\nAnnual variable compensation is based on the achievement of quantifiable objectives and qualitative objectives. These two types of objectives, set at the beginning of each period in question, are communicated to the Deputy Chief Executive Officer and account for 2/3 and 1/3 of variable compensation, respectively. The Board of Directors meeting of March 14, 2024, on the proposal of the Appointments and Compensation Committee, decided that the structure of the variable compensation of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer will continue to be aligned with that set for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The performance criteria for the variable portion of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer's compensation are as follows:\n\n# **WITH REGARD TO VARIABLE COMPENSATION CRITERIA (QUANTIFIABLE PORTION)**\n\nThe quantifiable financial criteria relate to i) the value of Compagnie de l'Odet's portfolio, both in terms of its own performance and that which is attributable to changes in the SBF 120 index, and ii) Group EBITA, each of which accounts for 1/3 of the \"target\" variable compensation.\n\n# **WITH REGARD TO VARIABLE COMPENSATION CRITERIA (QUALITATIVE PORTION)**\n\nThe qualitative criteria that represent 1/3 of the \"target\" variable compensation are subject to four indicators based on the following themes:\n\n- support for the continuation of Bolloré SE's story, particularly through the dissemination of its culture and the promotion of its values;\n- the company's commitment to a social policy that promotes gender equality at Compagnie de l'Odet;\n- the development of the company's CSR policy, in particular by continuing to immplement its FA Mayday project;\n- the company's commitment to climate issues through training and raising awareness of the issues involved in tackling global warming and reducing its carbon footprint.\n\nEach of these themes is assigned an identical coefficient to determine the level of achievement of the qualitative portion of variable compensation.\n\n# **COMPENSATION RELATED TO HIS PARTICIPATION IN THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS**\n\nThe Deputy Chief Executive Officer receives, as do all directors, compensation based on participation in the Board of Directors.

As in 2023, net commitments given remained at over 2 billion euros (see note 7.2 – Assets and contractual obligations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements) and mainly concern Groupe Canal+.\n\nIn Industry, the Group is continuing its R&D efforts in batteries and in the modernization of the equipment used in its Films businesses.\n\n# **1.3.3. PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURE**\n\n<span id=\"page-199-0\"></span>The Group has made future commitments due in more than one year in the framework of content assets which are detailed in note 7.2 – Assets and contractual content obligations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. These total more than 3.7 billion euros.\n\nIt intends to continue to grow by investing in all the sectors in which it operates.\n\n# <span id=\"page-199-1\"></span>**2. Research and development, patents and licenses**\n\n# **2.1. Research and development**\n\nFor many years, the Group has been committed to finding new activities. Research and development (R&D) is an essential element of the Group's industrial branch. This was demonstrated by the creation of the Blue Solutions division in October 2013.\n\nFor Group (excluding Vivendi), the R&D budget (including the subsidiary Blue Solutions) increased by 19.1% from 2022 to 2023, driven in particular by the R&D efforts of Blue Solutions. This confirms the Group's commitment to continue investing in R&D and, more specifically, to focus its R&D efforts on the next generations of all-solid batteries, which are experiencing very strong growth.\n\nFor Blue Solutions, the total amount of R&D spent on batteries was 23 million euros, with 11.6 million euros for Blue Solutions (formerly Batscap in Quimper) and 11.4 million euros for Blue Solutions Canada (formerly Bathium in Canada), including 1.8 million euros for its subsidiary Capacitor Sciences Inc. On the R&D side, efforts in 2023 were focused on the search for a new high potential electrolyte (known as Gen4) that can operate at ambient temperature, allowing access to the automotive market, particularly passenger cars, and offering rapid charging solutions for these vehicles. The Canadian and French teams are working in close collaboration on this project. The work covers the electrolyte as well as cathode materials (LMFP, NMC) and lithium thinning. These aspects are the keys that will enable Blue Solutions to offer its customers a battery cell with a density at least 40% higher than the best Li-ion batteries currently on the market.\n\nFor Capacitor Sciences Inc., in 2023, research efforts once again focused on improving the synthesis of new polymers intended to be introduced as a base element for the future high potential electrolyte with high conductivity at ambient temperature for the Gen4 project.\n\nFor Bluebus, R&D spending amounted to 2.6 million euros, focused on the optimization of thermal comfort and safety aspects of the vehicle.\n\nFor Bolloré Innovative Thin Films, R&D expenditure totaled 0.8 million euros. Its R&D efforts focused on the development of innovative solutions for food films and the launch of circular versions for packaging, and on the study of ultra-thin dielectric films or UTF (Ultra Thin Films) for capacitors intended for electric vehicles.\n\nIn 2023, IER continued to invest in the development of new products. A total of 1.2 million euros was invested in the optimization of identification and localization technologies (RFID, IoT, barcode, Wirepas, etc.) to enable intervention at all stages of the supply chain and to respond to the problems of various companies, and 0.6 million euros in the optimization of solutions for the electronic processing of fines, post-parking fees and other road-related penalties. IER also invested 4.8 million euros in the software and hardware optimization and development of innovative solutions for passenger processing in public transit stations and airports. Automatic Systems invested 5.6 million euros developing new products and optimizing existing products. At Vivendi, research and development efforts are detailed on pages 42, 46, 48, 50, 53, 59, 62, 65 of Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document.\n\n{200}------------------------------------------------\n\n| (in millions of euros)             | Change<br>2023-2022 | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018  | 2017  |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------|------|------|------|------|------|-------|-------|\n| Bolloré Films                      | 0                   | 0.8  | 0.8  | 0.7  | 0.6  | 0.6  | 0.6   | 0.6   |\n| Blue Solutions (France and Canada) | 47.2%               | 21.2 | 14.4 | 9.4  | 10   | 16   | 20.1  | 19.7  |\n| Capacitor Sciences Inc.            | 0                   | 1.8  | 1.8  | 1.4  | 1.6  | 3.1  | 4.3   | 7.5   |\n| Bluecar                            | 0                   | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 19.3 | 27.2  | 28.6  |\n| Bluestorage                        | -100%               | 0    | 0.8  | 1.5  | 2    | 2.5  | 10.6  | 13.7  |\n| Bluetram/Blueboat                  | 0                   | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0.4   | 0.8   |\n| Bluebus                            | 8.3%                | 2.6  | 2.4  | 5.4  | 6.4  | 7.1  | 13.5  | 19.9  |\n| IER(1)                             | 2.5%                | 12.2 | 11.9 | 11.8 | 11.9 | 9    | 9.8   | 10.6  |\n| Bolloré Telecom                    | -100%               | 0    | 0.5  | 3    | 11   | 19.2 | 19.2  | 19.6  |\n| TOTAL                              | 19.1%               | 38.6 | 32.6 | 33.2 | 43.5 | 76.8 | 105.7 | 121.0 |\n\n# **RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS**\n\n<span id=\"page-200-0\"></span>(1) Including Automatic Systems (5.6 million euros in 2023).\n\n# **2.2. Patents and licenses**\n\nThe Group's patent portfolio was stable between 2022 and 2023 (with a decrease of 5.8%), mainly due to the end of the protection period for some of the patent families for Blue Solutions Canada, the resumption of new filings for Blue Solutions France and Canada, and the streamlining of the Bluecarsharing portfolio.\n\nIn addition, the in-depth review of the Blue Solutions portfolio continued with the primary goal of maintaining a substantially constant portfolio of holdings with a strong legal scope and/or relevant geographical scope. This streamlining results from the Group's desire to optimize its expenditure on the management of its patent portfolios and to simultaneously increase its number of patent filings in order to build a portfolio of key intangible assets related to new developments for the new generation of Gen4 batteries (with a view to licensing its most promising technologies, mainly in the areas of batteries, buses and stationary applications). Blue Solutions' overall portfolio (France and Canada) was stable with a very slight decline of 4.3%.\n\n|                            | Patents filed in 2023 |                    | Total portfolio in effect |                      |                  |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|------------------|\n|                            | Total                 | Of which in France | 2023 (all countries)      | 2022 (all countries) | Change 2023-2022 |\n| Bolloré Films              | 0                     | 0                  | 9                         | 9                    | 0%               |\n| Blue Solutions             | 35                    | 2                  | 294                       | 257                  | 14.4%            |\n| Blue Solutions Canada Inc. | 17(2)                 | 2(1)               | 302(3)                    | 366(3)               | -17.5%           |\n| IER                        | 0                     | 0                  | 13                        | 17                   | -23.5%           |\n| Bluecarsharing             | 0                     | 0                  | 17                        | 26                   | -34.6%           |\n| Bluebus                    | 5                     | 0                  | 57                        | 60                   | -5%              |\n| Automatic Systems          | 0                     | 0                  | 4                         | 4                    | 0%               |\n| TOTAL                      | 57                    | 4                  | 696                       | 739                  | -5.8%            |\n\n(1) For Blue Solutions Canada, the United States saw the greatest number of filings, and not France.

Inflows related to the disposal of minority interests related to the sale of shares in Vivendi by Compagnie de Cornouaille for +177.2 million euros.\n\n# Impact of reclassification of discontinued operations and assets held for sale\n\nIn 2023, –122.5 million euros of the change corresponds to the reclassification of the net cash of Bolloré Logistics, which was the subject of a put option granted by the CMA CGM group on May 8, 2023 and which was actually disposed of on February 29, 2024, to assets and liabilities held for sale (see note 1 – Highlights), while –84.6 million euros corresponds to disbursements relating to the sale of Bolloré Africa Logistics in 2022 and –111.0 million euros corresponds to items relating to discontinued operations and assets held for sale at Vivendi (in particular relating to Editis).\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **5.1.5.

possibility of splitting Vivendi into several entities, each of which would be listed on the stock market, and structured around Groupe Canal+, Havas, a company combining publishing and distribution assets through the majority stake in the Lagardère group and the 100% stake in Prisma Media, and a company holding listed and unlisted financial interests in the culture, media and entertainment sectors.\n\nBy way of reminder, if Vivendi's Supervisory Board authorizes the Management Board to go ahead with the project, a number of important steps will have to be taken. These include consultation with the employee representative bodies of the entities concerned, before which no decision in principle may be taken, obtaining the necessary regulatory authorizations, the required approvals from the Vivendi group's creditors and the consent of Vivendi's shareholders at a General Meeting. As indicated in Vivendi's press release on December 13, 2023, such a transaction would take between twelve and eighteen months to complete.\n\nAccordingly, Vivendi may need to restructure its debt, and new financing may need to be arrangements. The availability of sufficient funding is one of the conditions for the proposed split, the feasibility of which is under review.\n\n# **COMBINATION WITH LAGARDÈRE**\n\n# Vivendi's investment in Lagardère\n\nBy way of reminder, as at December 31, 2022, Vivendi held 81,380,480 shares in Lagardère, representing 57.66% of Lagardère's share capital and 48.35% of the voting rights in Lagardère at that date.

OUTLOOK FOR THE GROUP IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT**\n\nThe Group remains vigilant about the current and potential consequences of the macroeconomic uncertainties, but remains confident about the resilience of its main business lines.\n\nThe uncertainties linked to the various ongoing global conflicts have had a significant impact on financial markets and raw material prices and has affected the global economy as a whole. The Group cannot accurately assess all the indirect consequences of these crises, but is constantly adapting to demonstrate resilience and ensure the continuity of its activities.\n\nIn 2023, the Group's cash position fell by –2,616 million euros, from a net cash position of +709 million euros as at December 31, 2022 to a net financial debt of –1,907 million euros as at December 31, 2023. This was mainly due to the full consolidation of Lagardère with effect from December 1, 2023 (see note 1 – Highlights) but also due to cash flows from ongoing activities, which amounted to 1,401 million euros. At the end of December 2023, the Group also had 8,259 million euros in confirmed and unused credit lines.\n\n{215}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-215-0\"></span>**NOTE 3.

CONSOLIDATION SCOPE**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\n# **• Consolidation scope**\n\nCompanies over which the Group exercises exclusive control are fully consolidated.\n\nGenerally, the control exercised by the Group is materialized by the holding of at least 50% of the capital and voting rights of the companies involved. However, in some cases, and in accordance with the criteria addressed by IFRS 10, the Group may consider that it controls entities in which it holds less than 50% of the capital and voting rights.\n\nIn the first half of 2023, Compagnie de Cornouaille sold 18.6 million shares in Vivendi SE, reducing the Group's percentage control over Vivendi SE to 30.04% as at December 31, 2023 (excluding treasury shares). This change in the Group's shareholding in Vivendi over the fiscal year does not call into question its role as the sole reference shareholder or the analysis of other facts and circumstances, allowing the Group to consider that its position of control over Vivendi, which began initiated on April 25, 2017 continues.\n\nThose companies on which the Group has a considerable influence are consolidated by the equity method.\n\nCompanies over which the Group has joint control by virtue of a contractual agreement with other shareholders are analyzed, whatever the percentage held, in order to define whether they are \"joint ventures\" or \"joint operations\" pursuant to the criteria defined by IFRS 11. \"Joint ventures\" are consolidated by the equity method, whereas \"joint operations\" are accounted for, where applicable, at the level of the control directly held over the partnership's assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Group did not identify any joint operations as at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Group assesses, on a case-by-case basis in respect of each shareholding, all of the details enabling the type of control exercised by it to be characterized and reviews this assessment if there are changes affecting governance or if facts and circumstances indicate a change in control exercised by the Group.\n\nPotential voting rights held in consolidated entities are analyzed on a caseby-case basis. In accordance with IFRS 10 \"Consolidated financial statements\", only the potential voting rights conferring, either alone or by virtue of other facts and circumstances, substantial rights over the entity are taken into account for the assessment of control. The Group then analyzes whether these potential rights enable it to have immediate access to the variable returns on the investment and then takes account of the holding resulting there from when calculating percentage interests. This is the case, for example, if there are reciprocal purchase or sale options that can be exercised at a fixed price and on the same date.\n\nCompanies that are of no significance either individually or collectively in relation to the consolidated financial statements are excluded from the consolidation scope. Their materiality is assessed before the end of each fiscal year.\n\n# **• Translation of the financial statements of non-French companies**\n\nThe financial statements of non-French companies whose operating currency is not the same as that in which the Group's consolidated financial statements are presented (euros), and which are not suffering hyperinflation, have been translated according to the \"closing date exchange rate\" method. Their balance-sheet items are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the close of the fiscal period, and profit and loss items at the average rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded under foreign currency translation adjustments in the consolidated reserves.\n\nGoodwill relating to non-French companies is regarded as part of the assets and liabilities acquired and accordingly translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the closing date.\n\n# **• Transactions in foreign currencies**\n\nForeign currency transactions are initially recognized in the entity's functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate for the entity's functional currency prevailing at the closing date. All differences are recorded in the net income for the period, with the exception of differences on borrowings in foreign currencies that are hedges of net investment in a foreign entity. These are directly charged to other income and expenses recognized directly in equity as long as the net investment is held.\n\n## **• Business combinations**\n\nAs at January 1, 2010, the Group has applied the provisions of the revised IFRS 3 \"Business combinations\".\n\nCombinations initiated after January 1, 2004 but before January 1, 2010 are entered in the accounts in accordance with the former version of IFRS 3. Goodwill is equal to the difference between:\n\n- the sum of:\n\t- the consideration transferred, i.e. the acquisition cost excluding acquisition fees and including the fair value of any earn-out payment,\n\t- the fair value on the date control is taken of minority interests in the case of partial acquisition for which the full-goodwill option is chosen,\n\t- the fair value of the interest previously held, where applicable;\n\n{218}------------------------------------------------\n\n- and the sum of:\n- the share of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities of the entity acquired on the date control is taken relative to controlling interests (including, where applicable, previously held interests),\n- the share relating to minority interests if the full-goodwill option is retained.\n\nOn the acquisition date, the assets, liabilities and identifiable potential liabilities of the entity acquired are individually assessed at their fair value, whatever their intended purpose. The analyses and expert assessments required for the initial valuation of these items must be completed within twelve months of the acquisition date. An interim valuation is given if financial statements must be established during this period.\n\nIntangible assets are entered separately from goodwill if they can be separately identified, i.e. if they arise from a legal or contractual right or are separable from the activities of the entity acquired and are expected to yield a financial return in the future.\n\nAcquisition fees are recognized in the income statement, as is any change outside the period for the allocation of items included in the calculation of goodwill.\n\n<span id=\"page-218-0\"></span>If a controlling interest is gained through successive acquisitions, the share previously owned is remeasured at fair value on the date the controlling interest is acquired as a debit or credit to income.\n\n# **5.1. CHANGES IN THE CONSOLIDATION SCOPE IN 2023 AND 2022**\n\n# 5.1.1. Changes in consolidation scope in the 2023 fiscal year\n\n# **• First consolidation in the Bolloré Energy sector**\n\nOn July 11, 2023, the Group finalized the purchase of 100% of the shares in Sicarbu Ouest, a subsidiary of the Eureden cooperative specializing in the distribution of petroleum products. The agreement for the acquisition of Sicarbu Ouest was signed on April 28 but remained subject to approval from the French Competition Authority, which has since been obtained without reservation.\n\n# **• First consolidations in the Communications sector**\n\nOn June 21, 2023, Groupe Canal+ and PCCW Limited announced that they had entered into a strategic partnership to accelerate the development of Viu, Asia's leading streaming platform. As a result of the transaction, Groupe Canal+ has become a significant minority shareholder in Viu thanks to a staggered investment of 300 million US dollars, including an initial payment of 200 million US dollars (186 million euros) that enabled Groupe Canal+ to acquire a 27.32% stake in Viu. Groupe Canal+ exercises significant influence over Viu, which is accounted for using the equity method as from June 21, 2023. On February 26, 2024, Groupe Canal+ announced that it held 30% of Viu's share capital. Groupe Canal+ holds a call option to increase its stake in Viu to 51%.\n\nHavas continued its policy of making targeted acquisitions with ten new agencies joining the Group in 2023. Havas thus continued to grow in strategic geographical areas (HRZN and Eprofessional in Germany, Pivot Roots and PR Pundit in India, Noise in Canada, and Uncommon in the United Kingdom) and in specific business lines: Australian Public Affairs in Australia, Cunha Vaz & Associados in Portugal and Klareco in Singapore strengthened the international H/Advisors network.\n\nIn July 2023, Prisma Media acquired a majority interest in MilK, a publisher of high-end decoration and fashion magazines. On November 30, 2023, Prisma Media acquired the Côté Maison group, a publisher specializing in high-end interior decoration.\n\n# **• Change in consolidation method in the Communications sector**\n\nThe Group has fully consolidated Lagardère since December 1, 2023 (see note 1 – Highlights). Before November 30, 2023, the Group accounted for Lagardère using the equity method. As at December 31, 2023, taking into account the exercise of disposal rights since November 30, 2023, the Group held 84,399,064 Lagardère shares, representing 59.80% of the capital and 50.62% of the voting rights. At that date, 27,683,985 million transfer rights were exercisable, representing a financial commitment of 667 million euros on 19.62% of Lagardère's share capital, recognized in the balance sheet as a financial liability.\n\n# **• Deconsolidation in the Communications sector**\n\nOn June 21, 2023, the date on which the European Commission approved the administrator and its engagement contract, Vivendi transferred the power to govern Editis's operational and financial policies to the administrator, The Group assesses, on a case-by-case basis with respect to each partial acquisition, whether to choose the full-goodwill option (goodwill including the share attributable to minority interests).\n\nThe Group enters the effects of business combinations under \"Other financial income (expenses)\".\n\n# **• Accounting for changes in consolidated ownership interests without loss of control**\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 10, in the event of the acquisition or disposal of securities in an entity controlled by the Group not resulting in a change in control, the entity recognizes the difference between the adjustment of the value of non-controlling interests and the fair value of the consideration paid or received directly in equity, Group share.\n\n## **• Loss of control**\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 10, the Group recognizes in the income statement, on the date of the loss of control, the difference between:\n\n- the sum of:\n- the fair value of the consideration received,\n- the fair value of any interests retained;\n- and the book value of these items.\n\nThe Group includes the effect of losses of control in \"Other financial income (expenses)\".\n\nby withdrawing from the direct management of Editis and by giving the administrator the power to exercise its voting rights over 100% of Editis's share capital. As at that date, in accordance with IFRS 10, the Group ceased to consolidate Editis. By way of reminder, since December 31, 2022, under IFRS 5 \"Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations\", Editis has been presented as held for sale.

Work on determining the fair value of assets and liabilities were finalized within the one-year period permitted under the standard.\n\n• Vivendi committed to gradually sell on the market over a five-year period all of its stake in Mediaset (renamed MediaForEurope on November 25, 2021) held by Simon Fiduciaria SpA.

BUSINESS DATA**\n\n# **6.1. REVENUE**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nIncome from ordinary activities is recognized as revenue when the performance obligation promised in the contract is fulfilled for an amount that is highly unlikely to be revised down significantly. Revenue is presented net of discounts granted.\n\nContracts are analyzed in accordance with IFRS 15 \"Revenue from contracts with customers\". The Group uses the practical expedient (since its contracts mainly have short cycles) allowing it not to present its order book in the notes to the financial statements (IFRS 15.122).\n\n# **Analysis of the agent/principal relationship in sales transactions involving a third party**\n\nIf the entity's promise is by its nature an obligation to provide the specified goods or services itself, then it is acting on its own behalf and is \"principal\" in the sale transaction. As such, the gross amount of the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods or services provided is recognized in revenue, and the commission paid to the third party is recognized in cost of sales. If the entity makes the necessary arrangements for the third party to provide the specified goods or services, it is acting as an \"agent\" and it then recognizes the net amount of the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods or services provided in revenue.\n\n{221}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe table below shows the specific characteristics of each sector associated with the entry of income from ordinary activities in the financial statements:\n\n| Sector                                           | Business line                                                                                                                                        | Recognition of revenue                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Bolloré Energy                                   | Distribution of oil<br>products                                                                                                                      | Revenue includes specific taxes on oil products included in sale prices.

INFORMATION ON OPERATING SEGMENTS**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nUnder the provisions of IFRS 8 \"Operating segments\", the operating segments used for segment disclosures are those used in internal Group reporting, as reviewed by Executive management (the Group's main operational decision maker), and reflect the Group's organization, which is based on business lines. The operating segments used are as follows:\n\n- Bolloré Energy: refers to the distribution and warehousing of oil products in Europe;\n- Communications: includes the publishing and distribution of pay and free TV and production, the sale and distribution of cinema films and TV series, the design and release of downloadable video games on mobile devices and consoles, ticketing and venue services, communications consulting and advertising agencies, magazine sales, sales of goods and circulation of publications, travel retail sales, sales of licenses and subscription services. The Group's equity-accounted shareholding in UMG is also included in this segment;\n- Industry: includes the production and sale of electric batteries and their applications: electric vehicles, electricity storage and solutions and films.\n\nOther activities mainly concern holding companies.\n\nThe breakdown of segment information by geographic area is as follows: • France, including overseas departments, regions and local authorities;\n\n- Europe excluding France ;\n- Africa ;\n- Asia-Pacific ;\n- Americas.\n\nTransactions between different segments are conducted under market conditions.\n\nNo single individual client represents more than 10% of the Group's revenue. The Group considers adjusted operating income (EBITA), a non-GAAP measure, as a measure of the performance of the operating segments presented in segment reporting. This indicator makes it possible to compare the performance of the operating segments, whether their activity results from internal growth in the operating segment or from acquisitions. In the Travel Retail business, the fees paid to the grantors or concessions are either variable, fixed or variable with a guaranteed minimum. The application of IFRS 16 to these contracts creates a distortion in the figures on the segment's performance since it only applies to the fixed portion of the rent, disconnecting the financial statements from the operational monitoring. In order to maintain a relevant indicator that reflects the economics of these contracts, the Group has decided to neutralize the effect of IFRS 16 on EBITA for concession agreements only.\n\n{222}------------------------------------------------\n\nTo calculate adjusted operating income (EBITA), the accounting impact of the following items is eliminated from operating income as reflected in the Group's financial statements:\n\n- the amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations and other rights catalogs acquired by our content production businesses;\n- goodwill impairment, other intangible assets related to business combinations and other rights catalogs acquired by our content production businesses;\n- other income/expenses related to transactions with shareholders (except when these are recognized directly in equity);\n- items related to concession agreements (IFRS 16): excluding gains or losses on leases and depreciation of right-of-use assets, including decreases in lease liabilities, interest paid on lease liabilities and changes in working capital relating to lease liabilities.\n\nWhen companies under significant influence have an operating nature in line with the Group's activities, the share of net income from companies accounted for using the equity method is classified in adjusted operating income.\n\nAdjusted operating income (EBITA) must be considered as additional information that cannot replace any measurement of the Group's operating and financial performance of a strictly accounting nature as presented in the consolidated financial statements and their notes. The Group considers that this is a relevant indicator of the Group's operational and financial performance.\n\nAdjusted operating income (EBITA) for each segment is the main indicator used by Executive management to assess the performance of the various segments and allocate resources to them.\n\nThe accounting and valuation methods used in internal reporting are identical to those used to draw up the consolidated financial statements, with the exception of the allocation of trademark and Group fees.\n\nRevenue and investments are also regularly monitored by Executive management.\n\nInformation on depreciation, amortization and provision expenses is provided to show the reader the main non-cash items of operating income but is not included in internal reporting.\n\n# 6.2.1.

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nTrade and other receivables are current financial assets (see note 8.3 – Other financial assets) initially recorded at their fair value, which generally corresponds to their par value, unless the effect of discounting is significant. At each year end, receivables are valued at amortized cost, after deducting any impairment losses due to collection risk.\n\nThe Group assesses the expected credit losses associated with its financial assets carried at amortized cost on a prospective basis. To assess the provision for expected credit losses on its original financial assets, the Group takes into account the probability of default at the date of initial recognition. Subsequently, provisions for expected credit losses on financial assets are revalued based on change in the credit risk of the asset during each fiscal year.\n\nTo assess whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk, the Group compares the default risk on the asset at the closing date with the credit risk at the date of initial recognition, based on reasonable forwardlooking information and events, credit ratings where available, and material or anticipated material adverse changes in the economic, financial or business environment that may result in a material change in the borrower's ability to meet its obligations. The notion of default and the full impairment policy are defined specifically within each operating entity.\n\nReceivables sold to third parties through receivable factoring contracts are recorded under \"trade receivables\" if their associated risks and benefits essentially remain with the Group, financial debts and loans being increased accordingly.\n\n|                                                 | 12/31/2023  |            |           | 12/31/2022  |            |           |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|-----------|-------------|------------|-----------|\n| (in millions of euros)                          | Gross value | Provisions | Net value | Gross value | Provisions | Net value |\n| Trade accounts receivable                       | 5,295.0     | (316.3)    | 4,978.7   | 5,259.4     | (222.3)    | 5,037.1   |\n| Operating receivables – tax and social security | 240.4       | (16.1)     | 224.3     | 156.6       | (16.6)     | 140.0     |\n| Other operating receivables                     | 1,598.5     | (209.6)    | 1,388.8   | 1,622.7     | (199.3)    | 1,423.4   |\n| TOTAL                                           | 7,133.9     | (542.0)    | 6,591.9   | 7,038.7     | (438.2)    | 6,600.5   |\n\n{225}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 6.6.1.

LEASES**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nThe Group elected to apply IFRS 16 retrospectively as at January 1, 2019, without restating the comparative periods in the financial statements.\n\nThe amount of lease liabilities relating to leases arising from business combinations after January 1, 2019 is measured at the present value of the remaining fixed and minimum guaranteed lease payments, in accordance with IFRS 16, as if the leases acquired were new leases on the date control is acquired. The amount of the rights of use is measured at the amount of the lease liabilities, adjusted to reflect the favorable or unfavorable nature of the lease terms compared with market terms.\n\nAs intellectual property licenses granted by a lessor and rights held by a lessee under licensing agreements are excluded from the scope of IFRS 16, and Groupe Canal+'s commercial contracts for the provision of satellite capacity are generally commercial service agreements for which contract costs are expensed as operational costs for the period, the Group's main leases comprise Lagardère's concession agreements in transport hubs and hospitals and property leases for which the Group is the lessee.\n\nThe Group also subleases retail or office space and acts as lessor. Where the subleases cover substantially all the risks and rewards of the main lease, they are accounted for as finance sub-eases. As a consequence, the right of use under the main lease is not recognized and a financial receivable is recognized.\n\nAll other subleases are classified as operating subleases. The associated sublease income is recognized directly in operating income.\n\nOn the consolidated balance sheet, lease-related right-of-use assets are presented in property, plant and equipment or other intangible assets according to the asset they target. Lease liabilities are recorded in other current or non-current liabilities according to their maturity. They are not included in the Group's financial debt.\n\n# **• Specialterms of concession agreements in Lagardère's Travel Retail business**\n\nAs part of its day-to-day operations, Lagardère Travel Retail enters into agreements with grantors of concessions (airports, stations, hospitals, etc.). These agreements grant the concession operator access to certain passenger flows and to the resulting revenue, in return for the payment of fees for the provision of retail space and the right to operate. These fees may be either fixed, variable or variable subject to a guaranteed minimum. They can be renegotiated with the grantor in the event of changes in the economic conditions applicable to the agreement or changes in law.\n\nThe formulas used to calculate the variable fees are generally based on a percentage of revenue achieved by product category, and/or on changes in passenger flows, and/or on changes in various external indices, including inflation.\n\nThe guaranteed minimum may be set out in the agreement, and/or calculated based on a minimum percentage of the previous year's fees, which may include a minimum amount. It is then considered to be a fixed payment in substance, because even if contains a variable component, it is unavoidable.\n\n# **• Measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability**\n\nLeases under which the Group is the lessee are recognized on the effective date of each lease and result in the recognition on the balance sheet of a lease liability equal to the present value of the fixed lease payments and the guaranteed minimum amounts under the Travel Retail concession agreements, in exchange for a right-of-use asset in respect of the leased assets.\n\nLease-related right-of-use assets are recorded at cost on the effective date of the lease. The cost of the right-of-use asset includes:\n\n- the amount of the associated lease liability;\n- initial direct costs (marginal costs of obtaining the lease);\n- payments made before the start of the lease after deduction of the incentives received;\n- decommissioning and restoration costs (recognized and assessed in accordance with IAS 37);\n\nThe right-of-use asset is then depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term, as determined in accordance with IFRS 16.\n\nAfter initial recognition, the amount of the liability is:\n\n• increased by the accretion effect (interest expenses on lease liabilities);\n\n- reduced by the rent payments made;\n- remeasured in the event of modification of the lease.\n\nThe term of the lease corresponds to the time for which the lease is noncancellable, taking into account any extension option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise and any termination option that the Group is reasonably certain not to exercise. This period is assessed by the lessees, lease by lease, and is revised on the occurrence of a significant event or a change in circumstances under the entity's control.\n\nFor concession agreements, the term is fixed by the grantor of the concession. The lessee does not generally have the ability to extend the term of the concession. Similarly, most concessions are extended through a tender process.\n\nIFRS 16 requires the discount rate for each contract to be determined by reference to the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee entity. In practice, given the organization of the Group's financing, the incremental borrowing rates are based on the swap rate curve of the currency of the contract plus the financing component, carried or guaranteed almost exclusively by Bolloré SE or Vivendi SE, depending on which entity holds the contract. The rate applied to each lease takes into account the lease payment profile.\n\n# **• Lease amendments and revaluations**\n\nIn the event of a reduction in the lease term or in the surface area leased, the right-of-use asset and lease liability are reduced accordingly in line with the percentage decrease, with a corresponding gain or loss as a result of the amendment of the lease recognized in the income statement. The residual lease liability is then adjusted against the right-of-use asset, after discounting at the new rate on the date of the amendment.\n\nIncreases in the lease term or surface area do not generate gains or losses on lease amendments, but rather result in a revaluation of the lease liability using the new discount rate on the date of the amendment, in exchange for an adjustment of the right-of-use asset.\n\n{228}------------------------------------------------\n\nChanges in the amount of the rent, provided for in the lease, without any adjustment of the surface area or term, will result in a revaluation of the lease liability without any revision of the discount rate in exchange for an adjustment of the right-of-use asset.\n\n# 6.11.1. Expense on lease liabilities\n\nThe expense on lease obligations recorded in profit and loss stood at 206.0 million euros as at December 31, 2023 (179.8 million euros as at December 31, 2022 restated, see note 4 – Comparability of financial statements).\n\n# 6.11.2. Lease-related right-of-use assets\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, net total lease-related right-of-use assets stood at 2,943.3 million euros (823.8 million euros at December 31, 2022) after deduction of accumulated depreciation in the amount of 788.7 million euros as at December 31, 2023 (815.0 million euros as at December 31, 2022). These rights of use mainly relate to concession agreements and real estate leases. Following the takeover of Lagardère by Vivendi on November 21, 2023, Lagardère has been fully consolidated in Vivendi's consolidated financial statements since December 1, 2023. The impacts of the leases were determined as if the leases acquired were new leases on the date on which control was acquired:\n\n- the lease liabilities are measured at the present value, using the discount rate in force on that date, of the remaining fixed and guaranteed minimum lease payments;\n- the amount of the rights of use is measured at the amount of the lease liabilities, adjusted to reflect the favorable or unfavorable nature of the lease terms compared with market terms.\n\n|                                    | 12/31/2023  |              |           | 12/31/2022  |              |           |\n|------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|-----------|\n| (in millions of euros)             | Gross value | Depreciation | Net value | Gross value | Depreciation | Net value |\n| Right-of-use assets on concessions | 2,036.1     | (34.1)       | 2,002.0   | 2.1         | (0.5)        | 1.6       |\n| Right-of-use assets on PP&E        | 1,695.8     | (754.6)      | 941.3     | 1,636.8     | (814.6)      | 822.2     |\n| TOTAL                              | 3,732.0     | (788.7)      | 2,943.3   | 1,638.9     | (815.0)      | 823.8     |\n\n# *Change in right-of-use assets*\n\n| Net values<br>(in millions of euros) | At<br>12/31/2022 | Gross<br>acquisitions | NBV<br>of disposals | Net<br>allowances | Changes in<br>consolidation<br>scope(1) | Exchange<br>rate<br>fluctuations | Other<br>movements(2) | At<br>12/31/2023 |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|\n| Right-of-use assets on concessions   | 1.6              | 6.7                   | 0.0                 | (34.3)            | 2,022.3                                 | (2.2)                            | 7.9                   | 2,002.0          |\n| Right-of-use assets on PP&E          | 822.2            | 115.3                 | (3.1)               | (161.4)           | 394.5                                   | (6.3)                            | (220.0)               | 941.3            |\n| NET VALUES                           | 823.8            | 122.0                 | (3.1)               | (195.7)           | 2,416.8                                 | (8.5)                            | (212.1)               | 2,943.3          |\n\n(1) Mainly comprising Lagardère, consolidated from December 1, 2023 in Vivendi.\n\n(2) Mainly comprising the effects of the reclassification of Bolloré Logistics as an asset held for sale (see note 1 – Highlights).\n\n# 6.11.3.

FIXED ASSETS**\n\n# **7.1. GOODWILL**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nGoodwill on controlled companies is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet assets under \"Goodwill\". Goodwill is not amortized but subjected to an impairment test at least once a year and whenever there is an indication of impairment. When impairment is found, the difference between the asset's book value and its recoverable amount is recognized among operating expenses for the fiscal year. This goodwill impairment cannot be reversed. Negative goodwill (badwill) is charged directly to income for the year of\n\nacquisition. Intangible and tangible assets are tested for impairment under certain circumstances. In the case of non-current assets with indefinite lives (e.g., goodwill), a test is carried out at least once a year, as well as whenever there is an indication of impairment. For other non-current assets, a test is carried out only when there is an indication of impairment.\n\nAssets tested for impairment are grouped in cash-generating units (CGUs), each corresponding to a homogeneous set of assets whose use generates an identifiable cash flow. When a CGU's recoverable amount is less than its net book value, an impairment is recognized and charged as an operating expense. The CGU's recoverable amount is the market value (less selling costs) or its value in use, whichever is higher. The value in use is the discounted value of the foreseeable cash flow from the use of an asset or a CGU. The discount rate is calculated for each cash-generating unit in accordance with its geographic area and the risk profile of its business.\n\n# 7.1.1.

Definition and reorganization of CGUs\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the Group had some 20 cash-generating units (CGUs) before the grouping of CGUs. The division of operations into CGUs is based on the particular features of each of the Group's business lines.\n\nThe principal CGUs or groups of CGUs are the following: \"Groupe Canal+\" (excluding Studiocanal), \"Lagardère\", \"Havas\" and \"Bolloré Energy\".\n\nThese business activities are described in note 6.2 – Information on the operating segments.\n\nThe goodwill relating to Vivendi is tested on the basis of the CGUs and CGUs combinations as defined in the Vivendi financial statements in the same way as the assets identified as part of the purchase price allocation (PPA).\n\n# 7.1.4. Recoverable amount based on value in use\n\nThe main assumptions used for the estimation of recoverable amount are:\n\n- the discount rate is determined by basing it on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of each CGU; it includes potential risks specific to each activity (business lines, markets and geographical areas); the rate selected was determined on the basis of information communicated by an outside consulting firm;\n- cash flows are calculated on the basis of operating budgets, then extrapolated by applying, up to the fifth year or for a specific longer period for some CGUs, based on plans approved by Management in advance\n\ncovering this longer period, a growth rate reflecting the growth potential of the relevant markets and management's judgment based on past experience.\n\nAfter the specified period, the terminal value is based on the perpetuity value of the cash flows, except for CGUs with finite cash flows.\n\nThese tests are carried out using an after-tax discount rate. The method adopted did not lead to a material difference with a calculation based on a pre-tax discount rate (test performed in accordance with IAS 36 BCZ 85).\n\nAt its meetings held on December 13, 2023 and January 30, 2024, Vivendi's Supervisory Board authorized the Management Board to review the possibility of splitting Vivendi into several entities, each of which would be listed on the stock market, and structured around Groupe Canal+, Havas, a company combining publishing and distribution assets through the majority stake in the Lagardère group and the 100% stake in Prisma Media, and an investment company holding listed and unlisted financial interests in the culture, media and entertainment sectors (see note 1 – Highlights).\n\nIn this context, without changing the valuation methods used each year, the Group reviewed the value of the goodwill allocated to its cash-generating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs, which are part of the Communications segment, by ensuring that the recoverable amount of the CGUs or groups of CGUs tested was at least equal to their net carrying amount as at December 31, 2023, including goodwill.\n\n{230}------------------------------------------------\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the test was carried out by the Group on each CGU or group of CGUs based on recoverable values determined internally or with the help of independent valuers. Following this review, and notwithstanding the current macroeconomic uncertainties (see note 2 – Outlook for the Group in light of the uncertainties related to the economic environment), the Group's Management concluded that the recoverable amount of each CGU or group of CGUs in the Communications segment that was tested was at least equal to its carrying amount as of December 31, 2023.\n\n- a 30% change in the recoverable amount of Havas would not result in an impairment loss; • given the recent nature of the acquisition of Prisma Media, the recoverable\n- amount of Prisma Media is considered to be equal to its carrying amount;\n- given the impairment of goodwill relating to Gameloft as at December 31, 2021, the recoverable amount of Gameloft is considered to be equal to its carrying amount;\n- lastly, no impairment test on goodwill relating to Lagardère was performed as at December 31, 2023 given that the takeover date (see note 1 – Highlights) was close to the end of the financial year.\n\nAccordingly, based on the recoverable amounts determined for each CGU or groups of CGUs as part of the goodwill impairment test as at December 31, 2023:\n\n• a 10% change in the recoverable amount of Groupe Canal+ would not result in an impairment loss;\n\nThe following table summarizes the assumptions used for the most significant tests on goodwill:\n\n| 2023<br>(in millions of euros)                      | Groupe Canal(1)                              | Havas        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Net book value of goodwill                          | 4,203.4                                      | 2,431.7      |\n| Other intangible items with indefinite useful lives | 1,709.4                                      | 397.6        |\n| Impairment losses recognized over the fiscal year   | (1.4)                                        | 0.0          |\n| Base used for recoverable amount                    | Comparable<br>(Value in use for Studiocanal) | Value in use |\n| Parameters of cash flow model used:                 |                                              |              |\n| – growth rate on terminal value                     | Comparable<br>(1.0% for Studiocanal)         | 2.25%        |\n\nNA: not applicable.\n\n(1) Canal+ Group's recoverable amount, excluding Studiocanal, was determined using multiple valuations, observed on stock markets or in recent mergers/acquisitions of about twenty similar companies, using financial parameters consistent with those of previous years, which are as follows: a multiple of EBITDA for pay-TV and a multiple of revenues for free-TV.

CONTENT ASSETS AND CONTRACTUAL CONTENT OBLIGATIONS**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nContent assets only concern the following Vivendi activities:\n\n# **• Groupe Canal+**\n\nRights to broadcast films, television programs and sporting events\n\nWhen contracts are signed for the acquisition of broadcasting rights of films, television programs and sporting events, the acquired rights are shown as contractual commitments. They are then entered in the balance sheet and classified among content assets under the following conditions:\n\n- the broadcasting rights of films and television programs are recognized at their acquisition cost when the program is available for its initial release, and are expensed in the period in which they are broadcast;\n- the rights to broadcast sporting events are recorded at their acquisition cost, at the start of the broadcasting period of the sports season concerned or as soon as the first significant payment is received, and are expensed in the period in which they are broadcast;\n- the consumption of broadcasting rights of films, television programs and sporting events is included in the cost of sales.\n\n# Films and television programs produced or acquired\n\n# for sale to third parties\n\nFilms and television programs produced or acquired prior to their first use with a view to being sold to third parties are recorded as content assets at their cost (mainly direct production costs and overheads) or at their acquisition cost. The cost of films and television programs is amortized and other related costs are expensed using the estimated revenue method (i.e. the ratio of the period's gross revenues to estimated total gross revenues from all sources on an individual production basis). Vivendi considers that amortization using the estimated revenue method reflects the rate at which the entity expects to consume the future economic benefits from the assets and that there is a strong correlation between income and the consumption of economic benefits from intangible assets.\n\nWhere applicable, estimated impairment losses are provisioned for their full amount in the profit or loss for the period, on an individual basis by product, at the time of estimation of these losses.\n\n#### Film and TV rights catalogs\n\nThe catalogs consist of second-run films acquired or transfers of films and television programs produced or acquired with a view to being sold to third parties after their first run (i.e. once first broadcast on a free broadband channel). They are recorded on the balance sheet at their acquisition or transfer cost, and are amortized respectively by group of films or individually according to the estimated revenue method.\n\n# **• Lagardère**\n\n# Copyright\n\nAdvances paid to authors (retainers, guaranteed advances, minimum guaranteed amounts) are recognized as intangible assets.\n\n# 7.2.1.

These are recognized as content assets when the program is available for initial broadcast or as soon as the first significant payment has been received. As at December 31, 2023, provisions were recognized on these commitments for 56 million euros (no change from December 31, 2022).\n\nThese amounts do not include commitments as to contracts for network broadcasting rights and non-exclusive network distribution for which Groupe Canal+ has not granted or obtained a guaranteed minimum. The variable amount of these commitments, which may not be reliably determined, is not recognized on the balance sheet and is not listed among commitments. It is recognized in income and expenses in the period in which the charge they are incurred. Based on an estimate of the future number of subscribers at Groupe Canal+,\n\nnet commitments received amounted to 75 million euros as at December 31, 2023, compared with 32 million euros in net commitments given as at December 31, 2022. These amounts include the distribution agreement signed with beIN Sports for the period from June 1, 2020 to May 31, 2025.\n\nOn December 2, 2021, Groupe Canal+ and the cinema organizations, represented by BLIC, BLOC and ARP, announced the signing of a new agreement which replaced the 2018 agreement, and extended the partnership between Canal+ and the French film industry until at least the end of 2024.\n\nWith regard to obligations to invest in audiovisual production, Canal+ must, pursuant to decree no. 2021-1926 of 30 December 2021, dedicate at least 4.2% of its total net revenue for the previous year to heritage works (drama, animation, creative documentaries, music videos and actual footage or reenactments of live performances). Part of this expenditure (at least 2.8% of revenue) is devoted to independent production activities.\n\nOnly films for which an agreement in principle has been given to producers are valued in off-balance sheet commitments; the total future estimate of the commitments under\n\nagreements with professional film-making organizations and producers' and authors' organizations is unknown. (2) Mainly includes the broadcasting rights of Groupe Canal+ for the following sporting events:\n\nAs at December 31, 2023:\n\n– European football competitions (UEFA): Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League, for the 2024-2025 to 2026-2027 seasons. As a reminder, Groupe Canal+ held exclusive rights to the Champions League for the two premium lots up to the 2023-2024 season, for which Groupe Canal+ had granted exclusive co-broadcasting rights to Altice group through a sub-licensing agreement; – on 21 September 2023, Groupe Canal+ announced the renewal of the entire English Premier League rights until the 2027-2028 season in France, as well as in the Czech Republic,\n\n- on 21 September 2023.

As at December 31, 2022:\n\n– European football competitions (UEFA): on June 29, 2022, Groupe Canal+ announced that it had secured all competitions for the first time: UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League, for the 2024-2025 to 2026-2027 seasons. As a reminder, Groupe Canal+ holds exclusive rights to the Soccer Champions League for the two premium lots up to the 2023-2024 season, for which Groupe Canal+ has granted exclusive co-broadcasting rights to Altice group through a sub-licensing agreement for the same seasons;\n\n– Premier League soccer in the United Kingdom until the 2024-2025 season, and in the Czech Republic and Slovakia until the 2024-2025 season;\n\n– lot 3 of the French Professional Soccer Ligue 1 until the 2023-2024 season, with the deal signed with beIN Sports on February 12, 2020;\n\n– exclusive rights to the National French Rugby Championship (Top 14) until the end of the 2026-2027 season;\n\n– Formula 1: on April 6, 2022, Groupe Canal+ announced a new exclusive broadcasting agreement until the 2029 season;\n\n– MotoGP™ on an exclusive basis until the 2029 season.\n\n{233}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *Commitments received*\n\n| At December 31, 2023<br>(in millions of euros) | Total | Under 1 year | From 1 to 5 years | More than 5 years |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Broadcasting rights for films and programs     | 248.0 | 159.0        | 89.0              |                   |\n| Broadcasting rights for sporting events        | 81.0  | 75.0         | 6.0               |                   |\n| COMMITMENTS RECEIVED FOR CONTENT ASSETS        | 329.0 | 234.0        | 95.0              | 0.0               |\n\n| At December 31, 2022<br>(in millions of euros) | Total | Under 1 year | From 1 to 5 years | More than 5 years |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Broadcasting rights for films and programs     | 204.0 | 114.0        | 91.0              |                   |\n| Broadcasting rights for sporting events        | 224.0 | 144.0        | 80.0              |                   |\n| COMMITMENTS RECEIVED FOR CONTENT ASSETS        | 428.0 | 258.0        | 171.0             | 0.0               |\n\n# <span id=\"page-233-0\"></span>**7.3. OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nOther intangible assets mainly include trademarks and concession entry fees, customer relationships, operating rights, rights of use of leased intangible assets, computer software, and assets arising from concessions resulting from the reclassification of infrastructures held under concessions in application of IFRIC 12.\n\nOnce acquired, other intangible assets appear in the balance sheet at their acquisition cost. The non-current assets produced appear on the balance sheet at cost; they are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life.\n\nConcession entry fees, acquired through business combinations, are valued based on the estimated cash flows forecast over the residual term of the contract acquired plus any renewal period, in order to take into account the ability of the acquired entity to renew these agreements with the grantors of the concession. The value corresponding to the estimated cash flows forecast over the residual term of the contract acquired is amortized over the remaining term of the concession. The value representing the future economic benefits arising from the renewal of the concession is amortized over the term of the renewed concession, as from the effective date of the renewal. If it appears likely that the agreement will not be renewed, the value of the concession is written down. Concessions are amortized over periods ranging from 6 to 30 years, with the average amortization period being 15 years.\n\nThe useful lives of the main categories of other intangible assets are as follows:\n\n| Concession entry fees           | 6 to 30 years |\n|---------------------------------|---------------|\n| Software and IT licenses        | 1 to 5 years  |\n| Customer relationships acquired | 7 to 19 years |\n\nIn line with IAS 38 \"Intangible assets\", R&D expenditures are entered as expenses in the fiscal year in which they are incurred, with the exception of development costs, which are recorded under intangible assets if the following capitalization criteria are met:\n\n- the project is clearly identified, and its associated costs reliably separated and monitored;\n- the technical feasibility of the project has been demonstrated;\n- the intention is to complete the project and use or sell its products;\n- there is a potential market for the product developed under this project, or its internal utility has been demonstrated;\n- the resources needed to complete the project are available.\n\nDevelopment costs are amortized over the estimated lifetime of the projects concerned from the date on which the product becomes available.\n\n- In the particular case of software, the lifetime is determined as follows:\n- if the software is used in-house, over the probable useful life;\n- if the software is for external use, according to the prospects for sale, rental or any other form of marketing.\n\nCapitalized software development costs are those incurred during the programming, coding and testing stages. Previously incurred expenditures (planning, design, product specification and architecture) are entered as an expense.\n\nThe development costs of games are capitalized when the technical feasibility and the intention of the management to complete the development of the game and to market it have been established and if the costs are regarded as recoverable. The uncertainty existing until the launch of the game generally does not make it possible to fulfill the capitalization criteria required by IAS 38. The development costs of games are therefore recognized as expenses when they are incurred.\n\nTotal research and development expenses recognized in the profit and loss statement for the 2023 fiscal year amounted to 155.5 million euros and related mainly to developments by the Vivendi group.\n\n{234}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 7.3.1.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are entered at their acquisition or production cost, less cumulative depreciation and any recognized impairment.\n\nImpairment is generally determined using the straight-line method over the asset's useful life; the accelerated depreciation method may nevertheless be used if it appears more relevant to the conditions under which the equipment concerned is used. In the case of certain complex non-current assets with different components (buildings, for instance), each component is depreciated over its specific useful life.\n\nThe main useful lives of the various categories of property, plant and equipment are as follows:\n\n| Buildings and fittings              | 5 to 50 years |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Plant, machinery and equipment      | 3 to 20 years |\n| Set-top boxes                       | 5 to 7 years  |\n| Other property, plant and equipment | 2 to 15 years |\n\nDepreciable lives are periodically reviewed to check their relevance.\n\nThe start date for depreciation is that on which the asset came into service. In the case of an acquisition, the asset is depreciated over its residual useful lifetime, which is determined as at the date of acquisition.\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 7.4.1.

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nCompanies accounted for using the equity method include companies over which the Group has a significant influence and joint ventures. To clarify the financial information provided further to the implementation of IFRS 10 \"Consolidated financial statements\" and IFRS 11 \"Joint arrangements\", the Group elected to recognize the shares of net income from operating companies accounted for using the equity method whose activities are linked to the Group's operating activities in operating income, under \"Share in net income of operating companies accounted for using the equity method\". The shares of net income from the Group's holding companies are presented in \"Share in net income of non-operating companies accounted for using the equity method\".\n\nShareholdings in associated companies and joint ventures are recognized pursuant to the revised IAS 28 as soon as a significant degree of influence or a controlling interest has been jointly acquired. Any difference between the cost of the shareholding and the acquired share in the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the company is entered under goodwill. Goodwill thus determined is included in the book value of the shareholding.\n\nAn impairment test is carried out as soon as an objective indication of impairment has been identified, such as a significant fall in the stock market price of the shareholding, the anticipation of a significant fall in future cash flows or any information suggesting likely significant negative effects on the entity's income.\n\nThe recoverable amount (in the case of shareholdings consolidated by the equity method) is then tested as described in the note on impairment of non-financial non-current assets (see note 7.1 – Goodwill).\n\nThe value in use of the shareholdings is calculated on the basis of an analysis of various criteria including the stock market value for listed securities, discounted future cash flows and comparable listed companies. These methods use the price targets set by financial analysts for listed securities.\n\nImpairment losses, if any, are recognized in profit and loss under \"Share in net income of operating companies accounted for using the equity method\" or \"Share in net income of non-operating companies accounted for using the equity method\", according to their classification.\n\nIn the event a significant degree of influence or a controlling interest has been jointly acquired through successive purchases of securities, the Group applies IAS 28.\n\nThe Group considers itself as involved in any losses realized by entities accounted for using the equity method even if the losses exceed the initial investment. The share of losses realized during the fiscal year is recognized in liabilities under \"Share in net income of companies accounted for using the equity method\", a provision is recognized under \"Provisions for contingencies\" for the share of losses exceeding the initial investment.\n\n#### (in millions of euros)\n\n| At December 31, 2022

Compagnie de l'Odet). As at December 31, 2023, UMG's stock market price was 25.81 euros per share and the value of investments in companies accounted for under the equity method on the consolidated balance sheet was 23.38 euros per share.\n\n# (\\*\\*) Lagardère\n\nThe Group has fully consolidated Lagardère since December 1, 2023.

South African regulations prohibit any foreign investor (excluding those from countries in the African Union that have entered into bilateral agreements) from holding a direct or indirect financial interest of more than 20% of the voting rights or from controlling a company holding a commercial broadcasting license. The MultiChoice Group's articles of association therefore limit the voting rights of all foreign shareholders to 20%, with, where appropriate, a reduction in their voting rights in due proportion (the scale-back mechanism). Groupe Canal+ is now the largest shareholder in MultiChoice Group, qualified as a material shareholder by MultiChoice Group, which is accounted for under the equity method as at January 1, 2022.\n\n# (\\*\\*\\*\\*) Viu\n\nOn June 21, 2023, the Group announced an investment of 200.0 million US dollars (186.0 million euros) in Viu, Asia's leading streaming platform.\n\n# **Financial information of Universal Music Group and MultiChoice Group at 100% ownership used to prepare the Group's financial statements**\n\nThe main aggregates of the consolidated financial statements as published by Universal Music Group and MultiChoice Group are as follows:\n\n| (in millions of euros)                    | Universal Music Group | MultiChoice Group     |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Balance sheet                             | June 30, 2023(1)      | September 30, 2023(2) |\n| Reporting date                            | July 26, 2023         | November 15, 2023     |\n| Non-current assets                        | 8,590                 | 1,224                 |\n| Current assets                            | 3,861                 | 1,189                 |\n| <b>Total assets</b>                       | <b>12,451</b>         | <b>2,413</b>          |\n| Equity                                    | 2,559                 | 38                    |\n| Non-current liabilities                   | 3,676                 | 1,108                 |\n| Current liabilities                       | 6,216                 | 1,267                 |\n| <b>Total liabilities</b>                  | <b>12,451</b>         | <b>2,413</b>          |\n| of which net financial position/(debt)(3) | (2,300)               | NA                    |\n\n{238}------------------------------------------------\n\n| (in millions of euros)                           | Universal Music Group                                               | MultiChoice Group                                           |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Profit and loss statement                        | Financial statements for the fiscal year<br>ended December 31, 2023 | Interim financial statements as at<br>September 30, 2023(2) |\n| Reporting date                                   | February 28, 2024(4)                                                | November 15, 2023                                           |\n| Revenue                                          | 11,108                                                              | 1,407                                                       |\n| EBITDA(3)                                        | 1,808                                                               | 330                                                         |\n| Net income, Group share                          | 1,259                                                               | (66)                                                        |\n| of which ongoing activities                      | 1,259                                                               | (66)                                                        |\n| discontinued operations and assets held for sale | –                                                                   | –                                                           |\n| Net income, Group share(5)                       | 189                                                                 | (89)                                                        |\n| Other comprehensive income                       | 60                                                                  | (6)                                                         |\n| Dividends paid to the Group                      | (264)                                                               |                                                             |\n\nNA: not applicable.\n\n(1) To consolidate Universal Music Group (UMG) using the equity method, the Group relies on its published financial information.

OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nOn initial recognition, financial assets are carried at fair value, which generally corresponds to the acquisition cost plus directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, financial assets are measured at fair value or amortized cost depending on the category to which they belong.\n\nFinancial assets are classified as \"Financial assets at fair value through equity\", \"Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\" and \"Financial assets at amortized cost\".\n\nThis classification depends on the entity's management model of financial assets and the contractual conditions for determining whether the cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Financial assets that include an embedded derivative are considered as a whole to determine whether their cash flows are SPPIs.\n\nNon-current financial assets include the portion due in over one year of financial assets recognized at fair value or at amortized cost.\n\nCurrent financial assets include trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and the portion due in less than one year of financial assets carried at fair value or amortized cost.\n\n# **• Financial assets at fair value**\n\nThese assets include assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, derivative financial instruments with a positive value and whose underlying is financial, and other financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nMost of these financial assets are actively traded on organized financial markets, their fair value being determined by reference to published market prices at the closing date. For financial assets for which there is no quoted market price in an active market, the fair value is estimated. The fair value of unlisted securities is determined on the basis of the revalued net assets and, if applicable, for transparency, the value of any underlying assets. The Group ultimately measures financial assets at historical cost less any potential impairment losses when no reliable estimate of their fair value can be made by valuation techniques and in the absence of an active market.\n\n# **• Financial assets at fair value through**\n\n**other comprehensive income**\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income include:\n\n• non-consolidated investments that are not held for trading purposes and for which the Group has made an irrevocable election to classify them at fair value through other non-recyclable items of comprehensive income. Unrealized gains and losses on financial assets measured at fair value through other non-recyclable items of comprehensive income are recorded in other income and expenses recognized directly in equity until the financial asset is sold, cashed in or otherwise removed from the balance sheet, at which time the accumulated gain or loss, previously recorded in other expenses and income recognized directly in equity, is transferred to consolidation reserves and is not reclassified in profit or loss. Dividends and interest received from non-consolidated investments are recognized in the profit and loss statement;\n\n• debt instruments whose contractual cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest on the outstanding principal, and where the Group's management intention is to collect contractual cash flows and to sell the financial assets. Unrealized gains and losses on these financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are recognized in other income and expenses recognized directly in equity. Where the financial asset is sold, cashed in or otherwise removed from the balance sheet or where there is objective evidence that the financial asset has lost all or part of its value, the accumulated gain or loss, recorded until then in other expenses and income recognized directly in equity is transferred to the profit and loss statement in other financial income and expenses.\n\n# **• Assets at fair value through profit and loss**\n\nOther financial assets at fair value through profit or loss mainly include heldfor-trading assets that the Group intends to resell in the near future (notably marketable securities) and other financial assets not meeting the definition of other categories of financial assets, including derivative financial instruments. Unrealized gains and losses on these assets are recognized in other financial income and expenses.\n\nShort-term investments (term deposits, interest-bearing current accounts and medium-term negotiable notes) do not meet the criteria for classification as cash equivalents according to IAS 7; similarly, the money market funds not meeting the requirements of the decision issued by the French Accounting Standards Authority (Autorité des normes comptables – ANC) and the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) in November 2018 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss in current financial assets.\n\n# **• Financial assets at amortized cost**\n\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost include debt instruments where the Group's management intention is to collect contractual cash flows that correspond solely the payment of principal and interest on the outstanding principal. They include receivables from equity interests, current account advances to associated or non-consolidated entities, security deposits, other loans, receivables and obligations.\n\nAt each year end, these assets are valued at amortized cost using the \"effective interest\" method.\n\nAn impairment is recognized if there is an objective indication of such a loss. The impairment corresponding to the difference between the net book value and the recoverable amount (discount of expected cash flows at the original effective interest rate) is charged to the income statement. This may be reversed if the recoverable amount should rise at a future date.\n\n| At December 31, 2023<br>(in millions of euros)                    | Gross value | Provisions | Net value(1) | Including<br>non-current | Including<br>current |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income |             |            | 6,840.9      | 6,840.9                  | 0.0                  |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss             |             |            | 317.6        | 0.1                      | 317.5                |\n| Financial assets at amortized cost                                | 652.0       | (199.1)    | 452.9        | 438.0                    | 14.9                 |\n| TOTAL                                                             |             |            | 7,611.4      | 7,279.0                  | 332.4                |\n\n(1) Net financial assets notably include listed and unlisted equity investments in the amount of 6,838.9 million euros, derivative assets in the amount of 10 million euros, cash management assets in the amount of 309.6 million euros and financial assets at amortized cost in the amount of 452.9 million euros.\n\n| At December 31, 2022<br>(in millions of euros)                    | Gross value | Provisions | Net value(1) | Including<br>non-current | Including<br>current |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income |             |            | 6,056.2      | 6,055.6                  | 0.6                  |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss             |             |            | 127.0        | 0.0                      | 127.0                |\n| Financial assets at amortized cost                                | 434.7       | (171.6)    | 263.1        | 247.7                    | 15.4                 |\n| TOTAL                                                             |             |            | 6,446.3      | 6,303.3                  | 143.0                |\n\n(1) Net financial assets notably included listed and unlisted equity investments in the amount of 6,046.7 million euros, derivative assets in the amount of 10.7 million euros, cash management assets in the amount of 125.8 million euros and financial assets at amortized cost in the amount of 263.1 million euros.\n\n{240}------------------------------------------------\n\n# (\\*) Breakdown of changes over the period\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                               | At 12/31/2022<br>Net value | Change in<br>consolidation<br>scope | Acquisitions(1) | Disposals | Change in fair<br>value(2) | Other<br>movements | At 12/31/2023<br>Net value |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------|----------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| Financial assets at fair value through<br>other comprehensive income | 6,056.2                    | 28.7                                | 175.7           | (16.1)    | 608.8                      | (12.4)             | 6,840.9                    |\n| Financial assets at fair value through<br>profit or loss             | 127.0                      | 10.5                                | 309.5           | (125.7)   | (3.7)                      | (0.0)              | 317.6                      |\n| Financial assets at amortized cost                                   | 263.1                      | 124.2                               | 152.6           | (30.1)    | 0.0                        | (56.9)             | 452.9                      |\n| TOTAL                                                                | 6,446.3                    | 163.4                               | 637.8           | (171.9)   | 605.1                      | (69.3)             | 7,611.4                    |\n\n(1) The change in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss includes term deposits of +309.5 million euros for Bolloré SE.\n\n(2) The change in the fair value of financial assets through other comprehensive income includes: +390.3 million euros for the Group's holding companies;

This valuation resulted in the recognition of a discount of 8.40% as at December 31, 2023.\n\nAll listed securities are classified in level 1 of the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.

INFORMATION RELATING TO MARKET RISK AND THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES**\n\n# **9.1. INFORMATION ON RISK**\n\nThis note is to be read in addition to the information provided in the Board's' report on corporate governance included in the notes to the universal registration document.\n\nThe Group identifies three categories of risk:\n\n- main risks concerning the Group: risks that may impact the Group as a whole;\n- risks specific to activities: risks that could impact a given business line or geographic area without threatening the financial structure of the Group as a whole;\n- legal risks.\n\nActivity-specific risks are detailed in chapter 3 – Risk factors of the universal registration document.\n\n# Main market risks concerning the Group\n\n# **• Risk associated with listed shares**\n\nThe Compagnie de l'Odet Group, which holds a securities portfolio valued at 6,838.9 million euros as at December 31, 2023, is exposed to fluctuations on stock market prices.\n\nThe Group's equity investments in non-consolidated companies are measured at fair value at year end in accordance with IFRS 9 \"Financial instruments\" and are classified as financial assets (see note 8.3 – Other financial assets).\n\nAs far as shares in listed companies are concerned, this fair value is the closing stock market value.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, revaluations of equity investments in the consolidated balance sheet determined on the basis of stock market prices amounted to 3,233.9 million euros before tax.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, a 1% variation in stock market prices would have an impact of 67.1 million euros on the valuation of equity investments, which would affect the other comprehensive income before tax, including 42.9 million euros for revaluations of the Bolloré Group's shareholdings in Omnium Bolloré, Financière V and Sofibol.\n\nThese unlisted securities, whose value is dependent on the valuation of Compagnie de l'Odet securities, are therefore also impacted by fluctuations in stock market prices (see note 8.3 – Other financial assets). As at December 31, 2023, the revalued amount of these securities was 4,297.2 million euros, for a gross value of 183.9 million euros. The shares of these unlisted companies are not very liquid.\n\n# **• Liquidity risk**\n\nThe Group's liquidity risk stems from obligations to repay its debt and from the need for future financing in connection with the development of its various lines of business. To deal with liquidity risk, the Group's strategy has been to maintain a level of unused credit lines that will allow it to deal at any point with cash requirements in addition to its investments and available cash reserves. As at December 31, 2023, the amount of confirmed and unused credit lines was 8,259 million euros (of which 3,792 million euros for the Vivendi group). Additionally, the Group strives to diversify its sources of financing by using the bond market, the banking market and over-thecounter financing (NEU CP).\n\nFor the Group's main syndicated bank financing facilities as at December 31, 2023:\n\n- Bolloré SE has two syndicated revolving credit lines: one of 1,300 million euros, of which 13.6 million euros was drawn as at December 31, 2023 (in US dollars) maturing in 2025, and another of 400 million euros, undrawn as at December 31, 2023, maturing in 2028. They are subject to a gearing covenant that caps the net debt to equity ratio at 1.75;\n- Compagnie de l'Odet has a credit line of 1,150 million euros, of which 375.0 million euros was drawn as at December 31, 2023 (in euros) maturing in 2026.\n- Vivendi SE has a syndicated credit line of 1,500 million euros maturing in January 2026 and eight bilateral credit lines for a total amount of 800 million euros maturing in December 2027;\n- none of these credit lines are subject to compliance with financial ratios and they contain the usual clauses seen in unsecured financing arrangements;\n- Lagardère SA has a syndicated credit line of 982 million euros maturing in April 2025.\n\nBonds issued by Vivendi SE are subject to the usual default, negative pledge and pari passu clauses. They also contain an early repayment clause in the event of a change of control (other than a change of control in favor of the Bolloré group) that would apply if, following such an event, Vivendi SE's longterm rating was downgraded below Baa3.\n\nAs at March 4, 2024, when the Vivendi Management Board met to approve the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, Vivendi's ratings were as follows:\n\n| Rating agency | Type of debt                       | Rating | Outlook        |\n|---------------|------------------------------------|--------|----------------|\n| Moody's       | Senior unsecured<br>long-term debt | Baa2   | Stable outlook |\n\nApart from the proposed spin-off, the feasibility of which is under review (see note 1 – Highlights), the Group considers that the cash flows generated by its operating activities, its cash surpluses net of amounts used to reduce its debts, as well as the funds available under undrawn bank credit facilities will be sufficient to cover its operating expenses and investments, debt servicing, tax payments, dividend payments, any potential share buybacks under existing ordinary authorizations, as well as its proposed investments over the next twelve months.\n\nSome other lines may have early repayment covenants connected with respect of financial ratios, generally involving ratios of net debt to equity and/or debt service coverage. These bank covenants and financial ratios were all met as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\nThe portion due in less than one year of loans used as at December 31, 2023 includes 67 million euros of short-term negotiable securities at Bolloré SE, 60 million euros at Compagnie de l'Odet and 561 million euros at Vivendi out of a program capped at 4,550 million euros (of which 3,650 million euros for Vivendi as at December 31, 2023) and 21.9 million euros of receivables factoring.\n\nAll bank lines of credit, both drawn and undrawn, are repayable as follows:\n\n| 2024        | 24% |\n|-------------|-----|\n| 2025        | 22% |\n| 2026        | 28% |\n| 2027        | 8%  |\n| 2028        | 17% |\n| Beyond 2028 | 1%  |\n\n# **• Interest rate risk**\n\nBecause of its financial debt, the Group is exposed to changes over time in interest rates in the eurozone, primarily on the portion of debt which is at variable rates, as well as to changes in the lending margins of credit institutions. To deal with this risk, Executive management may decide to set up interest rate hedges. Firm hedging (rate swaps, FRAs) may be used to manage the interest rate risk on the Group's debt.\n\nNote 8.5 – Financial debt describes the various derivative instruments for hedging the Group's interest rate risk.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, after hedging, fixed-rate gross financial debt amounted to 26% of total debt.\n\nIf interest rates were to rise uniformly by 1%, the cost of gross debt would increase by 57.5 million euros after hedging on interest-bearing gross debt. If interest rates were to rise uniformly by 1%, the cost of gross debt would decrease by –1.8 million euros after hedging on interest-bearing debt.\n\n{246}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **• Investment and counterparty risk**\n\nSurplus cash is invested in a prudent manner in low-risk liquid products with counterparties featuring a high credit rating.\n\nMoreover, Vivendi and Bolloré spread its investments across a number of selected banks and limit the investment amount per vehicle.\n\n# **• Currency risk**\n\nFor the Group, the breakdown of revenue by currency area (63% in euros, 10% in US dollars, 5% in CFA francs, 5% in zloty, 4% in pounds sterling, and less than 3% for all other currencies) and the fact that a large proportion of operating expenses is in local currencies limit its exposure to operating currency risk.\n\n<span id=\"page-246-0\"></span>The Group is reducing its exposure to currency risk further by hedging its main operations in currencies other than the euro with large international banks. The management of currency risk is largely centralized at Bolloré SE and Vivendi SE for subsidiaries which are attached to them directly.\n\n# **9.2. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**\n\nThe Group uses financial derivatives to manage and reduce its exposure to risks of change in interest rates and exchange rates. These are instruments traded on organized markets or over the counter, negotiated with first-class counterparties. They include interest rate or foreign currency swaps, as well as forward foreign exchange contracts. These instruments are all used for hedging purposes.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at the closing date of each fiscal year. The recognition of subsequent changes in fair value depends on the designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument and, where applicable, the nature of the hedged item and the type of hedging relationship designated. When these contracts qualify as hedges in accounting terms, the profits and losses made on these contracts are recognized in net income, symmetrically with the recognition of the income/expense of the items hedged.\n\nWhen the derivative instrument hedges a risk of change in the fair value of an asset or a liability recognized on the balance sheet, or a firm off-balance sheet commitment, it is termed a fair-value hedge. On an accounting basis, the instrument is remeasured at its fair value as a debit or credit to income and the item hedged is symmetrically remeasured for the portion hedged, on the same line of the profit and loss statement; or, if part of a planned At the Bolloré SE level, at the end of each month, each subsidiary declares its currency positions to be hedged to the Cash Department, which may arrange a firm hedge (forward buy or sell). In addition to these transactions carried out on a rolling basis, other hedges may be arranged on an ad hoc basis. Bolloré Energy hedges its positions directly on the market each day.\n\nWith regard to Vivendi, the Group's foreign exchange risk management policy primarily aims to hedge budgetary exposures for the next year related to monetary flows from operations in currencies other than the euro, as well as external firm commitments entered into in the context of the acquisition of editorial content (sports, TV and film rights, etc.) and certain industrial investments (i.e. set-top boxes) made in currencies other than the euro. The hedging instruments are currency swap, forward purchase or forward sale contracts, the majority of which mature in less than one year. Given the currency hedges in place, an unfavorable and uniform change of 1% in the euro against any of the currencies accounted for at end-December 2023 would have an immaterial effect on net income. In addition, the Vivendi group may hedge the foreign exchange risk on financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.\n\ntransaction on a non-financial asset or a liability, in the initial cost of the asset or liability.\n\nWhen the derivative instrument hedges a cash flow, it is termed a cash flow hedge. In that case, in accounting terms, the instrument is remeasured at its fair value as a debit or credit to other income and expenses recognized directly in equity with respect to the effective portion and by a debit or credit to income with respect to the ineffective portion. When the item hedged is recognized, the amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified in profit and loss on the same line as the item hedged; if part of a planned transaction on a non-financial asset or a liability, it is reclassified in the initial cost of the asset or liability.\n\nWhen the derivative instrument is a hedge of the net investment in a foreign company, it also qualifies as a cash flow hedge. For derivative instruments that do not qualify as hedges in accounting terms, the changes in their fair value are carried directly in profit and loss without remeasurement of the underlying asset or liability.\n\nIn addition, the income/expense related to the foreign exchange instruments used to hedge highly likely budgetary exposures and firm commitments, contracted as part of acquisition of rights on editorial content (sports, TV and film rights, etc.), are recognized in operating income. In all other cases, changes in the fair value of the instruments are recognized in other financial income and expenses.\n\n# Financial derivatives\n\n# **Balance sheet value**\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                   | 12/31/2023 | 12/31/2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Other non-current financial assets                       | 0.1        | 0.0        |\n| Trade and other receivables                              | 18.5       | 37.5       |\n| Other current financial assets                           | 0.6        | 1.8        |\n| TOTAL ASSET DERIVATIVES, EXCLUDING FINANCIAL DEBT(1)     | 19.2       | 39.3       |\n| Trade and other payables                                 | 23.6       | 14.3       |\n| Other current liabilities                                | 0.6        | 45.7       |\n| TOTAL LIABILITY DERIVATIVES, EXCLUDING FINANCIAL DEBT(1) | 24.2       | 60.0       |\n\n(1) Derivatives purchased for the management of currency risk, mainly within the Vivendi group.\n\n{247}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Currency risk management instruments\n\nThe tables below present the instruments for managing currency risk used by Vivendi;

directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices);\n- level 3: fair value estimated based on valuation techniques using significant data relating to the asset or liability which are not based on directly observable market data.\n\n# <span id=\"page-249-1\"></span>**NOTE 10.

NOTE 11. PROVISIONS AND DISPUTES**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nProvisions are liabilities whose actual due date or amount cannot be precisely determined.\n\n<span id=\"page-251-1\"></span>They are recognized when the Group has a present obligation resulting from a past act or event that will probably entail an outflow of resources that can be reliably estimated. The amount recorded must be the best estimate of the expenditure necessary to settle the obligation present at the closing date. It is discounted if the effect is significant and the due date is more than one year in the future.\n\nProvisions for restructuring are recognized as soon as the Group has a detailed formal plan of which the parties concerned have been notified. Provisions for contractual obligations mainly concern the restoration of premises used under service concession contracts. They are calculated at each fiscal year ended according to a work schedule extending over more than one year and revised annually to take account of the expenditure schedules.\n\n# **11.1.

LITIGATION IN PROGRESS**\n\nIn the normal course of their activities, Compagnie de l'Odet and its subsidiaries are party to a number of legal, administrative or arbitration proceedings.\n\nThe potential costs of these proceedings are the subject of provisions insofar as they are probable and quantifiable. The provisioned amounts are subject to a risk assessment on a case-by-case basis.\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, there are no other lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, governmental or legal proceedings or exceptional events (including any action of which the issuer has knowledge, and any currently suspended or threatened actions), that are likely to have or have had in recent months a significant impact on the financial situation, income, activity or assets of the company and the Group other than those described below.\n\n# Togo Guinea inquiry\n\nOn December 12, 2018 criminal charges were brought in a purely mechanical manner against Bolloré SE for bribery of a foreign public official, complicity in forgery and use of forged documents, and complicity in breach of trust, following the criminal charges brought on April 25, 2018 against two of its senior executives at the time. The allegations at the heart of the judicial inquiry go back to 2009-2010 and concern two operations in Togo and Guinea.\n\nThe inquiry seeks to determine whether the concessions obtained by local subsidiaries of the Group in Togo and Guinea were obtained because of communications services provided by Havas Group in those countries for 300,000 euros and 170,000 euros, respectively.\n\nBolloré SE has always strongly denied the facts alleged, which have been subject to numerous appeals before courts and tribunals.\n\nIn Guinea, the Group was named operator of the concession in 2010 because it had come in second during the international tender offer of 2008, after the default of the operator that had come in first.\n\nIn Togo, the concession agreement was signed on August 29, 2001, whereas the facts alleged would have occurred in 2009 and 2010, which is to say ten years later.\n\nIn these two countries, the Group's investments in port infrastructure today total over 500 million euros.\n\nIn a ruling handed down on September 26, 2019, the Second Examining Chamber of the Paris Court of Appeal canceled the indictment of Bolloré SE (and its two former senior executives) for complicity in forgery and use of forged documents in Togo, bribery of a foreign public official in Guinea and complicity in forgery and use of forged documents in Guinea.\n\nTo limit the length of these proceedings, Bolloré SE and Compagnie de l'Odet (formerly Financière de l'Odet SE) agreed to sign a deferred prosecution agreement (*convention judiciaire d'intérêt public* or CJIP) with the French National Financial Prosecutor's Office (*Parquet national financier* or PNF). This agreement signed on February 9, 2021 and validated by the Paris Judicial Court on February 26, 2021 is neither an admission of guilt nor a guilty verdict. It is a deal under which the PNF agreed to drop the charges against Bolloré SE, which agreed in turn to subject its compliance program to controls by the French anticorruption agency (Agence française anticorruption or AFA) for a period of two years and to bear the costs thereof up to 4 million euros. The Group's parent company, Compagnie de l'Odet (formerly Financière de l'Odet SE), agreed to pay a public interest fine of 12 million euros (which it paid on time).\n\nThe CJIP ended all charges brought against Bolloré SE.\n\nThe audits and checks carried out by the AFA with respect to the deferred prosecution agreement ended on March 8, 2023. Bolloré SE then received a draft final audit report from the AFA and provided its observations.\n\n# Autolib' vs. the Syndicat mixte Autolib' et Vélib' Métropole\n\nOn February 25, 2011, Syndicat mixte Autolib' et Vélib' Métropole (\"the SMAVM\") and Autolib' entered into a public service delegation for the purpose of installing, managing and maintaining a self-service electric automobile service and an electric vehicle recharging infrastructure (\"the agreement\" or \"the concession\").\n\nIn light of the updated 2016 business plan and the updated 2017 business plan that Autolib' forwarded to SMAVM, it was clear that the agreement was not economically attractive within the meaning of its article 63.2.1, and Autolib' notified SMAVM of this fact on May 25, 2018, in accordance with the agreement.\n\nSince the SMAVM did not wish to pay Autolib' the compensation called for in article 63.2.2 of the agreement in the event the concession should prove economically unattractive, it terminated the agreement per its article 63.3 in deliberation no. 2018-18 of June 21, 2018.\n\nArticle 63.3 of the agreement provides that, should the agreement be terminated pursuant to that article, the indemnification schedule in article 61 of the agreement shall apply.\n\nTherefore, Autolib' sent the SMAVM a letter dated September 25, 2018, with its request for indemnification for a total amount of 235,243,366 euros, calculated in accordance with articles 63.3 and 61 of the agreement.\n\nThe SMAVM, however, in a letter dated November 27, 2018, expressed its refusal to pay the indemnification referred to in item (vi) of article 61 of the agreement (indemnification and compensation due to Autolib' from the SMAVM since the threshold defined in article 63 of the agreement had been exceeded) by challenging Autolib's right to be compensated due to the threshold having been exceeded and to the agreement thus being recognized as economically unattractive.\n\nGiven this refusal by the SMAVM to pay the indemnification called for in item (vi) of article 61 of the agreement, thereby demonstrating a profound disagreement between the SMAVM and Autolib' about the amount of indemnification to be paid under article 61 of the agreement, Autolib' notified the SMAVM, in accordance with article 61 of the agreement and, in a letter dated November 29, 2018, that it was bringing the matter before the Arbitration Panel mentioned in article 70 of the agreement.\n\nArticle 61 of the agreement provides that: \"The Arbitration Panel may be appealed to by either party in the event of disagreement about the amount of this indemnification\".\n\n{253}------------------------------------------------\n\nArticle 70.1 of the agreement concerning the creation of an Arbitration Panel provides that, \"the Arbitration Panel shall consist of three (3) members whose personal and moral qualities and experience in public-private arrangements for comparable complex projects is well known. Within fifteen (15) calendar days after the appeal to the Arbitration Committee, each party will designate one (1) member, and the third member, who will be Chairman of the Arbitration Panel, will be chosen by common agreement between the two (2) members so designated. Failing an agreement within fifteen (15) calendar days, the Chairman of the Arbitration Panel will be designated by the Chief Judge of the Paris Administrative Court, at the request of the first party to act\".\n\nTherefore, and in compliance with said article 70.1 of the agreement, Autolib' and the SMAVM each proceeded on their own, on December 11 and 12, 2018, respectively, to designate the two out of three members of the Arbitration Panel.\n\nDespite numerous conversations held and proposals made by the members of the Arbitration Panel designated by the SMAVM and Autolib', the two were unable to reach an agreement as to the choice of a Chairman of the Arbitration Panel, even more than two months after the appeal to the Arbitration Panel on November 29, 2018.\n\nTherefore, and pursuant to article 70.1 of the agreement, Autolib' appealed to the Chief Judge of the Paris Administrative Court in a request dated February 12, 2019, so that she might appoint the Chairman of the Arbitration Panel.\n\nWhen the Chief Judge of the Administrative Court recused herself from making that appointment, Autolib' and the SMAVM granted the arbitrators a one-month extension to reach an agreement on the choice of a Chairman of the Arbitration Panel.\n\nHowever, no agreement on the selection of the Chairman of the Arbitration Panel had been reached between the two members of the Panel already appointed as at March 20, 2019.\n\nDespite the lack of agreement by the deadline agreed to between Autolib' and SMAVM, Autolib' remained keen to give the conciliation one last chance to take place. As such, in a letter dated March 22, 2019, Autolib' referred the matter back to a new Arbitration Panel, replacing the Arbitration Panel to which the matter was referred on November 29, 2018.\n\nHowever, unlike Autolib', the SMAVM, in a letter dated March 27, 2019, initially refused to appoint a member to the new Arbitration Panel other than the one originally designated.\n\nIn response to a letter from Autolib' dated March 29, 2019, calling on the SMAVM to appoint a new member of the Arbitration Panel and a reminder letter dated April 8, 2019, the SMAVM, in a letter dated on the same day, finally agreed to make every effort to appoint a new member to the Panel before April 23, 2019.\n\nHowever, contrary to all expectations, the SMAVM, in a letter dated April 23, 2019, subsequently informed Autolib' that it had been unable to appoint a new member to the Arbitration Panel within the agreed period, and that it intended to designate as a member of the new Panel the person appointed to the first.\n\nAs the arbitration proceeding was manifestly impossible, in the light of all the foregoing, Autolib', in a letter dated May 20, 2019, asked the SMAVM, prior to referring the matter to the Paris Administrative Court in accordance with article 71 of the Autolib' public service delegation agreement, to pay it the compensation due in accordance with article 63 and article 61 of the Autolib' public service delegation agreement, i.e. the sum of 235,243,366 euros, subject to adjustments, to cover the termination of the agreement.\n\nAs this request was implicitly rejected by the SMAVM on July 20, 2019, Autolib' applied to the Paris Administrative Court on September 9, 2019, asking it to force the SMAVM to pay it 235,243,366 euros, for the termination of the agreement, with interest and, where applicable, the compounding of accrued interest.\n\nUnder the terms of a judgment dated December 12, 2023, the Paris Administrative Court rejected Autolib's request while also refusing the requests of the SMAVM and the defendant municipalities made on the basis of article L. 761-1 of the French administrative justice code *(Code de justice administrative).* The court held that the SMAVM was liable to bear the entire share of the operating losses of the concession exceeding the threshold of losses accepted by the concession holder and set at 60 million euros in the contract, but that such a mechanism constituted a gift granted by a public entity, without, however, substantiating this characterization, thereby rendering the contract null and void. Autolib' appealed this judgment and intends to assert its rights in respect of all legal grounds available to it in this context.\n\n# LBBW *et al.* vs. Vivendi\n\nOn March 4, 2011, 26 institutional investors from Germany, Canada, Luxembourg, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Belgium and Austria sued Vivendi in the Paris Commercial Court for seeking damages for losses allegedly incurred due to four financial releases in October and December 2000, September 2001, and April 2002. On April 5 and April 23, 2012, two similar suits were filed against Vivendi: one by an American pension fund, the Public Employee Retirement System of Idaho, and the other by six German and British institutional investors. On August 8, 2012, British Columbia Investment Management Corporation also sued Vivendi on the same grounds. On January 7, 2015, the Paris Commercial Court appointed a third party responsible for checking the standing of the claimants and reviewing the documentation provided by them to evidence their alleged holding of the securities prior to the proceedings on the merits; this third party completed its task during the first half of 2018. On July 7, 2021, the Court issued its decisions on these various cases. The Court found Vivendi not liable in the absence of fault relating to the publication of inaccurate financial statements, the dissemination of false information and Vivendi's general communications from October 2000 to August 2002. The Court therefore dismissed all the plaintiffs' claims and ordered them to reimburse Vivendi's costs in the amount of 1,085,000 euros. The Court also ordered the provisional execution of the judgment. Almost all plaintiffs have appealed the judgment. All cases were distributed to the International Chamber of the Paris Court of Appeal. During a hearing on December 13, 2022, the timetable for the proceedings was set with pleadings scheduled for December 4 and 5, 2023, which were subsequently postponed to June 3 and 4, 2024.\n\n# California State Teachers Retirement System *et al.* vs. Vivendi\n\nOn April 27, 2012, 67 foreign institutional investors sued Vivendi in the Paris Commercial Court seeking damages for losses they allegedly incurred as a result of the financial communication of Vivendi between 2000 and 2002. On June 7 and September 5 and 6, 2012, 26 further parties joined the lawsuit. In November 2012 and March 2014, twelve plaintiffs withdrew. On January 7, 2015, the Paris Commercial Court appointed a third party responsible for checking the standing of the claimants and reviewing the documentation provided by them to evidence their alleged holding of the securities prior to the proceedings on the merits; this third party completed its task during the first half of 2018. On July 7, 2021, the Court issued its decisions on these various cases. The Court found Vivendi not liable in the absence of fault relating to the publication of inaccurate financial statements, the dissemination of false information and Vivendi's general communications from October 2000 to August 2002. The Court therefore dismissed all the plaintiffs' claims and ordered them to reimburse Vivendi's costs in the amount of 2,450,000 euros. The Court also ordered the provisional execution of the judgment. Almost all plaintiffs have appealed the judgment. The case was distributed to the International Chamber of the Court of Appeal of Paris. During a hearing on December 13, 2022, the timetable for the proceedings was set with pleadings scheduled for December 4 and 5, 2023, which were subsequently postponed to June 3 and 4, 2024.\n\n# European Commission investigation\n\nOn July 25, 2023, the European Commission announced that it had opened a formal investigation to determine whether, when acquiring Lagardère, Vivendi breached the notification and standstill obligations set out in the EU Merger Regulation, as well as the conditions and obligations attached to the Commission's decision to approve the Vivendi/Lagardère transaction. Vivendi is fully cooperating with this investigation.\n\n# Telecom Italia\n\nOn August 5, 2017, the Italian government informed Vivendi that it was opening a formal investigation to verify whether Telecom Italia and Vivendi had complied with certain provisions of legislative decree no. 21 of March 15, 2012 on \"regulating special powers in the areas at defense and national security\" (article 1) and \"activities of strategic importance in the energy, transportation and communications sectors\" (article 2). It was Vivendi's view that the provisions of this law did not apply to Vivendi.\n\n{254}------------------------------------------------\n\nOn September 28, 2017, the President of the Council of Ministers found that the notification made as a precautionary measure by Vivendi under article 1 of the aforementioned legislative decree was made late and that Telecom Italia had failed to make the required notification under article 2 of the decree after the change in control over its assets of strategic importance in the energy, transportation and communications sectors. The President of the Council of Ministers thus initiated proceedings against Telecom Italia for failure to give notice under article 2 of the same legislative decree. Vivendi and Telecom Italia appealed this decision. On September 6, 2022, the Administrative Court of Latium dismissed Vivendi's appeal, which appealed this decision to the Council of State. On July 5, 2023, the Italian Council of State dismissed Vivendi's appeal.\n\nMoreover, in this same context, Consob declared on September 13, 2017 that Vivendi exercises de facto control over Telecom Italia. Vivendi and Telecom Italia formally contest this position, and have appealed to the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio. On April 17, 2019, the Court dismissed the appeal brought by Telecom Italia and Vivendi, which subsequently appealed to the Italian Council of State on July 16 and 17, 2019, respectively. On December 14, 2020, the Italian Council of State ruled in favor of Vivendi and Telecom Italia. On June 11, 2021, Consob appealed against the Italian Council of State's decision before the Italian Supreme Court. On January 24, 2023, the Italian Supreme Court rejected Consob's appeal, putting a definitive end to this procedure.\n\n# Vivendi against TIM SpA\n\nOn December 15, 2023, Vivendi filed a complaint against TIM SpA before the Court of Milan seeking the annulment of the resolution adopted by TIM's Board of Directors on November 5, 2023, which approved the sale of the company's fixed-line network, and requesting a declaration that the transaction agreement entered into on November 6, 2023 was unenforceable. The first court hearing has been scheduled for May 21, 2024.\n\n# Epac against Interforum and Editis\n\nIn 2015, Interforum entered into an on-demand printing contract with Epac Technologies Ltd. In 2020, a disagreement emerged regarding the execution of the contract. On March 29, 2021, Epac informed Interforum and Editis that it was terminating the agreement entered into in 2015 as at March 31, 2021 and filed a lawsuit against them with the Supreme Court of the State of New York, claiming they had allegedly not paid invoices or complied with several contractual obligations and requesting the defendants be ordered to pay damages. On July 20, 2021, Epac extended the lawsuit to Vivendi which, on September 30, 2021, filed a motion to dismiss this lawsuit before the New York courts. In September 2021, discovery proceedings commenced against Editis. On December 29, 2021, Epac also called for a discovery proceedings against Vivendi. On June 16, 2022, a hearing was held on the motion to dismiss filed by Vivendi, under which the judge accepted Vivendi's dismissal. Epac appealed this decision on August 5, 2022. The parties have agreed to suspend any discovery during the appeal proceedings and until a decision is made. On June 29, 2023, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York granted Epac's appeal, thereby reinstating Vivendi as a defendant in the case. On August 10, 2023, Vivendi filed an appeal, which was opposed by Epac, against this decision before the Court of Appeal. This request was denied on November 9, 2023. On December 12, 2023, Vivendi filed a new motion before the New York Court of Appeal seeking leave to appeal.\n\n# Cameron Parish and the State of Louisiana against Texas Pacific Oil Company and others\n\nIn 2016, Cameron Parish and the State of Louisiana sued a number of oil companies, including Texas Pacific Oil Company (a former Seagram subsidiary, now owned by Vivendi). The companies were accused of conducting various oil and gas exploration and production activities that had allegedly damaged and contaminated the coastline. Of the 1,000 oil wells at issue in the case, 7 belonged to Texas Pacific Oil Company. Following mediation, the parties entered into a settlement agreement on December 13, 2023, thereby ending the proceedings.\n\n# Parabole Réunion\n\nOn August 11, 2009, Parabole Réunion lodged a fast-track claim against Groupe Canal+ with the Paris Regional Court, seeking that Groupe Canal+ be ordered to provide a channel of equivalent attractiveness to TPS Foot in 2006 and to pay damages. On April 26, 2012, Parabole Réunion also sued Canal+ France, Groupe Canal+ and Canal+ Distribution before the Paris Regional Court for the purpose of establishing the breach by Groupe Canal+ companies of their contractual obligations towards Parabole Réunion and their commitments to the minister of the Economy. These two claims were combined in a single suit. On April 29, 2014, the Regional Court ruled that the Parabole Réunion claims were partly admissible for the period after June 19, 2008 and accepted the contractual liability of Groupe Canal+ for the inferior quality of the channels made available to Parabole Réunion. The Court also ordered an expert appraisal of damages suffered by Parabole Réunion, rejecting the company's own appraisals. On June 3, 2016, the Court of Appeal upheld the Regional Court's April 29, 2014 ruling. Groupe Canal+ appealed to have the ruling quashed but was denied on January 31, 2018.\n\nOn January 17, 2017, the Paris Regional Court ordered Groupe Canal+ to pay 37,720,000 euros with provisional enforcement. Parabole Réunion appealed this ruling to the Paris Court of Appeal on February 23, 2017.\n\nOn May 29, 2017, Parabole Réunion raised an incidental question in order to have the court appoint an additional expert to assess the loss in value of its business. On October 12, 2017, the pre-trial judge of the Paris Court of Appeal granted this request and a judicial expert was appointed. On January 15, 2021, the judicial expert filed his final report. On 30 March 2021, Parabole Réunion filed submissions claiming that the expert's report was invalid.\n\nOn February 11, 2022, the Paris Court of Appeal issued its decision. It denied the request to nullify the appraisal report and confirmed the ruling of January 17, 2017 in all its provisions except for the amount of compensation for Parabole Réunion's operating losses. As a result, it ordered Groupe Canal+ to pay 48.55 million euros for operating losses over the 2008-2012 period, and to pay 29.5 million euros for operating losses over the 2013-2016 period, all with capitalization at the interest rate of 11% from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016. It also ordered Groupe Canal+ to pay one million euros in compensation for reputational damage and 500,000 euros in compensation for non-pecuniary losses.\n\nOn February 17, 2022, Parabole Réunion referred two requests to the Court of Appeal: one for correction of material errors relating to the amount of the compensation for operating losses as at December 31, 2012; the other failing to rule on interest and the compound interest rate applicable between January 1, 2017 and February 11, 2022. In a ruling dated April 15, 2022, the Court of Appeal dismissed Parabole Réunion's claims in respect of its request for omission, considering that it had rejected the request relating to the compound interest as from January 1, 2017. However, it granted its request for correction of the material error, considering that compensation for the operating loss suffered between 2008 and 2012 should be compounded over this period.\n\nOn April 19, 2022, Parabole Réunion sent a new request for correction of a material error against the decision of the Paris Court of Appeal of April 15, 2022, considering that, with regard to compensation for the operating loss suffered until 2012, the compounding was to apply from 2008 to 2016 and not from 2008 to 2012. On May 13, 2022, the Court of Appeal dismissed this request.\n\nOn May 16, 2022, Groupe Canal+ filed two appeals against the rulings of the Paris Court of Appeal of February 11, and April 15, 2022. On May 25, 2022, Parabole Réunion also filed an appeal against the judgments of the Court of Appeal. However, Groupe Canal+ withdrew from its second appeal on September 15, 2022. The hearing before the Commercial Chamber of the Cour de Cassation (French Supreme Court) was held on January 10, 2023. On March 1, 2023, it issued a partial cassation ruling, under which it confirmed the amount of the main sentence handed down by the Court of Appeal on February 11, 2022, but dismissed and canceled the provisions of the ruling condemning Groupe Canal+ to pay Parabole Réunion interest at the compound rate of 11% and referred the case to the Paris Court of Appeal, otherwise composed.\n\n{255}------------------------------------------------\n\nOn March 28, 2023, Parabole Réunion filed an appeal before the Paris Court of Appeal. On June 27, 2023, Parabole Réunion filed pleadings, primarily seeking payment for compensatory damages and interest, including (i) interest capitalized at 11% for the period 2008 to 2012, (ii) 190 million euros in respect of 2013 and 2014, and (iii) interest capitalized at the regulatory rates applied by Arcep since 2013 (i.e., ranging from 4.8% to 10%). It is still seeking publication of the decision and 12.5 million euros under article 700 of the French civil code *(Code civil)* procedure. The hearing before the Court of Appeal has been scheduled for June 24, 2024.\n\nOn July 4, 2023, Parabole Réunion filed a motion for a material correction to the operative part of the Paris Court of Appeal's decision of February 11, 2022, which related to the principal amount of the operating losses for the period from June 2008 to 2012 for which Canal+ Group was ordered to compensate Parabole Réunion, seeking to increase such principal mount from 48.55 million euros to 49,302,878 euros.\n\n# \"Touche Pas à Mon Poste\"\n\nOn 7 June 2017, the Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA, recently replaced by the Regulatory Authority for Audiovisual and Digital Communication (Autorité de régulation de la communication audiovisuelle et numérique or \"Arcom\")) decided to sanction C8 for a sequence with the columnist Capucine Anav, broadcast during the \"TPMP\" show on December 7, 2016, which it considered to have degraded the image of women. On the same day, the CSA also penalized C8 for another sequence in the \"TPMP ! La Grande Rassrah\" show of November 3, 2016. The CSA considered that this other segment had violated the dignity of a columnist on the show. In both cases, the sanction consisted of suspending advertising during the show and any rebroadcasts.\n\nOn July 3, 2017, following these two CSA rulings, C8 filed two requests for annulment with the French Council of State *(Conseil d'État).* On July 4, 2017, C8 also filed two actions for damages with the CSA, which were implicitly rejected. On November 2, 2017, C8 appealed these decisions to the Council of State. On June 18, 2018, the Council of State rejected C8's first petition for judicial review but did uphold its second petition by overturning the decision of the CSA. The Council of State's rejection of the first petition was appealed to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in December 2018 and was rejected on February 9, 2023. On November 13, 2019, the Council of State rejected the first action for damages but allowed the second, ordering the CSA to pay 1.1 million euros to C8, for the week during which the channel was deprived of advertising. The Council of State's decision to dismiss C8's claim for compensation over the segment with Capucine Anav was the subject of an appeal before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which was filed in December 2018 and dismissed on February 9, 2023. On May 4, 2023, C8 filed an appeal before the Grand Chamber of the ECHR, which was dismissed on June 26, 2023, thereby rendering the ECHR's decision to dismiss the case on February 9, 2023 final.\n\nOn July 26, 2017, the CSA decided to penalize C8 for a sequence broadcast during \"TPMP Baba hot line\" on May 18, 2017, judging that the channel had ignored the principle of respect for private life and its obligation to fight against discrimination, levying a cash fine of 3 millions euros. Following this decision, on September 22, 2017, C8 filed a petition for judicial review with the French Council of State, which was rejected on June 18, 2018. An appeal against this decision was filed with the ECHR in December 2018. On February 18, 2019, Groupe Canal+ sent a letter to the CSA requesting the cancellation of the aforementioned 3 million euros fine. This request was denied on April 5, 2019. An appeal against this decision was filed with the Council of State on June 5, 2019 and was rejected on September 28, 2020. In March 2021, an appeal was filed with the ECHR. By decision of February 9, 2023, the ECHR rejected the appeal. On May 4, 2023, C8 filed an appeal before the Grand Chamber of the ECHR, which was dismissed on June 26, 2023, thereby rendering the ECHR's decision to dismiss the case on February 9, 2023 final.\n\nOn November 17, 2022, the Arcom referred the matter to the independent rapporteur as part of the launch of a disciplinary procedure against channel C8 after the host of \"TPMP\", Cyril Hanouna made remarks that could be considered offensive against the member of parliament Louis Boyard during the program broadcast on November 10, 2022. On November 29, 2022, the independent rapporteur sent a statement of complaints to the channel. A hearing was held at Arcom on February 8, 2023 and the Arcom decided on February 9, 2023 to impose a fine of 3.5 million euros on C8. In a supplementary decision dated February 9, 2023, the Arcom also sent a formal notice to C8 on the same issue. On April 7, 2023, C8 filed an appeal against the fine and a summary appeal against the formal notice before the Council of State.\n\nOn November 18, 2022, Arcom issued a formal notice to C8 for comments made during several \"TPMP\" programs in October 2022 relating to the killing of a teenager. On January 17, 2023, C8 filed an appeal against this decision with the Council of State, which was dismissed on December 21, 2023.\n\nOn January 11, 2023, the Arcom independent rapporteur initiated disciplinary proceedings against C8 and notified the channel of its complaints following a \"TPMP\" program broadcast on October 5, 2022, in which Cyril Hanouna made statements about certain mayors, including the Mayor of Paris, which could be qualified as offensive. On May 31, 2023, the Arcom imposed a fine on the channel, ordering it to pay 300,000 euros. On July 27, 2023, the channel filed an appeal before the Council of State.\n\nOn January 13, 2023, the Arcom independent rapporteur initiated disciplinary proceedings against C8 and notified the channel of its complaints following a promotion of the films *Les Segpa* and *Ténor* in the programs \"Le 6 à 7\" and \"TPMP\" on April 19, 2022 and May 4, 2022, which could be qualified as surreptitious advertising. On June 21, 2023, the Arcom decided not to impose a sanction on the channel.\n\nOn January 16, 2023, the Arcom independent rapporteur initiated disciplinary proceedings against C8 following several occurrences in the programs \"Le 6 à 7\" and \"TPMP\" in November 2022, in which certain brands could be seen, which could be qualified as surreptitious advertising. On March 15, 2023, the Arcom independent rapporteur initiated disciplinary proceedings against C8 following several occurrences in the programs \"Le 6 à 7\" and \"TPMP\" in January 2023, in relation to the display of several brands, which could be qualified as surreptitious advertising. On June 21, 2023, the Arcom imposed a total fine on the channel of 200,000 euros in respect of these two proceedings. On August 18, 2023, C8 filed an appeal before the Council of State against this decision.\n\nOn April 14, 2023, following statements made by Gérard Fauré during a \"TPMP\" broadcast on March 9, 2023, the independent rapporteur of the Council of State, at the request of the Arcom, initiated sanction proceedings on April 14, 2023 for breaches of human rights, the requirement to exercise discretion in dealing with ongoing legal proceedings and the obligation to maintain editorial control over the broadcast. On July 26, 2023, the Arcom imposed a fine of 500,000 euros on C8. On September 25, 2023, C8 filed an appeal against this decision.\n\nOn June 12, 2023, following the broadcast of images and videos of Joy Smet (known as Hallyday) and comments made by Cyril Hanouna and his panelists during a segment of \"TPMP\" on January 30, 2023, the independent rapporteur of the Council of State initiated sanction proceedings against C8 for breaches of Joy Smet's image rights, respect for honor and reputation, and the obligation to maintain editorial control over the broadcast. On July 13, 2023, C8 submitted its observations to the independent rapporteur and believes that it did not commit any breach in the context of this segment. On January 17, 2024, the Arcom imposed a fine of 50,000 euros on C8.\n\n# Broadcasts on CNews\n\nOn December 3, 2019, the CSA gave formal notice to the CNews channel to comply with its obligations to respect human dignity and to promote the values of integration and solidarity, following comments made on the \"Face à l'info\" show on October 23, 2019 which were considered to encourage discrimination on religious grounds. CNews filed an appeal before the Council of State seeking to annul the CSA's decision, but this appeal was dismissed in June 2021. In December 2021, CNews filed an appeal before the European Court of Human Rights, which was dismissed on November 30, 2023.\n\nIn October 2020, the independent rapporteur, at the request of the CSA, initiated sanction proceedings against CNews, following comments made on the \"Face à l'info\" show on September 29, 2020 with respect to unaccompanied migrant minors. On March 17, 2021, the CSA imposed a fine of 200,000 euros on CNews. CNews filed an appeal before the Council of State, which was dismissed on July 12, 2022. On November 12, 2022, CNews filed an appeal before the European Court of Human Rights.\n\n{256}------------------------------------------------\n\nOn 15 May 2023, the Arcom's independent rapporteur initiated sanction proceedings against CNews in relation to two segments on the shows \"La Matinale Week-End\" and \"Midi News Week-End\" which were broadcast on September 24, 2022, and a segment on \"Face à l'info\" which was broadcast on September 26, 2022. These segments related to an \"international ranking of the safest cities\" conducted by the Numbeo website and were deemed to constitute a breach of honesty and accuracy with respect to their presentation and handling of information, as well as a failure to provide different points of view. On June 19, 2023, C8 submitted its observations to the independent rapporteur and believes that it did not commit any breach in the context of these segments. On January 17, 2024, the Arcom imposed a fine of 50,000 euros on CNews.\n\nOn 5 January 2024, the Arcom's independent rapporteur initiated sanction proceedings against CNews targeting three segments aired on CNews during which statements were made that could constitute breaches of the channel's obligations (inciting hatred and encouraging discriminatory behavior, as well as of the obligation to maintain editorial control over the broadcast).\n\n# Groupe Canal+ vs. Mediapro\n\nOn September 18, 2020, Groupe Canal+ filed a lawsuit against Mediapro before the Nanterre Commercial Court for unequal treatment and discriminatory practices in the context of discussions that had taken place between the two companies regarding the distribution of the Telefoot channel, which has been discontinued. On October 2, 2020, the Nanterre Commercial Court referred the case to the Paris Commercial Court.\n\nOn November 20, 2020, Mediapro filed a lawsuit against Groupe Canal+ before the Paris Commercial Court, requesting the Court to rule that Groupe Canal+ (i) abused its dominant position in the channel distribution market by unfairly discriminating against Mediapro and (ii) made disparaging statements constituting unfair competition. The two cases were joined at a hearing on February 8, 2021.\n\nOn June 16, 2022, Mediapro Internacional sued Groupe Canal+ on similar grounds. In a ruling of October 18, 2022, the Court decided to include the question of the admissibility of Mediapro International's action and its relevance to the case with the debates on the merits.\n\nOn January 31, 2023, the Paris Commercial Court dismissed all of their respective claims. On March 30, 2023, Mediapro appealed against the Paris Commercial Court's decision.\n\n# Groupe Canal+ vs. the Professional Football League\n\nFollowing the cancellation of a number of Ligue 1 championship matches between December 2018 and April 2019 due to the \"Yellow Vests\" movement, and their unilateral postponement by decision of the League of Professional Football (LFP), Groupe Canal+ sued the LFP on July 4, 2019, seeking damages to cover the financial losses suffered as a result of these postponements. Having acquired broadcast rights of matches and magazines for time slots identified during the tender process for the seasons from 2016-2017 to 2019-2020, Groupe Canal+ considers that the LFP violated the outcome of the tender process and has requested 46 million euros in damages. At a hearing on November 25, 2019, the LFP asked for Groupe Canal+'s requests to be rejected and for Canal+ to be ordered to pay compensation for the damages it allegedly caused by the publicity surrounding these proceedings. On June 1, 2021, the Paris Commercial Court denied Groupe Canal+'s claims and ordered it to pay 10,000 euros to the LFP for wrongful disparagement, as well as 50,000 euros in legal fees. Groupe Canal+ appealed this decision. The LFP filed a cross-appeal to have Groupe Canal+'s penalty for denigration (for publishing the lawsuit in the newspaper *L'Équipe*) to be reassessed From 10,000 euros to 500,000 euros. Oral arguments were heard on December 7, 2023 and a decision is expected to be issued on March 29, 2024.\n\nOn January 22, 2021, Groupe Canal+ brought summary proceedings against the LFP before the Paris Commercial Court, following the call for tenders launched by the LFP on January 19, 2021 for the sale of the Ligue 1 rights returned by Mediapro and seeking, among other things, the cancellation of the call for tenders and an order requiring the LFP to pay Groupe Canal+ the difference between the price of lot 3 acquired by it in connection with the 2018 call for tenders and not included in the contested call for tenders and its actual economic value. On March 11, 2021, the Paris Commercial Court issued its judgment, dismissing all of Group Canal+'s claims and ordering it to pay 50,000 euros in legal fees. On April 6, 2021, Groupe Canal+ appealed against this decision before the Paris Court of Appeal. On June 23, 2022, the pre-trial judge issued an order postponing judgment pending the appeal against the decision of the French Competition Authority of June 11, 2021, which was rejected on June 30, 2022 (see below). The case hearing before the Court of Appeal took place on December 8, 2022. On February 3, 2023, the Versailles Court of Appeal upheld the original ruling. Groupe Canal+ filed an appeal with the French Supreme Court on March 10, 2023.\n\nOn January 29, 2021, Groupe Canal+ also filed a complaint and a request for protective measures against the LFP before the French Competition Authority, seeking to require the LFP to organize a new call for tenders for all Ligue 1 broadcasting rights. On June 11, 2021, the French Competition Authority denied Groupe Canal+'s request to file a claim on the merits for lack of sufficiently probative evidence, and consequently, its request for precautionary measures. Groupe Canal+ appealed this decision and its appeal was rejected on June 30, 2022. Groupe Canal+ filed an appeal with the French Supreme Court on July 28, 2022.\n\nOn July 26, 2021, beIN Sports sued the LFP, in the presence of Groupe Canal+, before the Paris Judicial Court in order to ask the Court to recognize the expiry of the contract relating to lot 3 and, alternatively, to terminate it on the basis of article 1195 of the French civil code *(Code civil).* On March 29, 2022, the pre-trial judge ordered a deferment until the Paris Court of Appeal, to which the appeal against the decision of the Commercial Court of March 11, 2021 referred to above was referred, issued its ruling. This ruling was made on February 3, 2023, confirming the Commercial Court's decision. BeIN Sports appealed the deferment. On December 2, 2022, the Court of Appeal confirmed the deferment and extended it until the termination of appeals against the decision of the French Competition Authority of November 30, 2022 (see below). Groupe Canal+ and beIN Sports renounced appealing against the decision of the French Competition Authority of November 30, 2022 to put an end to the deferment. As a result, a hearing was held before the pre-trial judge on April 3, 2023, which scheduled the end of the discussions on April 24, 2023. Oral arguments were heard on June 20, 2023. On September 19, 2023, the Paris Judicial Court dismissed all of beIN Sports and Canal+ Group's claims. Canal+ Group and beIN Sports appealed against this decision on October 19 and November 6 2023, respectively.\n\nOn December 24, 2021, Groupe Canal+ filed a second complaint as well as a request for precautionary measures to the French Competition Authority against the LFP. Groupe Canal+ asked the French Competition Authority to note that LFP has used discriminatory practices by awarding most of the rights to broadcast Ligue 1 games to Amazon for a price of 250 million euros per season while Canal+ is forced to operate a Ligue 1 lot awarded in 2018 for 332 million euros per season and that these practices constitute abuse of a dominant position. It also asked the French Competition Authority to recognize the nullity of the contracts entered into by the LFP with beIN Sports in May 2018 and by the LFP with Amazon in June 2021, and to order the companies implicated to pay any financial penalties that it deems appropriate. Finally, it requested the issuance of precautionary measures consisting of the suspending the agreement concluded with Amazon on June 11, 2021 following the broadcast of the Ligue 1 2021-2022 season and a new award of lot 3 and lots operated by Amazon for the 2022-2023 to 2023-2024 seasons under non-discriminatory conditions. On November 30, 2022, the French Competition Authority rejected all requests made by Groupe Canal+ (complaint on the merits and request for precautionary measures). Groupe Canal+ and beIN Sports have waived the right to appeal this decision by the French Competition Authority in order to put an end to the deferment in the proceedings brought before the Court of Justice by beIN Sports against the LFP relating to the expiry of the lot 3 contract (see above).\n\n# BeIN Sports vs. Groupe Canal+\n\nAs part of the 2018 call for tenders for the rights to broadcast the Ligue 1 soccer championship for the 2020-2021 to 2023-2024 seasons, beIN Sports was awarded lot 3 and subsequently sub-licensed these rights to Groupe Canal+. Following the return of the Ligue 1 championship broadcasting rights for lots 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7 by Mediapro in January 2021, the French Professional Football League (LFP) subsequently awarded these rights to Amazon on June 11, 2021, for 250 million euros (compared to the 780 million euros paid for these same lots when they were awarded to Mediapro). Considering the price paid by Groupe Canal+ for the rights to broadcast the lot 3 matches compared to the price of the matches sold to Amazon, Groupe Canal+ believes that it has been subject to serious inequality of treatment and discriminatory practices. Accordingly, it has notified the LFP that it will no longer broadcast this lot 3 once the championship resumes in August.\n\n{257}------------------------------------------------\n\nAt the same time, Groupe Canal+ enjoined beIN Sports, in its capacity as licensee of the rights of lot 3, to carry out any legal proceedings to bring about the expiry of the contract relating to lot 3 entered into between beIN Sports and LFP and to refer the matter to the French Competition Authority on the grounds of discriminatory practices and distortion of competition. In view of the inaction of beIN Sports, Groupe Canal+ notified the latter, on July 12, 2021, that it suspended the performance of its obligations under the sub-licensing agreement, considering that beIN Sports itself failed to fulfill its essential obligation to carry out the above-mentioned legal actions. On July 16, 2021, beIN Sports, considering that the suspension of performance of the sub-licensing agreement constituted a manifestly unlawful disturbance and exposed beIN Sports to imminent damages vis-à-vis the LFP, filed an injunction against Groupe Canal+ with the Nanterre Commercial Court, requesting that the Court order Groupe Canal+ to produce, broadcast and pay for the matches in lot 3 of the French Ligue 1 championship, subject to a fine in the event of non-compliance.\n\nOn July 23, 2021, the Nanterre Commercial Court dismissed beIN Sports' requests.\n\nOn July 29, 2021, beIN Sports sued Groupe Canal+ again before the Nanterre Commercial Court to force it to perform its obligations under the sub-licensing agreement. On August 5, 2021, the Commercial Court issued a summary order asking Groupe Canal+ to honor all said obligations pending a decision on the merits of the termination or expiry of the contract. With a limit of 90 days, the fine for non-compliance was determined at one million euros per day. Groupe Canal+ appealed this decision. On March 31, 2022, the Versailles Court of Appeal issued two judgments confirming the interim orders of the Nanterre Commercial Court of July 23, 2021 and August 5, 2021, ordering Groupe Canal+ to continue the execution of the contract relating to Lot no. 3. Groupe Canal+ filed an appeal against the Versailles Court of Appeal ruling on the order of August 5, 2021. BeIN filed an appeal against the Versailles Court of Appeal ruling on the order of July 23, 2021. On May 10, 2023, the Counselor of the Commercial Chamber of the French Supreme Court issued a report on the two appeals. On October 25, 2023, the French Supreme Court dismissed, without providing any reason, the appeal filed by beIN Sports against the Versailles Court of Appeal's decision issued on March 31, 2022. On December 13, 2023, the French Supreme Court also dismissed the appeal filed by Canal+ Group against this March 31, 2022 decision.\n\nFurthermore, on February 2, 2022, beIN Sports filed summary proceedings against Groupe Canal+ before the Paris Commercial Court asking it to rule that the termination clause provided for in the sub-licensing agreement did not comply with the requirements in article 1225 of the French civil code *(Code civil)* and that it was therefore null and void, consequently ordering Groupe Canal+ to fulfill all of its obligations under the sub-licensing agreement. On July 5, 2022, the Commercial Court ruled that the termination clause was valid but that Groupe Canal+ was not entitled to terminate its sub-license agreement with beIN Sports. On August 2, 2022, Groupe Canal+ appealed against this decision before the Paris Court of Appeal. The hearing before the Paris Court of Appeal has been scheduled for April 4, 2024.\n\n# Proceedings before the Bobigny Labor Court\n\nSeveral employees of the Canal+ call center in Saint-Denis have initiated proceedings against Groupe Canal+ with the Bobigny employment tribunal to seek the cancellation of their dismissal on the grounds that the employment protection plan implemented in the call center is discriminatory. In two decisions handed down in May and October 2021, the plaintiffs' case was dismissed and they appealed this decision. The appeal proceedings are ongoing.\n\n# Thierry Ardisson, Ardis, and Télé Paris vs. C8 and SECP\n\nOn September 24, 2019, Thierry Ardisson and the companies Ardis and Télé Paris initiated summary proceedings against C8 and SECP before the Paris Commercial Court for termination of trade relations with no notice, following the non-renewal of the shows \"Les Terriens du Samedi\" and \"Les Terriens du Dimanche\", citing a situation of economic dependence. The plaintiffs sought an order in solidum from C8 and SECP to pay Ardis 5,821,680 euros, Télé Paris 3,611,429 euros and Thierry Ardisson 1 million euros to cover his alleged non-pecuniary losses. On January 21, 2020, a judgment was rendered under which C8 was ordered to pay 811,500 euros to Ardis and 269,333 euros to Télé Paris. Thierry Ardisson's case was dismissed and SECP was found not to have grounds for its claim. On March 16, 2020, Thierry Ardisson, Ardis and Télé Paris appealed this decision. On September 10, 2021, the Paris Court of Appeal ordered C8 to pay 3,800,476 euros to Ardis and 2,293,657 euros to Télé Paris, as well as a total of 417,587 euros for the latter's damages related to layoffs, representing an overall amount of 6.5 million euros. On September 20, 2021, C8 filed an appeal with the French Supreme Court.\n\nOn October 19, 2022, the Cour de Cassation (French Supreme Court) issued its ruling under which it issued a partial annulment of the Court of Appeal's ruling on the determination of the loss resulting from the sudden termination and thus canceled the provisions of the ruling condemning C8 to pay Ardis the sum of 3,800,476 euros and Télé Paris the sum of 2,293,657 euros in damages. The case is referred to the Paris Court of Appeal, which is otherwise composed.\n\nOn August 3, 2023, C8 and SECP entered into a settlement agreement with Télé Paris, thereby putting an end to part of the litigation. The proceedings in relation to Ardis's claims are continuing before the Paris Court of Appeal.\n\n# Groupe Canal+ vs. Technicolor\n\nIn December 2016, Groupe Canal+ and Technicolor entered into an agreement to manufacture and deliver G9 set-top boxes (for mainland France) and G9 Light set-top boxes (for Poland). In 2017, Technicolor challenged the prices agreed with Groupe Canal+ and ultimately decided to terminate this agreement at the end of 2017. As a result, Groupe Canal+ brought summary proceedings against Technicolor before the Nanterre Commercial Court for breach of contract. On December 15, 2017, Groupe Canal+'s claim was rejected. However, on December 6, 2018, the Versailles Court of Appeal ruled in its favor, recognizing the wrongful nature of the termination of the contract by Technicolor. Technicolor filed an appeal with the French Supreme Court which was dismissed on June 24, 2020.\n\nIn parallel, on September 2, 2019, Groupe Canal+ sued Technicolor before the Paris Commercial Court for breach of its contractual commitments. In its complaint, Groupe Canal+ alleged that Technicolor had failed to deliver the G9 and G9 Light set-top boxes in accordance with the manufacturing and delivery agreements entered into between the two companies. Groupe Canal+ requested reimbursement of the additional costs paid and alternative transport costs, the payment of late fees and damages. On October 9, 2019, Technicolor, in turn, brought summary proceedings against Groupe Canal+ as well as Canal+ Réunion, Canal+ Antilles and Canal+ Calédonie before the Nanterre Commercial Court for non-payment. On September 2, 2020, the Paris Commercial Court declared that the matter lay outside its jurisdiction and referred the dispute to the Nanterre Commercial Court. On October 22, 2021, the Nanterre Commercial Court issued a decision under which it acknowledged that Technicolor's termination of the contract was unfair, as were its requests for price increases. The Court also ordered an appraisal to determine the amounts requested by Groupe Canal+ in connection with this dispute. Technicolor appealed this decision. On February 3, 2022, a hearing was held on Technicolor's appeal, which was rejected in a ruling on March 3, 2022. The proceedings before the Nanterre Commercial Court are ongoing with regard to the appraisal ordered.\n\n# \"Free-to-air\" cases\n\nOn April 22, 2021, TF1, TMC, TFX, TF1 Séries Films, LCI, TF1 Films Production and TF1 Acquisition of Rights filed a complaint against Groupe Canal+ and SECP before the Paris Judicial Court, claiming that Canal+'s national free-toair broadcasting in March 2020 during the first lockdown constituted an act of piracy and unfair or prejudicial competition against them. Oral arguments were heard on September 26, 2023. On January 25, 2024, the Paris Judicial Court issued its decision, ordering SECP et Groupe Canal+ to pay GIE TF1 the sum of 681,000 euros and to pay TF1, TMC, TFX, and TF1 Films Productions to pay the sum of 739,062.50 euros. SECP and Groupe Canal+ were also ordered to pay the sum of 100,000 euros for the non-pecuniary loss suffered by the plaintiffs and 20,000 euros under article 700 of the French civil code *(Code civil)* procedure.\n\nOn April 23, 2021, France Télévisions, France 2 Cinéma and France 3 Cinéma filed a lawsuit against SECP before the Paris Judicial Court on similar grounds. On December 9, 2023, the parties entered into a settlement agreement, thereby ending the proceedings.\n\n{258}------------------------------------------------\n\n# UFC Que Choisir against Groupe Canal+ and SECP\n\nOn April 20, 2018 the Direction départementale de la protection des populations des Hauts-de-Seine (DDPP92) took out an injunction against Groupe Canal+ to cease placing its subscribers on contract into enhanced products, a practice which the DDPP92 deemed to be an \"unordered sale.\" At the same time, DDPP92 informed Groupe Canal+ that it had referred the case to the office of the Nanterre Public Prosecutor along with a statement that it deemed Canal+ Group to have committed the offense of a forced sale of services which is prohibited under the French consumer code *(Code de la consommation).* On July 8, 2020, the Nanterre Judicial Court approved a plea bargain agreement between Groupe Canal+ and the Nanterre Deputy Public Prosecutor.\n\nOn April 27, 2021, UFC Que Choisir brought proceedings against Groupe Canal+ and SECP before the Nanterre Judicial Court, as part of a class action for reimbursement of amounts overpaid to subscribers.\n\nIn an order dated November 25, 2022, confirmed by a decision of the Paris Court of Appeal issued on November 14, 2023, the pre-trial judge rejected Groupe Canal+'s motions to dismiss.\n\n# \"Audiovisual production obligations\" case\n\nOn March 24, 2021, the CSA (now Arcom) issued a formal notice to the Canal+ channel to \"comply, in the future, with its obligations to contribute to the development of the production of French films, independent French films and original French-language films\". The breaches referred to by the CSA relate to the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years. On May 19, 2021, Canal+ appealed this notice with the Council of State, which was rejected on January 27, 2023.\n\n# Sacem against Groupe Canal+\n\nOn June 9, 2023, Sacem brought proceedings against Groupe Canal+ before the Nanterre Judicial Court, alleging that Groupe Canal+ had infringed copyrighted works held in its catalog by distributing the TNT SAT offer without authorization since 2007.\n\nGroupe Canal+ is being asked to disclose the following to Sacem, under penalty of a fine, the revenue generated from the sales of reception equipment to which the TNT SAT offer applied, any revenue received from linear television and radio service providers in exchange for their inclusion in the TNT SAT offer, and the list of linear television and radio services included in the TNT SAT offer since its inception. Such information is required in relation to the period from 2007 to 2022.\n\n# Inquiry by US judicial authorities into commercial practices in the advertising industry\n\nOn June 11, 2018, Havas Group received an injunction to provide documents concerning one of its subsidiaries in Spain – Havas Media Alliance WWSL. These documents were sent to the relevant American authorities. This request from the US judicial authorities seems to concern commercial practices followed in the area of discounts and rebates. At this point, Havas Group is not part of any proceedings and no claims have been made against it. There have been no new developments since then.\n\n# Proceeding concerning the services provided by Havas Paris to Business France\n\nOn February 7, 2019, Havas Paris, a subsidiary of Havas SA, was indicted for having benefited from favoritism in an amount of 379,319 euros. This indictment took place as part of a judicial investigation opened by the Paris Prosecutor's Office into illegal favoritism alleged to have been practiced by Business France when it arranged for communications services to be provided by Havas Paris. Havas Paris denies the allegations and has filed an appeal against this decision. Havas Paris's Deputy Chief Executive Officer was indicted on December 21, 2023 for illegal favoritism. He denies the allegations and has filed an appeal against this decision. These indictments have no significant financial or pecuniary consequences for Havas Paris.\n\n# Investigation by the Swiss Competition Commission\n\nFollowing the rejection by referendum on March 11, 2012 of measures to introduce a single price for books in Switzerland, the Swiss Competition Commission (Comco) reopened an investigation into imports of Frenchlanguage books by distributors.\n\nFollowing this procedure, Comco made a final decision on May 27, 2013 under which Diffulivre (a subsidiary of Hachette Livre) was held liable for territorial exclusivity practices with the intention or effect of partitioning the Swiss French-language publishing market. Under this decision, the infringement concerned services provided to publishers of the Hachette group, services provided by Hachette, and Swiss third-party publishers.\n\nThis decision was upheld by the Swiss Administrative Court on October 30, 2019.\n\nOn January 13, 2020, Diffulivre filed an appeal with the Federal Court, which suspended the effects of the Administrative Court's ruling.\n\nIn a decision handed down on August 3, 2022, the Federal Court partially accepted Diffulivre's appeal, considering that only the agreements between Diffulivre and the Swiss publishers, as well as an agreement between Diffulivre and the publisher Harlequin, infringed Swiss competition law. It referred the case back to the Swiss Administrative Court, which will reduce the fine imposed by the Comco in 2013 accordingly.\n\n# Competition investigation in the school textbook market in Spain\n\nFollowing a complaint filed by a publisher, the Spanish Competition Authority (CNMC) carried out searches at the premises of the Anele (the school textbook publishers' trade association) and three publishers (including Anaya, a subsidiary of Hachette Livre), and subsequently launched a sanction procedure in October 2017.\n\nOn May 30, 2019, the CNMC issued its ruling which followed the recommendation of its investigating officers, and ordered Anaya and a number of its subsidiaries to pay total damages of approximately 8 million euros for:\n\n- discussions held between publishers with a view to promoting ethical behavior and ensuring buyers' independence – about providing for a special clause in an Anele Code of conduct that limits the bonuses and gifts offered by publishers to buyers' organizations when those organizations order textbooks, and;\n- discussions between publishers about the terms and conditions for selling digital versions of textbooks when negotiations are carried out with certain regions.\n\nAnaya has filed an appeal against this decision with the Spanish national court (Audiencia Nacional), which had the effect of suspending payment of the fine.\n\n# Class actions against Hachette Book Group\n\nIn 2021, class actions were filed in the United States against Amazon and certain print and e-book publishers, including Hachette Book Group (HBG). The plaintiffs allege that certain agreements between publishers and Amazon constitute price-fixing agreements that breach US antitrust laws. The defendants, including HBG, dispute these allegations, along with the admissibility of the class action. These motions to dismiss were granted by a decision dated September 29, 2022, with the judge considering that the appeals lacked sufficient evidence to succeed. However, as they were dismissed \"without prejudice\", the plaintiffs can amend and re-file their class actions.\n\nAmended appeals were accordingly filed on November 21, 2022, reiterating the arguments already put forward and attempting to resolve the problems identified in the September 29, 2022 ruling. The defendants, including HBG, have again filed motions to dismiss.\n\n# Monla/Lagardère Travel Retail & Chalhoub arbitration\n\nBetween end-2016 and early 2017, Lagardère Travel Retail (LTR), Monla Group SAL Holding (Monla) and Chalhoub Group Limited (Chalhoub) began talks regarding a potential joint response to a request for proposals for a duty free concession at Beirut airport.\n\nOn May 10, 2017, Monla had filed an arbitration claim against LTR and Chalhoub with the International Chamber of Commerce, asserting wrongful behavior in the conduct and suspension of their three-party discussions. Monla was seeking damages (plus miscellaneous expenses) from the respondents for the alleged harm caused, in particular to its image, and for loss of opportunity. The decision handed down by the arbitration tribunal at the end of December 2019 dismissed all of Monla's claims and ordered it to repay the costs incurred by LTR and Chalhoub in the arbitration. LTR has initiated proceedings to enforce the decision, which Monla is trying to resist. Monla may submit an action for annulment of the decision, subject to the applicable legal deadlines.\n\n{259}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Class action against The Paradies Shops\n\nThe Paradies Shops was the victim of a cyberattack on the company's computer servers in October 2020, which resulted in a breach of the personal data of tens of thousands of employees and customers. The parties concerned were informed and were offered credit monitoring services. One of the individuals involved initiated a class action filed in the United States in July 2021. The Paradies Shops filed a motion to dismiss the class action, which was granted by the judge in August 2022. The plaintiff has appealed this decision.\n\n# Disputes with photographers\n\nDisputes are ongoing with freelance photographers or employees who have contributed to magazines published by the Lagardère group. Most of these disputes concern returns of analogue photographic archives and retaining photographs, as well as the resulting operating losses. The proceedings are still ongoing and are progressing in a manner generally favorable to the Group.\n\nIn 2022, a final appeal decision in favor of the Lagardère group marked the end of one of these proceedings, in which very high claims for compensation were made against the Lagardère group.\n\n# WSG India and WSG Mauritius/Indian Premier League contracts\n\nIn 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (\"BCCI\") launched a call for tenders for the worldwide rights to its new cricket competition, the Indian Premier League (IPL), until 2017. WSG India, which became a subsidiary of Lagardère Sports and Entertainment in May 2008, was awarded most of these rights in early 2008, with the remainder awarded to an unrelated operator, MSM.\n\nA global reorganization of the distribution of these rights took place in March 2009 at the initiative of the BCCI. As part of the negotiations, the BCCI granted WSG India the IPL rights worldwide, excluding the Indian subcontinent, for the period from 2009 to 2017.\n\nIn June 2010, the BCCI terminated the 2009/2017 contract to market IPL rights worldwide, excluding the Indian subcontinent. WSG India immediately brought proceedings to protect its rights.\n\nIn spring 2011, the Indian Supreme Court took a series of interim measures that, without calling into question the marketing already carried out by WSG India and without prejudice to the merits of the case, temporarily granted the BCCI, under the supervision of the Court and pending the final ruling, media rights to the IPL outside the Indian subcontinent that are not already marketed by WSG India, as well as recovery of the amounts owed by the broadcasters and held in escrow. An arbitration award was handed down on July 13, 2020 in respect of the proceedings on the merits of the case, dismissing WSG India's compensation claim. Based on this award, the BCCI recovered the amounts held in escrow. WSG India has filed an appeal for annulment of the award on the grounds that it has no legal basis, and has applied to the competent Indian courts to have the sums concerned taken back into escrow. On March 16, 2022, the Bombay High Court issued a ruling granting WSG India's application to set aside the arbitration award handed down on July 13, 2020. The BCCI has appealed against this judgment.\n\nOn October 13, 2010, the BCCI filed a criminal complaint with the Chennai police authorities in India against seven individuals, including the former President of the IPL and four managers of WSG India, alleging breaches of the Indian criminal code in connection with the award to WSG India in March 2009 of certain IPL media rights for the 2009-2017 seasons. An investigation has been ongoing since 2010.\n\nFollowing the Indian tax authorities' audit of WSG India's operations, the company was issued with tax reassessment notices representing an overall liability of around 13.1 million euros as at December 31, 2022. WSG India has paid a deposit for part of the amount and launched an appeal.\n\nLastly, as part of an investigation by the Indian authorities into money laundering allegations concerning the former managers of the BCCI and its commercial partners in the IPL, on May 24, 2016 WSG Mauritius received a notification from Mauritius' Attorney General requesting it to provide certain documents. The hearings before the Attorney General took place in July 2016. WSG India's managers have since received requests for information and documentation, to which WSG India has responded. WSG India and WSG Mauritius are subsidiaries of Lagardère Participation. They are not part of the scope sold to HIG Capital.\n\n# Delta TV vs. Dailymotion\n\nOn March 1, 2022, Dailymotion received an order to pay from Delta TV claiming the sum of 2,065,000 euros in penalties regarding 59 videos which Delta TV claims had been notified in a previous dispute and uploaded again to Dailymotion's platform, in violation of an order of June 3, 2015 which applied the penalty. Dailymotion contested this order to pay in a summons dated March 21, 2022.\n\n# VSD and Georges Ghosn vs. Prisma Media, Rolf Heinz, Gruner+Jahr Communication and Bertelsmann\n\nOn September 12, 2022, VSD and Georges Ghosn, who acquired *VSD* from Prisma Media in 2018, summoned Prisma Media, Rolf Heinz, Gruner+Jahr and Bertelsmann before the Commercial Court of Paris. In particular, they are accused of breaches of their pre-contractual obligation of good faith and information during the negotiations and the purchase of *VSD* and more specifically of providing incorrect accounting estimates, concealing the extent of the losses on the date of the sale and knowingly concealing the number of journalists likely to implement their transfer clause.\n\n# See Tickets class action\n\nIn April 2021, Vivendi Ticketing US LLC (exercising its business as See Tickets US, hereinafter \"See Tickets\") was alerted of activity showing that a third party was able to obtain unauthorized access to certain pages of its website dedicated to the payment of event tickets.\n\nSee Tickets immediately initiated investigations, with the assistance of an expert, and took steps to end this unauthorized access. See Tickets definitively removed the malicious software from its platform in January 2022 and implemented a series of measures to improve its security.\n\nStarting in October 21, 2022, See Tickets notified all persons whose data have been impacted by e-mail. On the same day, it also notified the regulators of the US states concerned.\n\nOn October 28, 2022, a class action lawsuit was filed against See Tickets before the United States District Court for the Central District of California, in which the plaintiffs alleged that See Tickets had failed to adopt adequate security measures to protect the information of users of its ticketing platform, including credit card details, resulting in this security incident. See Tickets was also accused of having delayed notifying the individuals whose data have been impacted and the regulators. The parties submitted the case to mediation on January 12, 2023, which led to a settlement agreement that was preliminarily approved by the Court at the end of May 2023. On October 31, 2023, the Court issued its final approval of the settlement agreement, effectively ending the proceedings.\n\nSee Tickets experienced another information security incident that affected the personal data of individuals who had made purchases on the www.seetickets.com website between February 28, 2023 and July 2, 2023. See Tickets notified the potentially impacted customers and applicable state regulators of this incident on September 5, 2023. At the same time, See Tickets implemented appropriate measures to further protect the security of payment card information provided on its website. Since September 11, 2023, five class actions have been filed in the State of California and these were consolidated by the Court on October 3, 2023. On December 11, 2023, See Tickets was served with a joint complaint, consolidating the claims of these five class actions. A settlement mediation has been scheduled for March 11, 2024.\n\n{260}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Vivendi's tax disputes\n\nRegarding the tax inspections for 2008 to 2012, Vivendi SE was the subject of an assessment with the tax authorities challenging the accounting and tax treatment for the NBC Universal securities received in consideration upon the 2004 disposal of the securities of Vivendi Universal Entertainment and challenging the deduction of the 2.4 billion euros loss on the disposal of these securities. The French National Board for Direct Taxation to which this dispute was referred gave its opinion on December 9, 2016, in which it called for the assessments proposed by the tax authorities to be dropped. The dispute moreover being based on administrative principles, Vivendi asked for its cancellation on the grounds that it was creating new law. On May 29, 2017, the French Council of State favorably received Vivendi's appeal for misuse of authority. By letter dated April 1, 2019 and after various appeals, the tax authorities confirmed the order. On June 18, 2019, Vivendi therefore initiated litigation before the department responsible for the taxation. As no reply was received from the tax authorities, on December 30, 2019, Vivendi filed a complaint before the Administrative Court of Montreuil. On December 2, 2021, the Administrative Court of Montreuil dismissed Vivendi's complaint. On February 9, 2022, Vivendi filed a motion to appeal before the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal. This Court handed down its ruling, which was unfavorable for Vivendi, on December 13, 2023. In February 2024, Vivendi filed a motion before the Council of State to set aside this decision.\n\nRegarding the tax audit for fiscal years 2013 to 2017 in respect of the group's consolidated earnings, on June 14, 2021, Vivendi SE received an adjustment proposal. As at December 31, 2023, these proceedings were still ongoing, pending a response following the referral to the Legal Security and Tax Audit Department of the Directorate General for Public Finances (DGFiP) on March 15, 2022.\n\nRegarding the tax audit of Vivendi SE's individual earnings for fiscal years 2013 to 2016, on June 4, 2020, the tax authorities proposed a set of adjustments for 33 million euros (base) for these four fiscal years. This proposal will lead to a correction of Vivendi's tax losses carried forward and will not result in any current tax liabilities as any tax claimed will be paid by way of foreign tax receivables. By way of reminder, the decision of the Council of State of December 19, 2019 allows Vivendi to seek a refund of any additional corporate tax payment already made for the 2012-2016 period. Following a response from Vivendi on July 21, 2020, the authorities confirmed their position on September 14, 2020. Vivendi does not fully agree with the position taken by the tax auditing authorities, but does not intend, given the issues at stake, to challenge them.\n\nRegarding the tax audit of Vivendi SE for fiscal years 2018 to 2021, an adjustment proposal was received on December 15, 2023, which does not have any significant financial consequences. Vivendi sent a response to this proposal on February 13, 2024 and the proceedings are ongoing.\n\nWith regard to the dispute concerning the right to defer foreign tax receivables upon the exit from the consolidated global profit tax system without any time limitation, the Montreuil Administrative Court issued a first judgment against Vivendi on December 21, 2023 for fiscal year 2017 and a second judgment against Vivendi on February 15, 2024 for fiscal year 2018. Vivendi filed a joint appeal against these two judgments, in the same terms, before the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal in submissions filed on February 21, 2024. For the 2018 and 2019 financial years, the proceedings are still pending before the Montreuil Administrative Court.\n\nIn relation to Canal +, in proposed adjustments dated June 4 and June 7, 2021, the French tax authorities challenged Canal +'s right to break down, by type of service and by VAT rate, its revenue from composite offers comprising services that, if they were marketed separately, would be subject to different VAT rates. The tax authorities did not, however, take any account of scenarios in which, as a result of using this breakdown method, Canal + increased the amount of VAT it paid to the Treasury. They also failed to take\n\ninto account the deductibility of VAT from the corporate tax base for which they expected payment for the years 2016 to 2019. The tax authorities also intend to impose penalties for deliberate non-compliance, even if Canal+ is able to demonstrate that its practices are based on formal positions taken by the tax authorities, both in the context of either direct responses that may have been given to it or previous tax audits or litigation initiated by the audited companies. In a letter dated August 3, 2021, Canal+ formally disputed these assessments. In letters dated March 29 and April 20, 2022, the tax assessments notified to Canal+ were confirmed. Following a hierarchical appeal on June 28 and 29, 2022, the reminders were again confirmed. Canal+ therefore requested that the departmental contact become involved in a final appeal against the assessments that were the subject of a dispute between it and the tax auditing authorities. In a letter dated December 8, 2022, the departmental contact asked the central departments of the Directorate General of Public Finance to intervene, in view of the impact of the assessment proposals. The tax audit in respect of fiscal years 2016 to 2019 is ongoing. No tax has yet been collected under the assessment. With regard to 2020 and 2021, an audit was begun in 2023. As part of these audits, the tax authorities consider that Canal+ does not market television services and therefore refuse to apply the 10% VAT rate for these services and propose to apply the standard rate of 20% to all of Canal+'s revenues. Vivendi Management believes that it has solid legal grounds to defend its positions on the VAT liabilities of its subsidiaries. Vivendi's Management therefore considers that the outcome of the ongoing tax audits is unlikely to have a material impact on the group's financial position or liquidity.\n\nFinally, with respect to Havas, Havas SA brought an action seeking the repayment of the withholding tax paid by the company between 2000 and 2002 on the redistribution of dividends from European subsidiaries. Following a decision by the Administrative Court and later by the Court of Appeal, on July 28, 2017, the Council of State rejected an appeal by Havas against the decision of the Versailles Court of Appeal. This decision permanently ends this tax dispute and means that Havas won't be refunded the withholding tax. However, to restore Havas' right to compensation, three combined actions were taken: (i) a claim before the European Commission, (ii) an application for referral to the European Court of Human Rights and (iii) a claim for compensation under an action for damages against the French state. In a decision dated May 19, 2022, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the application was inadmissible. In an application filed on May 29, 2018 at the Cergy-Pontoise Administrative Court, Havas sought compensation for the loss it had suffered as a result of the decision not to admit its appeal to the Cour de Cassation (French Supreme Court). This is Havas's only pending dispute concerning the withholding tax. The loss for which it is seeking compensation is 59 million euros (amount of the withholding tax paid plus late-payment interest that it should have received). On March 28, 2023, the Court dismissed Havas' claims. On May 26, 2023, Havas filed an application before the Versailles Administrative Court of Appeal to set aside the judgment of the Administrative Court and order the State to pay it compensation for the loss suffered.\n\nLastly, when GVT was sold to Telefónica Brasil in May 2015, Vivendi realized a capital gain that was subject to withholding tax in Brazil. On March 2, 2020, the Brazilian tax authorities challenged the methods used to calculate this capital gain and ordered Vivendi to pay 1.2 billion Brazilian reals (approximately 226 million euros) in taxes, late-payment interest and penalties. This additional tax assessment and the refusal to take into account the reduction of the capital gain resulting from price adjustments were unsuccessfully challenged before the administrative authorities. Vivendi has brought an appeal in order to assert its rights, and believes it has a strong chance of success. Accordingly, no provision has been recorded in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 in respect of this assessment.\n\n{261}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-261-1\"></span><span id=\"page-261-0\"></span>**NOTE 12.

PENSION BENEFITS AND RELATED OBLIGATIONS**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\n# **• Post-employment benefits**\n\nPost-employment benefits include end-of-service payments, retirement schemes, as well as life insurance and healthcare benefits granted to the retirees of certain subsidiaries (primarily in the US).\n\nCommitments relating to post-employment benefits mainly concern subsidiaries in the euro zone and the United Kingdom. In the case of Vivendi, virtually all group employees enjoy retirement benefits under employee defined contribution plans, which are incorporated into local social security schemes and multi-employer schemes, or defined benefit plans, which are typically managed under group pension plans. The Group's plan financing policy is in line with applicable public regulations and obligations.\n\n# **• Other long-term benefits**\n\nOther long-term benefits are entered in the balance sheet as provisions. These include commitments relating to incentives associated with length of service and to mutual insurance.\n\nThis provision is valued according to the projected unit credit method.\n\nExpenses related to these commitments are recognized in the operating income, with the exception of interest expenses net of the expected return on assets, which is recognized in financial income.\n\n# 12.2.1. Types of plans\n\n# **• Employee defined benefit plans**\n\nIn line with the revised IAS 19 \"Employee benefits\", the Group's commitments under employee defined benefit plans, and likewise their cost, are valued by actuaries in accordance with the projected unit credit method. Valuations are carried out each year for the various plans.\n\nThese plans are either \"funded\", in which case their assets are managed separately from and independently of the Group's, or \"not funded\", in which case the commitment appears as a liability on the balance sheet. In the case of funded plans, they may be funded by investments in different instruments, such as insurance policies or equity securities and bonds, excluding Group debt instruments or shares.\n\nFor funded employee defined benefit plans, the shortfall or surplus of the assets' fair value compared to the discounted value of the obligations is recognized as a balance sheet liability or asset. If plan assets exceed recognized obligations, a financial asset is generated up to the present value of expected future refunds and reductions in future contributions. If such a surplus is not available or does not represent any future financial benefit, it is not recognized.\n\nCommitments associated with employee benefits are valued using assumptions as to future wages, age when rights are claimed, mortality rate and rate of inflation, and then discounted using the interest rate of firstclass long-term private bonds. The discount rate is thus determined for each country, by reference to the return on AA-rated corporate bonds with an equivalent maturity to the duration of the plans valued, generally based on representative indices. The benchmark rates used for primary plans are iBoxx AA Corporate and Merrill Lynch AA Corporate on the valuation date of the plans maturing in a time frame comparable to the average horizon of the particular plan in question. The benchmark rates used for these primary plans were not changed during the fiscal year.\n\nA cost for past services is generated when the company institutes an employee defined benefit plan or changes benefit levels in an existing plan, and the cost for past services is immediately recognized as an expense.\n\nThe actuarial cost recorded in operating income for employee defined benefit plans includes the cost of services provided during the fiscal year, the cost of past services, and the effects of any reductions or liquidation of the plan.\n\nThe financial component, recognized in other financial income and expenses, is comprised of the accretion effect of commitments, net of the expected return on plan assets using the discount rate used to measure commitments.\n\nActuarial differences arise mainly from changes in assumptions and from the difference between the results using the actuarial assumptions and the actual outcome of the employee defined benefit plans. Actuarial differences are recognized in full on the balance sheet, with an offsetting entry in equity except for other long-term benefits for which the effects of the changes are recognized in profit and loss.\n\n# **• Employee defined contribution plans**\n\nCertain benefits are also provided under employee defined contribution plans. The contributions for these plans are entered as personnel costs when they are incurred.\n\n# 12.2.2. The Group's employee defined benefit plans\n\nThe Group has employee defined benefit plans, in particular in the United Kingdom.\n\nThese plans are managed and monitored by trustees. In accordance with current legislation, the trustees implement an investment strategy to ensure the best long-term returns on investment with a level of risk that is appropriate to the nature and length of the agreements. The manager is in charge of the daily management of assets in accordance with the defined strategy.\n\nThe plans are analyzed on a regular basis by an independent actuary.\n\n{262}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Assets and liabilities included on the balance sheet**\n\n|                                                                | At

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nThe valuation and accounting arrangements for share subscription or share purchase plans relating to shares in the parent company and its subsidiaries are set out in IFRS 2 \"Share-based payment\".\n\nThe granting of shares and stock options is a benefit for their beneficiaries and as such counts as supplementary compensation. These benefits are recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis in the vesting period against an increase in equity for plans that can be repaid in the form of shares and as debts to staff for plans that can be repaid in cash.\n\nThey are valued at the time of their granting based on the fair value of the equity instruments granted.\n\n# 12.3.1. Bolloré SE free share allocation plan\n\nThe Bolloré Group granted free Bolloré SE shares to Group employees. These transactions were completed in accordance with the conditions set:\n\n- by Bolloré SE's General Shareholders' Meeting of May 29, 2019 for the plans approved at the Board of Directors' meetings of March 12, 2020, March 4, 2021, and March 10, 2022;\n- by Bolloré SE's General Shareholders' Meeting of May 25, 2022 for the plans approved at the Board of Directors' meetings of May 25, 2022, March 14, 2023, and July 28, 2023.\n\nThe Group applied IFRS 2 \"Share-based payment\" to this free share allocation plan. On the grant dates of March 12, 2020, March 4, 2021, March 10, 2022, May 25, 2022, March 14, 2023, and July 28, 2023, the fair value of the shares granted was calculated by an independent expert, this value equaling the expense to be recognized for the period corresponding to the vesting period of the shares.\n\n{265}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe fair value of the shares is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. This amount is included in the income statement under \"Personnel costs\" with an offsetting entry in equity. The employer's contributions due under these plans were immediately recognized as expenses. In 2023, the expense relating to all Bolloré SE share allocation plans was 5.3 million euros, compared with 4.5 million euros in 2022 (excluding the\n\nTransportation and Logistics business, classified as discontinued operations and assets held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5).\n\nBolloré SE plans 2020 2021 2022-03 2022-05 **2023-03 2023-07 Allocation conditions** Grant date March 12, 2020 March 4, 2021 March 10, 2022 May 25, 2022 March 14, 2023 July 28, 2023 Number of shares originally granted 765,000 2,563,500 606,000 3,652,500 631,000 80,000 Share price on grant date (in euros) 2.50 4.060 4.40 4.90 5.07 5.95 Vesting period 36 months 36 months 36 months 36 months 36 months 36 months Lock-up period None at the end of the vesting period, i.e. March 12, 2023 None at the end of the vesting period, i.e. March 4, 2024 None at the end of the vesting period, i.e. March 10, 2025 None at the end of the vesting period, i.e. May 25, 2025 None at the end of the vesting period, i.e. March 14, 2026 None at the end of the vesting period, i.e. July 28, 2026 **Main assumptions** Dividend rate (as a percentage) 2.4 1.5 1.4 1.2 1.2 1.0 Risk-free rate (as a percentage) 0 to 2 years 0 to 2 years 0 to 2 years 0 to 2 years 2.89 to 2 years 3.23 to 2 years 0 to 5 years 0 to 5 years 0 to 5 years 0 to 5 years 2.74 to 5 years 2.87 to 5 years Fair value of the option (including lock-up discount) (in euros) 2.32 3.88 4.22 4.72 4.89 5.78 **AT DECEMBER 31, 2023** Number of remaining shares(1) 0 2,493,500 606,000 3,632,500 631,000 80,000 Expense recognized in profit and loss (in millions of euros) (0.1) (1.3) (0.9) (2.2) (0.8) (0.1)\n\n(1) The plan approved on March 12, 2020 matured on March 12, 2023 and gave rise to a capital increase of 765,000 shares. See note 10 – Equity and earnings per share.\n\n# 12.3.2. Plans granted by Vivendi\n\n# **• Vivendi performance share plans**\n\nOn March 8, 2023, Vivendi's Supervisory Board confirmed the final allocation of the 2020 performance share plan, for 100% of the initial award.\n\nOn March 8, 2023, Vivendi SE also awarded its employees and senior executives 1,915 thousand performance shares, including 247,500 to members of the Executive Committee. The terms and conditions of the grant are set out in the Vivendi 2023 financial report.\n\nOn July 28, 2022, Vivendi SE awarded employees and senior executives 1,900 thousand performance shares, including 247,500 to members of the Executive Committee.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, there remained 4,667 thousands performance shares. The average remaining time before delivery of performance shares is 2.0 years. 897 thousand shares were vested as at December 31, 2023, including cancellations over the year of 97 thousand share following the departure of certain beneficiaries as well as a positive adjustment by a decision of Vivendi's Management Board on November 13, 2023 to vest 57 thousand performance shares. The conditions of this adjustment, which has no impact on the calculation of the accounting expense related to the performance shares in question, are described in detail in Vivendi's 2023 financial report.\n\nIn 2023, the expense related to all the performance share plans awarded by Vivendi SE was 11 million euros, compared to 12 million euros in 2022.\n\n# **• Group savings plan and Vivendi leveraged plan**\n\nOn July 20, 2023, Vivendi SE carried out an employee shareholding transaction through the sale of treasury shares restricted to employees of the French subsidiaries who were members of the group savings plan and corporate officers of the Vivendi group. The shares were previously repurchased by Vivendi SE under the authorizations granted by Vivendi's General Shareholders' Meeting on April 24, 2023.\n\nBy way of reminder, on July 26, 2022, Vivendi SE had carried out an employee shareholding transaction through the sale of treasury shares under a group savings plan and a leveraged plan restricted to the group's employees, retirees and corporate officers. The shares had previously been repurchased by Vivendi SE under the authorizations granted by Vivendi's General Shareholders' Meetings on April 20, 2020 and April 15, 2019.\n\nThe valuation assumptions for the 2023 plan can be found in Vivendi's 2023 financial report.\n\nAs part of the group savings plan, 1,597 thousand shares were acquired in 2023 through an employee investment fund at a price of 8.171 euros per share, compared with 1,394 thousand shares acquired in 2022 at 9.298 euros per share. In 2023, no expense was recognized in respect of the group savings plan, compared with 0.3 million euros in 2022 (excluding Editis, which was classified as an asset held for sale under IFRS 5).\n\nUnder the leveraged plan, 7,000 thousand shares had been acquired in 2022 through a company mutual fund at a price of 9.298 euros per share. The leveraged plan entitled employees, retirees, corporate officers, directors and members of the Supervisory Board who are beneficiaries of Vivendi SE and its French and foreign subsidiaries, to acquire Vivendi shares at a discounted price and to ultimately receive capital gains (calculated pursuant to the terms and conditions of the plan) attached to 10 shares for each share acquired. This transaction had been underwritten by a financial institution commissioned by Vivendi. In 2022, the expense recognized for the leveraged plan was 1.2 million euros (excluding Editis, which was classified as an asset held for sale under IFRS 5).\n\n# 12.3.3. Dailymotion's long-term incentive plan\n\nSome senior executives of Dailymotion benefit from a long-term incentive plan, covering a period up to June 30, 2026, indexed to the increase in the value of Dailymotion at the time of disposal of at least 10% of the company's capital or on the basis of an independent expert valuation carried out at the plan's maturity compared to its acquisition price at June 30, 2015. Should the value of Dailymotion increase, the amount of compensation under the incentive plan is capped at a percentage of this increase, depending on the beneficiaries. Pursuant to IFRS 2, an expense must be estimated for the cost of this compensation and recognized at each closing date up to the date of payment.\n\n{266}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 12.3.4.

TAXES**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nThe Group calculates its corporate income tax in accordance with the tax law in force at the time.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 12 \"Income taxes\", the timing differences between the book values of assets and liabilities and their tax-base values give rise to recognition of a deferred tax asset or liability, according to the variable carryforward method using the tax rate adopted or virtually adopted on the closing date.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized for all timing differences unless the deferred tax is generated by goodwill or by the initial recognition of an asset or liability which is not a business combination and does not affect either accounting or fiscal income on the transaction date.\n\nA deferred tax is recognized for all fiscal timing differences connected with shareholdings in subsidiaries, associate companies and joint ventures or capital expenditure in branches, unless the date on which the timing difference is to be reversed is within the Group's control and it is probable that it will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognized for the carryforward of tax losses and of unused tax credits insofar as it is probable that there will in the future be sufficient taxable income to which these tax losses and unused tax credits can be applied or if there are liability timing differences.\n\nThe book value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each fiscal year and, where necessary, revalued or reduced, to reflect changes in the likelihood of generating taxable profits resulting in these deferred tax assets being used. To assess the likelihood of generating an available taxable profit, the track record of results over past fiscal years is taken into account along with forecasts for future results, non-recurring items that are unlikely to reoccur in the future and the tax strategy. As a result, the evaluation of the Group's ability to use its tax loss carryforwards relies largely on judgment. If the Group's future tax results were to vary materially from what was anticipated, the Group would then be required to revise the book value of the deferred tax assets up or down, which could have a material effect on the Group's balance sheet and results.\n\nIn line with IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\n\n{267}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-267-0\"></span>**13.1.

Vivendi tax consolidation and consolidated global profit system\n\nVivendi SE benefits from the tax consolidation system and, up until December 31, 2011 inclusive, it benefited from the \"Consolidated global profit\" system pursuant to article 209 quinquies of the French general tax code *(Code général des impôts).* As from January 1, 2012, Vivendi SE has only benefited from the tax consolidation system.\n\n- The tax consolidation system allows Vivendi to fiscally consolidate the profits and losses of the French companies at least 95% directly or indirectly controlled, i.e., as at December 31, 2023, mainly entities belonging to Groupe Canal+, Havas, Prisma Media and Gameloft in France, as well as the companies involved in the Group's development projects in France (Vivendi Village, Dailymotion, etc.).\n- Up to December 31, 2011, the approved consolidated global profit system allowed Vivendi to fiscally consolidate its profits and losses with those of Group companies at least 50% directly or indirectly controlled, both in France and abroad. It initially received approval for a five-year period, namely from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2008, which was renewed on May 19, 2008 for a three-year period, namely from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2011. For reference, on July 6, 2011, Vivendi filed a further application with the French Ministry of Finance to renew its authorization to use the consolidated global profit tax system for a three-year period from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014.\n- Changes in French tax law in 2011 ended the consolidated global profit tax system for companies ending their fiscal years starting September 6, 2011 and capped the use of tax loss carryforwards at 60% of taxable profit. Since 2012, the allocation of tax losses carried forward has been capped at 50% of taxable profit.\n\nThe French tax consolidation and consolidated global profit systems have the following impact on the valuation of Vivendi's tax attributes (tax losses, foreign tax receivables and carryforwards):\n\n• as Vivendi considers that its entitlement to use the consolidated global profit system was effective until the end of the authorization granted by the French Ministry of Finance (i.e. until December 31, 2011), in 2012, Vivendi submitted a 366 million-euro refund request with respect to the 2011 fiscal year. At the end of the proceedings conducted before the administrative bodies, the French Council of State, by its decision of October 25, 2017, recognized Vivendi's right to make a claim of reasonable confidence authorizing it to apply the consolidated profit system over the entire period covered by the authorization, therefore including the period ended December 31, 2011;\n\n{268}------------------------------------------------\n\n- as Vivendi considered that the foreign tax receivables held by it upon exiting the consolidated global profit tax system can be carried forward until expiry of the authorization, Vivendi asked for repayment of the tax paid for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012. At the end of the proceedings before the administrative courts, the Council of State, in its decision of December 19, 2019, recognized Vivendi's right to use foreign tax receivables on exiting the consolidated global profit system. In addition, in light of the decision of the Regional Court in its litigation relating to the year 2012, Vivendi requested a refund of tax due for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. The decision of the French Council of State of December 19, 2019 led the tax authorities to issue a refund of the tax paid by Vivendi for 2012 and to automatically reduce the tax paid by Vivendi for 2015;\n- having won its case before the Council of State, which recognized (i) Vivendi's right to apply the consolidation system until the end of the authorization it held (Council decision of October 25, 2017 no. 403320 for the 2011 fiscal year) and (ii) Vivendi's right to use foreign tax receivables upon exiting the system in accordance with the provisions of article 122a of the French general tax code *(Code général des impôts),* i.e. over five years (Council decision of December 19, 2019 no. 426730 for the 2012 fiscal year), Vivendi sued in relation to the enforceability of the rule capping deferral at five years. The purpose of this dispute is to restore Vivendi's right to use the tax receivables still available on exiting the consolidated global profit system, representing 793 million euros. Vivendi also filed a complaint with the tax authorities demanding reimbursement of the tax paid for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, for 46 million euros. The outstanding tax receivables carried forward as at December 31, 2023 were 747 million euros. The proceedings are continuing before the administrative courts and Vivendi will, in 2024, submit a claim to request that its available foreign tax credits be set against the tax paid in 2021;\n- as a reminder, after taking into account the consequences of ongoing tax audits over the amount of losses accepted by the tax authorities, Vivendi SE carried forward 201 million euros in losses at January 1, 2021, fully recognized in the calculation of corporate income tax for the 2021 fiscal year. Vivendi SE therefore did not carry forward any more losses as at December 31, 2021. Given the reported taxable income for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, Vivendi carried forward a loss estimated at 119 million euros as at December 31, 2023. The amount of this loss does not include the amount of the losses that could be reinstated in favor of Vivendi SE under the ongoing NBC Universal litigation, in which Vivendi SE is requesting the reinstatement of 2.4 billion euros of losses;\n- at its meetings held on December 13, 2023 and January 30, 2024, Vivendi's Supervisory Board authorized the Management Board to review the possibility of splitting Vivendi into several entities, each of which would be listed on the stock market, and structured around Groupe Canal+, Havas, a company combining publishing and distribution assets through the majority stake in the Lagardère group and the 100% stake in Prisma Media, and an investment company holding listed and unlisted financial interests in the culture, media and entertainment sectors. In this context, given the uncertainty weighing on Vivendi SE's tax consolidation group, no deferred tax asset was recognized as at December 31, 2023 in respect of the amount of losses carried forward by Vivendi SE.\n\n# 13.1.4. Tax liabilities relating to discontinued operations and assets held for sale\n\nBolloré Logistics and its subsidiaries generated taxes totaling –86.7 million euros in 2023 and (for comparison) –108.5 million euros in 2022.\n\nIn addition, the activities of Bolloré Africa Logistics and its subsidiaries and Editis generated taxes in 2022 of –89 million euros and –16 million euros, respectively.\n\nThe tax effects discontinued operations or assets held for sale generated an impact of 17.3 million euros in 2023 (see note 1 – Highlights) and –105.8 million euros in 2022 (disposal of BAL).\n\n# <span id=\"page-268-0\"></span>**13.2.

As at December 31, 2023, goodwill is recorded in the balance sheet for a<br>net book value of 9,762 million euros compared to total assets of<br>59,981 million euros.

We familiarized ourselves with<br>the key assumptions adopted for all of the CGUs or groups of CGUs and,<br>according to the case:<br>• reconciled the business forecasts underlying the determination of the<br>cash flows with the information available, including market outlooks<br>and past achievements, and with Management's latest estimates<br>(assumptions, budgets, strategic plans, where applicable);<br>• compared the infinite growth rates used for the forecast cash flows with<br>the market analyses and the consensus of the principal professionals<br>concerned;<br>• compared the discount rates used with our internal databases, by<br>including financial evaluation specialists in our teams;<br>• examined the selection of companies from among transaction or stock<br>market

consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\n# **NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT**\n\nWe attest that the consolidated non-financial performance statement provided for in article L. 225-102-1 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)* is included in the disclosures relating to the Group presented in the management report, it being specified that, in accordance with article L. 823-10 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* we have not verified the fairness of the information contained in this statement or its consistency with the consolidated financial statements that must be verified in a report by an independent third party.\n\n# **REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS**\n\n# **PRESENTATION FORMAT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT**\n\nIn accordance with the professional practice standard on the due diligence of Statutory Auditors in relation to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with the single European electronic information format, we have also verified compliance with this format defined by European delegated regulation no. 2019/815 of December 17, 2018 in the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended for inclusion in the annual financial report referred to in I of article L. 451-1-2 of the French monetary and financial code *(Code monétaire et financier),* which have been drawn up under the responsibility of the Chairman and Chief Excecutive Officer.

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in article L. 821-55 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the company or the quality of management of the affairs of the company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,\n\n# **REPORT TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE**\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as significant audit findings. We also bring to its attention any significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration referred to in article 6 of regulation (EU) no. 537/2014, confirming our independence pursuant to the rules applicable in France as defined in particular by articles L. 821-27 to L. 821-34 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)* but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n\n- evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management in the consolidated financial statements;\n- assesses the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the Statutory Auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities included in the consolidation scope to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The Statutory Auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements as well as for the audit opinion.\n\nand in the French code of ethics for statutory auditors. *(Code de déontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes).* Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Chamalières, April 22, 2024\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\n| AEG Finances                 | Wolff et Associés |\n|------------------------------|-------------------|\n| French Member of             |                   |\n| Grant Thornton International |                   |\n| Samuel Clochard              | Patrick Wolff     |\n\n{281}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-281-1\"></span><span id=\"page-281-0\"></span>**6.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n# **6.1.4.1. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE FISCAL YEAR**\n\nThere were no significant events during the year.\n\n# **6.1.4.2. ACCOUNTING METHODS AND PRINCIPLES**\n\nThe annual financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles, standards and methods taken from the 2014 French General Chart of Accounts, in compliance with ANC regulation no. 2014-03 and all subsequent amending regulations as well as the further opinions and recommendations of the French national accounting council (Conseil national de la comptabilité) and the French Accounting Regulatory Committee.\n\nGeneral accounting standards were applied in line with the prudential principle, according to the following basic assumptions:\n\n# **INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**\n\nNon-current assets are valued at cost of acquisition, the value at which they were contributed, or at the cost of production.\n\nAmortization and depreciation for impairment are calculated on a straightline basis in accordance with the expected useful life of the assets.\n\nThe principal useful lifetimes applied for the acquisition of new assets are as follows:\n\n# **NON-CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS**\n\nEquity investments are recorded at their historical acquisition cost or their transfer value. The acquisition costs for the equity investments are recorded when incurred. At the end of the fiscal year, an impairment is booked when the net asset value is lower than the balance sheet value. The net asset value • going concern;\n\n- consistency of accounting methods from one fiscal year to another;\n- independence of the fiscal years.\n\nAdditionally, they were prepared in accordance with the general rules regarding the preparation and presentation of annual financial statements. The basic method used for the valuation of accounting entries is the historical cost method.\n\n| Software and licenses               | 3 to 5 years   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Buildings                           | 15 to 20 years |\n| Fixtures and fittings               | 10 to 20 years |\n| Other property, plant and equipment | 3 to 10 years  |\n\nis calculated according to the revalued net book value, profitability, future prospects and the value in use of the shareholding.\n\nThe technical loss from merger, if any, is included in the net book value of the underlying assets during impairment tests.\n\n# **TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES**\n\nReceivables are valued at nominal value. A provision for impairment is made when the net asset value is lower than the book value.\n\n# **BOND ISSUE COSTS**\n\nBond issue costs are recognized under deferred expenses and are amortized over the life of the bond. In the event of repayment of the loan, the amount of these costs is recognized as an expense.\n\n# **SEVERANCE PAY AND PENSIONS**\n\nLegal or conventional severance pay and supplementary pensions for personnel in service are entered under off-balance sheet commitments, in accordance with the option provided by article L. 123-13 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)*.\n\nFor the valuation of its retirement commitments, Compagnie de l'Odet applies method 2 of ANC recommendation no. 2013-02.\n\nThe amount of the commitment is valued using the PUC (Projected Unit Credit) method based on the following assumptions:\n\n• gross discount rate: 4%;\n\n- inflation rate: 2%;\n- nominal salary increase: 2.70%.\n\nThere are no specific commitments towards the governing bodies or executive management.\n\n{287}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **6.1.5.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained provides an appropriate, sufficient basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are set out in the section entitled \"Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors with respect to the auditing of annual financial statements\" of this report.\n\n# **INDEPENDENCE**\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence requirements of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)* and the French code of ethics for statutory auditors *(Code de déontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes)* for the period from January 1, 2023 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non audit services referred to in article 5(1) of regulation (EU) no. 537/2014.\n\n# **JUSTIFICATION OF OUR ASSESSMENTS – KEY AUDIT MATTERS**\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of articles L. 821-53 and R. 821-180 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)* relating to the justification of our assessments, we would like to inform you of the key audit matters relating to the risks of material misstatement which, according to our professional judgement, were the most important for the audit of the annual financial statements for the year, as well as the responses we have given in relation to these risks.\n\nSuch assessments are thus part of our audit of the annual financial statements considered as a whole, approved in the context described above, and of the formation of our opinion expressed above. We express no opinion on items in these annual financial statements considered individually.\n\n# **VALUATION OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND FINANCIAL ASSETS**\n\n*(note 2 to the annual financial statements)*\n\n| Key audit matter

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the annual financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement. \"Reasonable assurance\" means a high level of assurance, but does not entail a guarantee that an audit performed in accordance with professional standards will systematically detect any material misstatement. Misstatements may result from fraud or error and are considered material where it can reasonably be expected that, considered individually or cumulatively, they may influence the business decisions made by users of these financial statements, based on the latter.\n\nAs stated in article L. 821-55 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* our assignment to certify the accounts does not consist of guaranteeing the viability or the quality of the management of the company. Statutory Auditors exercise their professional judgement throughout audits conducted in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France. In addition, Statutory Auditors:\n\n• identify and assess the risks of the annual financial statements containing material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and define and implement audit procedures for such risks, and collect evidence they consider sufficient and appropriate on which to base their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than that of a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, falsification, voluntary omissions, misrepresentation or the circumventing of internal control;\n\n# **REPORT TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE**\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee, which outlines the scope of the audit work and the work programme implemented, as well as the findings of our work. We also inform, where appropriate, the significant internal control weaknesses that we have identified with respect to the procedures relating to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information.\n\nIncluded in the information disclosed in the report to the Audit Committee are the risks of material misstatements that we consider to have been the most significant for the audit of the financial statements for the year and which therefore constitute the key audit matter, which it is our responsibility to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in article 6 of regulation (EU) no. 537-2014 confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France as established in\n\n- become aware of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to define audit procedures that are appropriate to the circumstances, and not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control;\n- assess the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as the information concerning them provided in the annual financial statements;\n- assess how appropriately management applies the going concern accounting policy and, depending on the evidence gathered, whether there is significant uncertainty related to events or circumstances likely to affect the company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the evidence gathered up to the date of their report, taking into account that subsequent circumstances or events could affect business continuity. If they conclude that there is significant uncertainty, they direct the readers of the report to the information provided in the annual financial statements concerning such uncertainty or, if this information is not provided or is not relevant, they certify the financial statements with reservations, or refuse to certify them;\n- assess the overall presentation of the annual financial statements and evaluate whether the annual financial statements reflect their underlying transactions and events so as to give a true and fair view of them.\n\nparticular under articles L. 821-27 to L. 821-34 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)* and in the French code of ethics for statutory auditors *(Code de déontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes).* If necessary, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks to our independence and the safeguards applied.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Chamalières, April 22, 2024\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nAEG finances French member of Grant Thornton International Samuel Clochard Patrick Wolff\n\nPatrick Wolff\n\n{295}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-295-1\"></span><span id=\"page-295-0\"></span>**7.

Dividends**\n\n# **4.1. Distribution of dividends for the past three fiscal years**\n\nThe amount of the dividends per share distributed for the three previous fiscal years were as follows:\n\n| Fiscal year                        | 2022      | 2021      | 2020      |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Number of shares                   | 6,585,990 | 6,585,990 | 6,585,990 |\n| Dividends (in euros)               | 3.60(1)   | 3.60(1)   | 3(1)      |\n| Amount paid (in millions of euros) | 23.7      | 23.7      | 19.8      |\n\n(1) Since January 1, 2018, dividends received by natural persons that are tax domiciled in France are subject to a single flat-rate withholding tax (PFU or flat tax) of 30% at the time\n\nof payment, i.e. 12.8% for income tax and 17.2% for social contributions.\n\nIndividuals whose reference taxable income for the previous year was lower than a certain threshold (50,000 euros for single, widowed or divorced taxpayers, 75,000 euros for taxpayers who file jointly) may request an exemption from the withholding of the flat income tax (12.8%).\n\nThe request must be made, under the shareholders' responsibility, by November 30 at the latest of the year preceding the dividend payment.\n\nAt the time of their declaration, dividends may also optionally be subject to the progressive income tax scale, after the application of a 40% rebate. If applicable, this option gives rise to a regularization of the income tax paid in respect of the single flat tax.\n\n<span id=\"page-302-5\"></span>In all cases, dividends received must be declared the year following their payment and may give rise, if applicable, to additional income tax in respect of the exceptional contribution on high revenues.\n\n# **4.2.

Dividend registration**\n\nThe legal time limit on unclaimed dividend entitlements is five years from the date of payment. Dividends left unclaimed after this five-year period will be paid to the French State.\n\n{303}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-303-0\"></span>**5.

SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE BYLAWS, THE CHARTER AND THE INTERNAL RULES OF PROCEDURE CONCERNING THE MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND MANAGEMENT BODIES**\n\nThe provisions related to the administrative and management bodies appear in chapter III of the bylaws.\n\nThe Board of Directors is made up of three to eighteen members, subject to the exemption provided by law in the event of a merger.\n\nTheir term of office lasts three years, and the age limit for exercising their duties is set at 99 years.\n\nThe rules of procedure of the Board of Directors include a provision requiring each director to allocate 10% of the compensation received for performing his/her duties as a director to purchase shares in Compagnie de l'Odet until the number of shares held reaches the equivalent of one year's compensation received.\n\nThe Board of Directors elects from among its members a Chairman/ Chairwoman of the Board of Directors, a natural person who organizes the Board's work and ensures that the directors are in a position to fulfill their assignments.\n\nRegardless of the period for which they have been conferred, the Chairman/ Chairwoman's duties end automatically at the end of the first Ordinary General Meeting held after the date on which he/she reaches the age of 75. However, the Board of Directors may in this case decide to renew the Chairman/Chairwoman's term of office for one or two periods of two years.\n\nThe Board may appoint from among its members one or more Vice-Chairmen/ Vice-Chairwomen to preside at Board meetings in the event of the absence or incapacity of the Chairman/Chairwoman.\n\nFailing this, the position of Chairman/Chairwoman falls on a member of the Board especially chosen by his/her colleagues at each meeting.\n\nThe Board may also appoint a secretary who may be selected from outside the members of the Board.\n\n{328}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Executive management of the company is carried out, under its responsibility, either by the Chairman/Chairwoman of the Board of Directors or by another natural person appointed by the Board of Directors, bearing the title of Chief Executive Officer.\n\nUpon the proposal of the Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors may mandate one or more persons (but no more than five) to assist him/her as Deputy Chief Executive Officer.\n\n# **1.5.3.

RIGHTS, PRIVILEGES AND RESTRICTIONS ATTACHED TO SHARES**\n\nArticle 11 of the bylaws provides that, apart from the voting right granted to it by law, each share entitles the holder to a portion, in proportion to the number and par value of existing shares, of the share capital, the profits or the proceeds of liquidation.\n\nArticle 19 of the bylaws states that:\n\n*\"[…] The voting rights attached to shares are proportional to the capital share they represent. At equivalent par value, each capital share or dividend share carries one voting right.*\n\n*However, a double voting right compared to that granted to other shares, taking into account the portion of the share capital that they represent, is granted to all fully paid-up shares held in registered form in the name of the same shareholder for at least four years […]\".*\n\n# **1.5.5. MEASURES TO BE TAKEN TO AMEND SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS**\n\nThe company's bylaws do not provide more restrictive provisions than the law in this area.\n\n# **1.5.6.

INTERNAL CHARTER FOR CHARACTERIZING AGREEMENTS**\n\nIn light of changes in regulations and various standards, the Board of Directors, at its meeting on September 12, 2019, adopted a new internal charter for the Group to characterize agreements and as such distinguish, firstly, between agreements subject to the Board's \"prior authorization\" scheme and approval by the General Shareholders' Meeting (so-called \"regulated\" agreements) and, secondly, between agreements regarding ongoing operations concluded under normal conditions (known as \"arm's length\" agreements).\n\nIn addition, after noting the conditions of application of the legal regime governing regulated agreements and the various phases of the control procedure, the charter, pursuant to the provisions of article L. 22-10-12 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* provides for the implementation of a procedure allowing a regular assessment as to whether the arm's length agreements fulfill these conditions.\n\n# **TYPOLOGY OF ONGOING AGREEMENTS CONCLUDED UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS**\n\nThe typology, established on the basis of agreements concluded regularly within the Group, was determined based on the work of the financial and legal departments and assessed together with the Statutory Auditors.\n\nThe following are regarded as arm's length agreements and therefore not subject to prior authorization:\n\n- invoices from Compagnie de l'Odet to other Group companies, related in particular to administrative assistance or management services;\n- asset transfers from any Group company within the limit of 1.5 million euros per transaction;\n- options or authorizations granted within the framework of a Group tax regime (tax consolidation agreement);\n- disposals of securities of minor importance that are purely administrative in nature, or disposals of securities as part of a reclassification of securities\n\n# **INTERNAL ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE FOR ARM'S LENGTH AGREEMENTS**\n\nThe conditions governing agreements characterized as ongoing and concluded under normal conditions will be assessed each year by the Board at the meeting called to approve the financial statements.\n\nTo that end, the Board will have access to the work of the Chief Financial Officer and the Group Legal Counsel. Both of these officers will have previously reported on their work to the Audit Committee, which will report (having links with the company as defined in article L. 225-38 of the French commercial code *[Code de commerce]*) for up to 1,000,000 euros per transaction, whereby transactions relating to listed companies have to be carried out at a price corresponding to an average of the prices listed in the last twenty trading days;\n\noccurring between the company and natural persons or legal entities\n\n- transfers between the company and one of its directors of a number of securities equal to that set for exercising his/her duties as a corporate officer within the issuer of securities transferred;\n- cash management and/or loan transactions, provided the transaction is carried out at the market rate with a maximum differential of 0.50%.\n\ntheir findings to the Board of Directors' meeting called upon to approve the characterization of the relevant agreements. The implementation of the assessment procedure that took place at the\n\nmeetings of the Audit Committee on March 14, 2024 and the Board of Directors on March 14, 2024 showed that the characterization of the agreements adopted at the end of the meetings meets the requirements.\n\n# **1.5.10.2. REVIEW OF AGREEMENTS APPROVED DURING PREVIOUS FISCAL YEARS AND CONTINUED DURING THE YEAR**\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of article L. 225-40-1 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* the Board of Directors meeting on March 14, 2024 examined the agreements signed and authorized in previous fiscal years whose performance continued in 2023 and noted that the reasons for signing the agreements and the different interests that presided over their implementation are still applicable to each of the agreements.

undergone two major transformations over the past year:\n\n- it left the logistics sector,\n- it acquired the Lagardère group.\n\nAfter selling our African logistics business to MSC, the world's leading shipping company managed and controlled by our friends, the Aponte family, we have now reached an agreement to sell our freight forwarding business to CMA CGM, managed and controlled by the Saadé family, whom we have known for over thirty years. We know that these two families will continue to grow these wonderful businesses. These transactions have also been well received by the employee representatives.\n\nAfter more than two years of analysis and the authorization of the European Commission, Vivendi was able to acquire around 60% of the Lagardère group. Founded by Jean-Luc Lagardère, and managed by Arnaud for the past eighteen years, both friends of our family, the group has significant global business activities in two sectors: publishing and travel retail, in which the group ranks among the top three worldwide.\n\nThese profound changes are not unusual for our Group. From paper to plastics, transport, oil, communications, we have continually sought to develop new sectors and then pass them to new partners, better placed than us, to develop them further. All this, of course, while creating significant value for our Group.\n\nAs we write these words, the Group is entering its 203rd year. Let us hope that, despite a concerning international environment, we will continue on our positive path, never forgetting to support charitable initiatives, and thanking all those who work for Compagnie de l'Odet and the Bolloré Group for their past performance and for their future vigilance and solidarity.\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/0 description: A man with white hair is wearing a blue scarf and a black and blue jacket with yellow trim.

The building's architecture includes a high ceiling with a grid-like structure, possibly a skylight, allowing natural light to flood the space.

The stability of its shareholder base enables it to follow a long-term investment policy. Ever since it was founded, the Group has stood out thanks to its ability to adapt to innovative services and solutions, and its international diversification strategy, while ensuring that it has positive social and environmental impacts. Today, armed with a solid financial structure, it makes investments within its own business lines (oil logistics, communications and industry), and perhaps tomorrow in new business sectors.\n\nImage /page/7/Picture/3 description: The image shows several statistics. There are more than 76,000 employees. The company operates in 91 countries across 5 continents. The revenue in 2023 was 14 billion euros. The adjusted operating income (EBITA) in 2023 was 1 billion euros. The equity at the end of 2023 was 33 billion euros.\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/1 description: The image shows a white line drawing of a delivery truck with a clock on top of it. The truck is facing right and has lines behind it to indicate motion. The background is a teal square.\n\n# **Oil logistics**\n\nBolloré Energy is a major player in oil distribution and oil logistics in France and in Europe. Since 2018, Bolloré Energy has diversified its product range to offer its customers cleaner alternatives and enable them to significantly reduce CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/4 description: The image is a purple square with a white icon of two overlapping speech bubbles. The larger speech bubble is on the left, and the smaller one is on the right. The speech bubbles are outlined in white.\n\n# **Communications**\n\nThe Bolloré Group's Communications division is based on its holdings: – in Vivendi, with: Groupe Canal+, no. 1 in pay-TV in France, Lagardère, the world's third largest book publisher for the general public and educational markets and no. 1 in France. The world's fifth largest retailer in transport hubs and the second largest retailer in airports, Havas, one of the largest communication groups in the world, Prisma Media, a leading bi-media group in France ranking number one in magazines, online video and daily digital audience ratings; Gameloft, a leader in mobile video games; – in Universal Music Group, the world leader in musical entertainment.\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/7 description: The image shows a blue square with rounded corners. Inside the square is a speech bubble shape, also in blue. Within the speech bubble is a white battery icon with a lightning bolt symbol inside it.\n\n# **Industry**\n\nThe Blue division brings together the Group's industrial activities, alongside Blue Solutions, Bluebus and Bluestorage. The Films division specializes in ultra-finish retractable packaging films and dielectric films for capacitors.

It sold its port and logistics activity in Africa to the MSC group in December 2022, and the international freight forwarding and logistics business (Bolloré Logistics) was sold to CMA CGM in February 2024. These two disposals have helped to strengthen the Group's financial capacity, and it plans to make new investments in its existing business lines and/or in new business segments. The Group will remain family-owned and will continue to develop its three business sectors: (i) Oil logistics; (ii) Communications and (iii) Industry.\n\nA strategy for the Group to diversify into the oil distribution market with, by 2028, a range of alternative fuels contributing to the energy transition.\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/4 description: A wide shot shows a large, white storage tank with the words \"BOLLORE ENERGY\" written on it in blue and green. A metal staircase leads up the side of the tank, and a person is walking up the stairs. In front of the tank is a white truck with the word \"BOLLORE\" written on the side. A person is standing next to the truck. In the background, there are other storage tanks and trees. The sky is blue and clear.\n\n# **Oil logistics**\n\nBolloré Energy is a key player in oil distribution and oil logistics in France, Switzerland and Germany. Bolloré Energy is also a player in the consolidation of the oil products distribution sector in France (see the acquisition of Sicarbu and a dozen businesses every year) and is also continuing to invest in its network of service stations in Germany.\n\nTo cope with the structural decline in the oil distribution market, Bolloré Energy is pursuing a strategy to diversify into the storage of petroleum products (launch in 2018 of the Dépôt Rouen Petit-Couronne activity – storage capacity of nearly 600,000 m3) and has also continued to invest in the development of alternative fuels such as biodiesel (B100), synthetic diesel (HVO) and bio fuel oil containing 30% biofuel in order to reduce its carbon footprint and thereby contribute to the energy transition. Lastly, it has established isglö, which specializes in improving the energy efficiency of homes and buildings.\n\n# **Communications**\n\nIn September 2012, the Group acquired a stake in Vivendi of which it became the leading shareholder and in which it currently owns a 29.9% interest. Vivendi has been fully consolidated by Bolloré since April 2017.\n\nSince 2014, Vivendi has built a global content, media and communications group based on a strategic roadmap focused on transformation, internationalization and the greater integration of its business lines. To that end, Vivendi is continuing to develop its three main businesses. In the audiovisual and media sectors, Groupe Canal+ has set itself a target of reaching 30 million subscribers by 2025. Achieving this objective will require it to continue increasing its international subscriber base, either through organic growth or acquisitions. Groupe Canal+ has therefore acquired significant stakes in MultiChoice in South Africa and Viu in Asia, the second largest OTT service in terms of number of subscribers (more than 12 million) in this region. After M7 in 2019, in 2023 it also acquired SPI, which operates in Central and Eastern Europe.\n\nIn communications, Havas Group is continuing with its policy of making targeted acquisitions in order to strengthen its presence in strategic geographical regions and/or in specific business lines. Since 2015, the company has made between five and nine acquisitions on average per year and is expected to continue at this rate over the next few years.\n\nThe Vivendi group is also looking to continue growing its publishing business in order to become a global player in promoting creation, authors, knowledge and culture. Following its public tender offer for Lagardère, which closed in June 2022, Vivendi holds more than 60% of its share capital. In order to obtain the European Commission's authorization to acquire Lagardère, Vivendi sold Editis, the second largest publisher in France (acquired in 2019), together with the magazine *Gala*, owned by Prisma Media. The closing of these transactions on November 21, 2023 enabled Vivendi to finalize its combination with Lagardère.\n\nIn order to fully unlock the development potential of all its business activities, Vivendi, in December, proposed reviewing the possibility of splitting Vivendi into several entities, each of which would be listed on the stock market and structured around four entities: Groupe Canal+, Havas, a company combining the publishing and distribution assets (Lagardère and Prisma Media),\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/1 description: The image shows a page from a document. The page is divided into two parts. The left part features a poster for the TV show \"Mister Spade\". The poster has a group of people at the top, and a man standing in a pool of water at the bottom. The text \"Le calme attendra\" is written above the man. The title of the show, \"Mister Spade\", is written in large letters at the bottom of the poster. The right part of the page contains the text \"OVERVIEW OF THE GROUP AND ITS ACTIVITIES 1\". Below this text is a paragraph that reads, \"With more than 500 electric buses on the road worldwide, the Group is one of the preferred partners of carbon-free transport players, thanks in particular to its 'solid-state' LMP® batteries.\" Below the text is a picture of a bluebus vehicle 100% electrique.\n\nCanal+ has set itself a target of reaching 30 million subscribers by 2025. Promising original creations for\n2024 include: *Mister Spade* by Scott Frank.\n\nand a company holding listed and unlisted financial interests in the culture, media and entertainment sectors. This project, if completed, would create value for all the Group's stakeholders and would create independent pure players with the necessary human resources and financial agility to pursue their own growth trajectory in an international context marked by numerous investment opportunities.\n\nLastly, following the listing and distribution of Universal Music Group (UMG) in September 2021, the Bolloré Group holds an 18% stake in UMG, while Vivendi holds 10%. UMG is the world leader in recorded music. It will continue to rely on the growth in streaming and its proximity to artists in growing its worldwide revenue and its unrivaled catalog.\n\n# **Industry**\n\nThe Industry sector comprises: (i) Blue, with the Group's e-mobility activities including LMP® electric batteries, the production of clean transport solutions and the marketing of energy storage solutions; (ii) Films, which includes the production of polypropylene films for capacitors and films for food and industrial packaging; (iii) Systems, which offers a range of solutions and equipment to optimize flows of people, equipment and data.\n\nThe Bolloré Innovative Thin Films division is continuing to develop new high-tech products, particularly in recyclable ultra-thin retractable packaging films, which will enable it to continue growing its commercial activities internationally. As part of this commercial strategy, it is also continuing to make industrial investments, within its capacities, in order to increase the proportion of films it produces with higher added value.\n\nThe Group has made Blue Solutions' activities a major priority for development, thanks in particular to its innovative \"solid-state\" batteries, which are based on proprietary Lithium Metal Polymer (LMP®) technology, and whose commercial applications currently cover 6-meter and 12-meter electric buses, in particular through contracts with the RATP and a number of major urban areas in France and Belgium, as well as electricity storage. Since 2022, the Group has been stepping up its R&D efforts through strategic collaboration agreements with university laboratories in France and Switzerland in order to develop, ahead of its competitors, a new battery (Gen4) that can be used in the automotive industry. Blue Solutions is working with automotive manufacturers and suppliers to fine-tune technical developments and ensure that the technology directly addresses the needs of their upcoming electric vehicle platforms.\n\nWithin the Systems division, Automatic Systems (AS), the global leader in automated secure entry control (pedestrian, vehicle, passenger access), is developing successfully, thanks in particular to its product innovations and the quality of its experts.

Among its major acquisitions of the year, in July, Bolloré Energy finalized the purchase of 100% of the shares in Sicarbu Ouest, a subsidiary of the Eureden cooperative specializing in the distribution of petroleum products. In addition to consolidating Bolloré Energy's territorial roots with a significant presence in Brittany, Loire-Atlantique and Mayenne, this acquisition strengthens the ties between the agricultural world and the company. The e-commerce activity launched in 2017 with hellofioul.fr, its online store selling domestic heating oil, continues to grow.\n\nIn 2023, Bolloré Energy posted strong results in all its business lines thanks to the commitment of its teams, the quality of its operational processes and the reliability of its network.\n\n# **Energy transition**\n\nWhile supporting the position of heating oil in the French energy mix, Bolloré Energy is committed to the energy transition.\n\nSince 2018, Bolloré Energy has diversified its product range to offer its customers cleaner alternatives. Since fall 2021, it has been marketing biodiesel (B100) under the brand name \"Koolza 100\", produced from French-grown rapeseed oil and, since December 2021, a synthetic diesel (HVO100) under the brand name Izipure, made from 100% recycled materials and reducing CO2 emissions by up to 90%.

However, since the listing and distribution of Universal Music Group in 2021, the group has suffered from a very high conglomerate discount. In order to fully unlock the development potential of all its activities, on December 13, 2023, Vivendi's Management Board proposed to the Supervisory Board that it review the possibility of splitting Vivendi into several entities, each of which would be listed on the stock market. This project would be structured around Groupe Canal+, Havas, a company combining the publishing and distribution assets (Lagardère and Prisma Media), and a company holding listed and unlisted financial interests in the culture, media and entertainment sectors.\n\nSince this announcement, the group has been reviewing the feasibility review. In any event, if the Supervisory Board authorizes the Management Board to go ahead with the project, a number of important steps will have to be taken. These include consultation with the employee representative bodies of the entities concerned, before which no decision in principle will be taken, obtaining the necessary regulatory authorizations, the required approvals from the group's creditors and the consent of Vivendi's shareholders at a General Meeting. As indicated on December 13, such a transaction would take between twelve and eighteen months to complete.\n\n# **CONTENT, MEDIA, COMMUNICATIONS, RETAIL STORES IN TRANSPORT HUBS** GROUPE CANAL+\n\nOperating in more than 50 countries and with nearly 7,600 employees in 2023, Groupe Canal+ is a major global player in content creation and distribution.

This has resulted in a strong commitment among, and strong growth in the number of, subscribers of this service. Its international roll-out has accelerated with a presence in more than 40 countries and territories to date.\n\nIn a fast-changing environment with multiple operators, Groupe Canal+ stands out from its competitors as a result of its technological, commercial and content-related expertise, and its unique ability to forge partnerships with all players.

It is made up of the Compagnie de l'Odet and Bolloré portfolio of 9.0 billion euros and the Vivendi portfolio worth 7.6 billion euros at the end of 2023. The Group also has various agricultural assets.\n\n> While developing each of its operational activities, the Group's strategy has sought to maintain industrial capital in the form of assets that can be sold if needed or form the basis of new activities or partnerships.\n\n# **Shareholdings**\n\nThe stock market value of the Group's portfolio of listed securities stood at 16.6 billion euros at December 31, 2023, versus 16.2 billion euros at the end of 2022.\n\nThe portfolio held directly by Compagnie de l'Odet and Bolloré was worth 9.0 billion euros at the end of 2023, compared with 7.6 billion euros at the end of 2022. This increase was mainly due to rising share prices, mainly the share price of UMG. It notably includes holdings in UMG, Bigben and Socfin:\n\ng Universal Music Group (UMG)(1): following the listing of UMG on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and the distribution of 60% of UMG's capital to Vivendi's shareholders in September, 2021, the Group has a 18.4%(2) stake in UMG, valued at 8,660 million euros at December 31, 2023.\n\nVivendi's equity portfolio was worth 7.6 billion euros, compared with 8.6 billion euros at the end of 2022. This fall was due to it ceasing to hold the stake in Lagardère following full consolidation from December 1, 2023. This was partially offset by the increase in the share prices of its other holdings, including UMG and Telecom Italia. Vivendi's equity portfolio includes investments in UMG, Telecom Italia, MediaForEurope, FL Entertainment, and MultiChoice:\n\ng Universal Music Group: following the sale of 20% of UMG's share capital to a consortium led by Tencent and 10% to the Pershing Square group, as well as the distribution of 60% of the share capital to Vivendi's shareholders in 2021, Vivendi now has a 9.98% stake in UMG(4). This shareholding amounted to 4,692 million euros at December 31, 2023;\n\ng FL Entertainment: as a result of the transfer of its 32.9%\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/46/Picture/1 description: The image shows an aerial view of a large agricultural field with rows of crops.

Socfin is one of the leading independent planters worldwide and manages almost 190,000 hectares of plantations.\n\nIn Asia, Socfin is present in Indonesia through Socfindo, which farms 45,000 hectares of oil palms and rubber trees, and has expanded into Cambodia, where it has undertaken the planting of 7,000 hectares of rubber trees, of which more than 6,000 hectares are now mature. In Africa, Socfin has numerous plantations in various countries, such as Cameroon, where Socapalm and SAFA Cameroun manage 44,000 hectares of oil palms and rubber trees, Côte d'Ivoire, where Société des Caoutchoucs de Grand Bereby (SOGB) farms 23,000 hectares of oil palm and rubber tree plantations, and Nigeria (26,400 hectares).\n\nRedlands Farm Holding also owns 3,300 hectares across three farms in Georgia and Florida.\n\nThe 2023 olive harvest was adversely affected by winter frost. In addition, following the conclusive tests carried out in 2022, the cultivation of the estate's land to produce self-sufficient levels of sunflower seeds for the purposes of its extra-virgin sunflower oil business, continued in 2023.\n\nAfter the initial success achieved in 2022, the rapid commercial expansion of the Fresh Press Farms brand continued in 2023 in the United States, with its products now sold in around 4,000 supermarkets. Alongside this expansion, more intensive efforts are being made to develop new products aimed at exercising logistical and commercial leverage in the distribution points acquired. These developments should also help to establish Fresh Press Farms as an innovative brand in the eyes of consumers and as a contributing factor to an improved diet.\n\nThe Group is also a shareholder and operator of a vineyard in southeastern France: Domaine de La Croix which bottles \"cru classé\" wines in the \"Côtes de Provence\" appellation area. The vineyard has a total area of 242 hectares, including 110 hectares carrying viticultural rights, which produce approximately 650,000 bottles per year.

Chaired by Marie Bolloré, the Fondation de la 2e chance helps people aged 18 to 62 who have faced extreme hardship and who presently\n\nlive in a vulnerable situation, but who have a real desire to get their lives back on track. It provides financial and personal support for a realistic and sustainable professional project:\n\ng creating or buying a business (up to 8,000 euros in funding);\n\ng completing training leading to a qualification (up to 5,000 euros).\n\nThis financial \"leg-up\" is accompanied by professional and emotional sponsoring provided to the beneficiary, until the project reaches a successful conclusion.\n\nThe Foundation's continued activities are supported by a team of employees and volunteers. Six employees coordinate all those involved in the Foundation at the head office, hosted by the Bolloré Group. A network of 1,000 active volunteers acts as on-site representatives, instructors and sponsors throughout France. Since its creation, Fondation de la 2e chance has helped over 9,255 people to bounce back.\n\nIn 2023, 243 new candidates were given support, with average aid per case of 2,971 euros. 70% of candidates received help via training and 30% for creating a company.

Being able to give back a part of what we have had the good fortune to receive is a value deeply rooted in the Bolloré Group's DNA. It is the reason why the Group has chosen to prioritize youth empowerment and education, while maintaining its commitment to respond to humanitarian and public health emergencies.\n\nIn 2023, the Group contributed to the economic independence of around 10,000 beneficiaries in 14 countries, via charities working mainly in education, health, and student vulnerability. For example:\n\ng 50,000 euros in support for the Solucham association, which promotes education and health in the mountain valleys of Nepal and the Solukhumbu region; in Europe, to combat growing levels of student hardship, the Group launched an international solidarity scholarship program, \"Room for Success\", co-designed with the Cité internationale universitaire de Paris. Having received the Earthtalent by Bolloré label, this program provides financial support to students. This year, scholarships were made available to around twenty students living in poverty.\n\nWhile young people are the priority of the Earthtalent by Bolloré solidarity program, they are not the only population to receive support. The Group also takes action in the event of humanitarian emergencies, which was the case in 2023 following the earthquake in Turkey. In support of the NGO Acted, basic necessities, including hygiene kits, were transported to distribution sites.\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe paper manufacturing plant in Odet, Brittany.

Non-financial performance statement**\n\nSince its creation, the Bolloré Group has been driven by a very determined commitment to entrepreneurship and innovation. With a strategy of diversifying its activities, it is listed on the stock exchange and benefits from a stable and family-owned shareholder base, which allows it to make longterm investments(1). It has a long history of transmission from generation to generation, based on a corporate culture and strong values, shared by all its employees, which include humility, excellence, courage, solidarity, agility and innovation. The Group's commitments are reflected in its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy based on the four fundamental pillars described below. Given the great diversity of the Bolloré Group's activities and CSR challenges, and in the interest of conciseness, the non-financial performance statement (DPEF) presented below explains the mitigation techniques implemented by the Group to manage its priority CSR risks relating to the activities of the Logistics, Oil logistics and Industry sectors. The priority CSR challenges associated with the activities of the Vivendi group are described in its universal registration document. However, the summary of consolidated priority risks for Bolloré and Vivendi is available in section 1.1.2. – The Bolloré Group's non-financial risk mapping. Furthermore, consistent with the scope of financial consolidation, Vivendi's priority CSR issues are summarized in the body of this document, and the consolidated view of the main social and environmental performance indicators is\n\n# <span id=\"page-55-1\"></span>**1.1. CSR challenges and strategy**\n\n# **1.1.1. THE BOLLORÉ GROUP'S CSR STRATEGY**\n\nThe Group is committed to following the principles of respect for human rights and has been a member of the United Nations Global Compact for twenty years. This commitment is reflected in the Bolloré Group Ethics and CSR Charter, as well as in the human rights Charter backed by international standards such as the OECD guidelines for multinational companies, the fundamental conventions of the International labour organization (ILO) and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. All employees of the Group's divisions and subsidiaries are bound by the commitments expressed in these Charters. The Bolloré Group CSR strategy described below was developed in view of the results of the materiality analysis of the Group's challenges carried out in 2016. This analysis made it possible to determine the most material issues, through their identification and prioritization, during specific interviews with internal stakeholders in each of the Group's activities, while taking into account the expectations of external stakeholders (customers, employees, public authorities). Updated to include Vivendi on its integration in 2017, the materiality matrix identifies seven major priority challenges in four fundamental pillars that shape the Bolloré Group's CSR strategy. These commitments are upheld by all of the Group's divisions to make CSR part of everyday life in their core business and to create value and connections between the men and women in the company, their environment, and stakeholders. Note that this mapping will be fully updated in 2024 to meet the new regulatory requirements arising from the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the change in the scope of our activities.\n\nIn 2017, the Group consolidated its results as part of its response to decree no. 2017-1265 of August 9, 2017 implementing order no. 2017-1180 of available in the summary tables presented at the end of this chapter 2 (see section 1.3. – Summary tables of the Bolloré Group's non-financial performance indicators). The non-financial performance statements of both Bolloré and Vivendi are subject to verification by an approved independent third party<sup>(2)</sup>.\n\nThe Bolloré Group's 2023 non-financial performance statement includes the activities of the Bolloré Logistics division, which was sold in February 2024. These activities were held by the Bolloré Group for all of 2023. They had been classified as held-for-sale activities since May 8, 2023 in accordance with the IFRS 5 standard, and were therefore excluded from the presentation of the Group's activities and risks in the 2023 management report. However, non-financial reporting standards do not provide for any special treatment of activities that have not yet been sold. Thus, the non-financial performance of the Bolloré Logistics division is included in the Group's non-financial performance statement but presented distinctly on a separate line in the reporting tables. The risk management policies and action plans for future years are less in depth than for the rest of the Group given the recent sale of these activities. Finally, to facilitate reading and allow for quick identification of the activities sold off, it was decided to lighten the font pertaining to Bolloré Logistics data in the following sections.\n\nJuly 19, 2017 on the publication of non-financial information by companies, and to the duty of care law. These regulatory obligations have introduced an analytical perspective based on the management of priority non-financial risks. The Bolloré Group promotes the implementation of virtuous due diligence measures in all its business sectors to ensure that the policies, processes and improvement plans in place guarantee its non-financial performance over the long term. Anticipating and responding to customer expectations by mitigating the risks around business ethics, protecting human capital by implementing a health and safety policy conducive to a lasting relationship with employees, safeguarding environmental assets by investing in the development of innovative products and services, and being an actor in the development of society and the communities where the Group operates – these are all factors that will create value.\n\nThe Vivendi group, which mainly represents the Bolloré Group's Communications business, is part of this approach. In 2020, it redefined its own CSR commitments in line with its corporate mission: *Creation Unlimited* – unlocking creation by valuing all talents, ideas and cultures and sharing them with as many people as possible. Vivendi's CSR program, *Creation for the Future*, was rolled out to all of its business lines in 2021. It was partially adjusted in 2022 to take into account the insights revealed by the results of the CSR risk mapping and the materiality survey (see Vivendi universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 2.1.1. – A materiality survey to analyze priority issues), *Creation for the Future* sets the course and defines a framework for action common to all Vivendi group entities. It enables creative energies to come together to contribute to building more sustainable, open, inclusive and responsible societies.\n\n# **1.1.1.1. ALL RESPONSIBLE AND COMMITTED – THE BOLLORE GROUP'S ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM**\n\nThe Bolloré Group's desire to fulfill its stakeholders' expectations and to play an active role in responsible development are currently reflected in four areas of commitment:\n\n# **UNITING AND PROTECTING PEOPLE, THE COMPANY'S GREATEST STRENGTH**\n\n- Protecting the health and ensuring the safety of the women and men exposed as part of our activities.\n- Attracting talent and developing the skills of our employees.\n- Maintaining social dialog and promoting well-being in the workplace.\n\n(1) For further details on the Bolloré Group, its activities and business model, please see chapter 1 of this universal registration document.\n\n(2) For more information on Vivendi, its activities, business model and non-financial performance statement, please refer to Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **ACTING WITH INTEGRITY IN OUR BUSINESS CONDUCT AND PROMOTING HUMAN RIGHTS**\n\n- Sharing the same business ethics and ensuring compliance with the strictest standards.\n- Promoting human rights in our businesses and supply chains.\n\n# **INNOVATING IN RESPONSE TO MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES**\n\n- Reducing our carbon footprint and adapting to climate change.\n- Placing the control of our carbon footprint at the heart of our products and services.\n- Preventing pollution and reducing environmental impacts related to our operations.\n\n# **COMMITTING OVER THE LONG-TERM TO REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT**\n\n- Contributing to and promoting local employment.\n- Revitalizing regions.\n- Building and maintaining dialog with stakeholders.\n- Undertaking societal actions for the benefit of local populations.\n\nThe commitments of the Bolloré Group are in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Its actions have a direct or indirect positive impact on 151 of the 169 targets.\n\nA summary of the main performance indicators relating to these major commitments is available in chapter 1 of this universal registration document (see chapter 1 – CSR Performance in brief).\n\n# **1.1.1.2.** *CREATION FOR THE FUTURE* **– VIVENDI'S CSR PROGRAM**\n\nIn 2021, Vivendi deployed its CSR program, which includes all its activities in a framework of unified positive action. The program is named *Creation for the Future* and expresses Vivendi's raison d'être: *Creation Unlimited.* It contributes to the success of Vivendi's mission, \"to unleash creation by revealing all talent, valuing all ideas and cultures, and sharing them with as many people as possible\". Deployed to the entire Vivendi group in 2021, the *Creation for the Future* program is based on three pillars that put environmental, societal and social impacts into perspective at all levels of Vivendi's activities and set new ambitions by 2025.\n\n- *Creation for the Planet:* aims to help to curb climate change and incorporates a reduced carbon trajectory validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative. The Group is also committed to getting its partners and suppliers involved in its approach and, thus further contribute to the global offsetting of carbon emissions;\n- *Creation for Society:* aims to inspire change by working to make culture, a vector of emancipation and social ties, accessible to as many people as possible and foster the emergence of more inclusive, sustainable and responsible realms of imagination. To imagine the society of the future, and drawing on its role as a leading cultural player, the group intends to do its part to ensure that everyone can access diverse and inventive cultural offerings that help them grow as individuals and better understand others, the world and themselves.\n- *Creation with All:* reaffirms the principle of collective commitment and the importance of each person's role in building a more sustainable and inclusive society together. The group's employees are the most implicated,\n\nbut this also applies to its artistic talents in all their diversity and all around the world, and to other stakeholders (customers, business partners, suppliers). Each person, at their own level, can act and have a positive impact. To build a more responsible world together, Vivendi strives to discover and develop a wide array of talent to ensure the cultural relevance of its content. Vivendi creates conditions conducive to their development with an attractive and inclusive working environment, where their creations and commitments are valued.\n\nThis approach, which is at the highest level of the group, is a performance driver at the heart of Vivendi's strategy and creates value shared with all stakeholders. It is built on an organization in charge of steering the roadmap, which sets out each of the pillars of commitment in Vivendi's various business lines. It is shared with all employees, who are its leading ambassadors.\n\nThe implementation of the strategic program is also based on a foundation of respect for ethical values and an integrity culture that underpins the conduct of business within the group. This is reflected in the group's overall compliance policy, which helps to maintain trustworthy relationships with its many partners and, in particular, its customers. To govern its activities, Vivendi has its own ethical measures, applicable to its subsidiaries and adapted to their businesses (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2-2.2. Main non-financial risks and opportunities).\n\nThese commitments are in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 1.1.3. – Vivendi's contribution to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals).\n\n# **1.1.2. THE BOLLORÉ GROUP'S NON-FINANCIAL RISK MAPPING**\n\nIn accordance with the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), in 2017 the Group mobilized the members of the Management Committees of all of its divisions to map the CSR risks and opportunities associated with its transport and logistics activities and industrial activities. The subsidiaries organized workshops on risk-scoring, led by a consultancy firm and using software to rank the risks identified and ensure the effectiveness of the method used. A universe of 16 CSR risks and opportunities, covering the themes defined in the NFRD, was first defined and explained for each Group division. These risks are inherent to the Group's activities and were considered throughout the value chain (procurement, operations, use of products and services sold), taking into account all stakeholders (employees, customers, suppliers, subcontractors, public authorities, investors, etc.). Each risk was rated according to its frequency and severity. The frequency was defined as the probability of the risk occurring over the next five years. The severity corresponds to the impact of the occurrence of the risk on reputation, turnover or operations. This methodology was constructed in line with the Bolloré Group's general risk mapping. The fundamental principle of considering the expectations of stakeholders has been implemented, for example by gathering perceptions of these expectations from operational teams with full knowledge of the field. Corruption risk and conflicts of interest, a priority area, was scored by the Compliance Department in collaboration with all divisions.\n\nVivendi carried out its own CSR risk mapping in 2018 and updated it in 2022. The management of the CSR strategy, as well as the action and mitigation plans for identified non-financial risks are monitored by the Vivendi group's CSR Department (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – sections 2.1 – The process for prioritizing CSR commitments, and 2.2. – Main non-financial risks and opportunities).\n\nThe mapping of Vivendi's non-financial risks has been pooled with the Bolloré Group's mapping to obtain a consolidated view shown in the following table. The mapping, updated in 2021 in line with the work performed by the divisions, regulatory changes and changes in the scope of the Bolloré Group's activities, is in line with the Group's priorities identified during the materiality analysis. These priority risks are a natural fit with the four key pillars of the Bolloré Group's CSR strategy.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                             |

CSR GOVERNANCE**\n\nIn terms of corporate governance, the Bolloré Group refers to the French Corporate Governance Code for listed companies established by Afep (French association of private enterprises) and Medef (network of entrepreneurs). It also takes into consideration the expectations of its stakeholders, including the recommendations of ESG rating agencies and investors.\n\nAt its meeting of March 14, 2023, the Board of Directors (see the composition of the Board of Directors in section 1.4.2 – Members of the Board of Directors as at March 14, 2024) was invited to consider the changes made in the new version of the Code published in December 2022 aimed at ensuring that the Board of Directors incorporates the CSR strategy in its duties. CSR topics are now handled by the Audit Committee and, as such, the independent directors received initial training on environmental and climate issues provided by a third-party organization in March 2023 and October 2023.\n\nWith regard to the creation of a dedicated CSR Committee, after reiterating that the Audit Committee reviews non-financial risks as part of its current duties, the Board members decided that the Board of Directors will continue to refer to the work of the Audit Committee, whose responsibilities were extended to all CSR issues in 2023.\n\n# **1.1.3.1. THE GROUP CSR DEPARTMENT**\n\nThe Group CSR Department defines the framework of the CSR strategy, plays a role in awareness-raising and mobilization, coordinates action plans, steers annual reporting, and analyzes and enhances performance. The CSR Department reports to the Group Finance Department on a weekly basis to define the Group's position concerning these key questions, seize opportunities and ensure implementation of the measures needed to control the Group's CSR risks.

The CSR Department also relies on a network of CSR managers for each division and contributors at the level of each legal entity.\n\nVivendi's CSR policy, supported by the Management Board and the Supervisory Board, is at the heart of the Group's governance. In the interest of strategic coherence and to ensure the Group honors its CSR commitments, Vivendi's CSR Department reports directly to the Chairman of the Management Board. The Supervisory Board is also involved in the governance of the Group's non-financial performance. In accordance with its internal procedures, it regularly monitors the progress of our CSR policy, and is kept informed by the Management Board via a quarterly activity report. For more information on the Vivendi group's CSR governance, see section 1 – 2.1. A CSR strategy implemented by the management bodies.\n\nLegal, etc.). Its role is to assist the subsidiaries in risk control and in the promotion of CSR objectives, to formalize procedures and policies and to define common indicators to reinforce coherence and steering of the CSR strategy, despite the wide diversity of activities and geographic locations. The CSR Department is also represented on the Risk Committee, once a year. In 2022, the Head of CSR shared the duty of care plan and the action plan. This committee not only raises awareness, but also informs top management of the actions taken on these topics.\n\n# **1.1.3.2. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE**\n\nIn 2023, the Audit Committee's remit was extended to all CSR topics. The CSR Department organized two awareness-raising sessions on CSR issues for independent directors. The sessions, which emphasized environmental issues, were led by external subject matter experts. The strategic guidelines were presented to the Audit Committee at its July 2023 meeting. At a special meeting on climate issues held in October 2023, the independent directors of the Audit Committee and the Chief Financial Officer, Vice-Chairman of the\n\n# **1.1.3.3.

This Committee, made up of 12 members, including six women (50% women) reflects\n\n# **1.1.3.4. THE ETHICS – CSR AND ANTICORRUPTION COMMITTEE**\n\nThe primary task of the Ethics – CSR and Anticorruption Committee is to ensure the compliance and results of the actions taken in terms of the promotion and respect of the Group'S values and commitments, and in particular the strict application of the ethical principles published in the Ethics and CSR Charter and the Code of Conduct. Under the authority of the Chairman of the Ethics – CSR and Anticorruption Committee appointed by the Chairman of the Bolloré Group, this body meets once or twice a year.

The objective is to determine the areas of work in terms of ethics, compliance and CSR at the Group level, which must be rolled out operationally in the divisions. The Committee therefore approves the strategy, reviews performance and determines the prospects, projects and action plans with regard to the Group's priority risks and opportunities.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.1.3.5. THE RISK COMMITTEE**\n\nThe Head of CSR attends the meetings of the Risk Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, Vice-Chairman of the Group, and whose agenda includes the assessment of social and environmental risks. The CSR strategy with a risk-based approach was mentioned, as were the actions implemented to control those risks and the Group's duty of care plan. This Committee meets twice a year.\n\n# **1.1.3.6. THE CSR NETWORK: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GROUP CSR STRATEGY IN EACH BUSINESS LINE**\n\nThe CSR Department relies on a network of CSR directors and managers within the divisions, with whom it communicates on an ongoing basis to ensure that the policy adopted by the Group is applied in each division. The Department also works closely with the functional departments of the entire Group (Legal, Finance, Human Resources, Purchasing, Communication, etc.).

These contributors report the indicators related to their non-financial performance to the Group CSR Department each year as part of the annual CSR reporting campaign.\n\n# **1.1.3.7. CROSS-FUNCTIONAL GOVERNANCE**\n\nImage /page/59/Figure/8 description: The image is a diagram illustrating a company's CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) structure and processes. It is divided into several sections, each representing a different aspect of CSR management. The sections are Strategy Validation and Control, CSR presence, Executive management (including Executive Committee, The Risk Committee, and Ethics - CSR and Anticorruption Committee), Board of Directors (Audit Committee Remit expanded to include CSR), Finance Department, CSR Department, Coordination and Monitoring, All responsible and committed (Uniting people, the company's greatest strength; Acting with integrity in our business conduct and promoting human rights; Innovating in response to major environmental challenges; Committing over the long-term to regional development), Implementation in the Entities, CSR Department in the entities (CSR programs at the entities and ad hoc working groups), Operations/Action plans (Real estate, Purchasing, Business lines (battery and systems production, bus/film/audiovisual/transport), HSE, HR), and Ownership (Group employees, Information/awareness-raising via internal communication tools (newsletter, intranet, events), on a daily basis as part of their functions, management of CSR projects at their level).\n\n# **1.1.4. PERFORMANCE MONITORING**\n\nNon-financial performance is monitored throughout the year by coordinating the Group's various priority projects (for example, work prior to the drafting of the Group's climate strategy, the mapping of human rights risks or the application of the Taxonomy Regulation, etc.). Risk management interviews are conducted by the head office CSR Department with the business line officers who are responsible for managing priority risks and locally, targeted thematic questionnaires (e.g. human rights questionnaire and analyses of energy consumption) also contribute to the assessment of the performance of both the Group and its divisions. The annual results are consolidated during the non-financial reporting campaign in Group entities around the world (see sections 1.3.1.1. – Methodology note for social reporting and 1.3.2.1. – CSR reporting methodology note) whose robustness, completeness and reliability have been significantly enhanced over the last ten years. The list of performance monitoring questions and indicators was updated in 2019 to best illustrate the management of the Bolloré Group's priority CSR and social risks, then was finalized in 2020. They are the subject of dedicated analysis to continue to strengthen their reliability each year. The indicators are, where relevant, provided to the Group and/or tailored specifically to the divisions according to their particular challenges. In accordance with the reporting requirements and disclosure of information on the company's CSR performance, the compliance of the Bolloré Group's DPEF with regard to the CSR priority risks identified and the fairness of the information presented is verified by an accredited independent third-party (quantitative audits and qualitative interviews) (see section 1.4. – Report by the independent third party on the consolidated non-financial performance statement).\n\nIn 2021, the Bolloré Group defined an initial set of measurable objectives, validated by the members of the Ethics – CSR and Anticorruption Committee, enabling it to strengthen the management of its CSR policy and establish a continued improvement approach. These commitments embody the Bolloré Group's CSR policy, implemented on a daily basis in each core business. Since 2021, the team at the Group CSR Department has focused its efforts onissues relating to the fight against climate change and ensuring Group compliance with regulations covering duty of care, taxonomy reporting and the CSRD.\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.1.4.1. SUMMARY OF OBJECTIVES AND PROGRESS OF THE CSR STRATEGY**\n\nThe summary table below shows the Group's objectives for each of the four pillars of its CSR strategy, as well as their progress on a consolidated scope including the Bolloré Logistics division, which was sold on February 29, 2024. The scope of engagement of the Group CSR strategy will be reviewed in 2024 to take into account two recent significant disposals (Bolloré Africa Logistics in 2022 and Bolloré Logistics in 2024), as well as the new expectations of the new European CSRD. This will involve setting new objectives with regard to a dual materiality analysis.\n\n| Pillars of the CSR strategy                                                          | Review of commitments

LISTENING TO ITS STAKEHOLDERS TO OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE**\n\n# **1.1.4.2.1. A GROUP THAT IS ATTENTIVE TO ITS STAKEHOLDERS**\n\nThe Group and its divisions are committed to taking into account the expectations and concerns of their internal and external stakeholders at all levels of the organization. The divisions and subsidiaries maintain ongoing dialog with their stakeholders (local communities, customers, suppliers, etc.), adapted to their local and operational contexts (see section 1.2.4.2.3. – Building and maintaining dialog with stakeholders). Moreover, in 2023, nearly 100% of Group entities completing the CSR reporting declared they were certified or had at least one site that was ISO 9001 certified. As part of this approach, a mapping of relevant stakeholders is required for the entities concerned.\n\nEvery year, the Group is attentive to the requirements of its external stakeholders. In 2021, the Group undertook an external stakeholder identification process (banks, funders, investors, customers, etc.). Exhaustive identification of their priorities and expectations and their level of influence on the Group was carried out. Taking local expectations into account strengthens the effectiveness of its due diligence mechanisms, which helps build a relationship of trust over the long term in areas such as:\n\n- **requirements and obligations arising from public authorities and regulatory and market institutions** (non-financial performance statement, law on the duty of care, Sapin II law, General Data Protection Regulation, the law on combating tax evasion, European taxonomy, Afep-Medef Code, AMF recommendations, etc.);\n- **investors:** the CSR Department, reporting to the Finance Department, works hand-in-hand with the Investor Relations team to integrate the requirements and respond to the expectations and questions sent to the Group;\n- **ESG rating bodies,** with which the Group strengthens its discussions each year in a bid to improve its ESG performance and better meet their expectations. Dialog with these rating bodies enables the Group to identify areas for improvement on ESG aspects, as well as to better understand its sector positioning. The Group Finance Department pays particular attention to this information, which is reported to the various Committees in which the CSR Department is represented each year (see 2023 main results in section 1.1.4.2.2 – Bolloré Group's non-financial performance ratings).\n- **customers** of its business units for whom it undertakes to provide the best quality products and services in compliance with its CSR commitments over its entire value chain (see section 1.2.4.2.3. – Building and maintaining dialog with stakeholders);\n- **suppliers and subcontractors** (see section 2.3.3. Duty of care approach in the supply chain, Group duty of care plan);\n- **local communities** with which the divisions conduct a structured dialog approach (see section 1.2.4.2.3. – Building and maintaining dialog with stakeholders);\n- **major multilateral institutions and agencies** (United Nations Global Compact);\n\n# • **media;**\n\n• associations and NGOs**.**\n\nThe Group also engages in an ongoing dialog with its internal stakeholders, such as employee representative bodies, in order to guarantee and promote a high-quality social dialog over the long term. This deployment occurs within the Group as part of negotiations with employee representatives or in other forms, depending on the laws of each country in the network. The Group's subsidiaries undertake to facilitate the expression of employees in countries where the International labour organization (ILO) conventions on the freedom to organize have not been ratified (see section 1.2.1.2.2. – Promoting social dialog and quality working conditions).\n\nIn 2021 Vivendi worked with a specialized firm to conduct a materiality analysis to measure the expectations of all its stakeholders regarding the CSR issues specific to its activities. The materiality analysis was developed in accordance with the risk universe of the non-financial risk map, after consultations with a sample that includes Vivendi's major stakeholder categories (business partners, authorities, civil society members, talent, employees and management). Nearly 3,300 responses from around 15 countries were analyzed (see section 1 – 1.3 – Ongoing dialog with stakeholders, and section 2 – 2.1 – The process for prioritizing CSR commitments, in Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document).\n\n# **1.1.4.2.2. BOLLORÉ GROUP 2023 NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS**\n\nOver the past three years, the ESG score assigned to the Group by the various bodies has stabilized and increased thanks to:\n\n- clarifications of the CSR strategy through various communication materials (non-financial performance statement, CSR report, charters, etc.);\n- the implementation of more consistent policies and relevant monitoring indicators;\n- more structured dialog between the CSR team and ESG analysts.\n\nESG rating agencies are selected according to several criteria:\n\n- the widespread use of their analyses by investors;\n- the publication of ESG scores on financial platforms;\n- a comprehensive assessment methodology that enables performance to be improved for all ESG aspects.\n\n|              | CDP                                                                                                                | Moody's ESG                                                                                                     | ISS ESG                                                                | Sustainalytics                                                                                                                                                           |\n|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Rating scale | Rating by tier:<br>• D- to D: Disclosure<br>• C- to C: Awareness<br>• B- to B: Management<br>• A- to A: Leadership | Performance level:<br>• Weak (0 to 29)<br>• Limited (30 to 49)<br>• Robust (50 to 59)<br>• Advanced (60 to 100) | ISS ESG Rating:<br>rating scale from 1 (low risk)<br>to 10 (high risk) | Rating scale:<br>• Severe (score above 40)<br>• High (score of 30 to 40)<br>• Medium (score of 20 to 30)<br>• Low (score of 10 to 20)<br>• Negligible (score of 0 to 10) |\n| 2023 rating  | • \"Climate Change\" = B<br>• \"Supplier Engagement\" = A-                                                             | • ESG score = 54/100<br>– Robust level                                                                          | • ISS ESG Rating:<br>– Score = 1 for E and S<br>– Score = 9 for G      | • ESG Score: 12.5 - Low Risk<br>• Sector rank (media): 31st out of 298                                                                                                   |\n\nThe Group's divisions are also regularly called upon by non-financial rating agencies:\n\n- Bolloré Logistics' CSR performance was assessed at Platinum level in 2023 by EcoVadis, which places the division in the top 1% performing companies assessed according to the EcoVadis standard;\n- with regard to industrial activities, the subsidiaries IER and Automatic Systems were awarded the Gold level in 2023 and ranked among the top 5% of companies assessed by the agency.\n- the Bolloré Energy division's performance was also assessed by EcoVadis and awarded a Silver medal in 2023.\n\nIndependently of the Bolloré Group's responses, Vivendi is still committed to communicating transparently with analysts and investors on ESG topics, and also endeavors to respond to the questionnaires from the main ESG rating agencies, in order to enable investors to better understand the Group's profile and the results of the CSR program *Creation for the Future* (see 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 1.3.1. – Constructive dialog with the financial community).\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.1.5. ANALYSIS OF THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE BOLLORÉ GROUP'S ACTIVITIES WITH REGARD TO THE EUROPEAN TAXONOMY**\n\nUnder the European Union's Sustainable Finance Action Plan launched in 2018, European Regulation 2020/852 of June 18, 2020 (the Taxonomy Regulation) introduces a single classification to establish whether an economic activity is environmentally sustainable, the aim being to encourage sustainable investments and redirect capital flows to meet European requirements for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving the climate neutrality target at European level by 2050.\n\nAn economic activity is said to be \"sustainable\", if it contributes substantially to one of the six environmental objectives of the Taxonomy Regulation, does not harm the other five objectives and respects minimum safeguards.\n\nIn accordance with this regulation, for fiscal year 2021, the Bolloré Group was subject to the obligation to publish the share of revenue, capital expenditure (Capex) and operating expenses (Opex) of activities eligible under the two climate objectives. In 2022, the activities defined as eligible were subject to an assessment to determine whether they are aligned with the technical criteria for climate change mitigation, do not cause significant harm to the other five environmental objectives and that they meet minimum safeguards.\n\nOn June 13, 2023, the European Commission published the Delegated Acts relating to the four other environmental objectives (transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and reduction, sustainable use and protection of aquatic and marine resources, protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems). For fiscal year 2023, the disclosure requirements concern the\n\n# **1.1.5.1. METHODOLOGY APPROACH**\n\n# **1.1.5.1.1. IDENTIFICATION OF ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES**\n\nTo meet this new reporting obligation, the Bolloré Group's CSR and Finance departments organized meetings on taxonomy reporting for the third consecutive year, in association with the CSR and Finance departments of each of the divisions and with the support of a specialized firm. The objectives of these meetings were to:\n\n- raise awareness and train the teams on the principle of taxonomy reporting;\n- identify eligible business segments within the meaning of the taxonomy;\n- analyze existing accounting standards and information at Group/division/ entity level;\n- present the technical alignment criteria expected for the main business segments identified as being eligible.\n\nThe identification of eligible business segments was updated in 2023 based on a methodological approach including a detailed analysis of the Group's activities with regard to the eligible economic activities described in the annex to the regulation. Furthermore, as a business activity sold in February 2024, Bolloré Logistics was excluded from taxonomy reporting pursuant to the rules of the European Commission under IFRS 5 (Delegated Act on article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation).\n\nThe eligibility and alignment analysis was conducted at a granular operational level such that there is no risk of double counting within the same taxonomy objective. Activities potentially eligible for several taxonomy objectives have been specifically identified and are presented in the \"Codes\" column of the regulatory tables.\n\nIn summary, the following Bolloré Group activities were considered as eligible:\n\n- at the Industry division, the manufacture of electric vehicles, automotive components and mobility components, high-, medium- and low-voltage electrical equipment for electricity transmission and distribution, research, development and innovation close to the market, electricity storage (identified respectively through activities 3.3, 3.18, 3.20, 9.1 and 4.10 in the annexes to the regulation) in respect of the climate change mitigation objective, as well as the provision of data-based IT/operational solutions through activity 4.1 and the manufacture of plastic packaging through activity 1.1 under the circular economy objective;\n- following the publication of the new activities by the regulation, the Group adopted a new interpretation of eligibility, identifying a more relevant activity concerning the manufacture of plastic packaging 1.1, which replaced activity 3.17 in 2022. As recycled materials, scraps and biosourced\n\neligibility and alignment of activities in respect of the first two environmental objectives as well as eligibility in respect of the four new environmental objectives.\n\nIn addition, the Commission has made targeted amendments to the Delegated Act on the climate component of the EU Taxonomy to extend its scope to economic activities contributing to climate change mitigation or adaptation that had yet to be included, concerning in particular the manufacturing and transport sectors. The Energy, Industry and Communications divisions have all been impacted by these changes.\n\nThe Vivendi group, which represents the Communications sector of the Bolloré Group, is also subject to the application of the Taxonomy Regulation. The results of the work are detailed in Vivendi's Non-Financial performance statement (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2, section 2.4. – European taxonomy).\n\nIn view of the immaterial nature of the alignment rates of investment expenses relating to rights of use published by the Lagardère group for fiscal year 2022 in its Non-Financial performance statement, and considering that the long-term portion of all property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and rights of use prior to January 1, 2022 as immaterial, given the proximity between the date on which Vivendi acquired control and the closing date of the fiscal year, the Lagardère group's sustainable investment expenses were excluded from the calculation of the long-term portion of Vivendi's investment expenses.\n\nor biochemical materials still account for a low share of the activity, the revenue of plastic packaging manufacturing (activity 1.1) has been classified as ineligible;\n\n- at the Energy division, capital expenditure (Capex) related to activities 6.6 and 7.3, respectively road freight transport and the installation, maintenance and repair of equipment promoting energy efficiency under the climate change mitigation objective;\n- for all divisions, individual Capex (activity 7.2) enabling the renovation of existing buildings as part of the climate change mitigation objective;\n- at the Communications Division, Vivendi's activities related to the production, broadcasting, programming of audiovisual content and the promotion of shows and music recordings are considered eligible for the climate change adaptation objective (activities 8.3 \"Programming and broadcasting\", 13.1 \"Creative, artistic and live entertainment activities\" and 13.3 \"Production of cinematographic films, videos and television programs; sound recording and music publishing\", as specified in appendix II of the Climate Delegated Act of June 4, 2021). In 2023, the set-top box rental business was considered as eligible under the circular economy transition objective (activity 5.5 \"Products as services and other circular service models focused on use and results\").\n\nThe following Bolloré Group activities were considered as ineligible:\n\n- under the European taxonomy, the transport of fossil fuels and biofuels cannot be eligible. As Bolloré Energy's economic activities relate to oil logistics and distribution, they do not fall within our scope of analysis for revenue;\n- regarding the Industry division, the production of dielectric films included in the composition of capacitors that can ultimately be used in the batteries of electric vehicles cannot be directly linked to a taxonomy-eligible activity;\n- regarding the FAQ of April 2021, activities in the agricultural sector are excluded. As the economic activities relating to olive groves and vines held by the Bolloré Group relate to this sector, they do not fall within the scope of analysis for revenue. No individually eligible investment expenditure was identified during the analysis;\n- at the Communications division, under current regulations, some Vivendi group activities are not eligible for the taxonomy, chiefly advertising, publishing, video games and magazines. Similarly, the activities of Lagardère Publishing, the Lagardère textbook publishing branch and Lagardère Travel Retail are not considered as eligible.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.1.5.1.2.

The work carried out established that 44% of the revenue generated by the Bolloré Group (including Vivendi) in 2023 is eligible and 1% is aligned under the three objectives of the European taxonomy (climate change mitigation and adaptation and the circular economy). Among the Industry division activities identified as eligible, only revenue related to \"Manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transportation\" (activity 3.3) can be considered as aligned with the climate change mitigation objective.\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\nThrough its clean transport solutions production activities at its subsidiary Blue Solutions, the division is supporting the energy transition by enabling the development of low-carbon transport services. This activity meets the criteria for substantial contribution to the climate change mitigation objective listed in the Delegated Act (see section 1.1.5.2.4. – Compliance with technical review criteria).\n\nRegarding Vivendi, the aligned portion of revenue for activity 8.3 \"Programming and broadcasting\" was determined based on a sample of the number of broadcasting hours of sustainable content relative to the total number of broadcasting hours of live programs. The aligned share of revenue for activity 13.3 \"Production of cinematographic films, videos and television programs; sound recording and music publishing\" was determined based on the amount of investments in \"green\" programs relative to all the investments made for theatrical releases in 2022.\n\nBy way of comparison, the Bolloré Group's consolidated revenue in 2022 amounted to 13,580 million euros (revenue at December 31, 2022 including Communications, restated for Bolloré Logistics). The work carried out in 2022 established that 43% of the revenue generated by the Bolloré Group in 2022 is eligible and 1% aligned under the two environmental objectives of the European taxonomy related to climate change. The slight increase in eligible activities between 2022 and 2023 is explained by the fact that, following the publication of new activities, the Group identified more eligible activities this year and extended the scope of analysis to other divisions of the Group.\n\n# **1.1.5.2.2.

This includes 100% of the Capex related to \"Manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transportation\" (activity 3.3) by the Industry division. Battery and electric vehicle manufacturing activities meet the criteria for a substantial contribution to the climate change mitigation objective listed in the Delegated Act (see section 1.1.5.2.4. – Compliance with technical review criteria).\n\nWith regard to the Communications sector, part of the Capex for three activities was considered to be aligned, namely activities 8.3 \"Programming and broadcasting\", 13.3 \"Production of cinematographic films, videos and television programs; sound recording and music publishing\" and 7.7 \"Acquisition and ownership of buildings\" under the climate change mitigation objective. By way of comparison, the Bolloré Group's consolidated taxonomy Capex at December 31, 2022 amounted to 2,799 million euros (data at December 31, 2022 including Communications, restated for Bolloré Logistics). The work carried out in 2022 identified that 77% of the Bolloré Group's Capex was eligible and 2% of eligible Capex was aligned with climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives. The increase in eligible Capex between 2022 and 2023 is explained by the fact that, following the publication of new activities, the Group identified more individually eligible Capex this year and extended the scope of analysis to other Group divisions.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.1.5.2.3. BREAKDOWN OF OPERATING INVESTMENTS (OPEX) FOR THE 2023 FISCAL YEAR**\n\nIn fiscal 2023, operating expenses (Opex), as defined by the Taxonomy, represented 332 million euros, i.e. less than 10% of the Bolloré Group's total consolidated operating expenses (including Communications). Given the expense items covered (the sum of unfunded research and development costs, building renovation costs, short-term leases and asset maintenance\n\n# **1.1.5.2.4. COMPLIANCE WITH TECHNICAL EXAMINATION CRITERIA**\n\nAt workshops organized in the second half of the year, the CSR and Finance Departments of each of the divisions determined the substantial contribution to the six objectives of the taxonomy for each activity identified as eligible and took stock of the existing policies and assessment processes that meet the DNSH criteria.\n\n# Substantial contribution criteria\n\nRegarding substantial contribution criteria, the eligible activities of the Bolloré Group contribute substantially to the objectives of climate change mitigation and adaptation through the following activities:\n\n- Activity 3.3 \"Manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transportation\": in accordance with the analysis carried out for alignment, the Bolloré Group considered that, through its clean transport solutions production activities at its subsidiary Bluebus, the division supports the energy transition by enabling the development of low-carbon transportation services offers and thus complies with the criteria for a substantial contribution to the climate change mitigation objective listed in the Delegated Act.\n- Activities 8.3, 13.3, \"Programming and broadcasting\" and \"Production of cinematographic films, videos and television programs; sound recording and music publishing\" respectively: in accordance with the analysis carried out for alignment, the Bolloré Group considered that, through its programming, creation, production and distribution activities at its Communications division, it raises awareness of climate change and its consequences through the development of sustainable program offers. Some content contributes to efforts to adapt other activities or other populations by raising awareness of climate change and its consequences.\n- Activity 7.7 \"Acquisition and ownership of buildings\": a review of compliance with the criteria on the substantial contribution of activity 7.7 \"Acquisition and ownership of buildings\" was carried out for the new office sites, based on the energy performance of the buildings according to the date of construction (energy performance certificate of at least class A or within the threshold of the top 15% of assets by country and according to the nominal capacity of the heating, ventilation or air conditioning equipment of the premises). These analyses revealed that the Bolloré Group complies with the criteria for a substantial contribution to the climate change mitigation objective listed in the Delegated Act.\n\n# Principle of not causing significant harm (DNSH)\n\n#### 1. **Climate change adaptation**\n\nThe Bolloré Group has assessed the exposure of all its eligible activities to physical climate risks according to two global warming scenarios (RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 of the IPCC) by 2030 and 2050.\n\nVivendi has conducted a map of physical climate risks covering all its activities, in particular capital expenditure (Capex) on real estate (economic activity 7.7).\n\nand repair costs), this indicator is not material in relation to the Group's activities and no eligibility or alignment analysis has been carried out. For the regulatory details of the key performance indicators by activity including the Communications sector, see section 1.1.5.2.6. – Details of key performance indicators – Regulatory tables.\n\nExamination of compliance with DNSH for activities 8.3 \"Programming and broadcasting\" and 13.3 \"Production of cinematographic films, videos and television programs; sound recording and music publishing\" was conducted via the mapping of physical climate risks carried out by the Vivendi group and the implementation of adaptation solutions, in accordance with the recommendations of the TCFD (TaskForce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures).\n\nBased on this mapping, the Vivendi group deploys appropriate adaptation solutions for each site, depending on the extent of the risks identified and the location of the asset in question.\n\nThe analysis of physical climate risks with respect to activity 3.3 \"Manufacture of low-carbon technologies for transportation\" did not reveal any\n\nabsolute exposure to physical risks at Bolloré Bretagne by 2050 (RCP 8.5). The Bolloré Group has therefore responded to the DNSH adaptation for all its aligned activities.\n\n#### 2. **Sustainable use and protection of hydrological and marine resources**\n\nAt the Industry division, an environmental impact assessment was carried out for all eligible battery and electric vehicle production sites (activities 3.3) to identify the risks related to the preservation of water quality and the prevention of water stress. Water pollution risk is a key risk identified for the division and is subject to specific mitigation measures (see section 1.2.3.2.2. – Preventing local pollution risks and industrial accidents).\n\n#### 3. **Transition to a circular economy**\n\nAt the Industry division, waste generated by eligible battery and electric vehicle production activities (activity 3.3) is managed by the sites in accordance with a formally drafted management plan. As part of an ecodesign approach, environmental assessments such as life cycle assessment, governed by ISO 14040, have been carried out since 2013 on Bluebuses (see section 1.2.3.2.3. – Optimizing waste management and promoting the circular economy).\n\n#### 4. **Pollution prevention and reduction**\n\nIn accordance with annex C, the Industry division's eligible electric vehicle production activities (activity 3.3) do not lead to the manufacture, marketing or use of the substances listed in the regulation and therefore meet the criterion of Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) to pollution prevention and control.\n\n#### 5. **Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems**\n\nIn accordance with annex D, all eligible electric vehicle manufacturing sites (activity 3.3) conducted an environmental impact study or impact assessment to assess the likely adverse impacts on biodiversity, particularly on protected species and habitats, as part of the facility authorization process. Where appropriate, these studies include measures to avoid, reduce and compensate for adverse environmental impacts and a description of alternative solutions.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.1.5.2.5. COMPLIANCE WITH MINIMUM SAFEGUARDS**\n\nAs part of taxonomy reporting, the Group's compliance with minimum safeguards is based on the analysis and verification of the due diligence process implemented to prevent, address and remedy human rights violations committed in connection with its own operations or activities that are part of its value chain.\n\nThe four key topics listed in the OECD guidelines, namely: bribery/corruption, human rights including workers' rights, fair competition, and taxation, have been targeted in the compliance analysis. The items mentioned in various international standards were summarized in an analysis grid to verify the Bolloré Group's compliance with each of the points required under the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nThe analysis shows that the ethical measures implemented by the Group comply with the criteria set in the most stringent standards:\n\n- human rights: the Group has established due diligence processes based on a process of mapping and identifying human rights issues (see section 1.2.2.2. – Promoting human rights in our value chain);\n- fair competition: the rules of competition law defined by States, the European Union and all international organizations apply to all Bolloré Group companies. Compliance with competition rules is enshrined in the Group's Code of Conduct and applies to all its employees and partners (see section 1.2.2.1. – Sharing the same business ethics and ensuring compliance with the strictest standards);\n- anticorruption programs: the Group's commitment is reflected in its zero tolerance policy for corruption risk (see section 1.2.2.1. – Sharing the same business ethics and ensuring compliance with the strictest standards);\n- taxation: to ensure compliance with the tax rules applicable in the countries where the Group operates, legal and tax teams are deployed centrally and locally to monitor the conduct required to comply with these rules. Compliance with these rules is set out in the Group's Code of Conduct to raise the awareness of all employees and business partners (see section 1.2.2.1.3. – The fight against tax evasion).\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.1.5.2.6.

Four key pillars of a sustainable commitment**\n\nWithin its four strategic areas of commitment, the Bolloré Group integrates all the resources implemented to manage its priority non-financial risks and seize opportunities. It therefore promotes, in all of its divisions, the implementation of virtuous and vigilant approaches to ensure that the policies, processes and improvement plans in place ensure its long-term nonfinancial performance. The Bolloré Group's management of priority risks is explained below.\n\nThe description of the Group's commitments provides summary details of Vivendi's policies, which mainly correspond to the Bolloré Group's Communications sector. However, the quantified indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding Vivendi. Consolidated Group data including Vivendi are presented, where available, in the social indicator summary tables (see section 1.3.1. – Summary tables of social indicators). Comprehensive information on Vivendi's policies and action plans is available in Vivendi's nonfinancial performance statement.\n\n# **1.2.1. UNITING AND PROTECTING PEOPLE, THE COMPANY'S GREATEST STRENGTH**\n\nThe Bolloré Group's activities are particularly exposed to the risk of workplace accidents. Accordingly, the health and safety of employees, subcontractors, and all persons indirectly exposed to the Group's activities is a major priority. In addition, the Group strives to be a leading employer, placing employee commitment and skills at the heart of its performance, by implementing specific actions to recruit the talent of the future in its various core businesses.\n\n# **1.2.1.1. PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND ENSURING THE SAFETY OF THE WOMEN AND MEN EXPOSED AS PART OF OUR ACTIVITIES**\n\n# **1.2.1.1.1. THE HEALTH AND SAFETY RISKS OF EMPLOYEES AND THIRD PARTIES**\n\n# Health and safety of employees and third parties(1)\n\n# *Prioritization of risks related to the health and safety of employees and third parties*\n\n| Transportation and logistics | Oil logistics  | Industry |       |         | Communications |\n|------------------------------|----------------|----------|-------|---------|----------------|\n| Bolloré Logistics            | Bolloré Energy | Blue     | Films | Systems | Vivendi        |\n\n(1) Priority non-financial risk.\n\nIn blue: priority non-financial risk at the division level.\n\nTransportation and logistics and industrial activities operate in environments with potentially high risks of accidents, and call for specific vigilance depending on the region. The issue is particularly material with regard to industrial activities, such as handling, production and assembly, construction, freight and passenger transport, and the handling and transportation of hazardous goods. As for its employees, one of the Bolloré Group's priority risks is ensuring the health and safety of partners and subcontractors working on its sites, as well as local communities which could be impacted by its activities. The risks relating to the safety of third parties in the context of freight and passenger transport operations are particularly material. For Vivendi, these risks materialize in limited activities (production, logistics related to the printing and distribution of books) or in connection with employees' travel abroad. The management of the priority CSR risks identified for Vivendi is explained in chapter 2 – Non-financial performance in Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document: Occupational health and safety risks for employees (see sections 4.3.1. – Improving quality of life at work and adapting to new working methods and Preserving health, safety and well-being at work and section 4.3.1.1. – Recognizing talent and growing together), and risks related to the health and safety of customers and users of products and services (see sections 1.3.2. – Listening to customers, 4.2.3. – Encouraging responsible content, 4.2.3.3. – Providing a protected environment to ensure a safe entertainment experience, and 4.3.3.3. – Simplifying customer engagement).\n\n# **1.2.1.1.2. LEADING MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THIRD PARTIES**\n\n# Group policy\n\nThe Group implements management systems based on recognized standards such as ISO 45001 on occupational health and safety management in all of its activities and locations. The implementation of these management systems ensures that the health and safety of Group employees is taken into account on a daily basis within a virtuous duty of care cycle, framed by appropriate policies and procedures to control this risk (see section 2 – Bolloré Group's duty of care plan). The Group is committed to investing in the prevention of workplace hazards and accidents, to improving working conditions and to training and raising awareness among its employees and stakeholders working on-site (e.g. subcontractors, external companies, partners, suppliers, customers, etc.).\n\nThe QHSE (Quality, Hygiene, Safety, Environment) Department of each division occupies a predominant place within the organizations and its main tasks are to:\n\n- coordinate, design, review and manage the continued improvement and service quality programs;\n- accompany development of the HSE culture and best practices, and;\n- guarantee maintenance of business line certifications leading to improved performances and a measure of confidence for customers.\n\nThe performance of QHSE policies is supervised by the Executive management teams of each division, which ensure that the resources required to implement, maintain and continually improve their QHSE management system are available. They set the objectives at their level, monitor application of action plans and ensure that any discrepancies are corrected through the analysis of incidents/accidents, audits, inspections and performance analysis to measure the efficiency of the QHSE management system.\n\nThe rules with which subcontractors must comply are also established and are subject to specific contractual requirements.\n\n# Objectives and progress\n\nTo standardize the divisions' policies, monitoring indicators and the implementation of targets at Group level, a set of indicators relating to employee and third party health and safety risk, shared by all divisions (excluding Vivendi) has been implemented since 2019 (see table – Indicators on the rollout of the Bolloré Group's HSE management system). This work was further reinforced by the setting of reasonable targets, validated in early 2021 by Executive management (members of the Ethics – CSR and Anti-Ccorruption Committee), and presented in the following table.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Area of action                                                                                                                                   | Group objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Horizon             | Progress at 12/31/2023                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Commitment by senior<br>management to monitor<br>the Group's performance<br>to ensure the health<br>and safety of employees<br>and third parties | • 100% of legal entities included in the CSR<br>reporting scope(1) monitor their HSE<br>performance annually in the Management<br>Committee, Executive Committee or Board<br>of Directors meetings                                     | Renewed<br>in 2023* | 90% of entities state that they monitor HSE<br>performance at Management Committee,<br>Executive Committee or Board of Directors'<br>meetings                                                                |\n| Implementation of<br>occupational health and<br>safety management systems                                                                        | • 100% of the workforce in the CSR reporting<br>scope(1) covered by a health and safety<br>management system                                                                                                                           | Renewed<br>in 2023* | 97% of the headcount in the CSR reporting<br>scope covered by a health, safety and<br>environmental (HSE) management system                                                                                  |\n| Certification                                                                                                                                    | • 70% of entities covered by an HSE<br>management system have at least one site<br>with health and safety certification under<br>one of the following standards: ISO 45001<br>or OHSAS 18001, SQAS, ICMI, ISPS, TAPA FSR,<br>ISO 22000 | Renewed<br>in 2023* | 82% of entities covered by an HSE management<br>system have at least one site with health and<br>safety certification under one of the following<br>standards: ISO 45001, SQAS, ICMI, TAPA FSR,<br>ISO 22000 |\n\n(1) See section 1.3.2.1. – CSR reporting methodology note.\n\n\\* The 2022 targets were renewed in 2023 due to two significant disposal projects and anticipated work related to the CSRD in 2024.\n\n# Health and safety management systems adapted to the specific requirements of each business\n\nIn response to the issues raised by their operation in several territories, the QHSE management systems first of all comply with the applicable legal and regulatory requirements and may be reinforced with regard to the risks specific to each activity.\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\n# Bolloré Logistics\n\nIn 2020, Bolloré Logistics obtained triple multi-site Integrated Management System (IMS) certification, bringing together all occupational health and safety, quality management, and environmental standards (ISO 45001, ISO 9001, and ISO 14001 respectively). Issued by Bureau Veritas, this certification covers entities located in the Europe, Americas, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and South Asia regions. Some 300 sites in over 54 countries were covered by the triple certification in 2023. The aim of this certification is to harmonize the network's current procedures at the global level. It will enable Bolloré Logistics to continue rolling out common operational processes to meet its customers' requirements and improve its management methods and tools to move towards greater performance.\n\nBolloré Logistics implements a QHSE management system at all its entities, all of which are ISO 45001 certified.\n\nIn addition, the QHSE Corporate Department continued to support the use of B'Excellent, its steering platform dedicated to quality, health, safety, security and environment activities, which was launched in 2019. The platform is intended for the QHSE network as well as all managers. It provides for improved control of the management of HSE activities, data management thanks to various dashboards (HSE reporting, incident recording and monitoring, progress with the action plan, inspection schedules and implementation, business continuity plans, etc.), and the analysis of the QHSE performance of Bolloré Logistics entities worldwide.\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n# Bolloré Energy\n\nAt Bolloré Energy, the health, safety and environment policy, which was updated in 2019, covers the risks associated with occupational health and safety issues. Bolloré Energy puts all its efforts into meeting the expectations of its customers. It has compiled a database of best practices to manage occupational health and safety risks, particularly in transport, in the context of the delivery of its products and services to individuals. In addition, an HSE Management Committee meets once a month. Since 2021, to centralize the process for identifying workplace accidents, an online workplace accident reporting tool has been put in place, making the data more reliable. Note that Seveso sites are subject to specific and particularly strict health and safety rules and are subject to inspections by France's regional environmental, planning and housing agency (DREAL), The high thresholds are checked each year and the low thresholds every three years. Every five years, regulatory inspections are carried out on sites classified as ICPE (facilities classified for environmental protection). These accounted for 25 inspections at Bolloré Energy sites in 2023.\n\n# **• Industry**\n\n#### Blue and Films\n\nAll of Blue's subsidiaries and the Films packaging activities apply health and safety policies specific to their industrial activities. They are implemented through improvement programs presented and validated by the employee representative bodies each year. The plastic packaging films production site is certified BRC and ISO 22000, ensuring the safety of food packaging. Blue Solutions' battery production sites are certified according to the IATF 16949:2016 automotive quality management standard, reinforcing safety, traceability and the technical specifications required for automotive production. Finally, the activities of the Blue and Film divisions are certified 9001:2015.\n\nAll sites have a system that implements ISO 45001 principles, although the need to commit to a formal certification process has not been identified for the entities at this time.\n\nIn addition, safety tours are carried out on the Industry sector scope by specially trained managers. In 2023, 100 safety tours were conducted within the Films division, 125 within Blue Solutions and 50 within Bluebus.\n\n## Systems\n\nIER and Automatic Systems (Systems entities), cover the occupational health and safety issues of employees and third parties, deploy a HSE management system and are subject to evaluation audits. The HSE management system includes:\n\n- publication of documentation: the single health and safety document, risk prevention program, improvement of working conditions, safety instructions and sheets, etc.;\n- raising awareness and training on the prevention of risks to which employees are exposed: electricity certification, manual handling, chemical risk, etc.;\n- systematic analysis of the causes of workplace accidents at all sites, and;\n- the implementation of action plans and proposals for corrective action, and publication for stakeholders. Occupational health and safety actions are formalized in a general action plan that is continuously monitored, which gives rise to an annual assessment validated by the employee representative bodies (CSE).\n\nIn addition, the after-sales/worksite Department of Automatic Systems Belgium has been VCA certified (Belgian health, safety and environmental certification) since 2008, giving it the means to control the safety risks it encounters at each new facility or intervention site (maintenance, repair). The ISO 14001 and VCA certifications were renewed in 2023 following the audits carried out on the of Automatic Systems Belgium scope in 2022.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n# *HSE management system rollout indicators(1) at the Bolloré Group(2)*\n\n| (as a percentage)                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Bolloré Logistics | Bolloré Energy | Industry | Others | 2023 Total | 2022 Total* |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------|--------|------------|-------------|\n| Proportion of employees covered<br>by an HSE management system(2)                                                                                                                                                    | 100               | 92             | 83       | 85     | 97         | 98          |\n| Proportion of entities having installed<br>an HSE management system(2)                                                                                                                                               | 96                | 25             | 80       | 33     | 87         | 97          |\n| Proportion of entities having<br>undergone a QHSE audit                                                                                                                                                              | 83                | 50             | 80       | 0      | 77         | 80          |\n| Proportion of entities having at least one site<br>with health and safety certification by at least<br>one of the following standards: ISO 45001<br>SQAS, ICMI, ISPS, TAPA FSR, ISO 22000 or<br>Pedestrian Free Yard | 100               | 50             | 100      | 0      | 98         | 75          |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from CSR reporting (see section 1.3.2.1. – CSR reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding Vivendi.

PREVENTING ACCIDENTS AND OCCUPATIONAL RISKS AND IMPROVING WORKING CONDITIONS**\n\n# Group policy\n\nObjectives and progress\n\nWithin the context of the QHSE management systems, occupational risks related to Group activities and business lines are subject to specific health and safety analyses. As such, the entities regularly update their occupational risk mapping, in close collaboration with local managers, social partners, occupational physicians and other stakeholders.\n\nBased on these findings, ergonomic principles and risk mitigation techniques are then implemented. Regular audits and the incident and accident analysis implemented by Group entities lead to improvement plans incorporating preventive and corrective measures. Each entity identifies and naturally\n\n# complies with the applicable external requirements, be they regulations or contractual clauses. Visits to workstations make it possible to assess occupational risks in collaboration with the occupational health teams. External companies that have to carry out work regularly on site are subject to prevention plans and work permits with the aim of guaranteeing the protection of workers and communities in terms of health and safety. Health and safety audits and inspections are conducted internally to reinforce prevention through regular monitoring of sites, facilities and equipment and by external inspection bodies for facilities and equipment subject to a regulatory audit requirement.\n\n| Area of action                                                                        | Group objectives

2024.\n\n# Preventing accidents and occupational risks and improving working conditions in the Group's activities\n\nWithin each division, the occupations and workstations, which are sometimes extremely specialized and high-risk, are analyzed to prevent occupational risks and accidents and optimize working conditions for our employees. In the Transportation and logistics business, appropriate policies are implemented, monitored, and regularly reviewed to prevent major risks (e.g., general driving rules, drugs and alcohol policy, etc.). Employees such as forklift operators, locomotive drivers and drivers of specialized vehicles (identified as the business lines most at risk) undergo routine testing for at-risk behavior stemming from the use of medication, drugs or alcohol prior to taking up their position.\n\nAwareness-raising initiatives and health and safety policies are adapted to each activity and region, mainly focused on the professional risks associated with handling, storage and transportation operations, taking into account the task, workload, physical effort, the working environment, and individual suitability. Ergonomics rules and risk reduction methods are implemented and specific measures are required to adapt to the health and safety issues associated with each activity.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\n#### Bolloré Logistics\n\nAt Bolloré Logistics, the main professional risks relate to handling, storage and transport operations. As such, operators are trained in the right actions and postures before carrying out manual handling operations, and their training is renewed as often as necessary. Any accidental event is recorded in a database in order to learn from it, be able to trace it, and to summarize all the corrective actions implemented (training/information, review of procedures, changes to working methods or equipment, etc.). In 2023, approximately 13,100 HSE audits and inspections were conducted in the Bolloré Logistics network. This year, a health and safety event was organized by the Bolloré Logistics Corporate QHSE Department. The \"Go Safe\" challenge was an opportunity to highlight the various initiatives implemented by the division's sites to prevent risks and improve working conditions while mobilizing managers and employees. More than 200 initiatives, including numerous collaborative actions, have been launched:\n\n- 44% relate to health and safety training and awareness;\n- 26% cover measures to reduce occupational risks, and;\n- 14% are linked to fostering a health and safety culture.\n\nFurthermore, these initiatives are shared across the network and the best of them were rewarded at the end of 2023.\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n#### Bolloré Energy\n\nIt should be noted that the main accident risks in Oil logistics activities pertain to transportation linked to the distribution of petroleum products. The flammability of heating oil and diesel is triggered at very high temperatures (over 65 °C), which is why the main accident prevention actions focus on mitigating fire risks.\n\nA major accident prevention policy, updated in 2022, is in place on the most at-risk sites of Bolloré Energy, helping to protect employees, third parties (subcontractors and temporary workers on-site) and customers. The main risks identified are fire risks, road traffic risks and risks associated with gestures and postures, various corrective and mitigation measures are implemented such as:\n\n- regular fire prevention exercises carried out to avoid possible emergency situations (for example, a fire at the loading station). Nine exercises were carried out in 2023;\n- creation of a fire defense plan at distribution network depots;\n- improved safety for the delivery and unloading of additives, hazardous oil products: Bolloré Energy installs new dedicated tanks every year;\n- appointment of a heating services controller and a heating services technical trainer to support our technicians in this activity, which involves a range of specific risks (use of cutting tools, chemicals, etc.);\n- annual employee training (e-learning, seminars, etc.) on various topics: occupational health and safety, chemical risks, prevention of risks related to the transportation of dangerous goods by road (ADR, FCO, road safety training), etc.;\n- an online ordering platform for protective equipment specially designed to be adapted to the business lines was set up in 2020 and updated in 2022 to include new equipment, and;\n- the deployment of prevention plans (information on the site risks in view of the work to be carried out) and, potentially, the issuing of a fire permit to prevent risks for external companies.\n\n# **• Industry**\n\n#### Blue and Films\n\nThe occupational risks identified at industrial sites include chemical risks, moving machine risks, cutting risks (cutting machinery, blades), electrical risks, and the risks involved with heavy parts (lifting means).\n\nAmong the flagship accident prevention initiatives, the industrial sites have put in place systems allowing staff to make suggestions to involve teams more in risk prevention and launch actions to improve safety at workstations.\n\nThe French sites have adopted a policy for the prevention of arduous working conditions through commitments and actions incorporated in the occupational risk prevention process, in collaboration with the company physician. All arduous factors have been analyzed since July 2016, beyond the legal obligation. Shift work, which is inherent to the activity, is the only issue that cannot be addressed by prevention. That is why, since 2016, people who have worked shifts for most of their careers have benefited from an early retirement plan to compensate for the fact that the personal hardship account (additional time deposited in the time savings account) does not apply retroactively.\n\nOther specific measures to prevent accidents were implemented in 2023. Blue Solutions made several investments, including:\n\n- new purchases of personal protective equipment (PPE) adapted to the chemicals used in the new-generation batteries (Gen4);\n- purchases of filtration hoods for the R&D teams\n\nThe Bluebus division continued its study to improve load bearing, with a conclusive trial of a neck support system. It implemented various measures, including a fall arrest system for operators (protective barrier, secure ladder), and updated the organization of its internal fire teams.\n\nIn the Films division, various studies aimed at improving the risks associated with carrying loads were also rolled out in 2023. The sites also implemented measures to prevent the risk of falls and to prevent the risk of electrocution and fire on production equipment.\n\nIn 2023, accident prevention was illustrated by specific training initiatives (see 1.2.1.1.4. Informing, training and raising awareness).\n\n#### *LMP® battery safety*\n\nThe issues of exposure to and handling of hazardous products are identified in the context of lithium battery production. While lithium is not toxic, it can be dangerous due to its corrosive and flammable nature. The design of the facilities (e.g. dry air conditioning in the workshops), fire risk prevention measures, operating instructions, staff training and personal protective equipment are all adapted to the specific risks of lithium metal.\n\nBlue Solutions specializes in \"solid-state\" battery technology. In the event of piercing, there is no release of hazardous liquids or formation of explosive atmospheres in a confined environment. LMP<sup>®</sup> batteries are exempt from SVHC (substance of Very High Concern) rules under the European REACH regulation and CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction) rules under the CLP regulation.\n\n#### Systems\n\nIER, a Systems division subsidiary, is engaged in a professional risk prevention process, in close collaboration with social partners, members of Occupational Health and Safety Committees (CSSCT), and occupational health and other stakeholders. The main risks identified are those caused by handling activities and by the carrying of loads. To prevent risks, the locations of the production and storage lines of IER, Automatic Systems and EASIER plants have been optimized for processes such as those implemented in Besançon since 2017 which have reduced the probability of occurrence of occupational diseases such as musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in general. Health, safety and working condition improvement plans are monitored with year-end completion rates of more than 80%. Entities in the Systems division are organizing initiatives specifically dedicated to improving working conditions and employee well-being. For example, in 2022 IER undertook a diagnostic of psychosocial risks with the aim of improving quality of life and working conditions. After this diagnostic, actions were taken to limit the risks identified.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Preventing health and safety risks to third parties (subcontractors and neighboring communities)\n\n# **Subcontractors**\n\nEmployees of subcontracting companies are bound by the same requirement criteria as the standards applied to Group employees. They are subject to the same health and safety analysis and performance indicators, whether these arise from regulations or contractual clauses. Risks linked to concurrent activities with external companies are also analyzed and specific prevention and protection measures are identified. The issue is addressed at weekly meetings of the Ethics and Compliance Committee of the Transportation and logistics division, composed of Executive Committee members.\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\n#### Bolloré Logistics\n\nFor Bolloré Logistics, a subcontractor management process is established to ensure a high level of HSE quality. This process leads to the accreditation, selection and monitoring of subcontractors.\n\nIn 2023, approximately 342 HSE audits and inspections were conducted with Bolloré Logistics' subcontractors.\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n# Bolloré Energy\n\nBolloré Energy relies on its major accident prevention policy to mitigate and manage health and safety risks that could apply to third parties. This policy is subject to strict processes conforming to recognized standards (Seveso, ICPE, ISO 14001 and ADR [European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road]).\n\n#### *The Bolloré(2) Group's accident rate indicators(1)*\n\n# **• Industry**\n\n#### Blue and Films\n\nThe Industrial entities make very little use of subcontractors. The third-party workers that could be impacted by the health and safety issues relating to bus, plastic film or battery production activities are temporary workers. Accident monitoring has been implemented, and there were no accidents in this category in 2023.\n\n## **Neighboring communities**\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n# Bolloré Energy\n\nAs part of the identification of major accident risks that might have an impact on neighboring communities, only Seveso sites could be concerned. As a result, these sites are subject to appropriate and specific monitoring of the potential issues identified: 100% of Seveso sites are covered by a major risks prevention policy. In this respect, special intervention plans (PPIs) are drawn up by the departmental prefect, in collaboration with Bolloré Energy. These plans set forth the appropriate measures to deal with the consequences for the local community if an accident occurred at a site posing a technological risk. In 2023, three Seveso depots were covered.\n\nBolloré Energy's oil depots are not located in areas with high population density. Local residents in the area are still informed of the risks associated with oil depots through several information and awareness-raising actions.\n\nIt should also be noted that all Bolloré Energy sites are self-sufficient in mitigating fire risks, with appropriate equipment and processes. Ten internal health and safety audits were carried out on Bolloré Energy's activities in 2023.\n\n|                                                          | 2023 | Of which<br>Bolloré Logistics | 2022* |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------|-------------------------------|-------|\n| Number of workplace accidents with lost-time             | 155  | 75                            | 137   |\n| Lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) (x 1,000,000)(3) | 4.87 | 2.80                          | 4.33  |\n| Lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) (x 200,000)(4)   | 0.97 | 0.56                          | 0.87  |\n| Severity rate of workplace accidents (x 1,000)(5)        | 0.15 | 0.10                          | 0.16  |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from social reporting (see section 1.3.1.1. – Social reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding Vivendi.

Subcontracting companies must also ensure that their staff are qualified and certified to perform the requested tasks. With respect to daily operations, the teams remind subcontractors of the basic safety rules for dayto-day operations (e.g. handling heavy loads, hazardous products, transportation and traffic regulations).\n\n# Objectives and progress\n\n| Area of action                                      | Group objectives                                                                                                                                            | Horizon                       | Progress at 12/31/2023                                                                                                                                         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| HSE training for<br>employees and<br>subcontractors | • Monitoring of the number of HSE training<br>hours by QHSE and/or HR                                                                                       | Annual                        |                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Informing and<br>raising employee<br>awareness      | • Display of HSE policy on the premises<br>by 100% of the legal entities included<br>in the CSR reporting scope(1)<br>• Mandatory information for newcomers | 2022 carried<br>over to 2023* | • Reported methods used to communicate<br>on the HSE policy:<br>• 94% of entities report posting it on the premises<br>• 86% report that they inform newcomers |\n\n(1) See section 1.3.2.1. – CSR reporting methodology note.\n\n\\* The 2022 targets were renewed in 2023 due to two significant disposal projects and anticipated work related to the CSRD in 2024.\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Training adapted for each activity\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\n#### Bolloré Logistics\n\nIn Bolloré Logistics entities, training and awareness programs adapted to the nature of the activities carried out (training in PPE, hazardous substances, fire-fighting, work at height, etc.), take various forms:\n\n- \"15-minute safety\" sessions or \"talks\" provided to small groups of employees in the field. They instill dialog with employees through a set of questions and answers and encourage the feedback of information from the field that could lead to the implementation of areas for improvement (e.g. modification of traffic flows or identification of hazardous zones, etc.);\n- regular on-site HSE meetings at which key messages are provided to participants or safety moments are organized.\n\nNew employees receive training in the main health, safety and environment rules to be controlled within the framework of their working environment (governance and QHSE actors, risks and precautions related to manual handling, driving forklifts, handling and storing hazardous goods, organizing fire rescue, etc.).\n\nEvery year, Bolloré Logistics publishes a QHSE review covering all of the operational challenges and issues (KPIs, certification, specific actions deployed on sites, projects, etc.).\n\nIn 2023, three hours of training and information on average were provided per employee.\n\n#### *World Day for Safety and Health at Work 2023*\n\nThe Transportation and logistics division and its subsidiaries observed World Day for Safety and Health at Work, like every year, by organizing events and activities around the world to promote safety and the prevention of workplace accidents and occupational diseases.\n\nThis year, the Bolloré Group wanted to focus on the theme \"a safe and healthy working environment\".\n\nBolloré Logistics employees came together around the world and several initiatives were carried out, including:\n\n- sessions to raise awareness and prevent occupational risks and share best practices;\n- emergency drills such as first aid procedures, chemical spills, use of fire safety equipment, fire/emergency evacuation exercises, etc.;\n- preventive actions to promote occupational health, notably through fun games (such as \"find the mistake\");\n- health check-ups.\n\nThis event, which brought together more than 4,600 employees around the world in the Bolloré Logistics scope, also reminded everyone of the Bolloré Group's values and health and safety culture.\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n#### Bolloré Energy\n\nAt Bolloré Energy, awareness-raising initiatives on health and safety risk prevention related to the environment were also organized within the framework of ISO 14001 and new arrivals systematically receive training. In addition, extensive training plans are regularly organized for employees and third-party companies working on site (e.g. external drivers loading vehicles at Bolloré Energy sites).\n\nIn 2023, the following were organized:\n\n• initiatives on the prevention of chemical risk (e-learning module) and the launch of a new platform for ordering protective equipment;\n\n- prevention actions related to well-being at work and stress management for employees and managers (e-learning), and;\n- training in rational and preventive driving.\n\nIn 2020 a prevention and safety program was launched for delivery drivers (practical preventive driving exercises, intervention techniques for delivery incidents, or in the event of a fire). Developed with the Association for Prevention in the Transport of Hydrocarbons, this program enabled 38 drivers to be trained in 2023. Training will continue in 2024.\n\nSpecial training is offered to temporary workers and some suppliers for carriers that load on site because there is a safety protocol and a specific delivery procedure that must be followed. All carriers of hazardous materials are required to abide by the Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR) for road transport. This training, received by all Bolloré Energy service providers, refers to all the provisions that road carriers must apply to prevent risks related to the transport of hazardous materials.\n\nAlthough there is not yet any comprehensive tracking of the HSE training completed by subcontractors at the level of the Bolloré Energy division, it should be noted that all carriers working at Seveso sites must undergo safety-related training.\n\n# **• Industry**\n\nAll entities involved in Industry activities display their health and safety policy on site and systematically inform new arrivals of the rules for preventing health and safety risks.\n\n#### Blue and Films\n\nA large number of health and safety training courses are provided to train employees and new recruits: first aid at work training and refresher courses; explosive atmospheres (Atex) training; manual handling; correct posture and movement; laser or radiological risks; fire training (first and second responders); product emergency intervention (Blue Solutions); and electricity certification.\n\nSpecialized training was provided in 2023: conducting safety inspections, ergonomics of production workstations, movements and posture, management of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), chemical risks, harassment officers, and addiction prevention.\n\nIn addition, emergency training (evacuation, fire, accidental spills, etc.) is carried out every year through crisis management exercises at the various sites, in particular with the internal response teams as part of their training.\n\n#### Systems\n\nThe IER and Automatic Systems France entities also inform all new hires of environmental risks (chemicals, ecofriendly actions, waste sorting, etc.) at their workplaces, through e-learning courses. In addition, the chemical risk prevention program, initiated in 2013, is rooted in the day-to-day life of IER to manage the introduction of hazardous products at the company with regard to the product safety sheet and to implement adequate awareness for employees for their use and storage.\n\nFurthermore, as part of awareness-raising on occupational health and safety, all managers in the Systems division received training on psychosocial risks in 2023.\n\nFor subcontractors, the prevention plan signed by both parties covers the subjects of online training and includes risk identification. Further training is provided in small groups if specific needs are identified.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n# *Health, safety and/or environment (HSE) training indicators at the Bolloré Group(1)*\n\n|                                                                                             | 2023              |                |          |        |            |        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------|--------|------------|--------|\n|                                                                                             | Bolloré Logistics | Bolloré Energy | Industry | Others | 2023 Total | 2022*  |\n| Number of hours of training<br>on the topics of health, safety<br>and/or the environment(2) | 53,781            | 10,567         | 10,397   | 1,475  | 76,220     | 59,918 |\n| HSE training hours for subcontractors(3)                                                    | 1,300             | –              | –        | –      | 1,300      | 11,300 |\n\n(1) These indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding Vivendi.

PROTECTING HEALTH**\n\nThe Bolloré Group protects its employees from physical and mental harm. The Group's occupational health objectives are as follows:\n\n- protecting the health of everyone in the workplace;\n- providing a framework to identify and minimize health risks;\n- reducing health risks related to our activities, and;\n- complying with all regulatory and legal requirements.\n\nThe health of employees is assessed and monitored through several actions: • pre-employment medical check-up;\n\n- \n- increased monitoring of staff potentially exposed to high risks, and;\n\n• immunization or disease prevention programs, where necessary. The Bolloré Group also offers effective welfare protection. It is reflected in the implementation of programs to access care and prevention according to the location of its activities.\n\nNearly 92% of Bolloré Group entities offer more favorable health coverage than required by legal obligations and local practice in the countries in which it operates. Protecting human capital is a real growth and recognition challenge for the Bolloré Group which is therefore committed to providing its employees with high-end guarantees in terms of social protection.\n\nWhen local health services are deemed inadequate or too far from operational sites, the divisions and subsidiaries implement the necessary resources (medical centers, medical personnel, ambulances and medical equipment) to ensure the health of their employees, their families and, where necessary, subcontractors.\n\n# Specific health challenges related to the Group's activities\n\nDue to their presence in sensitive geographic areas, the QHSE Departments and the medical services of Group entities are particularly attentive to preventing illnesses, pandemics, epidemics and local health crises. Managers are informed of the introduction of special procedures (e.g. daily reminders of safety rules and training for employees and subcontractors).\n\nEach year, the Group raises employee awareness, for example, with initiatives around World AIDS Day and Pink October for breast cancer prevention.\n\nThe divisions also place specific emphasis on health risk prevention related to drug and alcohol use, including strict controls (drugs and alcohol policy) for road carriers in particular.\n\nFurthermore, the approach to preserving employee health is clearly illustrated by the identification and management of psychosocial risks, and the development of quality of life and working conditions initiatives.\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n# Bolloré Energy\n\nTraining on psychosocial risk prevention in 2023 focused on the following topics:\n\n- working together to fight unconscious bias;\n- dealing with abusive phone calls;\n- psychosocial risk awareness.\n\nAs as a provider of services to individuals, the customer relationship was also identified as a potential source of stress may. As such, Bolloré Energy is deploying training on managing customer aggressiveness to its sales teams. In 2023, a total of 515 hours of training were provided within the Bolloré Energy entity and the La Charbonnière-LCA entity for a total of 74 people trained.\n\n# **• Industry**\n\n# Blue and Films\n\nPsychosocial risk prevention measures are deployed through training to enable managers and team managers to prevent and measure stress in their departments. In 2023, 16 employees completed the \"managerial mindset\" training at Blue.\n\n# Systems\n\nIn 2023, IER organized the second edition of its week for issues related to well-being at work during the QVCT Week. The programming included awareness-raising sessions, such as a nutrition and well-being workshop, workshops with time for discussion and reflection on quality of life at work, and a variety of activities, including sports.\n\nIER also launched a psychosocial risk prevention approach in 2023, partnering with an organization that specializes in preventing these issues. The initiative is organized into different stages:\n\n- completion of a preliminary diagnostic within the entity to collect existing data relating to its operation and especially its management of healthrelated issues, with the aim of quantifying work issues within the company;\n- creation of a joint steering committee to convene various functions (HR, occupational psychologist, QHSE, etc.). The committee's aim is to ensure the project runs smoothly, to confirm progress made and main actions, to monitor the proper implementation of the measures to be selected, and to disseminate information to all staff;\n- creation of dedicated working groups to serve as spaces for discussion to identify and propose concrete solutions to the issues identified;\n- distribution of a questionnaire to identify psychosocial risk factors, the results of which will be presented to the steering committee, which will work on a summary to report on the results, prioritizing the risk factors for the working groups to focus on;\n- reporting of actions identified for priority attention by the steering committee, and definition of an implementation schedule and monitoring tools.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\n## *Employee health care coverage indicators(1) at the Bolloré Group(2)*\n\n|                                                                                         | 2023 Total | Of which<br>Bolloré Logistics | 2022 Total* |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------|-------------|\n| Percentage of employees eligible for social security coverage                           | 94         | 93                            | 93          |\n| Percentage of entities where health coverage extends to employees' beneficiaries        | 82         | 78                            | 82          |\n| Percentage of entities where the health coverage is more favorable than required by law | 92         | 94                            | 94          |\n| Percentage of employees eligible for regular medical checkups provided by the company   | 81         | 78                            | 81          |\n| Percentage of entities where medical services are offered to employees free of charge   | 91         | 85                            | 89          |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from social reporting (see section 1.3.1.1. – Social reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding Vivendi.

To meet the requirement for quality excellence in our services and ensure the sustainability and growth of our activities, attracting then retaining and developing the skills of the company's women and men is a major lever for operational efficiency and innovation. Our actions are based on seven pillars: relationships with school, recruitment, diversity, mobility, training, professional support and compensation.\n\nAt Vivendi, the group's entities offer attractive working environments and new, more inclusive organizational methods to promote collaboration and a sense of togetherness. The group is also committed to recognizing the diversity of career paths and to offering opportunities to grow, learn and take initiative. Our talented employees, in all their diversity, contribute to the originality of content and services, and respond to the sensitivities of different audiences. External talent is vital to the activities of the Vivendi group: these talents are identified and supported by multicultural teams who can analyze trends, build trusting relationships, drive incubation programs and find new ways to detect talent. Earning their loyalty depends in particular on the ability to offer them a range of services (content promotion, copyrights management, brand partnerships, etc.). See chapter 2 of Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document on Risks related to attracting and retaining talent. See section 4.3.2.1. – Identifying and nurturing artistic talents worldwide in all their diversity. For more information on the management of priority CSR risks in the Communications sector, see section 2.2. – Main non-financial risks and opportunities.\n\n# Group policy\n\n# **• School relations: building long-term partnerships**\n\nRelationships with schools are a key pillar of the recruitment policy for the long term. Their main purpose is to attract trainees and apprentices, create privileged gateways for new graduates, and help train future generations. By sharing our business lines, challenges, values and opportunities we help students envision their future with the Group. These exchanges also allow us to better understand their professional expectations and thus offer appropriate experiences. The challenge in selecting and managing our partnerships is not so much to attract young people from the most reputable training courses, but to find promising profiles that match the Group's culture, while forging a lasting bond between the company and the students most in line with its needs.\n\n#### Strategic, lasting school partnerships\n\nDespite the global crisis, the Group committed in 2023 to maintaining its long-term partnership strategy and to help schools in this particular context. The number of school partnerships continued to grow, reaching 184 schools. The diversity of our business lines and geographic regions leads each entity to develop its own target school portfolio and strategy. In the Transportation and logistics division, seven strategic partnerships are ongoing and several initiatives (forums, conferences, HR workshops, case studies, etc.) are also carried out each year in other target schools. Kedge Business School has been one of the division's preferred partners since 2016 for two reasons: its supply chain, logistics and purchasing profiles, and its presence outside France with campuses in Shanghai and Suzhou. Likewise, Edhec is an essential partner, particularly for the quality of the financial profiles it trains. As a result, these two schools are the main sources of students hosted in internships and work-study programs at the Group's Headquarters.\n\nBlue is very committed to local partnerships with schools such as IUT de Quimper, École supérieure d'ingénieurs en agroalimentaire de Bretagne atlantique (Esiab), IUT de Lorient, École supérieure de logistique industrielle de Redon (Esli), Le Likès high school in Quimper and the Union des industries et métiers de la métallurgie Bretagne (UIMM) school. In the Systems division, Polyconseil, the Group's consulting business with highly-skilled engineering profiles, relies more on the principle of co-opting by capitalizing on the very active networks of top French schools. In 2023, Polyconseil continued its work with major engineering universities (Polytechnique, Télécom Paris, CentraleSupélec, Mines Paristech and Ponts Paristech) and with Epita, Epitech and Ada Tech (an inclusive and feminist IT school open to all). The various initiatives that began before the pandemic resumed in 2022. The HR teams and operational representatives of each of the business lines were able to resume relations with schools by regularly participating in recruitment forums and business line round tables, and by participating in thematic workshops (conferences, case studies, business projects, examination juries, HR coaching, etc.). The Transportation and logistics division thus maintained its engagement with schools, organizing 63 initiatives, including 23 in person. Our employees also contribute directly to the teaching processes. This is the case at Blue and at Polyconseil, where employees teach courses in our target schools.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\nVivendi also cultivates partnerships with the best schools and universities based on the areas of expertise it is seeking and with the aim to diversify profiles. At the end of 2023, Vivendi (excluding Lagardère) had 264 partnerships of this type.\n\nSee Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – section 4.3.1. – Offering all talent an attractive and inclusive work environment.\n\n# The intern experience rewarded with the HappyIndex<sup>®</sup> Trainees label\n\nThe Transportation and logistics division offers a structured internship and work-study policy focused on students' professional development. This involves various points: missions with responsibility and quality tutorial support, an orientation morning, follow-up throughout the internship and events to strengthen cohesion and knowledge of the company. The objective is to ensure that the internship or work-study experience at the company is a constructive part of the development of the students we host. This program was digitalized in 2021 to maintain the quality of the reception and onboarding of all students despite the context of remote working. In 2022, the experience evolved once again by adopting a hybrid mode of operation and offering a face-to-face experience to establish a collective dynamic and several digitalized business conferences which facilitated sharing with all students, regardless of the pace of their work-study programs. This\n\n*The Bolloré(2) Group's school relations indicators(1)*\n\ncommitment was once again rewarded with the renewal of the HappyIndex® Trainees label in 2023. In particular, this survey assesses the reception and support provided to interns and work-study participants in the workplace. With a recommendation rate of 78% in 2023, students have emphasized the responsibilities assigned, the trust granted and the educational character of the proposed missions. This anonymous questionnaire is also a valuable source of information with a view to continuously improving our HR processes and policies vis-à-vis interns and work-study participants.\n\n**Our interns and work-study program students, a future talent pool:** each year, Bolloré offers thousands of internships and work-study programs through initiatives carried out in schools. It offers opportunities in operating positions (supply chain, logistics, transport, shipping, civil engineering, port, rail, industrial project management, R&D projects, trade, etc.) and in support functions (finance, law, information systems, human resources, marketing, etc.). At the Group's head office and the Bolloré Transportation and logistics division, 117 interns and work-study participants were hosted in 2023. Given the quality of the experience offered by the company, recognized by the renewal of the HappyIndex<sup>®</sup> Trainees label for the third consecutive year, 60% of master's students were offered a position within the Group on completion of their course.\n\n|                                                                                   | 2023  | Of which<br>Bolloré Logistics* | 2022* |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------------------------------|-------|\n| Number of interns and work-study program students                                 | 1,188 | 985                            | 1,201 |\n| Number of interns and work-study program students recruited                       | 318   | 301                            | 300   |\n| Number of school partnerships                                                     | 184   | 143                            | 148   |\n| Number of interns and work-study program students recruited from our partnerships | 44    | 40                             | 59    |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from social reporting (see section 1.3.1.1. – Social reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding the Communications sector to improve legibility in terms of the action described in this chapter. Consolidated Group data including the Communications sector are presented, where available, in the social indicator summary tables (see section 1.3.1. – Summary tables of social indicators). More information on the policies and action plans implemented in the Communications sector is available in Vivendi's non-financial performance statement.\n\n\\* Data for the 2022 scope excluding Bolloré Africa Logistics following the sale of this business line.\n\nVivendi's business lines are also committed to offering a high-quality, attentive experience during the recruitment and onboarding process for employees and interns, by increasing discussions prior to their arrival within their teams, developing a managerial culture around one-on-ones and feedback, establishing internal mentoring programs, arranging meetings with managers and offering them an introduction to activities. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 4.3.1. Offering all talent an attractive and inclusive work environment.\n\n# **• Recruitment: a marker of our employer promise**\n\nIn 2022, the number of new hires gathered pace (increase of more than 20% compared to 2021) in all Group entities due to the economic recovery and the very favorable global employment environment (the Great Resignation in the United States, etc.). In this context, the Group's attention to ensuring an efficient, transparent and non-discriminatory hiring process remained intact. The situation stabilized in 2023 with a substantial volume of hires in line with the pre-pandemic years, as the global recruitments market becomes less competitive again.\n\nRecruitment contributes decisively to the company's performance by bringing in the best profiles in line with the Bolloré Group's culture and values and with our operating needs. In this context, the Group relies on a shared recruitment system to:\n\n- promote consultation between recruitment actors to define the needs in response to the company's development challenges;\n- communicate needs through the most relevant media, both internally and externally;\n- make the selection of talents more objective through the use of assessment tools that help gain a better understanding of the applicants' three key\n\ndimensions, namely their abilities, their technical and behavioral skills and what motivates them, and;\n\n• guarantee equal opportunities for all profiles, with the firm conviction that diversity is a source of productivity and creativity in companies.\n\n## Ensuring the excellence of our recruiters\n\nIn order to maintain skills and ensure business excellence, our two-year commitment with LinkedIn will enable us to deepen the initiatives undertaken over the last two years to create a community of recruiters, with three priorities: expertise in existing tools and their upgrades, the implementation of better recruitment techniques, and the development of business skills. In 2023, therefore, 128 HR staff involved in recruitment processes in France and abroad were required to complete various modules on how to use the tools offered by LinkedIn, which is the largest source of applications. In addition, several modules on taking diversity and inclusion into account in our recruitment processes were also rolled out.\n\n#### Language tests for objective assessment\n\nIn an international Group like Bolloré, where intercultural collaboration is needed, over the past years, the Transportation and logistics division has defined a common level expected in terms of English language fluency. Based on this common reference framework and in order to strengthen the excellence of our processes, in 2023, the Group's head office confirmed the use of language tests when hiring executives involved in international relations. These tests make it possible to ensure that candidates meet the required level of English fluency and thus facilitate objectification and fairness in decisions. New hires find it easier to integrate and taking up their new position faster.\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Ensuring a better understanding of who we are\n\nBeyond effective processes, our external actions to ensure a better understanding of what the Group is, in all its diversity, and its promise as an employer are also critical. In 2023, the Transportation and logistics division continued to carry out various video content creation projects in order to promote its businesses, activities and corporate culture through interviews and business videos, in partnership with Jobteaser. Blue continued the initiatives undertaken in terms of visibility by opening the doors of all its sites to its\n\n# *The Bolloré(2) Group's recruitment indicators(1)*\n\nemployment providers to ensure they have a perfect understanding of its business lines and needs. The division also increased its visibility on social media by regularly publishing information and videos on LinkedIn. Recruitment capsule videos were also made for publication on LinkedIn. In 2023, IER continued to communicate regularly on social media to promote the Group's employer brand and develop its attractiveness, by communicating in particular on the various actions carried out internally (HR coffee mornings, Welcome Day, engagement weeks, etc.).\n\n|                                                                 | 2023  | Of which<br>Bolloré Logistics | 2022* |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------------------------------|-------|\n| Number of external hires with permanent or fixed-term contracts | 3,837 | 3,325                         | 4,609 |\n| Number of external hires on permanent contracts                 | 2,790 | 2,383                         | 3,242 |\n| Number of external management recruits on permanent contracts   | 266   | 219                           | 354   |\n| Number of hires on fixed-term contracts                         | 1,047 | 942                           | 1,367 |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from social reporting (see section 1.3.1.1. – Social reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding the Communications sector to improve legibility in terms of the action described in this chapter.\n\nConsolidated Group data including the Communications sector are presented, where available, in the social indicator summary tables (see section 1.3.1. – Summary tables of social\n\nindicators).

The business lines enjoy significant visibility on social media thanks to regular postings that celebrate their achievements and innovations, reflecting their social, societal and environmental commitments and depicting the shared emotions generated by the group's content. The careers sites, which express the group's DNA, history, know-how and human capital through employee testimonials and podcasts about the career fields make it possible to create an initial connection with future employees. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 4.3.1. Offering all talent an attractive and inclusive work environment.\n\n# **• Promoting diversity: a major focus of the Group's HR policies**\n\nIn order to remain a diversified, international and innovative Group we have to consider the societies where we are located. The Diversity and Inclusion Charter, in line with the ILO conventions and with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, formalizes the ambitions, approaches and resources that the Group intends to implement.\n\nThrough this Charter, the Bolloré Group undertakes to ensure: • non-discrimination;\n\n- the recruitment and integration of people with disabilities;\n- the promotion of equality between men and women;\n- the professional integration of young people, particularly in connection with the sponsorship policy. (see section 1.2.4.3. – Sponsorship policy).\n\nThis Charter is gradually being rolled out through action plans covering all the stages of our employees' life cycle such as recruitment, promotion, mobility, and training, with measurable results and visible initiatives that reflect the Group's ambitions to improve in these areas.\n\nPromoting diversity and creating an inclusive environment are integral parts of the Vivendi group's DNA. Vivendi recognizes that everyone's differences are a source of enrichment, and emphasizes individual skills as the foundation of collective performance. The group's growth derives from the diversity of its business lines, employees, cultures, generations and talents. Diversity, equity and inclusion are strategic values embodied at all levels of the Group so that they are a reality for all employees, a managerial commitment and a daily priority for the HR teams.\n\nSee Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 4.3.1.2. Fostering an inclusive environment and diversity, essential to the group's DNA.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Raising awareness and strengthening non-discriminatory practices\n\nAn awareness-raising program to combat all forms of discrimination was launched in 2020 and is still ongoing. This course, consisting of various e-learning modules to raise awareness of discriminatory criteria in companies such as physical appearance, disability or age, was first deployed to the HR community. In 2021, the rollout of this system was expanded to include managers and HR teams in the holding company and the Industry division (in addition to the persons previously targeted in the Transportation and logistics division) in France. During its last rollout, the overall completion rate was just over 60%. More specifically, in 2023, a module addressing unconscious bias was rolled out to all employees across the Group's various entities.\n\nIn 2023, a special module developed as part of a new diversity campaign was launched on March 8 to coincide with International Women's Rights Day and raised awareness among 84% of employees.\n\nTo create an environment in line with its culture, values and priorities, the Vivendi group strives to promote inclusion and diversity by training its employees on these subjects and by giving its managers non-discrimination training. In addition, the diversity of Vivendi's talent, which guarantees the cultural relevance of its content, makes it possible to give audiences content that reflects them and brings them together.\n\n## Structuring our initiatives for people with disabilities\n\nIn addition to complying with legislative requirements, the recruitment and onboarding of people with disabilities is a strong source of social cohesion in the company. The Group's approach is based on two objectives:\n\n- adapt job profiles to optimize the recruitment of people with disabilities, and;\n- develop a working environment that is suitable for the onboarding of people with disabilities.\n\nIn 2023, the number of employees with disabilities increased in the Group and in France. These recruitments are the result, among other things, of the inclusive scheme: in France, 83% of work-study participants with disabilities were hired at the end of their training under this scheme. A disability agreement was finalized and the Group maintained the initiatives for people with disabilities in France launched in 2022, in consultation with all divisions. An Agefiph agreement is scheduled to be signed in early 2024.\n\nIn 2023, IER established a disability committee (made up of an HR officer and volunteer employees), the role of which is to inform, guide and support persons with disabilities, whether or not they have been recognized as disabled. A disability charter was therefore drawn up, and a number of awareness-raising initiatives were carried out with employees (conferences, games during the European Week for Employment of People with Disabilities (SEEPH), etc.).\n\n#### *Indicators(1) of persons with disabilities employed by Bolloré Group(2)*\n\n|                                                                                                                                   | 2023 | Of which<br>Bolloré Logistics | 2022* |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|-------------------------------|-------|\n| Number of employees with a disability                                                                                             | 315  | 236                           | 294   |\n| Number of employees with a disability in France                                                                                   | 271  | 195                           | 250   |\n| Percentage of employees with a disability/Group's total workforce                                                                 | 1.7  | 1.6                           | 1.6   |\n| Percentage of employees recruited with a disability/Total workforce recruited externally on<br>permanent and fixed-term contracts | 0.5  | 0.3                           | 0.6   |\n| Percentage of employees with a disability trained/total Group workforce trained                                                   | 1.5  | 1.4                           | 1.4   |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from social reporting (see section 1.3.1.1. – Social reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding the Communications sector to improve legibility in terms of the action described in this chapter.\n\nConsolidated Group data including the Communications sector are presented, where available, in the social indicator summary tables (see section 1.3.1. – Summary tables of social\n\nindicators). More information on the policies and action plans implemented in the Communications sector is available in Vivendi's non-financial performance statement.\n\n\\* Data for the 2022 scope excluding Bolloré Africa Logistics following the sale of this business line.\n\nThe Vivendi group is a disability friendly. Its various business lines work fully together and are committed to promoting the inclusion of people with disabilities (whether motor or psychic) and non-discrimination against them by implementing a responsible, sustainable policy, taking into account the specificities of the business lines and local legislation. This policy is notably reflected in regular awareness-raising campaigns for employees and managers, partnerships with associations to promote the employment and integration of people with disabilities, as well as the creation of conducive conditions for employees to report their disability so that appropriate accommodations can be made for positions and workstations. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 4.3.1.2. Fostering an inclusive environment and diversity, essential to the group's DNA.\n\n#### A company that promotes women\n\nProfessional gender equality is seen as a lever for transformation, with the potential to bring people together that is common to all the Group's divisions. The Group has set itself three objectives:\n\n- increase the presence of women in jobs where, for equal skills, women are poorly represented;\n- promote women's access to positions of responsibility, through the selection of more women for management training programs;\n- support women in their career development.\n\nIn 2023, the percentage of women in the Group remained stable compared with 2022. It accounted for almost half of the total workforce (47%).\n\nThe percentage of women hired on permanent contracts was equivalent to 2022 (45%). Blue is also working in this area by promoting the accessibility of positions to both men and women. Several women were recruited to production positions in 2023.\n\nThe percentage of women trained remained stable in 2023 and above the percentage of women in the workforce.\n\nIn 2023, the percentage of women with managerial responsibilities rose slightly compared with 2022 and is nearing women's representation at the company. The Group's Management was one of the major promoters of this progress with the reworking of the Group Executive Committee and the appointment of seven women directors, thus ensuring an Executive Committee at near parity (eight directors). All of these initiatives, including recruitment, training, promotions and remuneration, are reflected in France in an improvement in the gender equality index published in France. The gender equality index in France, implemented since 2019 for all Group entities with more than 50 employees, enabled us to monitor the results of the actions taken to diversify our talents, particularly with respect to women in the Group's activities. Thanks to the actions taken to ensure greater gender equality in the Bolloré Group, many entities have managed to improve or stabilize their ratings and all entities scored above 85/100.\n\n### Bolloré Logistics: a paragon of diversity\n\nThe notion that \"Cultural diversity is a driving force of development\" is not our idea, but rather UNESCO's. Bolloré Logistics is proud to have been named European Leader in Diversity by the *Financial Times* for the second year in a row. This prestigious award underlines the company's continued commitment to Inclusion and diversity within its teams.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\n## *The Bolloré Group gender equality index*\n\n|                               | 2023 | 2022 |\n|-------------------------------|------|------|\n| BL Guadeloupe                 | 92   | 99   |\n| Nord Sud                      | NC   | 94   |\n| IER                           | 88   | 90   |\n| BIS                           | 86   | 89   |\n| UES Telecom                   | 88   | 89   |\n| Bolloré Energy                | 91   | 86   |\n| Bolloré Logistics             | 85   | 85   |\n| Sogetra                       | 89   | 84   |\n| UES Bolloré                   | 88   | 83   |\n| Foresea Technologies          | 85   | 82   |\n| BTLC                          | 87   | 79   |\n| UES La Réunion                | 86   | 75   |\n| Bolloré Solutions Logistiques | 93   | 72   |\n\nFor the Automatic Systems and Nord Sud entities, although they are subject to index calculation, the representativeness criteria by category imposed by the index methodology do not make it possible to calculate it.\n\n# *The Bolloré(2) Group's gender equality indicators(1)*\n\n| (as a percentage) | 2023 | Of which<br>Bolloré Logistics | 2022* |\n|-------------------|------|-------------------------------|-------|\n| Women(3)          | 46.6 | 51.1                          | 46.8  |\n| Women managers(4) | 40.1 | 42.5                          | 39.1  |\n| Women recruits(5) | 45.1 | 47.8                          | 48.2  |\n| Women trained(6)  | 47.6 | 52.2                          | 48.8  |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from social reporting (see section 1.3.1.1. – Social reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding the Communications sector to improve legibility in terms of the action described in this chapter.

As a result, Vivendi places the utmost importance on diversity and gender diversity within its Management teams, with the goal of increasing the proportion of women at the highest level in all of the group's entities, and implementing specific actions to promote women and gender parity. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 4.3.1.2. Fostering an inclusive environment and diversity, essential to the group's DNA.\n\n# **• Mobility: a winning approach for employees and the organization**\n\nEmployee mobility is both a priority and a practical reality within the Bolloré Group. It may be geographical (national or international) or functional with a change of position within the same business line, to another business line or even through the creation of bridges between our different activities. It is an opportunity for employees to continue their development and strengthen their employability, and for the organization to build on the experience already acquired and promote cross-functionality.\n\nThe main keys to the success of mobility actions are proximity and the quality of the discussions the employees have with their managers and human resources managers to help them develop their career project, its feasibility and implementation. It was through this proximity and quality of dialog that, in 2023, in a context of fluctuating activity levels, changing organizations, and the sale of the Transportation and logistics business, the Bolloré Group was able to move 302 employees identified in Career Committees.\n\nHowever, policies and processes are required to encourage and facilitate internal mobility. In 2023, in line with the commitments made in 2022, three key actions were carried out illustrating the Group's desire to position mobility as a driver of employee performance and development.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n## A common mobility policy\n\nThe internal mobility policy drafted in 2019 continues to be rolled out and is more visible to employees. Note that the mobility policy is based on two main principles: it applies to all levels of the organization and all business lines, and it gives priority to internal applications in our recruitment process. As a result, job vacancies are widely published.\n\nIn order to maintain our actions on this subject, a pilot project has been launched in the Bolloré Transportation and logistics division at the Corporate level, aimed at recording, automating and harmonizing the Career Committee process in a system common to all divisions.\n\n# *The Bolloré(2) Group's internal mobility indicators(1)*\n\n## A network of business line HR officers ensuring cross-functionality\n\nIn order to implement the policy and continue to make progress on internal mobility, HR officers have been identified for each business line and tasked with providing an overview of the vacancies and the employees on mobility assignments across the Group. These HR officers participate in the business line Career Committee meetings, as well as in the bimonthly meetings of the mobility network. This participation allows them to better understand employees and their development challenges across all divisions, and to be proactive throughout the year on open positions or successions to be prepared.\n\n|                                                                                                 | 2023 | Of which<br>Bolloré Logistics | 2022* |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|-------------------------------|-------|\n| Internal mobility from another legal entity in the Bolloré Group (employees joining the entity) | 162  | 124                           | 146   |\n| Internal mobility towards another legal entity in the Bolloré Group (employee departures)       | 140  | 120                           | 146   |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from social reporting (see section 1.3.1.1. – Social reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) Tese indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding the Communications sector to improve legibility in terms of the action described in this chapter.\n\nConsolidated Group data including the Communications sector are presented, where available, in the social indicator summary tables (see section 1.3.1. – Summary tables of social indicators). More information on the policies and action plans implemented in the Communications sector is available in Vivendi's non-financial performance statement.\n\n\\* Data for the 2022 scope excluding Bolloré Africa Logistics following the sale of this business line.\n\nInternal mobility is a strategic element in the Vivendi group's human resources development policy to help employees grow professionally and to build loyalty. It also addresses organizational challenges (flexibility, decompartmentalization of functions, diversity of profiles within a team) and individual needs (revitalizing career paths and enhancing employability). At the group level, an Internal Mobility Charter has existed for over fifteen years, as well as a platform to collect and share job offers from French entities open to mobility. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 4.3.1.1. Recognizing talent and growing together.\n\n# **• Training policy**\n\nAnticipating the skills required for our business lines, in a rapidly changing and increasingly competitive environment, is still essential to ensure the excellence of the Group's services and products. Our investment in developing our employees' skills is key to achieving this.\n\n- In 2023, a total of 2,067 registrations were recorded for in-person and remote training, and more than 152,090 registrations for all-digital training.\n- Some 65 training projects were launched across the Group in 2022, and more than 50 internal and external trainers took part in these projects.\n- Main topics:\n- Management and talent;\n- Onboarding;\n- Business and customer relations;\n- Freight forwarding;\n- Soft skills.\n\nThe B'University Online training platform recorded more than 329,675 connections in 2023; traffic remains very high.\n\nIn 2023, women accounted for 50% (8,716) of employees receiving training and men made up 50% (8,700) to achieve perfect parity.\n\nOverall, 31,538 training enrollments were by managers and 120,552 by employees without managerial functions.\n\n# The Bolloré corporate university: B'University\n\nAs the Group undergoes profound transformation in a complex environment (international conflicts, climate and energy crises, inflation, the importance of meaningful work, hybrid work, etc.), the training offer must provide a strategic and operational response in line with those of the Group's Executive management, Finance Department and Human Resources Department.\n\nLaunched in 2020, the corporate university, B'University, is committed to driving these transformations and supporting employees in their development and employability.\n\nB'University has its own facilities in Suresnes (training rooms, codevelopment, etc.), which are greatly appreciated by employees and partners alike. The team specializes in project management and training engineering, content design and creation, and digital learning.\n\nIn 2021, B'University obtained ISO 9001:2015 certification in the fields of design, animation and deployment of training solutions, as well as the Qualiopi certificate. These certifications, a guarantee of quality, were renewed in 2023.\n\n## The multi-source format is prioritized\n\nInternal business lines and learners now prefer new training programs to be offered as \"blended learning\" opportunities. The assimilation of digital training continued with growing collective awareness that it is possible to learn effectively remotely. Drawing on this observation, using the B'University brand, the Group is continuing to accelerate its move towards more digital training aimed at developing employees' skills in the short, medium and long term. This draws on two strategic priorities:\n\n- the quality of training, combining efficient and diversified solutions to ensure efficiency and acquisition;\n- the experience of learning via fun (gamification) and immediately accessible methods.\n\n# Rollout of training on B'University Online, the Group's training platform\n\nIn 2023, B'University provided customary support for the launch of all mandatory training campaigns (Compliance, IT Security, GDPR, etc.).\n\nB'University introduced new options to the catalog of training courses focused on soft skills and building Office 365 proficiency. Employees expressed an average satisfaction rate of 3.4 out of 4 for this training offer.\n\nAt the end of October 2023, out of the 73 modules available in digital format, employees expressed an average satisfaction rate of 4.2 out of 5.\n\n#### Tailor-made training programs\n\nIn 2022, as remote working became increasingly widespread, the Group set up training on hybrid management to help employees adapt managerial practices and manage a team in a hybrid working context; this training continued in 2023.\n\nIn addition, a \"Train the Trainer\" course was launched and is proving a great success with employees who want to share their knowledge internally or support the rollout of internal projects.\n\nTEKAs, the training program dedicated to Bolloré Logistics' contract managers launched in 2021, was a great success. Its aim is to increase efficiency in day-to-day practices while remaining customer-centric.\n\nIn 2023, B'University supported the \"Globe Shippers\" project, whose goals include providing Bolloré Logistics' most loyal customers with a training benefit. To this end, they receive training sessions on the fundamentals of transport and logistics are run by B'University, as well as customized program design sessions.\n\nB'University also supported strategic training projects for the Bolloré Group, such as assistance with deploying the Transport Management System worldwide and the project to create a global business line onboarding pathway.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\nA B'Tomorrow class of 101 talented young people selected by region began in March 2023. B'Tomorrow is an advanced development program for talented young people that aims to improve behavioral skills, develop the network at the regional level, extend Group knowledge, and build strong professional relationships. With the integration of a self-assessment tool (DISC) in 2023, the program continues to expand, and will include a public speaking module in 2024.\n\n#### Training our managers to better prepare future generations\n\nOur managers play a key role in the Group's performance. Four major training programs support them, starting from the role of team manager to country\n\n# *The Bolloré(2) Group's training indicators(1)*\n\nand regional management functions. The Proxy, Most, Maps and Smart Leaders programs have a proven track record. With a pragmatic approach, they also build a shared managerial practices and a strong network of ambassador-managers in a company increasingly focused on learning. Each course comprises common foundations aligned with the Group's values. As such, they incorporate a virtuous managerial chain, encouraging the sharing of best practices. With these programs, the aim is to help managers develop skills in their role at each stage of their career. Participants are mixed with managers from the Group's various entities. IER has continued to develop its managers by drawing up a managerial charter to enable each manager to strengthen their practices and better support their teams.\n\n|                                                | 2023    | Of which<br>Bolloré Logistics | 2022*   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------|---------|\n| Number of employees trained                    | 17,666  | 14,621                        | 16,459  |\n| – France                                       | 7,177   | 4,821                         | 6,628   |\n| – Africa                                       | 0       | 0                             | 0       |\n| – Asia                                         | 6,227   | 6,092                         | 5,635   |\n| – Americas                                     | 1,992   | 1,734                         | 2,042   |\n| – Europe (excl.

More information on the policies and action plans implemented in the Communications sector is available in Vivendi's non-financial performance statement.\n\n\\* Data for the 2022 scope excluding Bolloré Africa Logistics following the sale of this business line.\n\nFor the Vivendi group, skills development and training tackle today's challenges and anticipate challenges on the horizon. For each of the group's companies, this means deploying the strategy and its needs, anticipating the transformation and evolution of its businesses (GEPP, or job and career management) and responding to employees' demands to grow and learn. Training is a priority, enabling us to foster all three aspects of an individual employee's human capital: skills, experience and personal development. Collectively, the main training areas chosen by the company support the deployment of its strategy and meet its needs. In this time of rapid transformation, the Group prioritizes training in changing professions, managerial skills, new organizational methods, quality of work life, health and safety prevention, and awareness of diversity, equity and inclusion. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 4.3.1.1. Recognizing talent and growing together.\n\n# **• Professional development support**\n\nThe annual appraisal: a key process for quality employee/manager discussions The annual appraisal is a key process implemented in all countries and for all employees.\n\nThis exchange is a special moment between employees and managers to review the past year and plan for the coming year. It involves addressing the employee's performance and skills, as well as expectations for the coming year and the associated resources. This time is also used to assess collaboration and see how it can be further improved. The purpose of the discussion is to encourage the development of skills and talents as a means of better meeting the goals and needs of employees and short- and medium-term organizational challenges. The content of this discussion is therefore key to supporting the employee and nurturing numerous HR processes such as mobility, training plans and Career Committees.\n\nThe rate of completion of annual appraisals held steady in 2023 (83%) compared with 85% in 2022.\n\n#### More development to improve performance\n\nDespite the context, because the Group is convinced of the importance of this exchange, the process has been adapted to strengthen its practice and impact. Three main changes have been implemented:\n\n- 1. the introduction of a shared core of behavioral skills in line with the Group's values;\n- 2. performance and development are addressed simultaneously with a \"challenge and support\" approach;\n- 3. ongoing dialog with the possibility of monitoring objectives during the year in order to be as close as possible to the business momentum.\n\nTo assist employees and managers in the exchange, a digital toolbox has been updated, with around twenty sources of content offering diverse educational methods (guides, fact sheets, videos, etc.). These tools are intended to help with the content of the exchanges, as well as with active listening, reformulation, and feedback techniques, etc.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Towards a common digital platform for managing appraisal meetings\n\nOver the past few years, the Group has been committed to an HR transformation plan to increase digitalization. The roll-out of the digital platform used by part of the Transportation and logistics division, the holding company, and Systems in 2021 was confirmed in 2022, with the aim of integrating the ASPAC region by 2024. The use of this platform makes it easier to capture and monitor exchanges over time. Moreover, this shift towards a common system is a real driver of improvements in mobility, training and Career Committees process through easy access for the HR community. It also allows for better follow-up via indicators.\n\n## Career Committees for cross-functionality and anticipation\n\nCareer Committees are used across the Group. Committee meetings follow a process ranging from the first levels of management to the highest levels. They aim to anticipate, through a collective discussion between managers and human resources, changes in the organization, to discuss the profiles of the talented employees identified, and to establish appropriate succession plans and development actions to be implemented. The challenge they face is to guarantee proactive management of jobs and skills.\n\nMeetings are organized at the division level as well as at the Group level by business line. The momentum remains strong, with 57 Career Committees organized, a stable figure compared with 2022 (excluding the Africa division).\n\n# **• Pay and compensation policy**\n\nThe Bolloré Group has set a clear course for its compensation policy. Its aim is that wages should be aligned with local markets in each of the countries where it operates and that the benefits it offers its employees should compare favorably with established practice in each market. It has therefore continued to implement the infrastructure needed to achieve this ambition. A system for weighing up job requirements has been adopted on a test basis in Asia and at the head office. Furthermore, a \"living wage\" study on the duty of care scope was completed in several countries (see section 1.2.2.2. – Promoting human rights in our value chain).\n\nThe Vivendi group strives to offer employees attractive and motivating compensation based on their skills and their personal contribution to the company's performance. The group's remuneration policy is based on principles of fairness and non-discrimination and rewards both individual and collective performance. The HR teams participate in benchmarking surveys and regularly analyze compensation to ensure compensation is pertinent internally and to compare it with the market so the business lines are able to retain their talent and attract potential new talent. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 4.3.1.1. Recognizing talent and growing together.\n\n# **• Conclusion**\n\nIn response to the risks identified, the Group seeks to ensure that it has the right skills at the right place and at the right time to support its strategy. The policy rolled out is one of acting proactively to meet the challenges that lie ahead. The implementation of combined actions is seen as a factor of success and competitiveness, but also as a driver of forward-looking management and decision-making. Its purpose is to:\n\n- optimize recruitment, training, mobility, and leveraging of key know-how;\n- contribute to the implementation of the talent management and future skills development strategy.\n\nThese systems also allow us to respond to:\n\n- risks related to issues of attractiveness: strengthening the employer brand, improving recruitment, adapting jobs to changes in the environment and corporate strategy, anticipating internal issues related to the age structure and affirming the Group's added value on the market by the coherent development of the businesses;\n- risks related to retention issues: promoting internal mobility, revitalizing and motivating employees by valuing skills and supporting professional projects, finding new drivers of loyalty for the key skills of our structure and facilitating the transmission of knowledge and know-how so as not to lose key skills.\n\nTo measure the effectiveness of our initiatives in terms of attracting and retaining talent, the permanent-contract turnover indicator has been used since 2019. Since 2020, it has been enriched with a specific focus on voluntary turnover (resignations only).\n\nIn the Systems division, at IER, employee retention and engagement initiatives have been implemented: HR coffee mornings, sustainable development weeks, quality of life at work, implementation of an onboarding pack (introductory booklet and integration seminars), and interviews following voluntary departures.\n\nPolyconseil has made kindergarten places available to its employees in order to limit turnover.\n\n#### *Staff turnover indicators(1) at the Bolloré Group(2)*\n\n| (as a percentage)                                           | 2023 | Of which<br>Bolloré Logistics | 2022* | Change<br>2023/2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|------|-------------------------------|-------|---------------------|\n| Turnover(3) (all reasons for permanent contract departures) | 18.5 | 19.3                          | 21.3  | -2.8 pt             |\n| Turnover(4) (permanent contract resignations only)          | 11.3 | 12.1                          | 13.7  | -2.4 pt             |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from social reporting (see section 1.3.1.1. – Social reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding the Communications sector to improve legibility in terms of the action described in this chapter.

The Bolloré Group, like most of the major groups, was faced with these tensions, particularly in certain business lines (logistics experts, IT experts including developers and data scientists, production operators and certain finance specialists). Despite carrying out two major disposal projects in 2022 and 2023, the Bolloré Group managed to contain overall turnover, which now stands at 18.5% and 11.3% on the basis of resignations alone, with a decrease of two points versus 2022.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.2.1.2.2.

In gray: non-priority non-financial risk at the division level.\n\nThe Bolloré Group businesses operate in different countries where local standards in terms of working conditions and social dialog can vary, representing a risk not only to employee development, but also to business continuity, potentially preventing us from delivering our services within the timeframe and to the standard expected by our customers.\n\nAt the Vivendi group, the risks associated with the challenges of social dialog have not been identified as major but are described as having the potential to engender additional operating costs in the event of employee absences, loss of confidence in the company or deterioration in the social climate and reputational impact that could damage the group's attractiveness and employee loyalty. Questions pertaining to social dialog and working conditions are detailed in Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 4.3.1. Offering all talent an attractive and inclusive working environment, in the passage \"Promoting continuous exchanges and social dialog\". For more information on the management of CSR priority risks in the Communications sector, see Vivendi's 2023 Universal registration document in chapter 2 – 2.2. Main non-financial risks and opportunities.\n\n# Group policy\n\nThe Bolloré Group is committed to guaranteeing and promoting quality social dialog over the long term, combining economic reality and response to internal social expectations to ensure collective corporate performance without jeopardizing existing balances. This is a central plank of the construction of a corporate social responsibility approach, making it the focus of special attention.\n\nSpecific features include:\n\n- promotion of social dialog;\n- development of company-specific agreements and, more specifically, working conditions as the driver of the company's performance, and;\n- defense of any action aimed at combating discrimination and promoting professional equality.\n\nThe Human Resources teams implement these guiding principles and common values throughout the world, taking care to adapt them to:\n\n- the specific nature of each country as regards prevailing legal provisions;\n- the economic reality and strategy of each company (determining the scopeof company-specific agreements possible depending on the structure concerned);\n- inter- and intra-business unit diversity, and;\n- human resources management and development priorities (retention of existing employees and/or attractiveness for job applicants through qualitative company agreements).\n\nThis policy gives rise to a rich and lively social dialog organized within the Group as part of negotiations with employee representatives or in other forms, depending on the laws of each country in the network.\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries undertake to facilitate the expression of employees in countries where the International labour Organization (ILO) conventions on the freedom to organize have not been ratified.\n\nThe development of industrial relations as a vector for the construction of a body of company-specific agreements is a subject of constant concern, with the aim of maintaining a peaceful social climate and ensuring ongoing dialog with employee representatives.\n\nBest practices, successful experiences and difficulties encountered on industrial relations matters are shared between central and local functions in direct exchanges and at HR seminars and workshops. Regular communication between local Human Resources teams and Industrial Relations Departments and the Group Human Resources Department is reflected in ongoing change to and development of the employee management approach in a continuous improvement process.\n\nSocial dialog and company-specific agreements must be a source of genuine social engineering for the company, allowing it to adapt labor standards to its requirements in terms of business productivity. In other words, they must facilitate organization and adaptation to ongoing transformations resulting from economic globalization while ensuring a fair redistribution of profits to employees in the form of benefits and salary gains.\n\nAs part of its social policy, and in accordance with the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organization, Vivendi's priority is to have a permanent and constructive dialog with employees and their representatives. Accordingly, the group conducts a social dialog and consultation process at all levels to find collective solutions, particularly on issues relating to working conditions, organizational changes and occupational health and safety. At the group level, social dialog is pursued through two bodies. One is national, the group Works Committee, and the other European, the European Works council. As regards working conditions, Vivendi promotes working times and modes that help to improve the quality of life and well-being of its employees. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 4.3.1. Offering all talent an attractive and inclusive work environment, in the passage \"Promoting continuous exchanges and social dialog\".\n\n# Action plan and areas of improvement\n\nThe actions and objectives for 2023 in this area were as follows:\n\n- the first is to continue applying the procedure for consolidating the various collective agreements in place and to develop it so as to maintain a comprehensive approach to social dialog and the specific agreements covering all entities in the scope;\n- the second is to promote shared approaches to social dialog while ensuring the preservation of the specificities of legal entities in respect of their country of location, their business, their economic results or their management and human resources development priorities, and;\n- the third is to define performance indicators with associated objectives to measure progress and plan corrective actions in the event of non-progression.\n\nFor social dialog and the development of company-specific agreements in the operating entities, it has been decided to present a focus by geography (using three areas) rather than by business so as to take into account the specificities of laws applicable in each country, which naturally impact internal company standards.\n\n# **• Americas, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and South Asia**\n\nThese areas, with a few exceptions, tend to have national labor regulations rather than agreements specific to each entity.\n\nMany entities establish unilateral internal industrial relations arrangements that reflect their own priorities, including equality of treatment and nondiscrimination.\n\nOther entities, less numerous, have conducted negotiations giving rise to a collective agreement.\n\nNoteworthy achievements include:\n\n- in India, Bolloré Logistics organized sports events (cricket, self-defense, yoga, etc.) in 2023, awareness-raising sessions (breast cancer, harassment, fire and safety procedures, etc.), AcTogether initiatives, CSR actions (recycling of wooden pallets and cardboard, reduction of lighting, etc.) and various events (women's rights day, retirement, etc.);\n- in the ASPAC region, Bolloré Logistics has implemented measures to improve the quality of life at work (variable working hours, remote working), renovated many offices and purchased new offices and carried out health and well-being initiatives;\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n- in 2023, Bolloré Logistics financed a vaccination campaign for employees and their families in South Asia and participated in the Green Globe action (exchange of used paper for plants);\n- in the Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Pakistan, Bolloré Logistics once again organized a week of employee well-being (physician, nutritionist, sports, motivation, etc.) in 2023. As there are no employee representatives in this region, a Social Committee has been set up to work on company life and propose social projects based on employee surveys;\n- in 2023, Bolloré Logistics USA continued to pursue several health-related initiatives (dentist, wellness training, mammograms, etc.);\n- in the LATAM region, Bolloré Logistics continued to organize charity events and tree-planting days, as well as several wellness initiatives for employees (mental health awareness, gym, nutrition, women's health, etc.), and;\n- Bolloré Logistics Canada carried out a number of initiatives to fight stress and promote psychological well-being in the workplace (retirement workshops, community vegetable garden).\n\n# **• Europe**\n\nIn 2020, the Group and the representatives of its European workforce agreed to set up the Bolloré Group European Corporations Common Committee (BECCC), to establish social dialog.\n\nThe objective is to make the BECCC a forum for giving the labor force in each European country a fuller vision and understanding of the strategy, economic situation and common human resources and training policies of the Group\n\n## *The Bolloré(2) Group's social dialog indicators(1)*\n\nin Europe. The social dialog in the BECCC at the European level is in no way intended to take the place of national social dialogs. It does aim, however, to help enrich the national discussions through a better understanding by the representatives of how the directions taken and the projects established in each country are inspired by and further the broad strategy and plans of the Group in Europe.\n\nIn 2023, the BECCC met several times. These sessions included discussions on the Bolloré Group's CSR strategy, as well as the strategy of its Transportation and logistics division in Europe, including the planned sale to the CMA CGM group of all the freight forwarding and logistics activities grouped under Bolloré Logistics. In addition, the BECCC representatives received legal training in 2023 to deepen discussions within this body.\n\nThe following noteworthy agreements were reached in 2023:\n\n- agreements following mandatory annual negotiations for 2023 in all of the Group's main subsidiaries in France;\n- an agreement on workplace gender equality, quality of life at work and working conditions signed at Bolloré Energy on May 2, 2023 and at IER on November 28, 2023;\n- a Bolloré telecommuting agreement for Bretagne branches on September 28, 2023;\n- IER modulation amendment on May 31, 2023;\n- Bolloré Logistics, Bolloré Logistics Martinique, Bolloré Logistics Guyane, Bolloré Logistics Guadeloupe, UES Bolloré Logistics La Réunion, BTLC, B'IS, Bolloré Energy and Nord Sud CTI agreements on professional elections.\n\n| (as a percentage)                                                                                              | 2023 | Of which<br>Bolloré Logistics | 2022* | Change<br>2023/2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|-------------------------------|-------|---------------------|\n| Percentage of entities where employees can benefit from union<br>representation and/or staff representation(3) | 36.1 | 36.8                          | 39.3% | -3.2 pt             |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from social reporting (see section 1.3.1.1. – Social reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators cover the Bolloré Group scope excluding the Communications sector to improve legibility in terms of the action described in this chapter.\n\n- Consolidated Group data including the Communications sector are presented, where available, in the social indicator summary tables (see section 1.3.1.

ACTING WITH INTEGRITY WHEN CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESS AND PROMOTING HUMAN RIGHTS IN OUR ACTIVITIES**\n\nThe intensification of regulatory and societal expectations has led the Group to phase in due diligence processes, in all its operations and as part of its business relationships. The Group is thus committed to an ethics policy based on commitments shared by all its subsidiaries, and it makes every effort to institute a framework that guarantees ethical practices that respect human rights in its business conduct.\n\n# **1.2.2.1. SHARING THE SAME BUSINESS ETHICS AND ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH THE STRICTEST STANDARDS**\n\n# **1.2.2.1.1. SHARING THE SAME BUSINESS ETHICS**\n\n# Group policy\n\nThe Bolloré Group has been committed since its creation to an ethical approach based on commitments shared across all its subsidiaries.\n\nA signatory of the United Nations Global Compact since 2003, the Bolloré Group has undertaken to support the fundamental principles of the Global Compact relating to human rights, working standards, the environment and the fight against corruption. As a signatory, the Group undertakes to include the 10 principles of the Global Compact into its strategy, culture and day-today operations but also to clearly inform its employees, partners, customers and the public of its commitment.\n\nThe Bolloré Group condemns corruption, influence peddling and anticompetitive practices. It ensures financial transparency, compliance with economic sanctions programs and the protection of personal data. It avoids attacks on the environment, human rights and the fundamental freedoms, health and safety of people. Lastly, it fights against all forms of discrimination and harassment.\n\nThe Bolloré Group's Code of Conduct reiterates these commitments and details the behavior expected of any person acting on its behalf.\n\nBecause individual actions must not compromise the collective commitment, it is the responsibility of each of the employees, agents and business partners of all Group companies to join it. The Bolloré Group does not tolerate any breach of its Code and encourages its stakeholders to report any action that would be contrary to it. The perpetrators of prohibited behavior are subject to disciplinary sanctions or legal proceedings in accordance with applicable law.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Corruption and influence peddling(1)\n\n#### *Prioritization of risks related to corruption and influence peddling(1)*\n\n| Transportation and logistics | Oil logistics  | Industry |       |         | Communications |\n|------------------------------|----------------|----------|-------|---------|----------------|\n| Bolloré Logistics            | Bolloré Energy | Blue     | Films | Systems | Vivendi        |\n\n(1) Priority non-financial risk.\n\nIn blue: priority non-financial risk at the division level. In gray: non-priority non-financial risk at the division level.\n\nThe Bolloré Group condemns all forms of corruption and influence peddling.

For more information on the management of CSR priority risks in the Communications sector, see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document in chapter 2 – 2.2. Main nonfinancial risks and opportunities.\n\n# International export controls and sanctions\n\nThe Bolloré Group complies with all sanctions, including those issued by the United Nations Security Council, the European Union and the United States of America, whether they be restrictive measures against a State, an individual or an organization. All persons acting on behalf of the Group must refrain from participating in transactions that could violate an embargo, sector-specific sanctions or asset freezes<sup>(3)</sup>.\n\n# **1.2.2.1.2. ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE STRICTEST STANDARDS**\n\nWithin the Bolloré Group, a dedicated organization ensures the effective implementation of a program based on the best standards in this area(7) in the three areas of compliance: the prevention of corruption and influence peddling, the prevention of anticompetitive practices and compliance with export controls and economic sanctions programs.\n\nThe management of corruption risks at the Vivendi group is based on the deployment of an anticorruption system that includes appropriate measures and procedures in support of four objectives: risk identification, risk prevention, risk detection and implementation of control measures. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2 – 3.2.1. The anticorruption system\n\n# Governance of compliance\n\nCompliance with the Bolloré Group's commitments is based on an effective and consistent system, common to all activities, implemented in particular by an organization responsible for ensuring its application:\n\n• the Board of Directors' Audit Committee, which monitors the three areas of compliance as part of its oversight of the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems;\n\nThe Bolloré Group(4) must observe the international, community and national regulations on export controls and economic sanctions that apply to the Group's business lines. Such regulations are enacted and updated actively by political entities at different levels: international organizations such as the UN, political and economic unions such as the European Union for their Member States, the countries themselves such as France and the United States of America.\n\nThe objective of export controls is to prevent goods from being diverted from peaceful civilian use, to control war materials and, for some States, to control strategic exports.\n\nEconomic and financial sanctions are an instrument of foreign policy of States and groups of States. They are intended to prohibit, restrict, or impose trade in targeted goods, technologies and services and may include measures for persons or entities related to States or groups of States. This includes territories, and natural or legal persons likely to represent a danger, and goods, equipment, or products classified as \"at risk\".\n\n# Compliance with competition provisions\n\nA healthy competitive environment conducive to innovation allows us to offer the best products and services to our customers.\n\nThe Bolloré Group does not engage in any practice aimed at unfairly distorting, hindering, suppressing or restricting free competition. Such practices include price fixing and dividing up market share and invitations to tender(5) .\n\nCompanies in the Bolloré Group(6) must comply, wherever they operate, with the rules of competition law laid down by States, the European Union and all international organizations. The rules prohibit, among other things, understandings, agreements, projects, formal and informal arrangements, or coordinated behavior between competitors whose purpose is to set their prices, the distribution of their territories, market shares or their customers.\n\n- Executive management sets the Group's targets and overall strategies, ensuring that all staff are informed of them;\n- the Ethics CSR and Anticorruption Committee, which defines and coordinates the implementation of the CSR approach in the Group and, as such, closely monitors the implementation and effectiveness of the Group's compliance system as described above, and;\n- the Group Chief Compliance Officer, who is responsible for implementing the compliance program, reports on the effectiveness of program to the Group's Audit Committee and the Ethics – CSR and Anticorruption Committee, and to the Group and division Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers.\n\nThe Compliance Department, created in 2008, oversees the effective implementation of the compliance program in all Group subsidiaries. Its staff of 10 includes managers, analysts, assistants and work-study students. To carry out its mission, it works in close collaboration with all operational and support functions (human resources and purchasing in particular) and relies on a network of compliance officers at all levels of the organization.\n\n- (1) The company itself and all its subsidiaries, within the meaning of article L. 233-1 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)*, or the companies it controls, within the meaning of article L. 233-3 of the same Code.\n- (2) Bolloré Group Code of Conduct, Anticorruption (p. 8).\n- (3) Bolloré Group Code of Conduct, Compliance with International Sanctions (p. 10).\n- (4) The company itself and all its subsidiaries, within the meaning of article L. 233-1 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)*, or the companies it controls, within the meaning of article L. 233-3 of the same Code.\n- (5) Bolloré Group Code of Conduct, Combating Anti-Competitive Practices (p. 10).\n- (6) The company itself and all its subsidiaries, within the meaning of article L. 233-1 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)*, or the companies it controls, within the meaning of article L. 233-3 of the same Code.\n- (7) In particular the recommendations of the French Anticorruption Agency (AFA) and those of the main regulatory authorities in these fields.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Compliance program for the fight against corruption and influence peddling, combating anticompetitive practices and compliance with international sanctions\n\nThe Bolloré Group is committed to satisfying all its stakeholders' expectations concerning business ethics, especially the prevention of corruption and influence peddling, the prevention of anticompetitive practices, and compliance with international sanctions.\n\nTo prevent, detect and deter breaches of its commitments, the Bolloré Group has deployed a compliance program inspired by the highest international standards(1) .\n\nThis program is founded on the following pillars:\n\n# **• Senior management's commitment**\n\nAt the highest level, the Group's senior management promotes a culture of integrity, transparency and compliance.\n\nIn terms of fighting corruption, the recommendations of the French Anticorruption Agency (Agence française anticorruption, AFA) supplement the system established by the Sapin II law and, as such, constitute the French Anticorruption standard, which the Bolloré Group applies.\n\nThis commitment is reflected in the Group's Code of Conduct. It relies in particular on a zero-tolerance policy for the risk of corruption, the inclusion of anticorruption requirements in procedures and policies, validation of the risk mapping, governance of the anticorruption prevention, detection and remediation program, and the implementation of a specific communications policy.\n\nThe same applies to the fight against anticompetitive practices, compliance with international sanctions and export controls in terms of approval of arrangements, codes of conduct, integration in procedures and policies, program governance and the implementation of a specific communication policy.\n\n# **• Risk mapping**\n\nThe mapping of corruption and influence peddling risks aims to identify, assess, prioritize and manage the inherent risks of corruption and influence peddling, taking into account the specific characteristics and diversity of our organizations in terms of business sectors, business lines or the geographical areas in which the Bolloré Group's activities and divisions operate.\n\nThe objective of the corruption and influence peddling risk mapping is to contribute to the management of risks covering all of the Group's managerial, operational and supports processes by giving compliance players the visibility necessary to establish proportionate prevention and detection measures adapted to the risks identified, so as to facilitate the implementation of these measures and any necessary remedial measures. The risk mapping was updated in 2022.\n\n# **• Risk management,through prevention, detection and remediation**\n\n# **Prevention**\n\n**• The Code of Conduct:** The Bolloré Group's ethical approach is based on values and principles embodied each day by all its executives and employees worldwide.\n\nThe Bolloré Group Code of Conduct details, for all employees and partners, the behavior expected in at-risk situations.\n\nIn particular, it reiterates the Group's zero-tolerance policy on corruption, its rejection of anticompetitive practices and its commitment to comply with all international sanctions. The Bolloré Group Code of Conduct applies to all persons acting on its behalf. It is incorporated into the internal regulations of all Group subsidiaries; employees who violate it are subject to disciplinary actions in accordance with applicable law. It can be found on the Group's website and must be distributed to all its partners, as an integral part of its expectations.\n\nThe Bolloré Group does not tolerate any breach of its Code and encourages its stakeholders to report any action that would be contrary to it via the professional whistleblowing system.\n\n**• Awareness-raising and training:** The Bolloré Group deploys a training system to ensure that all its employees have a good understanding of its Code of Conduct, in particular its zero-tolerance policy on corruption, its rejection of anticompetitive practices and its commitment to comply with all international sanctions programs.\n\nIn addition, employees in business lines identified as being at risk are subject to additional training through e-learning sessions on specific risks (gifts, bribery) and procedures aimed at preventing them.\n\nThis mandatory training path must be completed by all new employees and repeated every two years. The completion of these training courses is reviewed during annual appraisals.\n\n**• Third-party assessment:** the Bolloré Group ensures that its intermediaries, suppliers, subcontractors and customers adhere to the same business ethics.\n\nSpecific procedures for each activity, developed using a risk-based approach and a mapping of the types of third parties involved, are designed to ensure their integrity, and to verify and secure all business relationships upstream, within the normative framework of the AFA's recommendations. The teams who carry out this work ensure all third parties strictly comply with the values set out in the Bolloré Group's Code of Conduct and adhere to the regulations in force. The Group's objective is to instill in the DNA of its exposed managerial and operational teams, the absolute necessity of adopting and adhering to the anticorruption due diligence rules, an essential protective shield for the reputation and respectability of the Bolloré Group.\n\nTo this end, the dedicated procedures established for intermediaries and suppliers include a questionnaire and the collection of documents that will enable the required due diligence work to be carried out.\n\nThis consists of assessing a company's legal, social, shareholder and professional standing – in short, its reputation – and its strict compliance with national and international laws and regulations on anticorruption. It is prohibited to enter into any business relationship before obtaining approval from the Compliance Department (see chapter 2 – Bolloré Group duty of care plan).\n\n# **Detection**\n\n**• Whistleblowing system:** a mechanism that enables employees of the Bolloré Group companies and its external and occasional partners to alert it of a crime or an offense, a breach of the law or regulations, a threat to the general interest, or a failure to follow the Bolloré Group's Code of Conduct resulting from the activities of Group companies or of their subcontractors or suppliers.\n\nThis system, which can be accessed from the Bolloré Group's website and at alert.bollore.com, enables individuals to report actions that go against its anticorruption policy or that violate human rights.\n\nIn principle, the use of this system requires the identification of the whistleblower, unless the report provides sufficient details to establish the severity of the facts.\n\nReports are processed by specially authorized persons covered by an obligation of confidentiality.\n\nThe Group protects whistleblowers who act in good faith from any form of reprisal.\n\nThis whistleblowing system supplements but does not replace other internal reporting methods (such as the managerial reporting line).\n\n**• Anticorruption accounting controls and financial controls:** identified using the corruption risk map, specific anticorruption controls are in place at different levels of the organization. With respect to sanctions, financial controls are carried out on our transactions to ensure compliance with sanctions.\n\n**• The system's internal control and evaluation mechanism:** a three-level control system is applied to ensure the effectiveness of the anticorruption compliance program, which is subject to specific controls by the Group's Internal Audit Department.\n\n(1) Notably the guidelines of the AFA, the American FCPA, the American OFAC and the British Serious Fraud Office.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Remediation**\n\n**• Definition of corrective measures and disciplinary regime:** the updating of the mapping and the detection system through program controls and internal system assessments give rise to specific action plans ensuring the necessary remediation. In disciplinary terms, the perpetrators of prohibited behavior are subject to disciplinary sanctions or legal proceedings in accordance with applicable law.\n\n# Highlights\n\nThe French Anticorruption Agency continued its monitoring activities in 2023 under the judicial public interest agreement (CJIP). This monitoring, which applies to the company itself and all its subsidiaries, within the meaning of article L. 233-1 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* or the companies it controls, within the meaning of article L. 233-3 of the same Code, was completed in March 2023.\n\nFor more information, refer to chapter 3 on risk factors and internal control (see chapter 3 – 1.3. Legal risks).\n\nIn addition, in 2023 as in previous years, the many requests from third parties during the year led the Compliance Department to take action to meet the expectations of stakeholders in the field of anticorruption as well as regards controls on exports and compliance with international sanctions, which were again a major issue during the fiscal year.\n\n# Results and performance indicators\n\nThe results for the year are broadly in line with the deployment targets set.\n\n# **• Senior management's commitment.**\n\n#### This commitment includes:\n\n• expressing the managing body's commitment to the fight against corruption, as every year since 2018, on International Anticorruption Day (December 9). For the occasion, Marie Bolloré, Chief Executive Officer of the Systems division, and Fabricio Protti, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Bolloré Group, reaffirmed the Bolloré Group's determination to fight this scourge.\n\nThe awareness-raising initiative involved more than 2,500 employees around the world in webinars aimed at reviewing the challenges of the fight against corruption and the Group's work in this area;\n\n- monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of the anticorruption compliance program, compliance with competition rules and international sanctions by the three governance bodies, namely the Group Audit Committee, the Ethics – CSR and Anticorruption Committee and, month after month, by the Group's Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers and its activities; by the communications made by these same governing bodies at the head office and in the field;\n- assessing the performance of the main managers of the subsidiaries in the Transportation and logistics division, and setting up and holding Anticorruption Committee meetings. These committee meetings are the local point of contact for the commitment of senior management in each of the Group's entities;\n- reinforcing momentum in this area by updating the corruption risk mapping for all the Group's activities, the impacts identified by this update, in particular on the prevention tool in the form of the Code of Conduct, the detection of anticorruption accounting controls and remediation through specific action plans resulting from this updating of the mapping.\n\n# **• Corruption and influence peddling risk mapping**\n\nThe Group updated its mapping to apply a standardized methodology to allow consolidation at Group level.\n\nThis risk mapping update began in 2022 and continued in 2023 using the following methodology:\n\n• inventory of all operational and supports processes and sub-processes applicable to the various Bolloré Group activities;\n\n- central risk inventory: the risk scenarios to which the Bolloré Group is exposed were identified during individual interviews or workshops conducted with Group employees;\n- inventory of control resources: following individual interviews, workshops and contribution reports, the Compliance Department conducted internal work sessions aimed at identifying, with the relevant managers, the elements contributing to the control system implemented in the Bolloré Group. This work supplemented the business control environment already identified by the Group's employees questioned for the update;\n- development of a matrix to identify all identified risks and their ratings;\n- local risk inventory: the Compliance Department asked Group subsidiaries to decide on the processes and sub-processes identified, as well as the related risks. In 2023, 63 subsidiaries were surveyed. This exercise will continue until 2024, and;\n- inventory of action plans: identification of risk scenarios requiring action plans, definition of action plans and the central implementation method in the subsidiaries.\n\n# **• The Code of Conduct**\n\nThe Group's Code of Conduct, updated in 2020, is appended to the internal rules of procedure of all Group subsidiaries that have internal rules. The Code of Conduct was distributed to Group employees as described below (see Awareness and Training). A new update is planned for 2024 on the themes identified during the update of the mapping begun in 2022.\n\n# **• The whistleblowing system**\n\nEmployees are informed about how the professional whistleblowing system works and the terms and guarantees of use – in particular the protection of whistleblowers acting in good faith from any form of reprisal.\n\n# **• The awareness-raising and training system**\n\nThe Bolloré Group Code of Conduct and all components of its compliance program can be viewed on the dedicated intranet space. It is also distributed in print form, in emails and in posters during communication campaigns.\n\nTo assess the level of employee awareness, the following question was added to the annual appraisal form: \"Are you aware of the Bolloré Group's Code of Conduct and whistleblowing system?\" According to the analysis of the 2022-2023 campaign, 98% of the staff polled were aware of it.\n\nThe Code of Conduct and the whistleblowing procedure are also disseminated via the Code of Conduct e-learning module, which was updated in 2023 and completed by 12,485 employees (i.e. 95% of the target workforce). They are also publicized during awareness-raising actions (webinars to coincide with International Anticorruption Day), after which more than 2,500 participants were invited to vouch for their understanding of the Code of Conduct and the whistleblowing system.\n\nAn additional seven-module training campaign targeted employees belonging to business lines considered at risk (gifts, bribery, etc.) and focused on the corresponding procedures meant to prevent the specific risks. This second campaign resulted in 23,667 enrollments and a completion rate of 90%.\n\n# **• Third parties**\n\nAll of the Group's procedures have been reviewed and deployed in the Group's divisions and subsidiaries.\n\nA mapping of the Group's third parties was carried out and all third parties (intermediaries, suppliers and customers) eligible for an anticorruption assessment based on their category were screened and analyzed. Thus, this due diligence work initiated in 2020 and 2021 for some of the third parties was repeated this year in accordance with the three-year review rule included in the procedures (which of course excludes third parties whose alert systems require annual review).\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **• Anticorruption accounting controls**\n\nAs the process of identifying the controls to be carried out based on the risk mapping and the drafting of action to be carried out during these controls at the various levels of the organization were finalized in previous exercises, these controls were deployed in 2021. A number of missions to assist in implementing Sapin II accounting controls were carried out and level three anticorruption accounting controls were rolled out during field audits of the subsidiaries from spring 2021.\n\n# **1.2.2.1.3. THE FIGHT AGAINST TAX EVASION**\n\nFurther to the enactment of law no. 2018-898 of October 23, 2018 on the fight against tax, social security and customs fraud and the provisions of article L. 22-10-36 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* the Group has launched several actions to comply with the requirements of this new law.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Bolloré Group fulfills its tax obligations in compliance with local and international laws in force, pursuant to Code of Conduct and its Ethics and CSR Charter. The Bolloré Group does not tolerate any breach of these commitments.\n\n# Management of tax risk at the Bolloré Group level\n\nIn accordance with its commitments as set out in its tax policy and Code of Conduct, the Bolloré Group expects each subsidiary and each employee to strictly comply, in all circumstances, with the laws and regulations in force in the countries where the Group operates and with applicable international conventions. The Bolloré Group Tax Department is responsible for enforcing these commitments.\n\nSatisfactory organizational methods have been set up at the Group's Finance Departments to avert tax risks and to ensure that tax is calculated and paid correctly within the time limits in the States where it is owed and that tax filing requirements are met.\n\nBecause of its business model, the main risks that Bolloré Group entities are likely to encounter are reporting (late or inaccurate tax filing) and technical (misinterpretation of a regulation, unexpected legislative change, etc.) risks. These tax topics, which contribute to the quality of financial and accounting information, are regularly reviewed by the chief financial officers of each Bolloré Group entity, particularly during calls for tenders and when giving financial reports, whether during monthly meetings or during the preparation of interim or annual financial statements. The CFOs report directly to the Chairmen, members of the Boards of Directors, if any, or to the competent body of their reporting entity, as well as to the CFO at the next organizational level. They must ensure that financial data are prepared in accordance with the standards, principles and procedures in force and that they are reported reliably in accounting systems, which are themselves regularly monitored.\n\nWith the exception of the logistics activity, which by its nature involves operational flows between the various entities, cross-border intra-Group flows are limited and insignificant. They mainly consist of trademark fees, Bolloré SE services, and short- and medium-term financing for operational or external growth needs. The invoicing principles applied in this respect are in line with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) principles applicable to transfer pricing. These principles notably incorporate the recommendations issued as part of the 2015 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (Beps) project and take into account value creation, in addition to compliance with the arm's length principle.\n\nIn the context of their operational activities and/or investments, subsidiaries may be assisted by the Group Tax Department and/or by external tax advisors for any tax-related matters. When an outside consultant is involved, it undertakes to respect the commitments of the Bolloré Group.\n\nAn update made necessary by the mapping exercise carried out in 2022 identified the adaptations that will be implemented in 2023. Compliance with international sanctions is monitored through existing financial controls.\n\n# **• Internal control and evaluation system**\n\nBased on a specific audit of the general anticorruption compliance system aimed at assessing its various components, a level three control system was established in 2023 with a dedicated compliance auditing team within the Internal Audit department and presented at the meeting of the Ethics – CSR and Anticorruption Committee held on July 18, 2023.\n\nWhen a tax risk is identified, solutions are developed, scaled and implemented, in conjunction with the Group Tax Department and the appropriate Finance Departments, in order to minimize the risk. These analyses and solutions are regularly re-evaluated as projects evolve and laws and regulations change. Where appropriate, they are discussed and reviewed with auditors and/or competent tax authorities. The Group expects its subsidiaries to maintain transparent and constructive relations with the tax authorities in the countries in which they operate.\n\nWhen a company in the Group is the subject of a tax audit, the appropriate personnel and/or outside advisers are assigned to the tax audit to ensure that it is carried out without complications and is completed as quickly as possible.\n\nThe Bolloré Group also ensures that the following principles are respected:\n\n- transparency with tax authorities to foster quality relations to avoid any risk to the Group's reputation when local legislation and practices allow this. The Bolloré Group considers that such relationships engender longterm benefits for both the Group and local tax authorities;\n- fighting tax evasion by refusing to locate profits in tax havens. Localization is possible in States with beneficial tax systems if this is economically justified, i.e. the motivation is not mainly fiscal, and;\n- compliance of its tax policy with its sustainable development strategy by prohibiting any operation for which the main purpose is essentially to seek a tax gain, unless expressly allowed by the legislator.\n\nFor the last two points, the Group may use options provided for by local regulations in order to mitigate its tax or administrative burden. Thus, the Bolloré Group uses the legal provisions of the research tax credit (in France) and may create tax consolidation groups in countries where the law allows it. Nevertheless, in all cases, the Group undertakes to act with integrity in the conduct of its business and to fight tax evasion. Accordingly, then the Bolloré Group does business in a country whose taxation is considered preferential or which appears on the French list of non-cooperative countries or territories or on the European black or gray list of tax havens, it is solely because of its operational activities. When financial flows are being considered with one of these countries or States, the Group's Tax Department must be informed without delay.\n\n# Actions and procedures set up to combat tax evasion\n\nA tax section has been added to the Group's Code of Conduct in order to make public the Group's policy to combat tax evasion and the behaviors to be followed in order to meet these commitments.\n\nFurthermore a dedicated website is accessible to the Group's employees and commercial partners. It is part of the Group's professional whistleblowing system to issue alerts concerning actions that constitute or are liable to constitute tax evasion.\n\nThe Group continues to raise awareness among all Group staff and its business partners about preventing and combating tax evasion.\n\nThe Bolloré Group's legal and tax teams have already been deployed at central and local levels to advise and assist the Group's operational staff on a daily basis to ensure proper compliance with the applicable laws and regulations, in particular as part of the fight against tax evasion. They can also obtain advice from outside legal and tax experts, especially law firms.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.2.2.2. PROMOTING HUMAN RIGHTS IN OUR VALUE CHAIN**\n\n# **1.2.2.2.1. RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS**\n\n# Risks related to human rights(1)\n\n#### *Prioritization of human rights risks*\n\n| Transportation and logistics | Oil logistics  | Industry |       |         | Communications |\n|------------------------------|----------------|----------|-------|---------|----------------|\n| Bolloré Logistics            | Bolloré Energy | Blue     | Films | Systems | Vivendi        |\n\n(1) Priority non-financial risk.\n\nIn blue: priority non-financial risk at the division level. In gray: non-priority non-financial risk at the division level.\n\nOwing to its strong international presence, the Group hires many people, directly or indirectly, in institutional contexts that vary from one country to another, where human rights are at times threatened. That is why respect and promotion of human rights have been defined as a priority for the Group, covering issues such as guaranteeing decent working conditions, promoting social dialog and freedom of association of trade unions, the principle of non-discrimination (respect of the rights of individuals regardless of their origin, gender, sexual orientation, political or trade union membership, or their state of health, etc.) and the fight against all forms of harassment. It should be noted that forced labor and child labor represent an absolute priority for the Group in terms of prevention and action. These risks are controlled by the measures and internal controls set up to hire employees.\n\nThe identification and handling of these risks are subject to measures aimed at the Group's internal scope, its external stakeholders, and its supply and subcontracting chain. These measures are detailed in the chapter on the Group's duty of care plan (see chapter 2 – Bolloré Group's duty of care plan).\n\nThe human rights risks related to the activities of the Communications sector mainly cover issues around discrimination and harassment (psychological and sexual) of employees in their working environment, and those related to lack of information and support for consumers with using products and services marketed by the Vivendi group (for more information, see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 3.2.2. – duty of care plan).\n\n# Group policy\n\nThe Group strives to implement governance that reflects its values in the countries in which it operates in full compliance with local and international regulations. As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact since 2003 and having made this issue a fundamental pillar of its CSR strategy, the Bolloré Group has formally included dedicated commitments in its Group ethics system, consisting of the Code of Conduct, the Group Ethics and CSR Charter, the Responsible Purchasing Charter, the Diversity and Inclusion Charter and the Human Rights Charter.\n\nThe Code of Conduct sets out the expected behaviors of all persons acting on behalf of the Bolloré Group and formalizes recommendations to prevent, identify and report contrary actions. The Ethics & CSR Charter, signed by Cyrille Bolloré, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Group, identifies the major commitments associated with the Group's strategy, including \"Acting with integrity in our business conduct and promoting human rights\". It forms the basis of the Group's fundamental commitments from which the more in-depth policies or procedures are derived according to the issues identified as priorities. As such, the Group's Charter of Human Rights and the Group's Responsible Purchasing Charter integrates and strengthens these ethical measures by structuring a specific approach backed by international standards, particularly:\n\n- the International Charter on human rights;\n- the UN Guiding Principles on Business and human rights;\n- the OECD guidelines for multinational companies;\n- the International Labor Organization's core conventions, and;\n- the recommendations of the French Anticorruption Agency.\n\nThe commitments expressed in the Group's Human Rights Charter are also among the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and are rolled out under three main themes:\n\n- respect for the rights of workers throughout our value chain;\n- respect for the fundamental rights of communities close to our operations, and;\n- constant efforts to make a positive contribution to society.\n- In order to meet the commitments expressed in the Charter, the approach is based on a division of missions between:\n- the Group, which has a role of awareness-raising, training, mobilization, steering, pooling and reporting via the Group CSR Department, and;\n- the divisions and subsidiaries, which are responsible for operational implementation by including elements specific to their own business lines, as well as the necessary adaptations for their regions, entrusted to a division, or a CSR or Ethics Officer reporting to their Executive management.\n\nThe governance of ethical challenges is handled by Executive management through the Risk Committee and the Ethics – CSR and Anticorruption Committee, which meet once or twice a year to set guidelines that will be applied by the departments concerned and rolled out to the operational services (see chapter 1 – section 1.1.3. – CSR governance). The governance of ethical issues and more specifically human rights is ensured at the operational level through Human Rights Steering Committees bringing together the CSR, Group Compliance, and Group Human Resources Departments and the legal and purchasing business lines depending on the matters addressed. CSR and HR Steering Committee meetings are also held on a bimonthly basis to specifically address social and human rights issues.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Objectives and progress\n\n| Area of action                                                                                                          | Group objectives                                                                                                                                                | Horizon              | Progress at 12/31/2023                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Governance                                                                                                              | • Ensure the organization of the Human Rights Operational Steering Committee over the long term                                                                 | Annual               | • Target achieved.

RESPECT FOR WORKERS' RIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE VALUE CHAIN**\n\nTo promote human rights and ensure they are respected, the Group has always considered health, safety and the quality of working conditions as a major issue across the whole of its value chain. The Group's first human rights action plan to formalize this approach in accordance with regulations was rolled out over the 2019-2020 period and was built with a cyclical approach based on three key aspects (communication, awareness-raising and formalization). This action plan:\n\n• structured the Group's human rights approach;\n\n• incorporated new processes in the conduct of its operations, and;\n\n• continued the deployment and proper appropriation of these issues.\n\nSince then, the approach has been to strengthen the culture of vigilance among employees and the systems deployed for suppliers and subcontractors.\n\n# Employees\n\nRespect for workers' rights is based on the following issues: the health and safety of persons involved in the Group's activities, compensation, management of working hours and paid leave, diversity and the fight against discrimination, employee representation, and the fight against forced labor and child labor. These issues are set out and illustrated by indicators in the Group's duty of care plan.\n\nTo guarantee the proper appropriation of its principles and commitments among employees, the Group organizes human rights awareness-raising actions, including awareness-raising training modules (a specific human rights module and a module dedicated to compliance with the Code of Conduct, which also addresses human rights) have enabled more than 90% of employees to be informed about these issues.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nSince 2021, the Human Rights Steering Committee, including the CSR contacts of the Group's divisions and subsidiaries, as well as the support functions (legal, human resources, purchasing, compliance, etc.) has focused on the identification of a human rights priority scope (see section 2.3.2.1. – Human rights priority scope, within the Bolloré Group's duty of care plan) for the deployment of its approach and the action plans selected. Through dedicated bimonthly committee meetings, the CSR Departments and Group HR Department are working together to formalize a common framework to codevelop human rights roadmaps and action plans. In 2023, the strategy was organized around three types of actions:\n\n• the definition of an internal audit schedule, and;\n\n• the deployment of a project to address living wages.\n\nIn view of the change in its scope after the Bolloré Group sold all its activities on the African continent in December 2022, the human rights priority scope has refocused on freight forwarding activities in the Asia region. In 2023, of the 76 Bolloré Logistics entities, 31 entities were identified as priorities (see Duty of care plan 2.3.2.1 Human rights priority scope). These entities are located in 22 countries, more than half of which are in Asia-Pacific. The priority human rights scope will once again change in 2024, following the announcement in 2023 of the planned sale of Bolloré Logistics.\n\n• the implementation of specific measures in response to the challenges identified (the prioritization of issues relating to work time management was chosen in 2022);\n\n# *Human rights awareness module indicators*\n\n| (as a percentage)                                          | Americas | Asia/Pacific | Europe and<br>Middle East | France and overseas<br>departments, regions<br>and authorities | 2023 Total |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Percentage of employees trained in the human rights module | 88.9     | 94.6         | 91.8                      | 87.9                                                           | 90.8       |\n\n# **1.2.2.2.3. MAIN ACTIONS CARRIED OUT IN 2023**\n\n# **• Creation of a network of human rights officers**\n\nIn accordance with the pledges made in 2022, to strengthen the Group's organization and the cascading of its commitments locally, the Human Rights Steering Committee appointed dedicated officers among the teams in the local Human Resources Departments. These officers are essential points of contact for the head office and are responsible for:\n\n- ensuring that the Group's social and human rights commitments (defined in the Human Rights Charter and Diversity and Inclusion Charter) are applied to direct employees of the Group and its subcontractors;\n- reporting high-risk situations or conduct internal investigations.\n- implementing concrete due diligence measures and action plans developed at the head office;\n- contributing to the collection and reporting of local information from the HR and CSR Departments, as part of regulatory disclosures, and;\n- coordinating social compliance audits of clients to support local teams. This network of officers was finalized in 2023. It comprises more than 38 employees who have been educated on social compliance issues through various workshops and webinars, particularly in the Asia, Pacific and Middle East region. On-site training was organized in 7 countries (Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) to reinforce the awareness-raising effort.\n\n# **• Deployment of an internal audit approach**\n\nIn 2023, various assessments and surveys were carried out internally, particularly with regard to the priority issues identified by the Steering Committee, such as compensation and monitoring of working hours. The team in charge of social issues and human rights within the Human Resources Department has developed a social compliance audit questionnaire for the local staff to conduct self-assessments and internal controls within their operational scope, combined with document reviews and site visits within the priority scope. In the Asia-Pacific region, this covers Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. These self-assessments, inspired by the methodologies employed by international audit firms, address all social compliance topics and include various questions on the following issues: job security, working hours, living wages, social dialog, freedom of association, existence of works councils and workers' rights to information, consultation and participation, collective bargaining (including the percentage of the company's workforce covered by collective bargaining agreements), work-life balance, health and safety, gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value, training and skills development, employment and inclusion of people with disabilities, measures to combat violence and harassment in the workplace, diversity, child labor, forced labor, adequate housing, and privacy.\n\nIn 2023, 16 on-site self-assessments were carried out, including the head offices and main warehouses of the 7 selected countries. This approach did not identify any major non-conformities, and various areas for improvement were reported to the local departments. In the first half of 2024, Bolloré Logistics' Human Resources Department will set up a monitoring unit at the head office to coordinate the deployment of corrective actions.\n\nIn addition, an alert management protocol was put in place in 2023 to strengthen Bolloré Logistics' ability to manage any alerts on social and human rights issues and requests for external audits.\n\n# **• Deployment of a long-term project on living wages**\n\nIn line with the commitments announced in 2022, the Steering Committee approved the launch of a pilot project on living wages. This project, which was rolled out in 2023, helped develop the Group's requirements on certain social issues. As a catalyst for lifting people out of poverty and as a means of guaranteeing and respecting human rights, the question of a living wage has been identified as a priority issue in the Group's CSR commitments.\n\n# Methodology\n\n- While there is no universal definition of living wages, the project relied on the following definition: a living wage is a wage that allows workers to meet their basic needs and those of their families, and to have discretionary income to deal with other expenses. It takes into account factors such as the cost of housing, health care, education and other basic needs. A living wage is often higher than the legal minimum wage and reflects the cost of living in a given place.\n- For this initial exercise, the study focused exclusively on direct employees, looking at the wages earned for full-time equivalent working hours (excluding part-time work and overtime), and was carried out by the Group Human Resources teams with help from the network of human rights officers.\n- The 10 countries(1) selected for the project account for approximately 33% of Bolloré Logistics' total workforce. They were picked from the priority human rights scope based on their representativeness of the diversity of freight forwarding operations. The different regional socio-economic contexts were taken into account to define the thresholds that correspond to a living wage for each region, as the real cost of living can be very different from one place to another within the same country.\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\n- The methodology was based on:\n- wage levels established in existing international, national or sub-national legislation, as well as, where applicable, official standards or collective bargaining agreements aligned with an assessment of the wage level necessary to achieve a decent standard of living;\n- where applicable, on the national or sub-national minimum wage established by laws or collective bargaining;\n- in the absence of, or in addition to, the benchmarks defined by the Sustainable Trade Initiative (IDH), including applicable benchmarks compatible with the Anker methodology or provided by the WageIndicator Foundation or the Fair Wage Network, provided that they guarantee the primacy of collective bargaining for establishing the terms and conditions of employment.\n- The expert firm also referenced:\n- external data and benchmarks aligned with the Anker methodology to identify local living wage thresholds, making it possible to overcome the various gaps in existing benchmarks that are not systematically updated and, for example, do not necessarily take into account recent inflation or lack territorial granularity;\n- a guided process ensuring effective internal engagement to collect, aggregate and compare actual salary data internally, and understand what may or may not be eligible.\n\nThe expert firm was able to consult with the human rights officers in the Human Resources Department at the head office, who leveraged the network of Bolloré Logistics officers and held awareness-raising workshops and presentations on the methodologies. The purpose of this internal approach was to involve the local human resources teams in collecting the information necessary to carry out the study. Their participation and full involvement in the approach was identified as essential for data collection.\n\nDuring the study, it was observed that in most of the countries analyzed, the Group's employee benefits are what make it possible to reach or exceed the living wage threshold. Examples include medical insurance (which is sometimes extended to family members) that covers personal accidents, disability, outpatient consultations, emergencies, hospitalization or serious illnesses, as well as the 13th month contractual bonus granted to employees in some regions.\n\nHowever, some employee benefits related to annual leave, personal events such as weddings or religious holidays, and non-contractual bonuses (e.g. seniority and performance bonuses) are not included in the living wage calculation, even though they are often a significant source of income.\n\n# Results\n\nThis understanding of the various thresholds acquired by applying the Anker methodology will enable Bolloré Logistics to launch an initiative within the Human Resources Department in 2024 to work on the compensation structure for 146 employees identified during this pilot project whose analysis considered direct employees, or 4,349 staff members.\n\nThis initiative showed:\n\n- that internal staff are proficient in the data collection and processing methodology and calculation tools;\n- a detailed analysis of the various remuneration structures and confirmation of the Group's best practices.\n\n# Suppliers and subcontractors\n\nThe Group is focusing its efforts on the implementation and deployment of measures to enable it to exercise reasonable duty of care with regard to suppliers and subcontractors, in line with the measures in place for its own employees. The Human Rights Charter states that the Group's contractors and business partners must adhere to its principles, which are also reiterated in the Responsible Purchasing Charter. The implementation of the responsible purchasing approach is reflected in particular in:\n\n- a due diligence approach in the selection of suppliers and subcontractors, which systematically receive information on the Group's ethical measures before entering into the contractual relationship so that they can comply with them. Although the supplier selection and evaluation process is not consolidated in a single management tool, the Group Purchasing Department and the subsidiaries take account of ethical and compliance criteria in their purchasing process, above and beyond the standard financial, administrative and technical criteria required to fulfill the Group's commitments; a policy for assessing the integrity of suppliers and subcontractors, formalized by the Compliance Department;\n- a Responsible Purchasing Department working in particular to strengthen human rights aspects in ethical procedures;\n- the drafting and inclusion of a CSR clause and an anticorruption and compliance clause in contracts, illustrating the implementation of the Group's responsible purchasing approach, and;\n- the development of guidelines and the organization of specific information meetings to support company lawyers and purchasing teams in negotiations with business partners regarding the inclusion of this clause.\n\nThe training campaign for human rights officers designated for the priority scope in 2023 in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, covered due diligence topics such as the working conditions to implement, especially when using local employment agencies. The employment of migrant workers was a key focus. As such, employees of subcontracting companies were included in the self-assessments conducting on the priority scope in 2023. Furthermore, preventive and corrective actions were deployed follow up on this approach, including the integration of part of the management of indirect employees into the operational and HR internal control mechanisms. One example is the updating of working time monitoring processes in certain priority countries, where connected biometric systems have been installed to replace the physical time-clock machines used by subcontracting companies to monitor their workers. This made it possible to include subcontractors in the automated HR information system dedicated to payroll and working time management. These measures were put in place after educating and collaborating with local employment agencies, and make the monitoring and control of working hours and remuneration more reliable.\n\nActions tackling the specific risks associated with migrant workers were also implemented. During the audits carried out in 2022 at industrial sites in Malaysia, this issue was identified as requiring special duty of care efforts. Thus, the local and regional HR teams held discussions and worked with the employment agencies identified as using foreign workers to order to validate the guarantees provided in connection to hiring and accommodation conditions. In particular, a team organized a trip to Nepal, which is a country of origin for many foreign workers employed by Malaysian service providers. The team conducted an in-depth due diligence initiative and deployed measures to prevent the risk of debt bondage (e.g., verification of contracts, verification of hiring procedures, verification that the agency charges no upstream fees, confirmation that the terms of the contract are written in a language understood by the worker, etc.).\n\n# *In 2023*\n\n- All subcontractors and suppliers managed centraly by the Group Purchasing Department received the Group's Responsible Purchasing Charter. As stipulated in the Charter, the Bolloré Group expects the signatory to take all reasonable measures to ensure that its own supply chain complies with these commitments.\n- 98% of purchasing staff were made aware of human rights and ethical issues through awareness-raising modules or dedicated sessions.\n- All new contracts include the CSR clause.\n- The Bolloré Group's responsible purchasing strategy is described in the duty of care plan.\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.2.2.2.4. RESPECT OF THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORS CLOSE TO OUR OPERATIONS AND CONSTANT EFFORTS TO MAKE A POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY**\n\nAs part of an exercise to map risks and contextualize its human rights challenges, the Bolloré Group has identified this as a pillar of its commitment since its operations are liable to impact local populations and communities close to its operating sites, particularly in developing countries. In line with the procedure set out in its duty of care plan, Bolloré Group entities apply a process of reasonable diligence towards these external stakeholders in order to:\n\n- ensure their security with regard to the Group's activities (see section 1.2.1.2.2. – Promoting social dialog and quality working conditions);\n- offer them open dialog to ensure that they have a right to free and informed consent as well as collaboration opportunities (meetings with public authorities and neighboring communities) and in addition, provide them with a system through which they can raise concerns and file complaints, if necessary (see \"Establishing a whistleblowing and reporting system\" in the Group duty of care plan);\n- promote the right to a healthy environment by protecting the environment and preventing impacts on air and soil quality, access to drinking water and natural resources and other disturbances (see section 1.2.3. – Innovating in response to major environmental challenges).\n\nThe Group is also working on a progress initiative that sees it taking all reasonable and appropriate measures to optimize the positive external impacts of its operations throughout the value chain. In addition, the commitment to regional development is a major focus of the Group's CSR strategy (see section 1.1.2. – The Bolloré Group's non-financial risk mapping). As the Group is sometimes the leading employer in regions heavily impacted by development challenges (unemployment, infrastructure shortage, etc.), it is reinforcing its positive societal footprint, particularly through its sponsorship initiatives (see section 1.2.4.3. – Sponsorship policy), but also through its activities, which contribute to the opening up of territories, innovation and economic dynamism (local purchases, taxation and taxes, transfer of skills). More than 99.6% of employees are recruited locally. Moreover, the Bolloré Group relies on numerous partnerships with the schools and universities in its regions of operation, thus contributing to the dynamism of the regions in which it does business. Its training policy – open to employees of subcontractors in some regions – and the health coverage and vaccination campaigns it offers employees in regions lacking health facilities, also further its positive societal contribution.\n\n# **1.2.3. INNOVATING IN RESPONSE TO MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES**\n\nIn order to anticipate major societal changes and support the adaptations necessary for sustainable development, such as a reduction in the footprint of human activities on the environment or the promotion of the energy transition, the Bolloré Group is deploying mitigation measures for its adverse impacts, strengthening its climate strategy by setting goals for itself and investing for the long term in order to offer innovative low-carbon products and services. To support this approach, for more than ten years, the Group has relied on environmental reporting that covered 95% of the workforce (excluding Communications) and has drawn on a network of more than 300 contributors. To measure its performance and the efforts made to reduce negative environmental externalities related to its activities, the Group monitors the following indicators on an annual basis:\n\n- changes in direct and indirect energy-related GHG emissions (scopes 1 and 2), including the measurement of GHG emissions related to fuel, electricity and heating consumption;\n- changes in indirect GHG emissions related to the Group's operations (scope 3 and any scope 3 item deemed representative with regard to the activities is recognized), including the measurement of GHG emissions related to purchases of raw materials, freight, waste and business travel;\n- governance of environmental issues by the entities (policies, management systems, certifications, etc.), pollution and accident management, waste treatment and recyclability management, water management, share of consumption of electricity from renewable sources, etc. (see section 1.3.2.1 – CSR reporting methodology note).\n\n**Through its** *Creation for the Planet* commitment, Vivendi aims to help curb climate change and is pursuing a carbon reduction trajectory validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative. The group is also committed to getting its partners and suppliers involved in its approach and, thus further contribute to the global offsetting of carbon emissions. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 4.1. – *Creation for the Planet:* our environmental roadmap.\n\n# **1.2.3.1. REDUCING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AND ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\nTo clarify the Group's commitments, the presentation of \"Climate change risks and opportunities\" is aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Therefore, the Group has analyzed the main risks related to climate change in accordance with the international reporting framework (see section 1.3.3.2. – TCFD crossreference table).\n\n# **1.2.3.1.1. CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES**\n\n# *Prioritization of climate change risks(1)*\n\n| Transportation and logistics | Oil logistics  | Industry | Industry | Industry | Communications |\n|------------------------------|----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|\n| Bolloré Logistics            | Bolloré Energy | Blue     | Films    | Systems  | Vivendi        |\n\n(1) Priority non-financial risk. In blue: priority non-financial risk at the division level.\n\nThe Bolloré Group has identified the challenges associated with climate change as priorities for all of its activities. The challenges raised by climate change concern the entire Group: the increase and intensification of extreme weather events are likely to significantly disrupt all of the Group's operations. For this reason, the Bolloré Group has continued and refined its transition risk analysis in order to strengthen its resilience approach in its business strategy (see section 1.2.3.1.3. – Management of the Group to reduce the impact of its operations on climate change), as well as an analysis of physical risks, which is needed to formalize adaptation plans.\n\nThe Vivendi group also identified the fight against climate change and adaptation strategies as major issues in its materiality matrix (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 2.3. – The main risks related to climate change).\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Key climate change transition risks and opportunities associated with the energy transition\n\nIn 2020, climate risks and opportunities were mapped for Bolloré's activities excluding Vivendi and, separately, for Vivendi's activities.

The study was conducted based on the IPCC's RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 scenarios for 2030 and 2050. The Group decided to use the RCP8.5 scenario, the most pessimistic scenario regarding the concentration of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, to identify its main risks of exposure by 2050. Exposure was not assessed for the hazards identified as not presenting a significant perceived risk. These hazards were modeled for all of the Group's sites (offices and branches, warehouses, industrial and logistics sites), excluding Vivendi, which conducted its own assessment with an expert firm (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 2.3.1. – Overview of the main risks related to climate change), i.e. 350 sites divided into three types (tertiary site, industrial sites, logistics sites) with the support of an expert firm.\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor example, the \"heat wave\" hazard corresponds to the number of days a year with a \"wet bulb temperature\" greater than 30 °C, i.e. a temperature that makes working outside unbearable. It was considered that from ninety days a year exceeding this temperature, the level of risk exposure would\n\nFor each of these hazards, each site's exposure was determined by combining two components:\n\n- 1. absolute exposure: comparison of the site's exposure at different time horizons compared to physical risk thresholds, and;\n- 2. relative exposure: change in the site's exposure at different time horizons compared to the historical period.\n\n# *Number of sites with a very high level of exposure to various climatic hazards*\n\n|                                                            | Type of risk                                                                        | Office/Branch | Warehouse | Industrial site |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Number of very high risks<br>recorded at the various sites | • Extreme weather events (avalanches, storms, forest fires,<br>cyclones, tornadoes) | 7             | 0         | 0               |\n|                                                            | • Hydrographic hazards (flooding, landslides, heavy rainfall)                       | 1             | 0         | 0               |\n|                                                            | • Water risks (water stress, drought)                                               | 46            | 8         | 0               |\n|                                                            | • Thermal risks (thermal stress, heat waves)                                        | 43            | 15        | 0               |\n| Number of sites exposed<br>to at least one very high risk  |                                                                                     | 90            | 21        | 0               |\n| Number of sites                                            |                                                                                     | 263           | 62        | 25              |\n\nbe very high.\n\nThis site exposure analysis is a first step in the analysis of physical climate risks, which shall be supplemented by an analysis of the sites' vulnerability to these risks in order to assess whether observed high levels of exposure translate into a real risk in terms of working conditions, security or business continuity. The aim of this vulnerability analysis will also be to quantify the financial impacts of the aforementioned risks, taking into account the book value of the assets and the impact on operating expenses. This work was initially scheduled for 2023, but has not been carried out given the planned sale of Bolloré Logistics, which accounts for 91% of the sites analyzed and the vast majority of the most exposed sites. The final step will be to establish dedicated adaptation plans by exploring all the measures to be implemented at the individual site level in order to mitigate its vulnerability to physical climate risks.\n\n# **1.2.3.1.2. GROUP CLIMATE STRATEGY: MAKING THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT CENTRAL TO OUR BUSINESS LINES**\n\nRecognizing the important role the private sector plays in combating climate change, the Bolloré Group has been taking steps for several years to monitor, control and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Continuing the carbon footprint analysis it began in 2021 to define a carbon reduction trajectory, the Group strengthened its commitment in 2023 by setting medium-term targets.\n\nThe carbon reduction plan for Vivendi's activities, which sets out carbon emission reduction targets validated by SBTi in March 2023, aims to reduce these emissions by 2035 compared with a baseline year of 2018. The objectives set cover Vivendi's most significant areas of activity in order of their contribution to its carbon footprint. See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 4.1.2.2. – Science-Based Targets commitments and carbon reduction objectives.\n\n# Group governance in the face of climate-related risks and opportunities\n\nReporting to the Finance Department, the Bolloré Group CSR Department coordinates the CSR strategy with the assistance of specialized committees, and through the Head of CSR's presence at the meetings of the Audit Committee, Executive Committee, Risk Committee, and Ethics – CSR and Anticorruption Committee.\n\nIn terms of corporate governance, the Bolloré Group refers to the French Corporate Governance Code for listed companies established by the Afep and the Medef. At its meeting on March 14, 2023, the Board was invited to consider the changes made in the new version of the Code published in December 2022 aimed at ensuring that the Board of Directors integrates the CSR strategy in its duties. With regard to the creation of a dedicated CSR Committee, after reiterating that the Audit Committee reviews non-financial risks as part of its current duties, the Board members decided that the Board of Directors will continue to refer to the work of the Audit Committee, whose responsibilities were extended to all CSR issues.\n\nAs part of the implementation of this recommendation, the following meetings were held in 2023:\n\n- on March 6, 2023, the independent directors, together with the Head of CSR, convened for an initial training on environmental and climate issues provided by a third-party organization;\n- on July 26, 2023, the Head of CSR presented the CSR strategic guidelines (including a focus on the climate strategy) to the Audit Committee;\n- on October 11, 2023, the independent directors met with the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Head of CSR and experts from an outside firm.\n\nThis work showed that the Group needed to be able to present targets for reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and to specify the trajectory to which it is committed in order to meet the expectations of its stakeholders. A firm of experts assisted in analyzing the carbon footprint and identifying carbon reduction opportunities, and a strategy with precise objectives was defined for a given timeframe.\n\nOn 20 October 2023, the Board of Directors approved the climate strategy submitted to it by the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Head of CSR. In addition, the analysis of the physical risks associated with climate issues initiated in 2022 was taken into account in the Bolloré Group's risk management processes in order to comply with the new European regulation concerning the classification of \"sustainable\" economic activities under the taxonomy (see section 1.1.5. – Analysis of the sustainability of the Bolloré Group's activities with regard to the European taxonomy).\n\n# Climate objectives and trajectory\n\nIn 2023, with the help of a specialized firm, the Bolloré Group carried out work to implement a decarbonization strategy. This structured approach will determine quantified reduction targets in light of an action plan and investments to reduce the impact of all activities on the climate in the medium term (five to ten years). This work was carried out in compliance with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) methodology for the carbon footprint and carbon reduction target calculations. This process consisted of the following three phases:\n\n# • **phase 1: analysis of the Group's carbon footprint to identify the areas generating the most GHG.**\n\nTo calculate its carbon footprint, Bolloré essentially follows the methodology of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, an international protocol aimed at providing a regulatory framework for accounting and reporting GHG emissions. The Group publishes figures for its direct and indirect emissions linked to the energy consumed by the Group (scopes 1 and 2), as well as a portion of its indirect emissions under scope 3 deemed significant with regard to its activities (see section 1.3.2.2 – 2023 environmental data). The carbon footprint reviewed during 2023, on the basis of 2022 GHG emissions, led to several observations: the Group's scope 3 emissions (excluding Bolloré Logistics) account for 99% of total emissions, concentrated mainly on the sale of petroleum products by Bolloré Energy (80%). Scopes 1 and 2 emissions are generated by electricity consumption by the Communications(1) (67%) and Industry (20%) divisions.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n• **phase 2: identification and quantification of decarbonization drivers.** Following the analysis of the 2022 carbon footprint and the interviews\n\nconducted with the divisions, the main efforts to reduce GHG emissions will focus on the following carbon reduction drivers:\n\n- continuing Bolloré Energy's product diversification strategy, which entails investing in the development of biofuels that emit fewer greenhouse gases than traditional petroleum products;\n- purchasing electricity from renewable sources for all Group divisions, especially the Communications and Industry divisions;\n- purchasing low-carbon vehicles for the Bolloré Energy fleet.\n\nFurthermore, in line with the Group's commitments, all activities are adapting their business strategies to take account of climate-related risks and opportunities (see the paragraph below, Resilience of the organization's strategy).\n\n• **phase 3: development of a decarbonization roadmap and definition of reduction targets.**\n\nAfter measuring the capacity of its businesses to reduce their emissions, and integrating Vivendi's quantified commitments (see section 4.1.2 – Reducing the carbon footprint of our businesses in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement), the Group defined its reduction targets. The results of the research were analyzed in the light of the requirements of the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n\nOn October 20, 2023, the Board of Directors of Bolloré SE approved the climate strategy as follows:\n\n# *Climate strategy targets for 2030 compared to 2022*\n\n| Scopes 1 and 2 objective | 42% reduction taking into account the commitments made by Vivendi in March 2023 and in line with the Paris Agreement<br>trajectory to limit global warming to 1.5 °C. |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Scope 3 objective        | 30% reduction in the \"combustion of petroleum products sold\" post thanks in particular to Bolloré Energy's investments<br>in biofuels.                                |\n|                          | This objective will contribute to a 19% reduction in scope 3 emissions for the entire Group in 2030 compared to 2022.                                                 |\n\nEach significant change in the Group's scope will trigger a recalculation of the carbon reduction targets presented above, taking into account the requirements of climate strategy standards (Greenhouse Gas Protocol and Science-Based Targets initiative), which call for reassessment of GHG emissions for the baseline year whenever there is a significant change in the scope of consolidation.\n\n# Concrete initiatives to develop low-carbon products and services in each of the activities\n\nThe Group is involved in long-term investment processes. The diverse range of its activities strengthens its resilience to the vagaries of the market and allows it to create employment by adjusting its business lines and making low-carbon solutions an opportunity for the development of its products and services aligned with major energy transition and climate change challenges. The Group's commitment is illustrated by the concrete initiatives taken by its divisions and by investments to develop low-carbon products and services.\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\n# Bolloré Logistics\n\nGenerating more than 34% of the Bolloré Group's scope 3 GHG emissions, Bolloré Logistics has made CO2 reduction commitments, in particular for its downstream scope 3 emissions, corresponding to carbon emissions linked to the execution of its transportation services, in order to contribute to the decarbonization of the transport and logistics sector.\n\n# *Scope 3 commitments and objectives*\n\nBolloré Logistics set targets to reduce GHG emissions linked to the performance of transport services starting from 2020. To strengthen its climate plan, Bolloré Logistics officially committed to the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 2022 via a commitment letter and submitted its new reduction targets in October 2023, taking into account the sale of its activities in Africa at the end of 2022. The process to obtain SBTi validation is scheduled for the first half of 2024. Based on the latest SBTi sector-specific recommendations and methodologies, the target was calculated with the SDA method for air and sea and the ACA method for road freight; it is aligned with the 1.5 °C trajectory. The objective is a 22% reduction in GHG emissions on its downstream scope 3 in absolute terms by 2030 for its entire network (baseline: 2022).\n\n# *Roadmap*\n\nThe roadmap already drawn up for this scope and described below generated even greater involvement from our teams in 2023. All Bolloré Logistics business lines are concerned and involved, including purchasing, operations, trade, innovation, CSR, QHSE, legal and customs experts. Every day, teams are focused on improving the standardization of environmentally-responsible transportation solutions for all customers and on delivering bespoke carbon reduction plans for key accounts. All carbon reduction solutions are considered across all segments of the supply chain.\n\nThe approach followed by Bolloré Logistics for several years focuses on the design and offering of services aimed at CO<sup>2</sup> efficiency for Transportation and logistics solutions. The company is continuously strengthening its action plans in line with its increasingly strong commitments, as well as those of its customers, importers and exporters, in three ways:\n\n**1. Strengthening the low-carbon approach in the value chain**\n\n• **Participate in ecosystem initiatives and assist customers to reduce the environmental impact of their supply chain:** In 2023, alternative fuels with better carbon efficiency were further developed across the entire Bolloré Logistics network and all modes of transport. To successfully implement a customized reduction plan, Bolloré Logistics offers its customers the Powering Sustainable Logistics PACT, which seeks to define common CO2 reduction targets, including for issues related to packaging. To contribute to its downstream scope 3 commitments and better help its customers create value through decarbonization, in early 2023 the Europe CSR Department launched an initiative called \"Beyond Carbon\" founded on active listening and codevelopment with customers to find more carbon efficient transportation solutions (see section 1.2.4.2.3. – Building and maintaining dialog with stakeholders, paragraph on \"Illustration of dialog with stakeholders\"). Everywhere it operates, Bolloré Logistics regularly organizes customer events to build awareness around the environmental impact of transport and existing low-carbon solutions. For example, customized coconstruction workshops were held within the network, particularly in the B'Lab innovation centers, and Climate Fresk events were organized with customers in the various regions of the company's network.\n\n- **Systematically incorporating environmental performance criteria into the listing, selection and assessment of transport suppliers and subcontractors:** shipping companies and airlines are subject to an annual ESG assessment whose score directly impacts the purchasing policy integrated into internal service design support tools. The environmental aspect is also integrated into the service level and is subject to regular business reviews. At the start of 2023, the weighting of this assessment was increased in the overall score. Furthermore, carriers must list themselves on a digital platform that includes compliance, safety and environmental criteria. Only subcontractors declared active are operational, after first being approved internally in a clearly established circuit. Carrier QHSE audits round out this system.\n- **Training sales teams, the first advisors on Bolloré Logistics' sustainable supply chain solutions for customers:** to provide the best possible support for customers in their choice of low-carbon transport and logistics solutions, Bolloré Logistics is focused on building the skills of the company's sales teams. To achieve this, the second edition of the B'Sustainable Supply program for global sales teams was held in early 2023. It adopts a gamification strategy to better integrate the environmental challenges of the supply chain and low-carbon alternatives. The CSR community organized more than 45 live webinars in each region around the world. At the end of this second edition, more than two-thirds of salespeople, freight buyers and contractual logistics managers committed to this voluntary training program, enabling the gradual formation of a network of green champions within the sales teams.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\n- **2. Innovating and deploying digital data measurement and exploitation solutions**\n- **Refining and strengthening the relevance of transport carbon impact data:** Bolloré Logistics has implemented a CO2 dashboard directly linked to the transport management IT system, which allows customers to obtain performance indicators and a detailed view of each shipment of goods (CO2 eq emissions by segment and mode of transport, by origin/destination, as well as the main atmospheric pollutants). Continued improvement work continued over the period.\n- **Developing digital tools to help with decision-making and optimize the logistics system:** Bolloré Logistics continued to develop its digital tools based on environmental data, gradually making it possible to systematically consider CO2 criteria from the design of transport services, and upstream of the carbon indicator included in the quote sent to the customer. The work undertaken in 2023, a decision support tool was put in place to suggest alternative transportation plans (change of carrier or mode, alternative fuel option) after automatically analyzing different scenarios based on the customer's CO2e reduction commitments.\n\n# **3. Innovating and implementing alternative transport solutions**\n\n- **Developing partnerships with airlines and shipping companies to promote alternative fuels:** for air transport, Bolloré Logistics is working through its partners to offer its customers sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which allows for a 70% to 95% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The Bolloré Logistics AIRsaf offer is available on any commercial route for all shipping modes, regardless of the airline, thanks to its \"book and claim\" system. The framework of this offer complies with the guidelines of the Smart Freight Center and the GHG Protocol, and applies restrictive selection criteria to promote a second-generation alternative fuel that does not compete with food production. Its traceability and carbon accounting are ensured by certification issued by an independent third party. In 2023, the Group signed six partnerships with strategic airlines as part of the AIRSaf offer, making it possible to avoid nearly 24,000 metric tons of CO2e.\n- For maritime transport, at the end of 2021, Bolloré Logistics launched its SEAalternative offer, which allows its customers to opt for sustainable maritime fuel, in line with the mass balance concept. This option was updated at the end of 2023 to follow the same book and claim principle used for aviation to facilitate the use of biofuel to decarbonize sea freight by up to 84%.\n- **Developing road partnerships to accelerate the deployment of lowcarbon fleets:** throughout 2022 and 2023, Bolloré Logistics entities increased their partnerships with their subcontractors to replace transport services using only diesel fuel. In parallel with these initiatives, each region is continuing to update the local mapping of carriers with a fleet of lowcarbon vehicles. These initiatives are constantly enhanced by the carrier listing tool Link Partner.\n- **Proposing new multimodal transport options:** Bolloré Logistics is developing the use of river and rail routes and the deployment of regular service lines, for example between China and Europe. In France, in order to accelerate the use of multimodal solutions, the company has set a target of reducing emissions generated by road transport by 25% by 2025. A digital solution was also developed at the end of 2023 to promote available river and rail services by displaying the carbon indicator.\n- **Advancing the integration of cutting-edge technologies:** with its various research projects, Bolloré Logistics is helping to develop innovative means of transport. For example, Bolloré Logistics organized the door-to-door transport of a satellite and its parts from its client's site in Toulouse to the Guiana Space Center in Kourou on a next-generation sailing cargo ship. Depending on speed, this wind-propelled mode reduces carbon emissions by 20% to 30% compared with an equivalent conventionally-propelled vessel.\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n#### Bolloré Energy\n\nThe latest technological advances make it possible to guarantee a liquid and storable fuel that is more environmentally friendly. Since 2018, Bolloré Energy has diversified its range of products to offer its customers cleaner alternatives by reducing the portion of fossil fuel products it distributes in order to align its strategy with the energy transition.\n\n# *Biofuel oil*\n\nAs a pioneer in the distribution of biofuel oil in France with the launch of Biofioul Évolution (F5) in 2019, Bolloré Energy has been offering its customers an F30 biofuel oil containing 30% biofuel, Calorza, since January 2022. Biofuel oil is a bioliquid for heating consisting of rapeseed oil, produced in France, and mineral fuel oil, as well as an additive that alone **reduces energy consumption by 7%.** Based on data from the carbon calculator published by Ademe (French environment agency), increasing the proportion of rapeseed oil in the product made it possible to meet the government's demands by remaining below the threshold of 250 grams of CO2 per kilowatt hour announced at the Citizen's Climate Convention. Composed of plant matter, this biofuel oil represents an alternative to domestic fuel oil and is compatible with all heating systems for individuals and professionals. Bolloré Energy is working to spread this innovative product throughout France.\n\n# *Biofuels*\n\nBolloré Energy is also a pioneer in the development and promotion of lowcarbon liquid alternative fuels, in particular through the following solutions:\n\n- Bolloré Energy has sold its Koolza100, a B100 biodiesel produced solely from rapeseed and processed in France, since 2021. As an ecological alternative to fossil diesel with equivalent autonomy, Koolza100offers professionals, such as carriers or the rail industry, an immediate environmental solution as it reduces CO<sup>2</sup> emissions by 60% and fine particle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional diesel.\n- Bolloré Energy also distributes Izipure, its 100% renewable synthetic biofuel throughout the country. Made from organic waste, this biodegradable, odorless biofuel reduces CO2 emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional diesel and is compatible with almost all new or older diesel engines. To promote the use of its low-carbon fuels, in September 2022 Bolloré Energy signed an exclusive seven-year contract with transport company LK Kunegel. 350 buses will now use Izipure, which will reduce the carrier's carbon footprint by up to 10,000 metric tons of CO<sup>2</sup> and 10 metric tons of particles (nitrogen oxide) each year.\n- To develop its low-carbon liquid fuel offering and strengthen its position as a committed player in the energy transition, Bolloré Energy entered into a partnership in 2023 with the world's leading biofuel producer, the Neste Group, to distribute HVO100 Neste MY Renewable Diesel on the French market starting in 2024.\n\nBolloré Energy uses certified biofuel suppliers. Its Koolza100 comes from a supplier with 2BSvs certification, a voluntary protocol aimed at the energy market and recognized by the European Commission. The 2BS certification system, which is applicable worldwide, demonstrates sustainability criteria from the production of biomass to the collection of inputs, all the way through to the processing and production of biofuels, bioliquids or combustibles. Izipure comes from a producer certified under ISCC (International Sustainability Carbon Certification). ISCC is a certification system that can be applied to all biomass to verify the responsible nature of supply chains for agricultural biomass or biogenic waste and residues. It addresses the issues of reduced greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable land use, protection of natural biospheres and improved social sustainability.\n\n#### *Distribution of alternative oil products*\n\nBolloré Energy is also committed to promoting the use of biofuels with carriers that the company calls on to distribute its petroleum products.\n\nIn 2023, 88% of fuel deliveries to Bolloré Energy's retail depots were made by vehicles running on biofuel (HVO100 or B100), whereas they accounted for around 30% of such deliveries in 2022. Bolloré Energy is aiming for 100% next year.\n\nBolloré Energy would also like to extend this approach for deliveries to its key accounts via its Trading network.\n\n# *The development of low-carbon products and services*\n\nSince 2020, a specific sales organization has been dedicated to the promotion of these new solutions including bio fuel oil, biodiesel (Koolza100), Izipure, B10 diesel and a range of products with additives such as AdBlue© . As a result, Bolloré Energy has identified the need to invest in the training of all of its sales teams and to raise awareness among its customers. In 2023, nearly 30 sales employees at trading agencies completed \"low carbon\" training. In addition, 100% of Bolloré Energy managers were educated on the environmental stakes associated with low-carbon products.\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2022, the Energy Transition Department was created to continue accelerating the deployment of solutions to reduce the environmental footprint of the company's customers and partners and to support them in their energy transition. The actions of Bolloré Energy's Energy Transition Department focus on three areas of action:\n\n**1. Decarbonization,** by offering low-carbon liquid fuels to Bolloré Energy customers.\n\n**2. Support for consumers and users in the energy transition and energy sobriety:** in particular, the teams of technicians repairing boilers in private individuals' homes are also committed to supporting their customers in the energy transition and are now making changes to equipment such as replacing burners.\n\n**3. Reducing consumption** by financing energy efficiency projects. Bolloré Energy funds the following programs:\n\n- energy savings certificates (EECs): Bolloré Energy encourages its customers and consumers to improve their energy performance. Nearly 100 million euros on average will be disbursed under this scheme to finance assistance programs and energy-saving projects in the agriculture, industry, residential, transport, tertiary and other sectors;\n- the support programs approved by the French Ministry of Ecological Transition to support the development of ecomobility and promote low-carbon solutions:\n- Advenir, which helps to install charging stations for electric vehicles,\n- energy savings loans (PEE), offered from 2020 to 2024, with the aim of encouraging microbusinesses and SMBs to initiate projects to improve their energy efficiency, and\n- Alveole Plus, a project whose goal is to speed up the creation of bicycle parking spaces through financing, advisory actions and training on bicycle transit.\n\n# **• Industry**\n\n#### Blue\n\nElectricity storage is a major technological hurdle to cross if we are to meet climate challenges. Electric batteries have driven innovation in mobility and the development of renewable energies.\n\nThrough its LMP® electric battery production activities by its subsidiary Blue Solutions, and the production of clean transportation solutions by its subsidiary Bluebus, Blue is supporting the energy transition, notably by investing 35 million euros in R&D projects in 2023.\n\nConcrete initiatives are being rolled out in each of its activities, by several means:\n\n**1. The development of Blue Solutions' LMP® battery, a unique and environ mentally-friendly technology:** Lithium Metal Polymer (LMP<sup>®</sup>) technology is the culmination of an ambitious R&D program that began almost thirty years ago to bring to the market high-energy batteries that could be used for many applications. The Bolloré Group has invested over 3 billion euros and hired more than 2,000 people to develop this \"solid-state\" technology. Building on its position as a global leader in films for capacitors, the Bolloré Group made electricity storage a major priority for development. Composed of thin films made using extrusion techniques in which the Bolloré Group has significant experience, LMP® batteries are characterized by their high energy density, their safety in use, and their non-sensitivity to external temperatures. These batteries meet the needs of many markets and solve two key challenges of the energy transition: the development of low-carbon transport solutions by incorporating them into electric vehicles (electromobility market), the development of low-carbon transport solutions and the development of stationary solutions for smart energy management.\n\nFurthermore, in line with Blue Solutions' commitment to sustainability, an environmentally friendly approach has been adopted at all stages of the product lifecycle, from raw material sourcing to battery recycling:\n\n# • **Ecodesign:**\n\n- circular economy practices: Blue Solutions takes a circularity-oriented approach to design to ensure that its products are developed with recycling and end-of-life in mind;\n- environmental assessments such as the life cycle assessment governed by ISO 14040 have been carried out since 2013 on LMP® batteries. The\n\nassessment of the new generation of LMP® batteries (IT3) has shown that its carbon footprint based on stored kWh has been reduced by about a third compared to the previous generation (Cradle To Gate scope: from the extraction of raw materials to the doors of the Blue Solutions production plant). This is possible because of the design, which focuses on increasing energy density and optimizing the casing and electronics.\n\n## • **Sustainable sourcing:**\n\n- to deepen its commitment, Blue Solutions has partnered with companies to source raw materials through cleaner and more sustainable methods;\n- for direct lithium extraction, Blue Solutions is working with partners, including Eramet and the government of Chile, on a lithium extraction process that allows for more contained management of water resources.\n\n# • **Advanced recycling processes:**\n\n- recycling of end-of-life batteries: Blue Solutions has developed a unique process to recycle batteries at the end of their life, extracting recycled elements for future use;\n- high-yield lithium recycling: The projected yield from the lithium metal recycling process is 90%. In 2024, Blue Solutions will deploy the second stage of its current pre-pilot line;\n- treatment and recovery of residues: Blue Solutions has established innovative partnerships to recycle black mass and recover precious materials;\n- purification: once recovered, the lithium undergoes a purification process so that it can be reused, thus reducing the need to extract new materials.\n\nBlue Solutions integrates these principles to help ensure that every battery produced contributes positively to a sustainable future, aligning with the vision of leading the way towards safe, sustainable and intelligent e-mobility. Moreover, LMP<sup>®</sup> batteries do not contain cobalt, cadmium, or nickel, and thus have the advantage of being more environmentally friendly than most other battery technologies. To address the individual electric vehicle market, since 2021, Blue Solutions has been focusing its R&D efforts on the development of a new fourth-generation solid-state battery technology. An ambitious R&D plan has been undertaken to take to market a battery adapted to the needs of car manufacturers in terms of performance and environmental quality in 2026. This fourth-generation technology will implement the best design and manufacturing practices, anticipating the recycling and end-oflife stages, and will meet increasingly ambitious European regulations. To further the development of the next generation of its Gen4 batteries, the innovation team is reinforced each year and now has more than 100 employees who advance the work at the company's various sites (Blue Solutions and the lead laboratories CNRS, Grenoble NP-UGA, Nantes Université).\n\n**2. Bluebus, France's leading manufacturer of 100% electric buses:** Blue Solutions is committed to playing a long-term role in the electromobility market by becoming a leader in the electric bus market. The solid-state LMP® battery is popular with urban transport managers for its safety, high range, long life and ease of integration, making it a powerful solution for buses and electric vehicles. In particular, it equips electric buses manufactured by Bluebus, whose ambition is to meet the technological challenges of tomorrow's mobility and support the challenges of the energy transition. A low-carbon, silent public transport solution for urban and suburban areas, Bluebus' sixmeter and twelve-meter vehicles meet environmental requirements. They combine high technology and performance thanks to their latest-generation LMP® batteries. Today, more than 500 Bluebus vehicles are operating in around sixty cities around the world.\n\nThe all-electric six-meter Bluebus is the latest in the range of urban and suburban buses marketed by Bluebus. Equipped with an integrated charger and LMP<sup>®</sup> (Lithium Metal Polymer) solid-state electric batteries with increased density, its range can reach 280 km<sup>(1)</sup>. In addition to being accessible to people with reduced mobility, it can accommodate up to 35 passengers thanks to a floor area that is unrivaled on the market. Because it emits no air pollutants, the six-meter Bluebus can operate in lowemission zones (ZFE), helping to reduce greenhouse gases and improve urban air quality.\n\n(1) Range measured according to the E-SORT 3 cycle (UTAC 09/22 tests) and varies based on conditions of use.\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2023, the six-meter Bluebus was added to the catalog of France's national public procurement agency (UGAP), more than a year after its launch. This means that public-sector buyers do not have to go through the competitive tendering process. In addition, several agreements to distribute Bluebus models were signed in 2023, including agreements in Greece with the Syngelidis group, and in Spain and Italy with Indcar.\n\n# Films\n\nThe Films division is organized around two activities:\n\n- production of packaging shrink films, for which it is recognized as one of the world's leading manufacturers. These films are characterized by their extreme thinness, high performance and recyclability, and;\n- the production of ultra-thin plastic films, the main component of high value-added capacitors, which contribute in particular to the optimization of electricity networks and the development of renewable energies (photovoltaic) and parts for electric vehicles (UTF).\n\n**Ecodesign at the heart of packaging solutions:** in its ultra-thin packaging shrink film activity, Packaging Films offers two main ranges, namely Bolphane films for industrial applications and Bolfresh films for food applications, contributing to the protection and conservation of consumer goods and the fight against waste. Packaging Films places ecodesign at the heart of its products through the 3R approach:\n\n- **reduce:** through innovative processes so it can offer thinner but equally resilient and efficient products, enabling manufacturers and consumers to minimize their use of materials and their carbon footprint;\n- **recycle:** 100% of Bolphane's films are recyclable (in the polyethylene flexible packaging stream). Only the Bolfresh sealing film is not yet recylable. But an R&D project is underway, and major investments are planned for 2025 to be able to offer recyclable films on a new, innovative production line;\n- **reuse:** the products use recycled plastic and materials from renewable raw materials.\n\nAll the products developed by Packaging Films follow this approach and these three principles in order to meet the challenges of reduction at source. More specifically, the Bolfresh range aims to offer ever more efficient products and act for the circular economy by reducing the carbon footprint. Its teams aim to work on innovative solutions to achieve a 100% recyclable food packaging range.\n\nPackaging Films' ecodesigned products include:\n\n- Bolphane Bri (recycled inside), made up of 30% of postindustrial regenerated materials derived from manufacturing waste at the Bolloré Quimper plant;\n- Bolphane B-Nat<sup>®</sup> 0: the first biosourced generation consisting of more than 40% polyethylene from ethanol derived from sugar cane. In 2022, Packaging Films developed a second-generation biosourced product from used cooking oil;\n- The OXBTEC\\_RCB<sup>®</sup> (Recyclable Circular-Based) film in the Bolfresh range is the first barrier shrink film that is recyclable, contains circular polymers from advanced recycling of post-consumer plastic waste, and suitable for food contact. The plant is now ISCC+ certified to ensure the use of these alternative resins is compliant.\n\n# Systems\n\nThrough its solutions to optimize flows of people, goods and data, Blue Systems provides a response to the new challenges facing companies and cities, and supports the energy transition by offering innovative solutions to support the mobility of the future. Thus, to meet new challenges (the environment, and population and infrastructure flows), linked to the rapid development of new mobility solutions in cities, Blue Systems has developed an innovative software platform: Smart Mobility Platform. By offering services related to the smart, real-time management of mobility and infrastructure data, Smart Mobility is positioned as a trusted player and helps its partners achieve more connected sustainable mobility. For instance, when pollution levels peak the city can easily impose no-go areas for cars. It can also decide to give priority to soft and zero-emission mobility solutions over combustion engine vehicles.\n\nDeveloped with its subsidiary Polyconseil, this digital intervention system enables the cities to:\n\n- regulate mobility operators;\n- optimize the use of public space and infrastructure, and;\n- plan and synchronize mobility services in a changing situation.\n\nInitially focused on micro-mobility, the Smart Mobility Urban solution now incorporates the supervision of urban deliveries, taxis and private hire vehicles. At the same time, a Curb Management solution has been developed to enable cities to digitize their entire public space, understand usage and potentially optimize it.\n\n## *Smart Mobility: key figures for 2023*\n\n• Number of vehicles supervised: 50,000 (bikes, scooters, shared cars, autonomous vehicles).\n\n#### • Number of trips analyzed: 50 million.\n\n**Ecodesign of products:** from design to end-of-life, IER and Automatic Systems, subsidiaries of the Systems division, seek to design their products sustainably and reduce their environmental impact throughout their life cycle. For example, IER prioritizes the use of parts produced in Europe, thereby significantly reducing the carbon impact arising from their transport.\n\nIn addition, the Systems division designs its products to guarantee the longest possible service life, including maintenance (at least fifteen years), such as ticket vending machines and pedestrian and vehicle crossing equipment.\n\nAutomatic Systems requires R&D to design products that are more than 80% recyclable (according to the international standard IEC 62635). The choice of materials and manufacturing techniques (surface treatment, painting, welding, gluing, etc.) are decisive in guaranteeing this minimum rate and providing products whose environmental impact is optimized throughout their life cycle (until dismantling). In addition, the target energy consumption and noise level of the equipment, at rest or in operation, are set out in the specifications.\n\n**Innovative services to reduce customers CO<sup>2</sup> emissions throughout the supply chain:** through its Track & Trace subsidiary, IER helps its customers optimize their supply chain (warehouses, vehicles, transport, points of sale, public places and roads) with its traceability solutions. For example, in the mass distribution sector, IER has been working for more than fifteen years, in partnership with Auchan and Cogit, on the traceability of the fruit and vegetables sector in order to monitor products from the producer to the end customer, automate logistics operations and migrate from disposable to reusable packaging. Thanks to the RFID system, more than 7 million plastic cages are traced per year, making it possible to have less than 0.5% losses and optimize truck loading.\n\nIt has taken concrete progress measures for its customers, which facilitate the operator's work while respecting the environment:\n\n- the equipping of terminals with native energy saving solutions, i.e. programmed automatic switching on and shutdown or the systematic implementation of energy efficient power supplies;\n- the development of a \"French\" information system offering optimization solutions for delivery rounds to maximize the usage of the vehicle fleet, cover the shortest distance possible while ensuring that time commitments are met and reducing GHG emissions due to local operation, and;\n- the provision of mobile applications for drivers to optimize the transport plan, track packages and maximize the dematerialization of documents.\n\n**Polyconseil** is committed to working towards a digital world that is more energy-efficient, accessible, inclusive and conducive to generating a positive impact for society and citizens, and has enshrined a dedicated CSR strategy in the Polyconseil CSR Charter. The strategy is organized into four areas of focus:\n\n• **training and awareness-raising:** addition of training on sustainable digital solutions to the mandatory pathway followed by newcomers, organization of Climate Fresks;\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\n- **inclusion and diversity:** annual participation in Duo Days, partnership with Ada Tech School to recruit more women in digital professions;\n- **implementation of impact missions via the \"Polyclimate\" initiative:** BRGM's support in developing France's National Waste Register to improve traceability, development of a new \"GreenIT 360\" product to promote the development of ecodesigned digital solutions;\n- **responsible management of IT resources and facilities:** design of flexible infrastructure with dynamic scaling of resources, donation of used computers to Emmaüs Connect.\n\nWith a view to continuous improvement, Polyconseil regularly updates its carbon audit and, in 2023, initiated a partnership with Agence Lucie to help it obtain the label \"Numérique Responsable\" (Responsible Digital label), which will enable Polyconseil to identify new avenues of action.\n\n# **1.2.3.1.3. MANAGEMENT OF THE GROUP TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF ITS ACTIVITIES ON CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\nIn order to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the Bolloré Group has set itself the objective of implementing an energy consumption management approach based on:\n\n- sobriety: optimization of consumption, fight against energy waste, ecofriendly actions, etc.;\n- energy efficiency: investments in energy optimization (LED, presence detectors, renovation of heating/air conditioning systems, etc.), renewal of fleets of vehicles, electrification, etc.;\n- promotion of renewable energy: increase the share of electricity consumption from renewable sources via energy attribute certificates (EAC), such as origin guarantees and renewable energy certificates (RECs) or power purchase agreements.\n\nSignificant efforts are made every day by all divisions to reduce consumption, optimize operating costs and reduce the impact of their activities on climate change. While industrial sites are the biggest consumers and as such are the subject of special attention, the Bolloré Group is also careful to optimize the consumption of its tertiary sites. In addition, the Group and its divisions are also working on sustainable management of the real estate and infrastructure portfolio. 78% of entities covered by a management system including environmental considerations have at least one site certified by recognized environmental standards (HQE, LEED<sup>®</sup>, BREAM<sup>®</sup>, EDGE, ISO 14001, ISO 50001, Green Terminal or Biodiversity Commitment).\n\nFor several years now, the Vivendi group has also been committed to controlling its energy consumption and certifying the environmental performance of its buildings. In line with the 2025 intermediate and 2035 final targets for \"Energy\" and \"Use of renewable energy\" commitments, the Group plans to continue its actions to maintain and confirm this trajectory. In 2023, nearly 60% of electricity consumed by the Group came from renewable sources (versus 37% in 2022). See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 4.1.2.3. – Site energy performance, use of renewable energies and group-wide energy efficiency plan.\n\n# Operational objectives and progress\n\n| Area of action                | Group objectives                                                                                                                                                                                              | Horizon                       | Progress at 12/31/2023                                                                                                                                          |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reduction<br>of GHG emissions | Implement an energy consumption management approach<br>based on:<br>• energy sobriety (consumption, ecofriendly actions, etc.)<br>• energy efficiency (investments in the energy performance<br>of equipment) | 2022 carried over<br>to 2023* | • Continued rollout of various programs<br>dedicated to optimizing consumption: this<br>target will be updated in 2024 in light of<br>the change in Group scope |\n| Renewable<br>energies         | • Increase the share of electricity consumption from<br>renewable energy sources (proof of origin)                                                                                                            | 2022 carried over<br>to 2023* | • Reduction in GHG emissions through the<br>consumption of energy from renewable<br>sources: 13%(1)                                                             |\n\n\\* The 2022 targets were renewed in 2023 due to two significant disposal projects and anticipated work related to the CSRD in 2024.\n\n(1) Indicator calculation excludes Bolloré Logistics and Vivendi.\n\n# Actions adopted in each of the activities to reduce the impact of our activities on climate change\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics** Bolloré Logistics\n\n# *Scopes 1 and 2 commitments and objectives*\n\nentire network (baseline: 2022).\n\nIn order to strengthen its climate plan set up in 2018, Bolloré Logistics officially committed to the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 2022 via a commitment letter and submitted its new reduction targets in October 2023, taking into account the sale of its activities in Africa at the end of 2022. Based on the latest SBTi sector-specific recommendations and methodologies, the target was calculated using the absolute contraction approach and is aligned with the 1.5 °C trajectory. It sets a target to reduce scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 42% in absolute terms by 2030 for its\n\n# *Management of the climate strategy for direct activities*\n\nInitiated in 2018, the overall management of the Bolloré Logistics climate action plan is reflected in monitoring by the regional CSR managers and local country managers. At the central level, a single management tool is deployed to simulate the various reduction actions planned, completed or in progress, according to the scenarios, with an estimate of the quantity of carbon avoided, and the financial investment. Through this shared tool, each regional or local CSR manager records the actions within his or her scope that contribute to reducing carbon emissions (scopes 1 and 2), the scheduling of these actions and the corresponding environmental and financial indicators. Meetings between the Corporate CSR Department and regional CSR managers on the progress of action plans, planning and results with regard to the target trajectory are held quarterly.\n\nAround 100 actions involving an investment were recorded in the management tool, with various means:\n\n# **Investing in low-carbon company-owned road vehicles**\n\nRoad freight transport operated by company-owned vehicles impacting scope 1, accounts for less than 0.5% of total transport covered in terms of CO2 emissions. However, Bolloré Logistics continued to invest in more carbon efficient vehicles. In addition, ecodriving training for drivers of companyowned vehicles, company cars and service cars has been rolled out in several parts of the world.\n\n#### **Extending the use of renewable energies**\n\nIn terms of renewable energies, several investments have been made since 2020, initiated by the Green Hub warehouse in Singapore, which boasted nearly 2,400 solar panels on its roof in 2023.\n\nIn addition to producing renewable energy on site and in parallel with the sobriety and efficiency actions, some sites have opted for renewable energy supply through the purchase of energy attribute certificates (EAC) such as REC, iREC, and GO. In 2023, renewable energy accounted for 14% of electricity consumption\n\nIn addition, in order to ensure best practices within the company's network for the use of energy attribute certificates (EACs), an internal guide establishing guidelines was developed in association with a consulting firm, particularly in terms of processes, rules and the selection of energy attribute certificates (EACs); it has been deployed to the internal CSR community.\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Increasing awareness, training and engagement among teams**\n\nThroughout the period, information, awareness-raising and training activities were carried out across the network. Through the annual AcTogether challenge, an inter-country competition organized via a digital platform using collective gamification techniques, employees are invited to carry out local CSR actions, helping to reduce Bolloré Logistics' environmental impact. Energy efficiency of buildings and equipment and reducing GHG emissions feature prominently in this challenge. Through the fourth edition of AcTogether in 2023, some 175 actions worldwide were recorded over the period concerning employee awareness of the environment (excluding QHSE actions) (see section 1.2.4.2.3. – Building and maintaining dialog with stakeholders).\n\n#### **Tackling the most energy-intensive warehouses**\n\nIn addition to the general climate roadmap sent to its entities, in 2023 Bolloré Logistics defined an action plan specifically dedicated to the most energy-intensive warehouses. In 2022, a total of 20 warehouses were identified across all operating regions, with annual unit electricity consumption in excess of 675,000 kWh. They account for more than 50% of the company's total electricity consumption.\n\nThe components of this action plan are as follows:\n\n- annual reduction in electricity consumption of 5% per year;\n- achieve 100% electricity from renewable sources by 2030;\n- roll out internal certifications;\n- deploy technical building management;\n- increase investments in low-carbon equipment based on energy audit reports;\n- study the feasibility of AI solutions to optimize energy consumption (including HVAC), and;\n- raise awareness among internal and external stakeholders of these issues and solutions.\n\n## *Environmental certification*\n\nIn addition to the ISO 14001 certification already rolled out to nearly 84% of sites, new building construction must follow the principles of the Bolloré Logistics Responsible Building Charter signed in 2019 by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Head of Real Estate and Infrastructure division.\n\nThis document asks local departments to align their investment and operating cost targets with a reduction of their environmental footprint, working on four main interlinked areas:\n\n- reducing the building's carbon footprint during construction and use;\n- incorporating biodiversity and its ecosystem services from the design phase;\n- ensuring quality of work life to enhance well-being, creativity and performance, and;\n- constructing stronger buildings that are more resilient to climate risk.\n\nTo demonstrate its compliance, Bolloré Logistics made a formal commitment to systematically obtaining environmental certification at the construction phase, regardless of the size and location of new buildings. For example, with regard to the construction of major logistics hubs, the construction will always be subject to LEED<sup>®</sup> and BiodiverCity<sup>®</sup> dual certification.\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n#### Bolloré Energy\n\nBolloré Energy works daily on the environmental performance of its sites, from a standpoint of both pollution control (ISO 14001 certification, end-of-life rehabilitation of oil depots, etc.) and site energy performance (e.g., energy optimization of its vehicle fleet, 5% to 8% of which is generally renewed each year). To improve its environmental performance and as part of its ISO 14001 certification, Bolloré Energy has updated its policy for monitoring electricity consumption for its primary warehouses. New indicators have been implemented to ensure more regular and precise monitoring of consumption. Other initiatives have been rolled out, such as ecodriving training for all new employees involved in transport. Refresher sessions are organized each year to ensure the continued use of ecodriving techniques.\n\nA lighting replacement program was launched in the depots to introduce more energy-efficient solutions. LEDs were installed in four depots in 2023. Following the update of the GHG assessment in 2022, Bolloré Energy continued to renew its oil transport fleet: 25 trucks were ordered (Euro 6 standard), representing an investment of approximately 4 million euros. In 2023, 98% of Bolloré Energy's truck fleet met Euro 5 or Euro 6 standards. Bolloré Energy's goal is for 100% of its new fleet to run on HVO.\n\n# **• Industry**\n\n#### Blue\n\nIn a particularly tense electricity market, it was not possible for the plants in Brittany to cover their electricity consumption with renewable origin guarantees in 2023. Blue Solutions Canada consumes almost 100% renewable power from the Hydro-Québec network.\n\n# Films\n\nPackaging Films follows an \"avoid, reduce, compensate\" approach and has embarked on a forest carbon sink project with Alliance Forêts Bois. This project aims to capture, over two years (2023 and 2024), the incompressible carbon emissions arising from the operation of the Quimper production plant for the production of films in the Bolphane R3 range over two years through a local reforestation project in the Finistère department, which has been awarded Bas Carbone (low-carbon) certification by the ministry of Ecological Transition. In 2022, 9,750 trees were planted. This project also enabled the creation of 17 FTE jobs in the forestry sector.\n\n#### Systems\n\nSince 2021, Automatic Systems Belgium has invested heavily in optimizing the energy performance of buildings at the Mercator site in Belgium (LED lighting controlled by presence detectors, acoustic carpets, better distribution of air conditioners, use of local suppliers). Energy consumption is monitored monthly to detect any excesses.\n\nAutomatic Systems is also working to optimize its processes, particularly in its assembly areas. Thus, the subsidiary has moved from classic processes to lean management or one piece flow processes to increase delivery rates while reducing the footprint of each zone.\n\n# Drafting and adoption of sobriety plans\n\nFaced with energy supply tensions, the government called on French companies, and as a priority those in the CAC 40 stock market index, to reduce their energy consumption by 10% by 2024 compared to 2019 via the voluntary adoption of an energy sobriety plan. All of the Bolloré Group's French entities thus formalized energy sobriety plans to ensure the continuity of their activities and services while controlling their consumption. In 2023, these entities increased their efforts to develop solutions to improve the control of their energy consumption and thereby reduce their CO2 emissions.\n\nSupervised by a task force led by the Purchasing and CSR Departments, to consolidate the best practices of all business units and bring together the various energy plans and commitments to ensure business continuity, all the sobriety plans have applied the following measures:\n\n- reduction of heating and air conditioning;\n- restriction of lighting (sign and office lighting automatically shut off at certain times);\n- development and strengthening of consumption management and monitoring instruments (e.g. installation of sub-meters);\n- rollout of ecofriendly initiatives;\n- identification of energy-intensive equipment to control and limit consumption (fitting of clocks on certain equipment), elimination of individual electric radiators;\n- investments: reinforcement of LED rollout, acceleration of the installation of presence detectors, or implementation of technical building management systems;\n- performance of energy audits, and;\n- organization of working time.\n\n# Highlights\n\nFor the head office sites, an \"energy sobriety\" round table was set up in 2023 to monitor low-energy consumption measures, particularly related to lighting.\n\n• **Bolloré Logistics** extended the French sobriety plan to its global entities and, through the AcTogether platform, has initiated an internal challenge to be implemented by the teams on a daily basis to reduce the carbon footprint generated by the energy consumption of warehouses and offices. This initiative is part of the \"energy sobriety\" pillar of the Bolloré Logistics climate plan already initiated (see section 1.2.3.1.2. – Group climate strategy: making the management of our carbon footprint central to our business lines). The entities were asked to implement various measures in order to obtain the internal Energy Saving Office label, which covers the temperature in the premises (heating, air conditioning), lighting, insulation and the right reflexes to adopt with regard to the use of electrical appliances, including computer equipment. A webinar was organized by the head office CSR Department in the second quarter of 2023, a communication kit was sent to local sites and special information was sent to regional CSR managers and ambassadors. In addition, in accordance with local regulations or on a voluntary basis, energy audits \n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\nwere carried out in several countries in 2023, including in the United Kingdom, Canada, La Réunion and France. As France accounted for 29% of Bolloré Logistics' total electricity consumption in 2023, the operational implementation of the tertiary decree reinforces the climate action plan undertaken and extends it to all sites. Furthermore, improving the energy performance of our buildings is one of the key drivers of Bolloré Logistics' climate strategy. As in previous years, energy efficiency initiatives were once again rolled out across the network's buildings in 2023. The measures implemented include:\n\n- reducing air conditioning through the deployment of sun protection equipment or wall insulation, and replacing existing systems with more energy-efficient models;\n- optimizing air treatment to minimize energy consumption, solving the problem of humidity and developing smart solutions such as connected platforms to improve air quality;\n- improvement of electrical consumption measurement systems (BMS devices currently being deployed).\n- **IER and Automatic Systems** have committed to achieving significant energy savings through the implementation of energy audits and energy plans. Initiated in 2016, then renewed and monitored annually, these plans mainly focus on the energy performance of buildings and transport activities (e.g. fleet of vehicles). Among the concrete measures (installation of presence detectors and implementation of company-wide RTT days [time off in lieu of the thirty-five hour working week] to close facilities), energy tension on the national network is monitored through the government's Ecowatt platform and an action plan has been formalized to be\n\nable to act immediately in the event of a risk of power cuts. Efforts to regulate heating and the installation of LED lighting is also continuing.\n\n- In addition, under the 2022 sobriety plan, Systems subsidiaries implemented actions that were continued in 2023, including:\n- turning on heating units as late as possible;\n- reducing the temperature in facilities and workshops to 19 °C;\n- increasing setpoints in air-conditioned rooms (server rooms) from 22 °C to 24 °C;\n- deploying presence sensors everyone (particularly in restrooms);\n- installing LEDs in 2023 and continuing the project in 2024 at all sites;\n- performing energy audits;\n- improving the monitoring of energy consumption, in particular by installing clocks on energy-intensive equipment (compressors, extraction box, water heater);\n- limiting the use of energy-intensive equipment: IT, elevators, lighting, kitchens, hot water tanks, buses, etc.;\n- eliminating energy-intensive systems: replacing Besançon boilers, removing most individual electric heaters, removing sign lighting, etc.;\n- raising awareness of ecofriendly actions, noise, light, energy, waste (\"BLED\") and following up on BLED audits and checking that ecofriendly actions are properly displayed at all establishments.\n- **Blue and Films** have rolled out a study on the energy efficiency of French plants with Dalkia, and on Canadian plants with the service provider C-nergie. For its part, Bluebus has taken actions to control the heating temperatures in its workshop. In addition, the Films division installed LED equipment on its industrial premises.\n\n# **1.2.3.1.4.

The transport and storage of hazardous products and the occurrence of industrial accidents or fires represent major environmental risks and are a top priority for prevention. These risks have not been identified as one of the priority risks of the Communications sector, given the nature of its activities. For more information on the management of CSR priority risks in the Communications sector, see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document in chapter 2 – section 2.2. – Main non-financial risks and opportunities.\n\n# **1.2.3.2.2. PREVENTING LOCAL POLLUTION RISKS AND INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS**\n\n# Group policy\n\nControlling the environmental footprint of the Group's sites requires the deployment of Environmental Management Systems (EMSs) or specific measures and controls in accordance with recognized standards such as ISO 14001 for environmental management or standards that comply with strict regulations such as Seveso or ICPE for industrial sites. The sites are subject to industrial and environmental risk analyses, which constitute a decision-making tool for identifying the preventive or corrective actions to be put in place (e.g. prevention measures in the event of the transport or storage of hazardous materials, inventory of hazardous waste sources, measurement and analysis of emissions into air, water and soil). This continued improvement approach is at the heart of the environmental due diligence cycle implemented in the Group's entities in order to prevent the risks of local pollution and industrial accidents.\n\nThe activities are also subject to regular internal and external audits carried out pursuant to regulations and as part of certification processes. The defined processes make it possible to report, analyze, record and correct incidents, accidents and compliance failures that can lead to pollution.\n\nEven though the policies implemented and performance indicators are becoming increasingly standardized at the Group level, they inevitably retain the features specific to the challenges of each business line and activity. Each division implements emergency response plans based on the results of its risk maps. To ensure environmental performance monitoring, the divisions' Executive management teams set objectives and targets that are measurable and consistent with the QHSE policy for the relevant functions and levels in the organization. The achievement of targets is monitored at Executive Committee meetings and the annual QHSE Department Review.\n\n# Objectives and progress\n\nIn order to standardize the policies and indicators for monitoring the Group's various activities, a set of indicators relating to environmental risks used by all divisions (excluding Vivendi) has been deployed since 2019 (see \"The Bolloré Group's environmental management monitoring indicators\" and \"The Bolloré Group's environmental incident monitoring indicators\"). This work was further reinforced by the setting of reasonable targets, validated in early 2021 by Executive management (members of the Ethics – CSR and Anticorruption Committee), and consistent with the continued improvement process that is the focus of existing policies.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Area of action                                                                                          | Group objectives                                                                                                                                                                                        | Horizon                       | Progress at 12/31/2023                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Commitment of senior<br>management to monitor<br>the Group's performance to<br>preserve the environment | • 100% of divisions must have<br>an environmental policy signed<br>by Management                                                                                                                        | 2022-2025                     | • 87% of legal entities included in CSR<br>reporting(1) declare that they have an<br>environmental policy                                                                                                               |\n| Implementation<br>of environmental<br>management systems                                                | • 100% of the workforce of legal entities<br>included in the CSR reporting scope(1)<br>covered by a management system that<br>takes into account the environment                                        | 2022 carried<br>over to 2023* | • 94% of the workforce is covered by an<br>environmental management system(1)                                                                                                                                           |\n| Certification<br>of management systems                                                                  | • 70% of legal entities(1) covered by<br>an environmental management system<br>have at least one site certified under an<br>environmental standard (e.g. ISO 14001,<br>ISO 50001, Green Terminal, etc.) | 2022 carried<br>over to 2023* | • 93% of legal entities(1) covered by an<br>environmental management system have<br>at least one site certified under an<br>environmental standard (e.g. ISO 14001,<br>ISO 50001, etc.)                                 |\n| Prevention of local pollution<br>and management of hazardous<br>materials                               | • 100% of legal entities required to store or<br>transport hazardous materials equipped<br>with a pollution prevention mechanism                                                                        | 2022 carried<br>over to 2023* | • 39% of entities declare that they are<br>required to handle and/or store hazardous<br>materials<br>• 81% of which declare that they are<br>equipped with a pollution prevention<br>system                             |\n|                                                                                                         | • Mapping and/or assessment<br>of environmental risks to be carried<br>out on at least 100% of entities<br>reporting industrial sites                                                                   | 2022 carried<br>over to 2023* | • 83% of entities that specify that they have<br>industrial sites, report that they have<br>carried out an environmental risk mapping<br>or environmental analysis (assessment of<br>significant environmental aspects) |\n\n(1) See section 1.3.2.1. – CSR reporting methodology note.\n\n\\* The 2022 targets were renewed in 2023 due to two significant disposal projects and anticipated work related to the CSRD in 2024.\n\n# Prevention measures adapted for each activity\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\nThe Transportation and logistics activities are especially exposed to risks from local pollution and hazardous goods transport and storage.\n\nEmergency response plans are prepared in accordance with Executive management directives. Each entity implements performance monitoring processes and corrective monitoring processes and objectives similar to the division's. Each subsidiary ensures that employees, including subcontractors working on-site, are properly informed of the emergency response procedure.\n\n#### Bolloré Logistics\n\nAt Bolloré Logistics, environmental management is governed by the QHSE policy, in accordance with ISO 14001. The award in 2020 of the multi-site triple SMI certification (including ISO 14001, ISO 9001 and ISO 45001) certification for all entities in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific further strengthened its commitment. In 2023, the triple certification covered 300 sites in 54 countries.\n\nDue to the challenges associated with local pollution risks, Bolloré Logistics pays special attention to the prevention of industrial accidents and scrupulously supervises its storage and transport activities for hydrocarbons, cyanide and other hazardous materials throughout its entire supply chain in Africa. The management of hazardous goods is strictly governed by the division's QHSE policies and manual, which integrates risk assessment, risk prevention and control strategies, regulatory authorizations, reception procedures, segregation, control and handling of goods, as well as instruction and training of employees. Bolloré Logistics has spill prevention and control measures in place during all chemical handling operations (loading/unloading, storage, transfer, etc.) to minimize the effects of chemical spills on health and the environment, both on and off-site.\n\nDepending on the activity, area of operation or specific features of the site, specific measures are introduced. For example, chemical storage areas have means of containment of spills in order to control accidental spills and kits containing absorbent products (pellets, pads, socks) are made available. Contaminated materials are safely and adequately treated through a specialized hazardous waste treatment service provider. Retention trays are available to hold containers with leaks.\n\nWarehouses and yards operated by Bolloré Logistics have internal prevention, protection and intervention resources that include:\n\n- fire protection resources (fire extinguishers, fire hoses, smoke evacuation, etc.) based on the level of risk presented by the activities;\n- procedures to ensure the overall condition and maintenance of the facilities;\n- regular internal inspections to verify the good condition and accessibility of fire-fighting resources and emergency systems, compliance with safety rules, etc.;\n- specific procedures such as issuance of work permits before performing certain risky operations (e.g. hot-spot work), and;\n- procedures to secure facilities against the risk of malicious acts.\n\nIn addition, Bolloré Logistics has formalized its basic QHSE requirements for warehouse design and yards: a manual lists the QHSE and safety standards that must be followed when new warehouses are built, facilities are expanded or modified, or warehouses are rented. Training on the handling and transportation of dangerous goods is also provided to staff (IMDG, IATA, ADR, CFR49, etc.).\n\nIntervention exercises are conducted by the entities to test the effectiveness of the procedures and the emergency equipment available and proper knowledge of the rules to be followed by employees. Crisis management exercises with simulation of spills are also carried out. Members of the local crisis management cell work in concert with the highest civil, administrative, police and specialist military authorities.\n\nSubcontractors responsible for transporting dangerous goods are selected according to the list of qualified suppliers registered in the Link Partner platform, the selection of which is based on several criteria according to the vendor management procedure (compliance with regulations, quality of service, staff qualifications, equipment made available in good condition, appropriate, properly maintained, etc.). Depending on the sensitivity of the dangerous goods that may be transported, a pre-qualification audit may be carried out to verify the information provided by the subcontractor.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n# Bolloré Energy\n\nSubject to very strict mandatory regulations relating to its activity (Seveso sites, ICPE, etc.), Bolloré Energy implements an environmental management system on a daily basis to manage environmental risks, such as the risk of spilling hydrocarbons during loading or unloading, as well as the risk of fire on premises and the storage of hazardous products. These issues are governed by Bolloré Energy's general environmental, health and safety policy, which is based in particular on ISO 14001 certification.\n\nSince 2017, Bolloré Energy has been working on voluntary certification under ISO 14001:2015 for all its Seveso oil depots, going beyond the minimum regulatory requirements. Thus, 100% of its massive depots are covered by an environmental management system and a specific environmental policy. As part of the certification, five ISO 14001 audits were carried out in 2023.\n\nThese strategic procedures have enabled Bolloré Energy to reduce its environmental impact and provide accountability for environmental issues and to guarantee confidence for its stakeholders.\n\nIn addition, Bolloré Energy has put preventive technical controls in place at all of its facilities to allow more in-depth monitoring of depots and correct any anomalies. Crisis management exercises are carried out every year, complementing the exercises linked to the Seveso internal operation plan, enabling employees to gain practical experience in best practices. These exercises mobilize operational staff on site as well as external personnel (fire fighters, etc.). \"Crisis cell\" exercises are also organized, notably involving head office personnel.\n\nEight internal operation plan exercises were carried out in 2023.\n\n# **• Industry**\n\n## Blue and Films\n\nThree main risks have been identified for Blue activities and are subject to specific mitigation measures:\n\n- fire risks: extinguishing and detection systems, training and fire exercises including accidental spill scenarios. There were 21 exercises in 2023;\n- water pollution risks: storm basins to contain polluted water in the event of a fire or accidental spill. Any liquids stored are placed in retention tanks;\n- air pollution risks, managed in particular by systems that treat emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by thermal oxidation at battery manufacturing sites (France and Canada).\n\nIn addition, the factories producing LMP<sup>®</sup> batteries in France and Canada, electric buses (Bluebus) and plastic films (Bolloré Packaging Films) are covered by an environmental management system and are ISO 14001 certified. In 2023, 15 internal environmental audits were carried out on the Blue and Films scope.\n\nIt should also be noted that “solid-state” LMP<sup>®</sup> battery manufacturing technology has the advantage of eliminating the environmental risks associated with the release of hazardous liquids. LMP® batteries are exempt from SVHC (Substance of Very High Concern) rules under the European REACH regulation and CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction) rules under the CLP regulation.\n\nPeriodic inspections of facilities are carried out in accordance with the regulations in force. Service providers and carriers on our sites are subject to prevention plans and security protocols.\n\nIn addition, a safety advisor manages the transport of hazardous goods for all activities. His or her role includes advising management and ensuring compliance with the requirements for the transport of hazardous goods, including the shipment of products and waste covered by those regulations.\n\nIn 2023, 28 people were trained in the transport of hazardous materials in relation to Blue and Films activities. Awareness sessions on environmental issues are regularly held at the Group's sites (publication of dashboards, news flashes, etc.).\n\n#### Systems\n\nAll IER and Automatic Systems entities deploy an environmental management system. The main Automatic Systems production sites in Belgium have ISO 14001:2015 certification. In 2023, this certification process was extended to the French and Canadian sites, then it will be further expanded to IER in 2024 and Automatic Systems France in 2025.\n\nA new risk mapping was carried out as part of this process, identifying:\n\n- production of hazardous waste: soiled rags, WEEE (Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment), soiled empty packaging, empty aerosols, batteries, etc., and;\n- use and storage of cleaning products that may present environmental risks.\n\nCurrently, all French IER and Automatic Systems sites are equipped with chemical storage and treatment solutions (cleaners, detergents, aerosol, deicing agents, etc.). In addition to the health and safety measures implemented for employees, IER and Automatic Systems issue specific instructions for the management of chemicals and rules tailored to business lines for the management of occupational risks.\n\nInternal information campaigns are carried out to make employees aware of the environmental approach, including environmentally-friendly actions, the dissemination of the IER environmental Charter, the 5S project, citizens' days and the WEEE (Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment) campaign.\n\nInternal security audits are also carried out regularly. An internal audit is also carried out each year at Automatic Systems Belgium and IER France, as part of the deployment of the BLED solution (noise, light, energy, waste) where each process manager is responsible for assessing certain environmental issues.\n\n# The Bolloré Group's environmental management monitoring indicators\n\n# *Environmental management systems indicators(1) at the Bolloré Group(2)*\n\n|                                                                                                                                                               | 2023              |                |          |        |            |             |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------|--------|------------|-------------|\n| (as a percentage)                                                                                                                                             | Bolloré Logistics | Bolloré Energy | Industry | Others | 2023 Total | 2022 Total* |\n| Percentage of the workforce covered by<br>an environmental management system                                                                                  | 96                | 92             | 80       | 85     | 94         | 99          |\n| Proportion of entities with an<br>environmental management system                                                                                             | 87                | 25             | 70       | 33     | 78         | 98          |\n| Including the percentage of entities with<br>at least one site certified by an<br>environmental standard (e.g. ISO 14001,<br>ISO 50001, Green Terminal, etc.) | 96                | 100            | 71       | –      | 90         | 87          |\n\n(1) These indicators are derived from CSR reporting (see section 1.3.2.1. – CSR reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators relate to the Bolloré Group scope excluding Vivendi, as the risk of local pollution related to the transport and/or storage of hazardous materials has not been identified among the priority risks with regard to the activities of the Communications sector.\n\n- Data for the 2022 scone excluding Bolloré Africa Logistics following the sale of this business line\n\n\\* Data for the 2022 scope excluding Bolloré Africa Logistics following the sale of this business line.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\n# *Environmental incident indicators(1) at the Bolloré Group(2)*\n\n| Transportation and logistics (excluding Bolloré Energy)(3) | Bolloré<br>Logistics | Bolloré<br>Energy(4) | Industry(5) | Others | 2023 Total | 2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|--------|------------|------|\n| Number of environmental incidents                          | 7                    | 0                    | 0           | –      | 7          | 52   |\n\n(1) These indicators cover the scope of CSR reporting (see section 1.3.2.1. – CSR reporting methodology note).\n\n(2) These indicators relate to the Bolloré Group scope excluding Vivendi, as the risk of local pollution related to the transport and/or storage of hazardous materials has not been identified among the priority risks with regard to the activities of the Communications sector.\n\n(3) Gradual event (Ports and Rail scope), incidental and/or accidental event (product spillage, emissions of product vapor or gas, off-site disposal of products with no treatment prior to being discharged into the natural environment, etc.) that could damage the ecosystems or natural resources.\n\n(4) Number of accidents reported to the hazardous goods transport safety advisor that require declaration to the supervisory body.\n\n(5) Number of environmental accidents that caused pollution.\n\n# **1.2.3.2.3. OPTIMIZING WASTE MANAGEMENT AND BOOSTING THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY**\n\n# Group policy\n\nThe Group pays particular attention to the monitoring of its waste at the various sites in France and abroad, whose management is part of the measures taken to reduce its risks of local pollution (notably the storage of hazardous materials). The monitoring centers on \"hazardous\" waste (waste that, by virtue of its radioactivity, flammability, toxicity or other hazardous properties cannot be disposed of in the same way as other waste without endangering people or the environment) and \"non-hazardous\" waste (which in no way endangers people and the environment). The results of the reporting are used to monitor the production of hazardous and nonhazardous waste from the industrial sites of entities included in CSR reporting (see section 1.3.2.1. – CSR reporting methodology note) and identify the recovered or recycled portion. They have been included in the calculation of the Bolloré Group's scope 3 emissions since 2020.\n\nHazardous waste comes from Transportation and logistics activities, including Bolloré Energy (oil depots where residual hydrocarbons are either treated by thermal recovery or buried), and the Industry division (battery production plants, and WEEE at IER). The entities engaging in Transportation and logistics activities make every effort to have all of their waste retreated by contractors approved by the Ministry of the Environment of the countries in which they operate to obtain the best level of treatment available in the region in question.\n\nSince 2017, the Bolloré Group has strengthened its waste reporting process by refining its analysis mesh by waste sub-categories (more than 30 categories of waste identified such as paper, wood, metals, used oils, etc.) thereby ensuring a more detailed traceability of reported waste and improving the indicator's coverage rate.\n\nFor Vivendi, the topics of waste and the circular economy are addressed under its environmental risk duty of care work (see section 2.3. of Vivendi's non-financial performance statement). In 2023, Vivendi maintained its efforts to promote the circular economy and to protect forest resources with regard to paper-consuming activities (see section 4.1.2.5. of Vivendi's nonfinancial performance statement), and continued its initiatives to limit emissions by acting on all scope 3 categories, with the first benefits visible in waste management and certain leased and sold products. In 2023, Vivendi became the main media partner of Plastic Odyssey. With 20 metric tons of plastic pouring into the oceans every minute, the Plastic Odyssey is spending three years sailing the coasts most affected by plastic pollution to spark local waste processing initiatives, develop the recycling economy to create jobs, and raise local awareness among citizens.\n\nSee Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – sections 3.2.2.2 – Duty of care risks, 4.1.2.1. – The group's carbon footprint, 4.2.2.1. – Support the development of high-impact content.\n\n# Objectives and progress\n\n| Area of action                                  | Group objectives                                          | Horizon | Progress at 12/31/2023                                     |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Waste management<br>and the circular<br>economy | • Implement 4R strategies: reduce, repair, recycle, reuse | 2023    | • 81% of hazardous waste recovered or recycled in 2023     |\n|                                                 | • Increase the share of recycled or recovered waste       | 2023    | • 73% of non-hazardous waste recovered or recycled in 2023 |\n\n# Specific features of waste management and the circular economy in the Group\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\nThe entities of the Transportation and logistics division make every effort to have all of their waste retreated by contractors approved by the Ministry of the Environment of the countries in which they operate to obtain the best level of treatment available in the territory in question.\n\n#### Bolloré Logistics\n\nAt Bolloré Logistics, waste is processed in accordance with local regulations and waste management procedures defined by the company, following the directives set by the QHSE Corporate Department. Each entity implements and maintains a waste management plan. The waste is entrusted to specialized companies in charge of transporting and treating it (recovery, disposal, etc.). Before collection, waste is placed in suitable packaging and kept in storage areas provided for that purpose.\n\nIn parallel with the improvement in waste monitoring, sorting, and recovery processes in the entities, Bolloré Logistics' waste management approach has several drivers. Actions across the entire network have increased over the past two years:\n\n• **reducing waste:** in 2023, there was an increase in the re-use of consumables, such as wood and cardboard, in the warehouses, resulting in less waste. At some entities, paper is recovered to be shredded and reused as a replacement for plastic to pad shipped products. Upcycling awareness-raising workshops are also held for employees. Other initiatives are being implemented, such as a recycling solution for empty toiletry and cosmetic containers. This program has saved 810 metric tons of CO2e since it was launched. In May 2023, Bolloré Logistics received an award for the project in the \"Logistics – Sustainable Development\" category at the Singapore Business Review (SBR) Award 2023;\n\n• **promoting circularity:** as part of its ecoresponsible supply chain solutions, Bolloré Logistics continued to develop its REcycle offering to promote the reuse of packaging and consumables employed in transport and logistics. To drive the REcycle program, the teams have developed a dedicated digital application to enable the management of these consumables (booking of packaging according to needs, visibility of the stock of reusable packaging around the world, support in the management of customs operations, etc.). All these consumables have a unique barcode, allowing them to be tracked via the REcycle application. After registering more than 1,600 circular services in 2022, the REcycle digital platform continued to advance in 2023, with a 40% increase in the reuse rate compared to the previous year. In another win for circularity, the teams at the Bolloré Logistics head office joined the circular POS marketing program set up by Fabrique Circul'R in order to develop circular economy solutions to improve the management of POS marketing campaigns in several industries that use this type of product, such as large retailers and the agri-food sector;\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n• **optimizing packaging solutions:** the optimization of references is also an area for improvement. At the Cricquebœuf site in France, a significant investment was made in 2023 to install an automatic packaging machine that adapts the size of cardboard packaging to the product. In Singapore, where the contractual logistics business is very significant, many solutions related to packaging and the supply of ecofriendly consumables have been implemented. More than 400 consumables are monitored in a dedicated tool and sustainability is one of 6 criteria subject to an annual analysis of the performance of the main suppliers; nearly 79% of the total weight of consumables purchased comes from recycled or reused sources.\n\nAs part of the annual AcTogether challenge, more than 200 actions related to waste management, promoting the implementation of the 4R policy (reduce, reuse, repair, recycle) or focused on ecofriendly packaging, were finalized in 2023. Teams also worked on processes, including in the offices (ramping up the move to paperless offices, improving recycling, donating to allow for reuse, awareness of ecofriendly actions). A webinar for all employees on how to start reducing waste was organized in October 2022 (nearly 300 participants).\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n# Bolloré Energy\n\nBolloré Energy has set up service contracts with hazardous waste recycling and recovery companies. In 2023, Bolloré Energy worked with three service providers to recover its spent hydrocarbons and oils in particular.\n\n# **• Industry**\n\nBlue and Films\n\nWaste from the industrial sites is managed as follows:\n\n- reduction at source;\n- the waste generated is sorted and primarily sent to recycling channels;\n- the various blended waste from the plants in Brittany are directed to energy recovery facilities. No waste goes into a landfill: Blue Solutions calls on recovery and recycling service providers for wood, cardboard and metals. It should be noted that Bluebus entity recycles or recovers all of its hazardous waste.\n\nBlue Solutions Canada implemented additional sorting and awarenessraising actions on waste management in 2023.\n\n#### *Battery recyclability*\n\nThe recyclability of LMP<sup>®</sup> batteries is a priority for Blue Solutions, which is committed to creating a sustainable value chain by adopting a circularity approach and ensuring that products are developed in anticipation of their end of life (see paragraph on \"Concrete initiatives to develop low-carbon products and services in each of the activities\" in section 1.2.3.1.2. – Group climate strategy: making the management of our carbon footprint central to our business lines). The manufacturing process is designed to be as environmentally friendly as possible, for example through the use of a dry, solvent-free cathode extrusion process, the use of ultra-thin anodes and cathodes, and the re-injection of recycled materials into the production line. At this time, there is no solution on the European market for recycling lithium-metal batteries that use Li-Ion technologies. This is why Blue Solutions has been working since 2020 to develop an innovative and patented solution to extract, recycle and reuse lithium metal from end-oflife LMP<sup>®</sup> batteries. The results obtained from the prototype are very promising with more than 80% extraction of lithium-metal and a very high degree of purity.\n\nMore than 440,000 euros have been invested to date, and Blue Solutions is continuing to enhance and develop this process to achieve 90% yield and to deploy it at an industrial scale.\n\nIn terms of packaging and production of dielectric films:\n\n- scraps from the production of dielectric film and certain ranges of packaging films are crushed and re-extruded to transform them into a secondary raw material. These by-products are sold to customers or, in the case of packaging film, may be reused in the manufacturing process (BRi reference using 30% of postindustrial recycled material, a process that was extended to two other references in the Bolphane and Bolfresh ranges in 2022);\n- manufacturing scraps that cannot be transformed into by-products inhouse all have recycling solutions;\n- the development of chemical recycling of plastic waste on an industrial scale represents an additional opportunity to recover postindustrial and\n\npost-consumer film waste. Films Packaging is closely following this development and is contributing to its implementation by already using materials recycled via this technology in some of its products.\n\n#### *Plastic packaging management*\n\nPlastic packaging is subject to various restrictions or prohibitions at European and national level, with the promulgation in France of Act no. 2020-105 on reducing waste for a circular economy (\"Agec law\") which aims to end the marketing of single-use plastic packaging by 2040. Under this law, reduce, reuse and recycling targets will be set by decree every five years.\n\nAll films produced by Packaging Films can be recovered at the end of their life, either by recycling or by energy recovery in accordance with EN 13431. Packaging Films is committed to complying with current and future regulations, adapting its products accordingly, and pressing ahead with its ecodesign strategy (see section 1.2.3.1.3. – Resilience of the organization's strategy: placing the control of our carbon footprint at the heart of our products and services):\n\n- Bolphane R3 range: with 100% recyclable products to date, one BRi product incorporating postindustrial regenerated material, and B-Nat<sup>®</sup> 0 and B-Nat<sup>®</sup> F products incorporating biosourced material;\n- Bolfresh range: with currently one OXBTEC\\_RCB<sup>®</sup> reference, suitable for food contact, recyclable and containing a portion of recycled polymers from post-consumer plastic waste.\n\nFurthermore, the development of advanced recycling of plastic waste on an industrial scale represents an additional opportunity to recover postindustrial and postconsumer film waste, especially for food-contact films. Films Packaging is closely following this development and is contributing to its implementation by already using materials recycled via this technology in some of its products. This approach is applied across its entire range.\n\n# Systems\n\nIER and Automatic Systems do not directly consume raw materials, as their primary activity is assembly. However, they promote the recyclability and management of waste from their products as well as those of their suppliers. For example, Automatic Systems strives to reduce its share of total waste by working with its component suppliers to ensure that their packaging is recyclable and reusable. The subsidiary conducts in-depth monitoring of the overall quantity of waste and reports it annually during the QHSE Department review.\n\nMore than 80% of the products manufactured by these two subsidiaries, often with lifespans of more than fifteen years, are recyclable in the waste market. For example, the new \"FirstLane\" security corridor designed by Automatic Systems meets this objective by having a recyclability rate of 90.7%, calculated according to IEC 62635/2012 and a revaluation rate of 93%.\n\nTo further strengthen its waste management strategy, Automatic Systems also implemented a Product Environmental Profile (PEP) approach in January 2023 to assess the ecological footprint of each of its products, particularly by estimating their recyclability rate.\n\nIn response to regulations (European directive 2002/96/EC), IER is implementing a comprehensive solution for the recovery and reprocessing of its end-of-life products. In 2009, it signed a contract for a treatment solution with a certified and approved company. In France, it also joined a government-approved eco-organization on July 1, 2013. IER also offers its customers the opportunity to benefit from the recycling solutions it has set up with its certified service providers for earlier products not covered by the regulations and for facilities outside Europe. This is the case in North America, where the recycling of end-of-life electronic products is not yet regulated: IER, at the customer's request, offers dismantling, packaging and return of equipment to the factory. The recovered metal is then recycled and electronic waste passed on to specialist organizations.\n\nIn 2023, under the Agec law on reducing waste for a a circular economy, the subsidiaries IER, EASIER and Automatic Systems submitted a prevention and ecodesign plan. This plan fulfills the obligation arising from article 72 and article L. 541-10-12 of the French environmental code *(Code de l'environnement),* which state that manufacturers must draw up a five-year plan containing data on reduction and reuse, the origin of raw materials and the consumption of recycled materials and recyclability.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *Waste monitoring indicators(1) at the Bolloré Group(2)*\n\n|                                                                       | 2023                 |                  |          |                     |        |            |               |                             |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------|---------------------|--------|------------|---------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                                                       | Bolloré<br>Logistics | Oil<br>logistics | Industry | Communi-<br>cations | Others | 2023 Total | 2022 Total(2) | Total 2023<br>coverage rate |\n| Total amount of hazardous waste (in metric tons)                      | 572                  | 618              | 554      | 793                 | 174    | 2,711      | 4,806         | 100                         |\n| Of which hazardous waste recycled or recovered (in %)                 | 97                   | 75               | 67       | 87                  | 98     | 83         | 88            | 100                         |\n| Total amount of hazardous (or nonhazardous) waste<br>(in metric tons) | 8,887                | 42               | 3,984    | 9,214               | 388    | 22,515     | 37,765        | 100                         |\n| Of which non-hazardous waste recycled or recovered (in %)             | 64                   | 51               | 96       | 81                  | 31     | 76         | 79            | 100                         |\n\n(1) The quantities of waste reported by the Bolloré Group (with Vivendi, excluding Lagardère) in the table above only cover companies engaged in industrial activities.\n\n(2) For the Bolloré Group, the 2022 data have been restated to exclude Bolloré Africa Logistics following the disposal of this activity.\n\n# **1.2.3.2.4. OPTIMIZING WATER MANAGEMENT**\n\nGiven the importance of this issue at a global level, the Group is aware of its responsibilities for monitoring and optimizing its water consumption and preventing any risk of water pollution through the treatment of contaminated water. Water management is notably taken into account in the environmental management systems implemented by Group entities (see section 2 – 1.2.3.2.2. Preventing local pollution risks and industrial accidents).\n\nAs part of its environmental reporting, the Group monitors its water consumption closely in a constant effort to optimize resources. As a matter of principle, all critical facilities must be equipped to handle wastewater in accordance with local regulations.\n\n# Objectives and progress\n\n| Area of action   | Group objectives                                                                                 | Horizon                       | Progress at 12/31/2023                                                                   |\n|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Water management | • Implement actions to reduce water<br>consumption and prevent leakage/loss<br>on water networks | 2022 carried over<br>to 2023* | • Continued deployment of systems<br>to continuously monitor changes<br>in the flow rate |\n\n\\* The 2022 targets were renewed in 2023 due to two significant disposal projects and anticipated work related to the CSRD in 2024.\n\n# Specific challenges related to water management in the Group's activities\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\n# Bolloré Logistics\n\nGiven that water use is mainly linked to sanitary facilities and cleaning, water risk has not been identified as material for Bolloré Logistics' activities. Water consumption is monitored in all entities using meters or invoices. A water consumption reduction policy is in place, notably through the installation of rainwater collection tanks on network sites. The optimization of water consumption is also taken into account in new construction, and daily use is the subject of ecofriendly campaigns with employees. In Thailand, the Smile Hub warehouse uses an H2O Air molecular water generator to supply staff with cold water, saving 25% of water, or 60 m<sup>3</sup> per year. In 2023, the Calcutta branch (India) and the Lahore branch (Pakistan) decided to reuse wastewater from the air conditioning system to water plants: in total, more than 150 liters of water are saved each day.\n\nIn addition to efforts to optimize water consumption, the entities have been taking awareness-raising actions on the importance of preserving water resources for two years. In June 2023, to celebrate World Ocean Day, Bolloré Logistics France committed to the fight against water pollution by actively collaborating on an initiative spearheaded by the NGO Swim for Change. Bolloré Logistics Fiji, Oman, Australia and Singapore also organized actions to prevent marine pollution, resulting in over one ton of waste being collected on beaches.\n\n# **• Oil logistics**\n\n# Bolloré Energy\n\nIn 2023, Bolloré Energy consumed 12,027 m<sup>3</sup> of water and collected 484 metric tons of contaminated water, which is classified as waste and treated. Water discharged from industrial activities is regularly tested and each site is assessed at least once a year. In 2023, 97 tests were carried out.\n\n# **• Industry**\n\nBlue\n\nWater consumption is not directly used in Blue's industrial processes. Water is used for cleaning, sanitation and fire-fighting tests and drills. Water conservation and cost-saving measures are implemented at all sites; these include rainwater recovery solutions for sanitary facilities, automatic taps with motion detectors and regular consumption monitoring. This issue is a core component of Blue's health, safety and environment policies, as well as its environmental management system.\n\n# *Water consumption monitoring indicators(1)*\n\n| (in m3)              |                   | 2023(3)        |          |        |            |               |\n|----------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------|--------|------------|---------------|\n|                      | Bolloré Logistics | Bolloré Energy | Industry | Others | 2023 Total | 2022 Total(4) |\n| Water consumption(2) | 206,153           | 12,027         | 16,557   | 7,969  | 242,705    | 250,571       |\n\n(1) This indicator covers the Bolloré Group scope outside the Communications division for the sake of the clarity of the actions presented qualitatively in this chapter.\n\n(2) Includes water from distribution networks and from the environment.\n\n(3) Total 2023 coverage rate: 100% of the Bolloré CSR reporting scope.\n\n(4) For the Bolloré Group, the 2022 data have been restated to exclude Bolloré Africa Logistics following the disposal of this activity.\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.2.3.2.5. PRESERVING BIODIVERSITY**\n\nThe Bolloré Group is aware of the importance of taking biodiversity issues into account in the performance of its activities. This is reflected in various actions such as the biodiversity policy deployed by Bolloré Logistics.\n\n# Measures taken to preserve biodiversity in the Group's activities\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\n## Bolloré Logistics\n\nBolloré Logistics provides services that are not directly dependent on living resources. However, its network of agencies and logistics hubs, positioned at the crossroads of international trade, are all points of contact with biodiversity. For the past ten years, the company has been committed to taking biodiversity into account globally at the business line level, while relying on local adaptations in each of its locations around the world, with the goal of mobilizing all its employees, particularly through its Powering Sustainable Logistics CSR program. Its new Biodiversity Charter is the result of collaborative work by all Bolloré Logistics Departments, backed by the expertise of a biodiversity consulting firm that supports the teams over the long term. The company's objective is to extend its commitment to biodiversity throughout its value chain in response to its priority challenges in four areas:\n\n1. mobilize Bolloré Logistics' global network and oversee the rollout of our biodiversity commitments;\n\n2. model how our activities impact and depend on biodiversity throughout the value chain and identifying areas for improvement;\n\n3. reduce the pressure exerted by Bolloré Logistics' activities on the five causes of biodiversity degradation as defined by IPBES;\n\n4. strengthen the benefits of biodiversity for all stakeholders.\n\nTo do that, a Biodiversity Policy Steering Committee led by an ecologist and comprising more than 100 persons representing key functions in the company, and 40 biodiversity ambassadors, meets every six months to implement the 15 actions of the biodiversity management system, which has held the Ecocert<sup>®</sup> Biodiversity Commitment certification since 2015, and to monitor changes in indicators as closely as possible. One example among the many actions taken: Bolloré Logistics has been compiling an ecological database of its land holdings around the world to define appropriate local action plans in partnership with ecologists. In 2023, the land footprint of the 387 sites in the division's network was studied by an ecologist who established a biodiversity risk score for each of them using a common spatial and ecological analysis methodology (environment, surface area, footprint, land use, protected areas, etc.). Out of 188 sensitive Bolloré Logistics sites, 92 have been recognized as priority sites, i.e. sites with major biodiversity challenges and strategic warehouses for the Climate Plan. These priority sites account for 24% of all the company's sites, making up 52% of the total land footprint, 54% of green spaces and 49.5% of building space. There are a number of objectives: to inform employees about local biodiversity issues near their workplace, to focus support on priority sites by working with them to draw up local biodiversity action plans with recommendations from ecologists, and to measure the \"ecological potential of sites\" score.\n\nThis continuous improvement effort makes it possible to deploy the Biodiversity policy to priority sites as well as projects to build or renovate tertiary buildings in order to support them with an internal \"Site Committed to Nature\" label awarded by the CSR Department and partner ecologists. Since 2020, one of the company's specific commitments has been to implement a biodiversity action plan at 35 priority sites worldwide by 2025. It has now surpassed that goal with 39 \"Site Committed to Nature\" designations covering more than 95,500 m<sup>2</sup> of green spaces managed without pesticides. In addition, the goal to double biophilic indoor spaces in 2025 compared to 2019 levels to promote employee well-being at work was exceeded in 2023 with more than 401,000 m<sup>2</sup> covered by the Interior Design Charter incorporating quality of life at work and the greening of facilities. The goal to have 50% of employees made aware of biodiversity and climate change by the end of 2022 has also been achieved, with almost 19,000 employees educated on biodiversity and climate change in 2021 and 2022. The planning of regular events in the branches (Climate and Biodiversity Fresks, beach clean-ups, coral restoration, tree planting, etc.) in 2023 continued to raise awareness employee at the local level.\n\nMoreover, since 2018 Bolloré Logistics has been publicly committed to the Act4nature initiative spearheaded by the EPE (Entreprises pour l'environnement) association. It publishes an annual report on its biodiversity actions on the Act4nature official website; these actions include its voluntary commitments for 2025, which are audited every two years by the French Office of Biodiversity.\n\nThis makes Bolloré Logistics one of the companies that integrate biodiversity into its strategy, activities and value chain. It is leading the way in the transport and logistics sector with respect to its commitment to the preservation of urban biodiversity.\n\n# **1.2.4. COMMITTING OVER THE LONG-TERM TO REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT**\n\nAs a major global economic player, the Group conducts a proactive policy in the areas of access to education, training and care. It establishes lasting partnerships on themes related to its activities and values, by developing synergies with the local players in the regions in which it operates.\n\n# **1.2.4.1. RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO RELATIONS WITH COMMUNITIES**\n\n*Prioritization of risks and opportunities related to relations with local communities(1)*\n\n| Transportation and logistics | Oil logistics  | Industry | Communications |         |         |\n|------------------------------|----------------|----------|----------------|---------|---------|\n| Bolloré Logistics            | Bolloré Energy | Blue     | Films          | Systems | Vivendi |\n\n(1) Priority risk and opportunity.\n\nIn blue: priority non-financial risk at the division level. In gray: non-priority non-financial risk at the division level.\n\nWith locations in several countries, the Group, through its activities and relationships with local communities, is a key player in regional social and economic development. It must therefore prevent, mitigate and compensate for the negative externalities generated by its activity while maximizing beneficial impacts for local populations and the territories where it operates.\n\nThis risk has not been identified as one of the priority risks of the Communications sector, given the nature of its activities. For more information on the management of CSR priority risks in the Communications sector, see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document in chapter 2 – section 2.2. – Main non-financial risks and opportunities.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.2.4.2. A GROUP COMMITTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF POPULATIONS AND TERRITORIES**\n\n# Group policy\n\nIn all its activities, one of the Group's priority challenges is to contribute to the development of the regions in which it operates. This primarily involves the recruitment and training of local employees, investments, and dialog with the communities around its premises. The Group contributes directly or indirectly to the development of the local economy, and to the development of services. The relationships with local communities and actors enable it to better participate in regional dynamics and be more closely involved in their issues.\n\n- The Group's local social impact policy is broken down into several key points:\n- contributing to and promoting local employment;\n- revitalizing the regions;\n- building and maintaining dialog with stakeholders, and;\n- undertaking societal actions for the benefit of local populations.\n\n# **1.2.4.2.1. CONTRIBUTING TO AND PROMOTING LOCAL EMPLOYMENT**\n\nIn 2023, Bolloré Group measured its impact in terms of local employment and observed that the share of local employees remained stable. Of the Bolloré Group's 18,329 employees as at December 31, 2023, 99.6% were local employees.\n\nThe representativity of managers on each of the continents is in line with the Group's average overall, with a slightly higher rate in France, which is the\n\n#### *Indicators(1) on the workforce by geographic area(2)*\n\nwomen is very good in all regions, with almost equal proportions of women and men.

It engages in direct employment, and has an indirect impact through purchases from local suppliers and service providers (see section 1.2.2.2.3. – Respect of the fundamental rights of communities and neighbors close to our operations and constant efforts to make a positive contribution to society).\n\n# Impacts of investments in the Group's activities\n\n# on regional development\n\nThe Bolloré Group is committed to regional development, through its investments and business, as well as through its commitments to associations and sponsorship of programs promoting job placement. For example, since 2022, the Group has been supporting the rollout of mentoring in France in collaboration with the NGO Proxité. The experience in Proxité's priority neighborhoods and its results with more than 6,500 young people showed the Bolloré Group the power of supporting the association for two years to join forces and have a positive regional impact in Lille, Nantes and Toulouse. It affords employees an opportunity to get involved by sponsoring young people from struggling regions. The assistance is adapted to the needs and expectations of young people to give them the best chance at academic success and promote sustainable professional integration.\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\n#### Bolloré Logistics\n\nAt Bolloré Logistics, local purchases mainly include subcontracting costs (security, guards, rent, etc.), equipment rental and the purchase of fuel. All logistics, industrial and commercial facilities operated with leading partners and states drive job and wealth creation for the company's countries of operation, and contribute to the opening up of territories and their economic dynamism (local purchases and taxes).\n\nBolloré Logistics also contributes to the creation of indirect and induced jobs by prioritizing the purchase of materials and goods in the countries in which it operates and outsourcing appropriate tasks to local companies. As well as creating jobs, the company contributes to improving the employability of local populations through:\n\n- the transfer of knowledge and training;\n- skills development (employee training, solidarity actions to promote the education and training of young people), and;\n- improved performance and the ability of local companies to support economic growth (implementing corporate standards throughout its value chain, solidarity actions for local companies in this area, promotion of cooperation in education, training, and corporate R&D).\n\nAs part of this effort, several Bolloré Logistics branches have taken steps to develop relationships with schools. By way of illustration, in July 2022 the Singapore subsidiary launched a project to improve the inclusion of social and environmental impacts in the assessment of investments based on the Triple Bottom Line approach with a group of students from KEDGE Business School – Paris as part of their master's degree in Sustainability. The goal is to develop an easy-to-use tool that delivers financial performance and aligns with the CSR roadmap. This work is part of their final year project, and will provide an excellent basis for recommendations to address a Bolloré Logistics issue.\n\nFurthermore, Bolloré Logistics Singapore regularly organizes student tours of its B.Lab, an in-house innovation center that deploys its capabilities in digital innovation, robotics and sustainable development initiatives. The tours include presentations of the latest responsible solutions. In May 2023, a larger partnership was signed with Essec in Singapore, and the first two MAPS/Essec cohorts were launched with around 30 participants.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\nMeanwhile, Bolloré Logistics China was the partner of the 10th Trophée des Talents, a talent competition organized by the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China and the French Embassy. This national competition, launched in 2013, is aimed at Sino-francophone students and Chinese students. It provides them with a better understanding of the business world, and gives them access to a platform where they can connect with French companies and showcase their talents, to improve their chances of being recruited. Bolloré Logistics China is also committed to helping students with disabilities, and has officially pledged to offer internship and employment opportunities to students from specialized schools in Shanghai.\n\nSince April 2022, Bolloré Logistics has been supporting the Graine d'Orateur 93 association, which aims to expand public speaking training to schools, associations and/or socio-cultural organizations in the priority neighborhoods of Lille, Lyon and Marseille. The goal is to educate more than 300 young people about citizenship and the foundations of democracy by engaging in debate and public speaking.\n\n# **• Industry** Blue\n\nOut of concern for its impact on the environment and the development of the\n\nlocal economic fabric, Blue relies on local suppliers as much as possible. It works with local sheltered workshops such as CATs (labor assistance centers) and Esats (labor assistance establishments and Services) to purchase office supplies and wooden pallets, maintain green spaces, etc. In 2022, more than 83,578 euros was paid by the division unit as part of partnerships with CATs.\n\nIn addition, the production sites of Bluebus six-meter and twelvemeter electric buses and LMP® Blue Solutions batteries are certified Origine France Garantie (guaranteed French origin). This distinction ensures product traceability by giving consumers a clear and objective indication of origin and certifies that Bluebus vehicles built at the Quimper plant acquire their essential characteristics in France. This strategy of continued improvement of these vehicles also boosts the production line, which currently employs 130 people in Ergué-Gabéric in Brittany for bus production and 240 people for battery production.\n\n# **1.2.4.2.3. BUILDING AND MAINTAINING DIALOG WITH STAKEHOLDERS**\n\nThe Group and its divisions are committed to taking into account the expectations and concerns of their internal and external stakeholders at all levels of the organization. The Group undertook an external stakeholder identification process (banks, funders, investors, customers, ratings agencies, etc.) to take into account their priorities. The divisions and subsidiaries maintain ongoing dialog with their stakeholders (local communities, customers, suppliers, etc.), adapted to their local and operational contexts.\n\nVivendi fully recognizes that, in order to develop sustainably, a company must take into account its ecosystem, which comprises all its stakeholders. The group places great importance on dialog with everyone involved in its activities, and maintains ongoing exchanges with the financial and extrafinancial communities, associations and academic circles, employees and their representatives, and customers (see section 4.3.3.3. of Vivendi's nonfinancial performance statement). This approach was strengthened in 2021 with a materiality analysis that provided a better understanding of the expectations of the group's stakeholders (see section 2.1.1. of Vivendi's nonfinancial performance statement, in particular the stakeholder mapping diagram). See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 1.3 – Continuous dialog with stakeholders.\n\n# Illustration of dialog with stakeholders\n\n# **• Transportation and logistics**\n\nTo conduct its activities in the best possible manner and to be a valued and contributing partner of its host communities, the Transportation and logistics division maintains daily dialog with stakeholders in the territories in which it operates.\n\n# Bolloré Logistics\n\nBolloré Logistics is customer-focused, keen to maintain daily dialog to meet customers' current and future needs, to help them achieve sustainable growth. Each year, Bolloré Logistics conducts a customer satisfaction survey so that they can share their feedback and identify areas for improvement by region, country and industry.\n\nThe satisfaction survey was completed by 764 customers in 2023. Regular business reviews with customers and suppliers also allow for discussion and progress on environmental action plans. In addition, innovation workshops with customers, based on a design thinking approach focused on sustainable transport and logistics, are organized at the two B.Lab innovation centers at the Headquarters in Puteaux and Singapore.\n\nSince March 2023, Bolloré Logistics has also helped some of its key customers meet their commitments to reduce their carbon footprint and make carbon reduction a value driver with a codevelopment process called \"Beyond Carbon\". This proactive approach aims to codesign and innovate with them, then develop tools to enhance the value propositions linked to carbon reduction. As part of this process, individual interviews were held with customers' supply chain, CSR, sales and Purchasing Departments. Beyond taking a tailored approach to these key accounts, the aim is to capitalize on the efforts already made by Bolloré Logistics teams, to share methodology and, of course, best practices (see section 1.2.3.1.3. – Resilience of the organization's strategy: placing the control of our carbon footprint at the heart of our products and services).\n\nIn parallel, Bolloré Logistics is continuing its work in the transport and logistics sector. For example, in France teams participate in workshops organized by the sustainable development Commission of the French Federation of transport and logistics (TLF) and the SupplyChain4Good initiative managed by France Supply Chain by Aslog. As well as taking part in local initiatives, Bolloré Logistics participates in various international sector bodies with a common objective to combat climate change such as EcoTransIT<sup>®</sup>, the Clean Cargo Working Group, the Sustainable Air Freight Alliance, the Getting to Zero Coalition, and the Global Logistics Emissions Council. The company is also forging partnerships around packaging and the circular economy: in France, in 2023, it joined the Circul'R Club (a program focused on the challenges of point-of-sale advertising), and in Singapore, Bolloré Logistics is a member of the PPP (Packaging Partnership Programme) and PRAS (Plastic Recycling Association of Singapore) to implement recycling solutions in the country.\n\nBolloré Logistics also engages in initiatives with its stakeholders on societal actions. For example, in 2023, Bolloré Logistics and Earthtalent by Bolloré joined forces to launch \"Los Talentos para el Futuro\", an open call for projects with potential positive impacts in Mexico. This challenge, jointly developed with the Bolloré Logistics Mexico teams, aims to reward community projects with a positive impact on the environment, while promoting the talent and creativity of young Mexicans. The deadline for submitting projects was October 8, 2023, via a questionnaire on the Earthtalent website. Next, the proposals will be evaluated by a jury made up of experts and professionals from the Bolloré Group and its partners, who will deliberate and award the winning project up to 10,000 euros for one year, subject to the conditions set out in the rules.\n\n# *The AcTogether challenge, an inter-country competition that strengthens dialog with internal stakeholders*\n\nBolloré Logistics has stepped up dialog with its internal stakeholders with the introduction in early 2020 of an annual competition called AcTogether. This inter-country challenge aims to engage and unite employees in a quest to meet shared sustainable development targets, directly linked to its Powering Sustainable Logistics CSR program. The collective dynamic invites employees to undertake CSR challenges, individually or as part of a team, and share best practices and local initiatives on a digital platform. This enables Bolloré Logistics to better connect central policies with local network actions in its 65 regions.\n\nFor this fourth edition of the challenge, 1,663 actions were carried out in 50 countries, including 68% environmental actions (waste management, energy efficiency and CO<sup>2</sup> with building performance, low-carbon transport plan, sustainable packaging solutions and circular economy, biodiversity actions) and 21% social actions (well-being at work, preventive healthcare, diversity and inclusion, etc) and 10% GO SAFE actions in connection with the new health and safety challenge. This year's edition made good progress, with a 24% increase in completed actions compared to the 2022 edition. In 2023, Bolloré Logistics Philippines emerged as the winner of the challenge, with 154 actions completed that saved nearly 3,820 metric tons of CO2.\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Bolloré Energy\n\nAt Bolloré Energy, site monitoring commission meetings involving residents' associations and government departments, held at the prefecture, are also organized every year, in accordance with the regulations applicable to Seveso upper-tier sites.\n\n# **• Industry**\n\n# Blue\n\nAmong the Blue division's most important stakeholders are the research and development community and scientific training bodies that specialize in the challenges of the energy transition and the manufacturing of energy storage solutions. As such, Blue Solutions is developing various scientific collaboration partnerships, for example with the Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH) in 2023, and with the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM) in Neuchâtel on projects to improve solid-state lithium metal batteries.\n\nAlso in 2023, Blue Solutions and Bluebus joined forces with Forsee Power to develop the battery of the future in France.\n\n## Systems\n\nCar-sharing activities have been part of Systems' DNA since its creation and the division naturally continues to maintain essential dialog with its stakeholders such as local authorities, as its solution, the Smart Mobility Platform, is specifically designed to support them in the management of mobility services and infrastructure. Thanks to this regulatory tool, the city can offer operators fair access to urban space by balancing the various solutions and by creating a comprehensive and complementary mobility offer to existing transport networks. It enables transport operators to collaborate effectively to maximize the use of city resources and organize mobility services for the benefit of users. As such, the division maintains ongoing trustworthy dialog with the public authorities to which it provides its solutions.\n\n# **1.2.4.2.4. UNDERTAKING SOCIETAL ACTIONS FOR THE BENEFIT OF LOCAL POPULATIONS**\n\nSolidarity is one of the Group's core values. The Bolloré Group's solidarity policy and the related actions carried out each year are built around the Fondation de la 2<sup>e</sup> chance, the Foyer Jean-Bosco, targeted societal actions and the Group's International Solidarity Commitment and Sponsorship Department (see section 1.2.4.3. – Sponsorship policy).\n\nWith the third pillar of its CSR strategy, *Creation with All,* Vivendi reaffirms its belief that everyone has a role to play in building a more inclusive and sustainable society. And the group intends to have a positive impact on the world around it by working with all its stakeholders, both internal and external. See Vivendi universal registration document 2023 – chapter 2 – section 4.3.3 – Acting together to enable everyone to have a positive impact.\n\n# Fondation de la 2<sup>e</sup> chance: combating exclusion and promoting solidarity\n\nSet up in June 1998 at the initiative of Vincent Bolloré, the Fondation de la 2<sup>e</sup> chance has been recognized for its public utility since 2006. Chaired by Marie Bolloré, the Fondation de la 2<sup>e</sup> chance helps people aged 18 to 62 who have faced extreme hardship and who presently live in a vulnerable situation, but who have a real desire to get their lives back on track. It provides financial and personal support for a realistic and sustainable professional project:\n\n• creating or buying a business (up to 8,000 euros in funding), or;\n\n• completing training leading to a qualification (up to 5,000 euros in funding).\n\nThis financial \"leg-up\" is accompanied by professional and emotional sponsoring provided to the beneficiary, until the project reaches a successful conclusion.\n\nThe Foundation's continued activities are supported by a team of employees and volunteers. Six employees coordinate all those involved in the Foundation at the head office, hosted by the Bolloré Group. A network of 1,000 active volunteers acts as on-site representatives, instructors and sponsors throughout France.\n\nOver the past two decades, the Fondation de la 2<sup>e</sup> chance has helped over 9,255 people to bounce back. In 2023, 243 new candidates were given support, with average aid per case of 2,971 euros. 70% of candidates received help via training and 30% for creating a company. Successful beneficiaries aged between 25 and 44 years old accounted for 54% of the projects supported.\n\nBolloré Group employees in Brittany (Nantes, Quimper, Rennes) are committed to the Fondation de la 2<sup>e</sup> chance, supporting the social re-integration of people suffering hardship. In 2023, 22 people with projects were accompanied through professional training and/or retraining.\n\n# Foyer Jean-Bosco\n\nThe Group acquired a building belonging to the Petites Sœurs des Pauvres, built in 1896 and located in rue de Varize, in Paris, in the 16th arrondissement, that was fully restored between 2012 and November 2015. Today, it has more than 160 rooms, mainly used by young students from French provinces and from abroad, but also provides rooms for young people suffering from illness and the elderly. This year, the 140 students and 10 elderly residents represented numerous nationalities from Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The students created a choir and an orchestra and participate each week in charity work in Paris. The Foyer Jean-Bosco is a place of fraternal and intergenerational solidarity. It is an innovative scheme that will allow all participants to develop their talents while learning to live in unison.\n\n# Key societal initiatives in 2023\n\nIn all Bolloré Group divisions, employees support causes they care about and engage in projects that are in line with the Group's values, especially solidarity.\n\n# *Marathon Day, the Bolloré Group's charity race*\n\nThe eighth edition of Marathon Day, the Bolloré Group's charity race, was held on September 28, 2023. On this occasion, employees around the world gathered with the same objective: to cover as many kilometers as possible by walking, running or pedaling. Overall, around 9,000 employees in over 50 countries racked up 40,000 kilometers.\n\nMarathon Day is a major in-house event to bring employees together around a festive charity activity. In fact, the 10 countries that succeeded in mobilizing the largest number of employees in proportion to their workforce will be able to make a donation to a local non-profit of their choice. This year, Chile, Mexico, Hungary, Spain, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Polynesia, the Philippines, New Zealand and India received an endowment to help local communities. In Bangladesh, for example, street children received support from Street Children's Partners, while in Malaysia, women victims of domestic violence were assisted by the Women's Aid Organisation.\n\n# **• Other solidarity events**\n\nIn order to unite employees around major charity events, communications media are created at the head office and then adapted locally to increase team involvement. Best practices are shared between countries and duplicated, for example:\n\n- **International Women's Day, March 8.** This year, the Communications Department created a card game. The so-called \"privilege game\" aimed to educate employees in a fun way about gender equality issues. One hundred card decks were produced and sent to branches around the world. A series of short videos called \"BEquals\" was also introduced in March; throughout the year this series gave our employees a chance to talk about gender equality issues. A training module was also created with the help of B'University to raise employee awareness.\n- **Earth Hour, March 24.** For the fifth year in a row, the Bolloré Group joined in the WWF's global initiative, Earth Hour, inviting employees from all over the world to symbolically switch off their lights for one hour and to take an energy savings knowledge quiz. From France to Lebanon, Italy, Vietnam and Brazil, branches in 17 countries participated in this event. This initiative re-asserted the company's commitment to environmental issues.\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\n• **World Environment Week.** This year, it was not just a week, but the whole month of June that we dedicated to the environment to raise awareness among the employees of the Transportation and logistics division on the major current and future challenges. This gave them an opportunity to better understand how to limit their environmental footprint through events, quizzes and fact sheets.\n\nIn addition, Climate Fresk workshops were offered throughout the year in the subsidiaries, such as IER in Suresnes and Bolloré Logistics in the US.\n\nEmployees organised campaigns to clean up public spaces and sell plant planting in about 10 countries, particularly in Asia and the Americas.\n\n- **Pink October and Movember.** Throughout October and November 2023, employees of Bolloré Logistics and Bolloré Energy organized numerous awareness-raising and prevention actions to support the fight against breast cancer and male cancers. This year the Bolloré Group chose the theme of fighting cancer through sport. There were three workshops at the head office (boxing, yoga and low-impact exercise, yoga) and a session on breast self-exams and breast cancer prevention hosted by a midwife. For example, at Fast Bolloré Logistics in Lebanon, an information session on prostate cancer was held for all staff on November 24. Employees in Indonesia took part in and attended a real sports performance combining high-intensity cardio and weightlifting, on November 16.\n- **Charity collections.** In December, as in previous years, our subsidiaries took steps to help the underprivileged. A donation drive organized at the\n\n# **1.2.4.3. SPONSORSHIP POLICY**\n\nSince 2018, the Bolloré Group's sponsorship policy has been harmonized under the Earthtalent by Bolloré label, which ensures financial transparency and the societal impact of the charitable projects the Group backs to assist local communities.\n\nBeing able to give back a part of what we have had the good fortune to receive is a value deeply rooted in the Bolloré Group's DNA. It is the reason why the Group has chosen to prioritize youth empowerment and education, while maintaining its strong commitment to respond to humanitarian and public health emergencies.\n\nIn 2023, the human, financial and material support provided by the Group benefited almost 10,000 people in 14 countries, including nearly 50% young people through organizations working primarily in education, vocational training and entrepreneurship.\n\n# **2023 KEY FIGURES**\n\n- 89 societal impact projects in 14 countries, 61% of donations benefiting young people.\n- Almost 10,000 beneficiaries, including nearly 50% young people to advance 9 UN SDGs.\n- 41 projects supported in 2023 to advance SDG no. 3 \"Good health and well-being\".\n\n# **2023 HIGHLIGHTS**\n\nIn 2023, Earthtalent by Bolloré and Bolloré Logistics participated, alongside the NGO Acted, in the emergency plan to transport basic necessities by truck to the Hatay region in Turkey to meet the needs of victims of the earthquake that took place on February 6, 2023. The NGO present on site required the support of Bolloré Logistics, in particular to transport health kits, purchased from various suppliers throughout the country, to distribution sites. In addition, Bolloré Logistics handled the transport of an ambulance and medical equipment to Yemen to support the work of the NGO Elise Care.\n\nÎle-de-France and Brittany sites benefited Restos du Cœur. More than 15 boxes of basic hygiene products were donated to the Nanterre branch and more than 3 m<sup>3</sup> of foodstuffs were donated to the Quimper branch in Brittany.\n\nBolloré Logistics Thailand donated supplies, goodies, toys, games and books to 120 children at a local school. On December 15, 22 employees, including the Bolloré Logistics Thailand management team, went to the Samut Prakan Special Education Center to donate collected items.\n\nMeanwhile, Bolloré Logistics Vietnam collected reams of paper; over 1,000 pens, felt-tips and markers; and canned milk, cookies, toys and books, for the 60 children at the Green Bamboo Welfare Center, a non-profit organization that provides a safe haven for underprivileged children in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nEmployees also donated clothing to collection bins for Emmaüs Alternatives throughout 2023.\n\nLastly, the subsidiaries listening to the needs of local communities and schools close to their sites, continue to carry out various actions. In order to facilitate access to education for as many people as possible, kits with school supplies and educational materials are regularly distributed, complementing work to refurbish the school buildings, collection bins and so on.\n\n- **World AIDS Day on December 1.** Once again this year, both in France and abroad, employee awareness campaigns (posters, red ribbons, communications) were carried out in support of this cause.\n- **A room for sucess:** the international social scholarship program to help students in vulnerable situations.\n\nIn 2023, the Cité internationale universitaire de Paris students' residence and the Bolloré Group took action to combat student poverty with the \"A room for success\" scholarship program. Initiated in November, scholarships were made available to around 20 students living in poverty. A targeted response to the specific needs and situations of these students is offered through specific support and care.\n\n- 30 projects supported in 2023 to advance SDG no. 4 \"Quality education\".\n- 37 projects supported in 2023 to advance SDG no. 10 \"Reduced inequalities\".\n- 10 projects for women.\n\nEarthtalent By Bolloré and Bolloré Logistics also rallied to support the Graine d'Orateur association, whose goal is to encourage and build confidence in young people from underprivileged and working class neighborhood by teaching them public speaking skills. A donation of 14,000 euros was made over two years to help the association expand its speech workshops in the Île-de-France region, as well as in Lille, Lyon, Marseille and Toulouse, through the creation of a network of branches.\n\nThe key initiatives carried out in 2023 as part of Earthtalent by Bolloré include 50,000 euros to support the non-profit Solucham, which promotes health and education in the high valleys of Nepal and the Solukhumbu region. The association is currently building and running a training and apprenticeship center in the town of Salleri.\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-117-0\"></span>**1.3. Summary tables of the Bolloré Group's non-financial performance indicators**\n\n# **1.3.1. SOCIAL INDICATOR SUMMARY TABLES**\n\n# **1.3.1.1. SOCIAL REPORTING METHODOLOGY NOTE**\n\n# **1.3.1.1.1. STANDARD**\n\nThe reporting of non-financial indicators is based on the internal standards drawn up by the Bolloré Group: the social data reporting protocol. This was completely redesigned in 2018 to enable the necessary indicators to be\n\n# **1.3.1.1.2. ORGANIZATION**\n\nThe following indicators have been compiled and consolidated using Enablon software for all Group activities.\n\nThe reporting process relies on three levels of involvement:\n\n- at central level: the Group's Human Resources Information Systems and Compensation Department organizes and supervises the reporting of information as it is collected. It consolidates the social indicators of all Group entities;\n- at division/regional level: the representative for the division or geographic area within the division ensures that the process runs smoothly. The representative validates all of the indicators compiled within his/her scope\n\n# **1.3.1.1.3. COLLECTION PERIOD AND SCOPE**\n\nThe data relating to the reporting year are collected in January of the following year for the period from January 1 to December 31.\n\n- This year, due to the sale of Bolloré Logistics, two separate reporting campaigns were organized:\n- the collection of Bolloré Logistics social data was brought forward and deployed across 76 legal entities. The data collected cover the period from January 1, 2023 to September 30, 2023, a reporting period of nine months. To ensure data comparability, the published data have been extrapolated to cover a full year according to a methodology established by the Group and validated by the ITO;\n\n# **1.3.1.1.4. INDICATORS**\n\nSocial reporting counts each employee as one unit, regardless of how long that employee worked during the year.\n\nThe subjects covered in the information collected are workforce, diversity, staff mobility, training, absenteeism, labor relations, organization of working time and professional insertion.\n\nFor certain indicators, it was not always possible to take the whole of the scope into account. In particular:\n\n• new entities that join the reporting scope during the fiscal year are only included in the workforce data;\n\n# **1.3.1.1.5. MONITORING AND VALIDATION**\n\nTo ensure that the indicators are reliable, the Group's Human Resources Information Systems and Compensation Department has established:\n\n- preparatory meetings before compilation commences;\n- a user guide and interactive assistance, and;\n- a hotline providing support to representatives.\n\nThe monitoring and validation objectives are as follows:\n\n- to detect discrepancies recorded in the reporting tool;\n- to ensure the reliability of data by two-level validation (division and local).\n\ncompiled. It allows uniform definitions and rules to be applied throughout the Group for the compilation, validation and consolidation of indicators. It was distributed to all those involved in social reporting.\n\nand acts as the interface between the local level and central level for his/ her area of responsibility in the event of difficulties in reporting the data;\n\n• at the local level: local representatives are responsible for entering the indicators compiled in accordance with the reporting protocol, providing explanations where the indicators differ significantly from those previously reported.\n\nA data validation flow has been set up in Enablon at each level of the organization to ensure that the indicators entered are reliable and the associated explanations are relevant.\n\n• the collection of social data outside Bolloré Logistics has been deployed across 49 legal entities and covers all twelve months of the year. The data are published in consolidated format for 2023 and include data from the Vivendi group. For some indicators, the data are broken down by activity. The collection scope applies to all fully-consolidated companies, from the moment that the company takes on staff.\n\n- for Vivendi, entities with a total workforce under 15 people at December 31 only report workforce data (i.e., not data on training, absenteeism, health and safety or collective agreements).\n- To ensure the comparability of indicators against 2023 data:\n- the 2021 and 2022 social data have been restated to exclude Bolloré Africa Logistics, which was no longer part of the reporting scope as at December 31, 2023;\n- Vivendi's 2021 and 2022 social data have been restated to exclude Editis, which was no longer part of the reporting scope as at December 31, 2023.\n\nTo ensure that the data entered in the reporting tool are consistent, a test is carried out on the relevance of the values entered for the indicators compiled, particularly by comparison with the previous year's compilation.

ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATOR SUMMARY TABLES**\n\n# **1.3.2.1. CSR REPORTING METHODOLOGY NOTE**\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of decree no. 2017-1265 of August 9, 2017 implementing order no. 2017-1180 of July 19, 2017 relating to the publication of non-financial information by certain large companies and groups of companies, and the AMF recommendations on information to be published by companies concerning corporate social responsibility, the Group revised its reporting protocol and drew up a table of significant indicators regarding the risks identified for its diversified activities.\n\nThe principles on which this protocol is based are consistent with, in particular, IFRS guidelines, ISO 26000 and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). This protocol is distributed and applied to all entities that gather and communicate their non-financial information to the Group.\n\nIt is reviewed every year and defines the conditions for the collection and verification of data.\n\nThe universal registration document presents the Group's strategic drivers and major social, environmental and societal commitments.\n\nIt is supplemented by the CSR report, which includes information about the CSR actions of the various divisions.\n\n# **1.3.2.1.1. SCOPE OF REPORTING**\n\nThe scope of companies examined corresponds to the consolidated integrated financial scope (excluding finance and operating companies accounted for using the equity method) established as at December 31, 2022. For 2023, the scope of reporting includes companies that have:\n\n- a workforce of 20 or more, and/or;\n- a revenue greater than or equal to 10,000 euros, and;\n- been in existence for at least one year (i.e., with one full accounting year completed as at December 31)<sup>(1)</sup>.\n\nWith respect to these thresholds, Bolloré's CSR reporting (excluding Communications) covers:\n\n- 70 Group entities (52 Bolloré Logistics entities and 18 non-Bolloré Logistics entities) (versus 125 entities in HR reporting);\n- 95% of the Group's total workforce in 2022 (excluding Communications); • 90% of the Group's 2022 revenue (excluding Communications).\n\nWith regard to the consolidation thresholds relating to Bolloré's CSR reporting and Vivendi's environmental reporting (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 7.1.4.3. Environmental reporting scope), the environmental indicators consolidating the Communications division\n\n# **1.3.2.1.2. REPORTING METHODOLOGY**\n\nThe following points describe the methodology employed for reporting.\n\n# Reporting protocol\n\nThis document details the CSR reporting challenges, describes the respective roles and responsibilities of directors, level one and level two approvers, and contributors as well as the organization of the campaign. It is sent out to all relevant people before the commencement of the campaign. It is also archived and made available to everyone in the reporting system.\n\n# Indicators and standards\n\nA set of indicators has been defined, covering all CSR areas and divided into several themes. The indicators were provided to everyone upon sending out of the reporting protocol.\n\npublished in section 1.3.2.2. Environmental data covered nearly 90% of the Bolloré Group's total workforce (including Vivendi) in 2022.\n\nWhen selecting the entities to be surveyed for CSR reporting, the existence of criteria makes it possible to organize the reporting approach and to focus on the most representative activities of the Bolloré Group in terms of environmental impact. Each year, the Group calculates the impact of defining these criteria in terms of non-covered carbon emissions. For 2023, the noncovered share of entities not included in the reporting scope is less than 5%, an exclusion that is deemed immaterial.\n\nThe Bolloré Group installed specialist CSR reporting software enabling decentralized collection and centralized consolidation of non-financial indicators. This tool is deployed in all entities of the Transportation and logistics and\n\nIndustry divisions in the Holding entities. All of these companies' data are collected in a shared solution, while Vivendi's data are collected in another dedicated tool.\n\nData consolidation is carried out centrally by the Group CSR team.\n\nWaste reporting is only intended for Bolloré Group industrial entities. All entities that do not only carry out office activities are considered to be industrial entities.\n\n# Reporting questionnaire and consistency checks\n\nThe reporting questionnaire is split into five related sections:\n\n- structure of the entity;\n- health and safety;\n- managing our environmental impact;\n- environmental information, and ;\n- waste.\n\nConsistency checks were introduced in response to requests from the Statutory Auditors with a view to making the reporting more reliable.\n\n# Organization and collection period\n\nDue to the sale of Bolloré Logistics, two separate reporting campaigns were organized:\n\n- the Bolloré Logistics reporting campaign was brought forward and deployed across 52 legal entities. The data collected cover nine months. The published data have been extrapolated to cover a full year;\n- the environmental reporting campaign outside Bolloré Logistics was deployed across 18 legal entities and covers all twelve months of the year. For missing data, estimates can be made.\n\n(1) The consolidation scope may be adjusted by the divisions (exclusion of companies that were closed during the year, or for which data was not available, or inclusion of companies below thresholds, etc.).\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.3.2.1.3. CALCULATION OF GHG EMISSIONS**\n\nFor scopes 1 and 2, the greenhouse gas emissions presented in the document are linked to the Group's energy consumption and include those of Vivendi. The calculation methodology used is that of the Ademe (French environment agency) Footprint database as at October 3, 2023. Where emission factors in this database are not available or deemed irrelevant, other recognized sources such as the GHG Protocol (www.ghgprotocol.org), Defra (www.gov.uk/government/publications/greenhouse-gas-reporting-conversionfactors-2022), IEA (www.iea.org) or AIB (www.aib-net.org) may be used.\n\nInternationally, where the emission factors for certain items of energy consumption were unavailable, the French factor was applied. For GHG emissions linked to electricity, when no emission factor was available for a particular country, the highest factor from any of its neighboring countries was applied.\n\nFor 2023 data, the Bolloré Group reported its scope 2 emissions according to the market-based method. Nearly 12 entities reported that they used electricity from renewable sources. The recognized contractual instruments, such as the garantie d'origine renouvelable (renewable energy guarantee), were analyzed for each of these entities. They consist of the following entities: Blue Solutions Canada, Bolloré Logistics Australia Pty Ltd, Bolloré Logistics China Co. Ltd, Bolloré Logistics France, Bolloré Logistics Italy SpA, Bolloré Logistics Malaysia SDN BHD, Bolloré Logistics Singapore Pte Ltd, Bolloré Logistics Spain, Bolloré Logistics Thailand Co. Ltd, Bolloré Logistics Vietnam Co. Ltd, Compagnie de l'Odet, Global Freight Solutions AB. In accordance with the recommendations of the GHG Protocol, an emissions factor communicated by the renewable electricity supplier was used, and/or a residual factor specific to the entity's country was applied, if available.\n\nFor scope 3, the Group identified the largest sources of emissions. In order to satisfy its obligation to post information for customers about its CO<sup>2</sup> emissions from transportation services, the Bolloré Group developed an emissions calculation tool.\n\nAs regards the calculation of scope 3 linked to the combustion of petroleum products by the Bolloré Energy division, the Bolloré Group takes as a basis the volumes sold over the year and applies the emission factors from the Footprint database corresponding to the combustion of its products sold.\n\nThe data relating to employee business travel includes data on plane and train journeys. For plane journeys, the Group split out medium-haul flights (under 2,000 km) and long-haul flights.\n\nFor emissions relating to train journeys, the Group decided to use the emission factor provided in the Ademe Footprint database for diesel TER regional express trains. In sum, scope 3 corresponds to upstream energy, waste, petroleum product combustion and emissions due to the transport of goods in the provision of freight forwarding services and to work-related travel.\n\n# **1.3.2.2.

industrial processes and fugitive emissions linked to refrigerants.\n\n(2) Scope 2 corresponds to indirect emissions associated with energy, such as electricity consumption or steam, cold or heat consumption through distribution networks.\n\n(3) For the Bolloré Group, scope 3 corresponds to upstream energy, waste, petroleum product combustion and emissions due to the transport of goods in the provision of freight forwarding services and to work-related travel.\n\nFor Communications (Vivendi excluding Lagardère), scope 3 corresponds to other emissions produced by the Group's businesses, which are not accounted for in scopes 1 and 2 but which are linked to the entire value chain, such as purchases of raw materials (paper, cardboard, plastics, etc.), management of waste generated by the subsidiaries of Vivendi, employee business travel, etc.\n\nAs the acquisition of control of the Lagardère group was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2023, its environmental data were not yet included in the Group's non-financial reporting for 2023, in line with the reporting protocol.\n\n(4) For the Bolloré Group, the 2022 data have been restated to exclude Bolloré Africa Logistics following the disposal of this activity.\n\n# Scope 3 details\n\n| (in metric tons CO₂ eq)*                                                          | Bolloré<br>Logistics | Bolloré<br>Energy |

of hazardous materials has not been identified among the priority risks with regard to the Communications division's activities. More information on the policies and action plans implemented in the Communications division is available in Vivendi's non-financial performance report.\n\n(2) The 2022 data have been restated to exclude Bolloré Africa Logistics following the disposal of this activity.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.3.3.

independent third party, accredited by the Cofrac under the number no. 3-1681 (scope of accreditation available on the website www.cofrac.fr), we conducted our work in order to provide a conclusion expressing a limited level of assurance on the compliance of the consolidated non-financial statement for the year ended December 31, 2023 (hereinafter the \"statement\") with the provisions of article R. 225-105 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)* and on the fairness of the historical information (whether observed or extrapolated) provided pursuant to 3° of I and II of

misstatements that would call into question the fact that the consolidated non-financial statement is not presented in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements and that the information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the guidelines, in all material respects.\n\n# **PREPARATION OF THE NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT**\n\nThe absence of a generally accepted and commonly used framework or established practices on which to base the assessment and measurement of information allows for the use of different, but acceptable, measurement techniques that may affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\nTherefore, the information should be read and understood with reference to the guidelines, the significant elements of which are presented in the statement.\n\n# **LIMITATIONS INHERENT IN THE PREPARATION OF THE INFORMATION**\n\nThe information may be subject to uncertainty inherent in the state of scientific or economic knowledge and the quality of external data used.\n\n# **THE ENTITY'S RESPONSIBILITY**\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Management to:\n\n- select or establish appropriate criteria for the preparation of the information;\n- prepare a statement in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements, including a presentation of the business model, a description of the main non-financial

error.\n\nThe statement has been prepared by the Board of Directors.\n\ninvolved in the preparation of the information, as this could compromise our independence.\n\nHowever, it is not our responsibility to comment on:\n\n- the entity's compliance with other applicable legal and regulatory requirements, in particular the information required by article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green taxonomy), the French duty of care law and anticorruption and tax avoidance legislation;\n- the fairness of the information required by article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green

commercial code *(Code de commerce)* and the French code of ethics of our profession *(Code de déontologie de la profession de commissaire aux*\n\n# **MEANS AND RESOURCES**\n\nOur verification work mobilized the skills of six people and took place between September 2023 and March 2024 on a total duration of intervention of about eight weeks.\n\n# **NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE WORK**\n\nWe planned and performed our work taking into account the risks of material misstatement of the information.\n\n- In our opinion, the procedures we have performed in the exercise of our professional judgment enable us to provide a limited level of assurance:\n- we obtained an understanding of all the consolidated entities' activities and the description of the principal risks associated;\n- we assessed the suitability of the criteria of the guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability, with due consideration of industry best practices, where

order to verify the proper application of the definitions and procedures and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. This work was carried out on a selection of contributing entities and covers between 14.5% and 49.2% of the consolidated data relating to the key performance indicators and outcomes selected for these tests (14.5% of the workforce, 48.5% of electricity consumption, 49.2% of non-hazardous waste, 26.5% of the number of workplace accidents with work time lost);\n- we assessed the overall consistency of the statement based on our knowledge of all the consolidated entities.\n\nWe believe that the work carried out, based on our professional judgement, is sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.\n\nParis-la Défense, April 12, 2024\n\nFrench original signed by: Independent third

Duty of care plan**\n\n# **2.1. Introduction**\n\n**2.1.1. LEGAL CONTEXT**\n\nThe duty of care law pertaining to parent companies and order-giving companies aims to extend the liability of transnational corporations so as to forestall and avoid catastrophes such as what happened at Rana Plaza in Bangladesh in 2013. The companies affected by the law must draw up a \"duty of care plan\". The law operates in several areas where serious offenses may arise from the activities of a company or its supply chain:\n\n- human rights and fundamental freedoms;\n- personal health and safety, and;\n\n• the environment.\n\n# **2.1.2. THE MISSIONS OF THE BOLLORÉ GROUP**\n\nAs one of the world's largest companies, the Bolloré Group has a historical, long-term presence and occupies strategic positions in three business sectors: transport and logistics, industry, and communications.\n\n- Through its transport and logistics activity, the Bolloré Group is an important player in economic development, the opening up of regions, and the circulation of goods, offering an essential, even vital service, in that it provides an offering that makes it possible to import and export goods, even in the most isolated areas. This integrated logistics network is a real driver for the industrial logistics transformation of certain regions.\n- Through its oil logistics business in France, Switzerland and Germany, the Bolloré Group is a major player in the storage and distribution of petroleum products and an energy supplier to local authorities, individuals and professionals (farmers, carriers, etc.), making it essential to the economic activity of the countries in which it operates.\n\nThe law affects subsidiaries directly or indirectly controlled by the parent company, along with the activities of suppliers and subcontractors with whom there is an established business relationship. Note that the Bolloré Group's duty of care plan does not apply to companies in which it holds a stake that does not give control within the meaning of article L. 233-16 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce).*\n\n- Through its industrial activities, the Bolloré Group develops innovative and sustainable solutions to offer a coherent response to the challenges raised by climate change, particularly through sustainable mobility solutions.\n- Its Communication activities are managed by the Vivendi group.\n\nThese activities involve both adaptability and a solid foundation to offer consistent and optimal quality of service regardless of the context, in line with the Group's value of excellence. The Bolloré Group is nevertheless aware of the potential impacts that the conduct of its activities may have on the environment and the day-to-day life of its stakeholders. This is why, through its due diligence approach, the Group aims to identify and control its impacts in order to prevent – and if necessary correct – situations at risk, and maximize positive externalities, with a view to sustainable and shared development.\n\n# **2.1.3. SCOPE OF ACTION OF THE BOLLORÉ GROUP'S DUTY OF CARE PLAN**\n\nIn accordance with the law, the scope of the Bolloré Group's duty of care plan applies to:\n\n- Bolloré Logistics (as of the date of publication of this document, this business has been sold) and Bolloré Energy, and;\n- Industry subsidiaries, including Blue (Blue Solutions, Bluebus), Bolloré Innovative Thin Films (Bolloré Packaging Films and dielectric films) and Systems subsidiaries (IER, Automatic Systems, Smart Mobility, Polyconseil). The following are excluded from the plan:\n- Vivendi: its CSR Department relies on its own ethics and duty of care plan, applicable to its companies, and adapted to their business lines (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document – chapter 2 – section 3.2.2. – Duty of care plan.\n\nFor more information on the Bolloré Group's activities, see chapter 1 – Presentation of the Group and its activities;\n\n- financial holdings: note that the Bolloré Group's duty of care plan does not apply to companies in which it holds a shareholding that does not give control within the meaning of article L. 233-16 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce).*\n- The following paragraphs present the 2023 duty of care plan.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-135-0\"></span>**2.2. Methodology**\n\nThe duty of care plan is prepared at the level of the Group CSR Department, which is responsible for researching and drawing up the plan, and the analyses and recommendations that must then be applied by the subsidiaries and business lines concerned by the risks identified – notably the Purchasing, QHSE, CSR, Legal Affairs, Human Resources, and Compliance departments. It presents the general system and approach used to establish and strengthen its culture of care, applied daily by its employees. The illustration in operational activities is explained within the risk management frameworks (policy, action plans, highlights, indicators), published in the Group's non-financial performance statement, whose information is verified and audited annually by an independent third party organization. More than a reporting exercise, the Bolloré Group's non‑financial performance statement describes the risks, action plans, measures and indicators put in place to ensure that social and environmental issues are managed.\n\nThe duty of care plan is updated on a regular basis to present the new tools and processes developed to deploy the Group's due diligence approach across all its activities and its value chain.\n\nIt is based on the Group's ethical framework, which is organized around two core documents: the Group's Ethics and CSR Charter and its Code of Conduct as explained in the duty of care plan report below.\n\n- **The Ethics and CSR Charter** lists the Group's commitments in terms of environmental, social and societal responsibility. It forms the basis on which more specific commitments are adapted, formalized by the Group's charters (Human Rights Charter, Diversity and Inclusion Charter, Responsible Purchasing Charter), distributed to all employees and also available online.\n- **The Code of Conduct** applies to all persons acting on behalf of the Bolloré Group, and sets out the expected behaviors, both in day-to-day operations and in sensitive situations. It formalizes recommendations to prevent, identify and report breaches, particularly through the professional whistleblowing system (described below).\n- The ethical framework is based on the following international standards:\n- the United Nations Guiding Principles and the principles of the Global Compact;\n- the OECD Guidelines;\n- the International Charter on Human Rights;\n- the International Labor Organization's core conventions, and;\n- the recommendations of the French Anticorruption Agency.\n\n# **2.2.1. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THE GROUP DUTY OF CARE APPROACH**\n\nBecause of the nature and diversity of its geographical locations and of its activities, the Group's approach to duty of care is based on the following principles:\n\n- ensuring the Group and its business relationships comply with the most relevant international standards and local legislation in force, when the latter is more stringent;\n- paying particular attention to its employees, suppliers and subcontractors, notably through duty of care concerning working conditions and high standards of health and safety for all;\n- preserving the environment by measuring the impact of its activities and those of its business relationships as well as setting up actions to protect against and mitigate environmental risks, and;\n- applying particular duty of care to safety conditions and respect for the fundamental rights of the users of the Group's products and services and people living near our sites of activity.\n\n# **2.2.2. IMPLEMENTATION**\n\n# **2.2.2.1. MAPPING OF DUTY OF CARE RISKS**\n\nThe risks identified in 2017 when the Bolloré Group's first duty of care plan was developed were divided into three major families: health and safety risks for the men and women involved in our activities and our value chain, protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, and protecting the\n\n# **DUTY OF CARE PLACED AT THE HEART OF THE GROUP'S CSR STRATEGY**\n\nThese categories, consistent with the requirements detailed by the regulations, were confirmed in 2018, during the Group CSR risk mapping, carried out as part of the implementation of the requirements set out in the non-financial performance report and proposing a more detailed classification (see section 1.1.2. – The Bolloré Group's non-financial risk mapping). Duty of care risks have been incorporated into the Group CSR risk These principles reflect the Bolloré Group's ambition to operate in line with the best international standards and in accordance with its CSR commitments, the aim of which is to guide all employees and business partners around a common set of values. They are adapted through concrete measures, formalized as part of a methodology based on a continuous improvement approach. Moreover, to optimize its approach, the Bolloré Group has identified its priorities for concentrating efforts in terms of action plans, geographical areas and resource allocation. This approach aims to achieve effective and transposable results which can be gradually applied to all of the Group's activities, wherever they are based, and also reinforce its reasonable due diligence processes.\n\nenvironment. Since more than 97% of the Group's revenues represent BtoB services (excluding Communications) and not production activities intended for consumers, the issues of traceability of raw materials appear to be less material for the Bolloré Group.\n\nuniverse, rated by the members of the Executive Committees and representatives of the support and operational functions, placing the duty of care at the heart of the Group's CSR strategy. For this reason, the CSR Department has taken steps to detail the mitigation measures implemented for all these CSR and duty of care risks in its non-financial performance statement, as explained in the methodology section.\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **POOLING OF NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT RISK AND DUTY OF CARE RISKS, CROSS-REFERENCE TABLE**\n\n| Duty of care risk<br>categories<br>(duty of care plan) | Description of the risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Risks identified in<br>the Bolloré Group's<br>non-financial risk<br>mapping (DPEF)   | Risk governance                                                                        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Health and safety                                      | These risks cover issues relating to safe and decent working conditions:<br>accident prevention, provision of appropriate equipment and training to<br>perform work safely, and guaranteeing a safe working environment based on<br>health and safety standards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Health and safety<br>of employees<br>and third parties                               | Executive<br>management,<br>QHSE<br>departments                                        |\n|                                                        | The scope of the risk control framework is: Group employees, employees of<br>its service providers, suppliers and subcontractors, as well as the users of<br>its products and services and local communities.<br>There is specific duty of care for product manufacturing and handling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Attracting and<br>retaining skills                                                   | Executive<br>management,<br>HR departments                                             |\n|                                                        | and transport activities.

Historically focused on 25 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, this area was defined based on representativeness criteria (staff, Group activities) and on the basis of the Human Development Index of the countries concerned.\n\nThis scope is now updated annually using a methodology developed inhouse. It corresponds to the geographical areas where the human rights criticality index, developed using international standards(1), is below the average score of the countries in which the Group operates. In 2023, the priority geographical area was made up of 22 countries (Pakistan, Myanmar, Cambodia, China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Lebanon, India, Thailand, Brunei Darussalam, Qatar, Taiwan, Philippines, Indonesia, Timor-Leste, Fiji, Mexico, Colombia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates), more than half of which are in Asia-Pacific.\n\nImage /page/137/Figure/4 description: This is a world map with some countries colored in blue. The countries colored in blue are Mexico, Brazil, China, India, and Indonesia.\n\n# **2.2.2.2. ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES, MONITORING OF PERFORMANCE AND OF THE MEASURES IMPLEMENTED**\n\nThrough annual non-financial reporting and the monthly QHSE reports within the divisions, more than a hundred indicators of resources and results are monitored, adjusted and enriched each year, with respect to social, environmental, societal and governance issues. Shared and studied internally with a view to constant improvement and performance monitoring, the most relevant data are published in the DPEF, which presents the risk control frameworks (description, policies and action plans implemented, indicators) in detail. The collection process, updated by the integration of additional indicators, is optimized each year. Annual external audits related to the DPEF make it possible to validate the robustness of the data reported, illustrating the proper application of the Group's various risk management frameworks, based in particular on a duty of care cycle approach.\n\n# **IMPLEMENTATION OF DUTY OF CARE CYCLES**\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/9 description: The image shows a circular diagram with four stages. The stages are \"Identification of risks\", \"Action plans\", \"Monitoring and objectives\", and \"Communication of outcomes\". The stages are connected by arrows, indicating a cyclical process.\n\nWhen it built its duty of care mechanism, the Bolloré Group defined a dedicated approach, in order to meet the key issues identified and to offer an appropriate risk control framework. This duty of care cycle approach is based on the four phases of implementing duty of care: identifying the risks, developing associated action plans, monitoring these action plans and setting targets, and reporting the outcomes of the procedures in use. This methodology is reflected in the management of CSR risks presented in the DPEF (description of risks, policies implemented, indicators, etc.).\n\nThe approach ensures at each stage of the cycle that the appropriate choices have been put in place to provide reasonable and effective duty of care over the issues seen as priority issues. The performance evaluation of the measures deployed is coupled with corrective steps as part of continuous improvement.\n\n(1) Average of the benchmark indices: the Human Freedom Index, the UN Human Development Index, the Global Slavery Index, the Global ESG Index, the Global Gender Gap Index and the Global Freedom score from the NGO Freedom House.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nThis method is also meant to make it easier to teach various audiences concerned about the duty of care procedures, involve them, identify improvements and adapt them where appropriate. The Bolloré Group explains this procedure in the report on its duty of care plan below, using various examples.\n\nIn addition, the preparation, implementation and roll-out of its whistleblowing system equip the Group with new tools to manage its duty of care approach and measure the performance of its approach.\n\n# **IMPLEMENTATION OF A WHISTLEBLOWING AND REPORTING SYSTEM**\n\nIn 2018, the Compliance Department, the Human Resources Department and the CSR Department collaborated on revising the existing whistleblowing system, which now addresses in one place both the issues of corruption and influence-peddling, and those of duty of care, which have been defined and detailed. Since the Sapin II law requires an alert system similar to that required by the duty of care law, both systems were developed on the same platform as a way to pool them and to comply with the requirement of the AFA and the Cnil.\n\nThis alert system has been the subject of consultations with the employee representative bodies to adapt to the Cnil reference standard relating to the processing of personal data intended for the implementation of a professional whistleblowing alerts system.\n\nIts deployment and the processes for collecting and handling alerts are explained in the alert procedure, available on the Group's website.\n\nWhistleblowers' alerts are processed at the head office level and overseen by the Chair of the Ethics – CSR and Anticorruption Committee, which carries out its mission independently. The whistleblowing system is open to everyone: the mechanism allows any employee of Bolloré Group or its commercial partner or any person whose interests are likely to be affected by the Group's activity, to issue an alert regarding any crime or offense, a serious and clear breach of the law or regulations, threat to the general interest or acts which go against the Group's Code of Conduct. As such, the Group's alert and reporting platform can be used for alerts relating to violations or risks of violations of human rights, fundamental freedoms, personal health and safety or the environment.\n\nAlerts issued using the whistleblowing mechanism are screened for admissibility by dedicated contacts, depending on the nature of the alert. Where applicable, the alerts will be investigated in order to establish, within a reasonable time-frame, the materiality of the facts in question.\n\nIf an investigation makes it possible to establish the materiality of a reported breach and the involvement of the alleged perpetrators, disciplinary sanctions and/or legal proceedings are taken against the person(s) in question. The Bolloré Group guarantees confidential processing (see section 1.2.2.1. – Sharing the same business ethics and ensuring compliance with the strictest standards).\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-139-0\"></span>**2.3.

This infographic aims to represent the continuous improvement of the Bolloré Group's duty of care approach in a concise manner. The policies, action plans and indicators used to measure the performance of CSR risk management, particularly in terms of protecting the environment, health and safety of persons, and respect for human rights, are explained and developed in the Group's non-financial performance statement, in accordance with the risk pooling approach.\n\n# **2.3.2. DUTY OF CARE APPROACH ON HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES WITHIN OUR ACTIVITIES**\n\n# **2.3.2.1. HUMAN RIGHTS RISK MAPPING**\n\nThe human rights risk mapping is determined on the basis of the duty of care priority geographical area and pertains to transport and logistics entities located in countries where the criticality index is lower than the average of the countries in which the Group operates. These issues were not deemed major for the activities of the Industry and Oil logistics divisions (see section 2.2.2.1. – Duty of care risk mapping, \"Pooling of DPEF and duty of care risks, cross-reference table\" paragraph).\n\nAs the Bolloré Group sold all its activities on the African continent in December 2022, the human rights priority scope has refocused on freight forwarding activities in the Asia region. In 2023, of the 76 Bolloré Logistics entities, 31 entities were identified within the 22 countries comprising the duty of care priority geographical area (see section 2.2.2.1. – Mapping of duty of care risks, \"Defining a priority geographic area\" paragraph).\n\n# **2.3.2.2. FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF WORKERS**\n\nThe Group is focusing its efforts on the implementation and deployment of measures that enable it to exercise reasonable duty of care with regard to the employees of its suppliers and subcontractors, in line with the measures\n\n# **HEALTH AND SAFETY**\n\nThe Bolloré Group's divisions and subsidiaries have health and safety policies that apply to all people working on the sites and which govern workers' activities based on risk mapping. They ensure the best standards are applied to guarantee a safe working environment and prevent accidents After identifying the human rights priority scope, specific actions were implemented to address the issues identified, in particular the need to: • increase awareness in certain regions;\n\n- strengthen the indicators which illustrate the Group's management of\n- these issues (see section 2.3.5. Table of duty of care indicators), and; • identify long-term projects to tackle specific issues (see section 2.3.4.1.\n\n– \"Working conditions\" duty of care cycle). Reporting on duty of care indicators within this scope continued in 2023, but the scope will change in 2024 with the sale of Bolloré Logistics activities. In the last quarter of 2023, work to update the scope and methodology for mapping human rights issues was organized as part of workshops dedicated to anticipating the requirements of new European directives, and will be continued in 2024.\n\nin place for its own employees. The commitments relating to respect for workers' rights are expressed in the ethical framework (see section 2.2. – Methodology) and are built in particular on the following tenets.\n\nby taking the specificities of each job into account to propose appropriate actions (see section 1.2.1. – Uniting and protecting people, the company's\nrequests for external audits – usually at the request of customers. With greatest strength).\n\n# **COMPENSATION**\n\nThe Bolloré Group's divisions and subsidiaries have compensation policies that respect local minimum wage legislation. The regularity of compensation payments may be an important issue for employees in some countries and subsidiaries ensure that a salary corresponding to the number of hours actually worked is paid regularly. However, the Group has identified the payment of a living wage (which can be defined as the amount that enables a worker and his or her family to live in dignity) as a duty of care priority. The issue of living wages goes beyond mere compliance with a legal minimum wage: indeed, in some countries, the legal wage does not necessarily cover basic needs. Thus, a project devoted to living wages was deployed in 2023 at entities within the priority scope, by the Group Human Resources Department in collaboration with the Group CSR Department and the network of human rights officers (see the \"Deployment of a long-term project on living wages\" paragraph in section 1.2.2.2.2. – Respect for workers' rights throughout the value chain).\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **WORK TIME AND PAID LEAVE**\n\nThe Bolloré Group and its subsidiaries undertake to comply with local laws, and implement systems and measures to ensure the management of working hours and paid leave (remuneration of overtime, work, respect of break times, weekly rest days, granting of parental leave, etc.). The Human Rights Steering Committee has identified these issues, which are explained in the by-laws and the collective bargaining agreements on the different sites, as priority targets for special duty of care effort within the duty of care priority scope and will be subject to dedicated audits, among other measures.\n\nTo this end, in 2023, this topic was specifically monitored as part of the internal audits carried out within the human rights priority scope in Asia-Pacific and various actions were taken to improve the monitoring of working hours, particularly the hours worked by direct employees and subcontractors (see section 2.3.4.1. – \"Working conditions\" duty of care cycle).\n\n# **EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATION**\n\nIn addition to complying with local regulations on freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining in the countries where it operates, the Bolloré Group and its subsidiaries are committed to promoting an ongoing, highquality dialog with employees. If legislation is restrictive in this area, the Group\n\n# **THE FIGHT AGAINST FORCED LABOR**\n\nAs regards forced labor, in addition to the actions described in the \"Working hours and paid leave\" paragraph, the Group has noted that using employment agencies could be a risk factor in certain regions within the priority scope. Therefore, it has taken actions to specifically address the risks associated with indirect employees, and migrant workers in particular. For example, in 2023 local HR teams in the Asia-Pacific region worked with the employment agencies that had been identified as having the potential to use\n\n# **THE FIGHT AGAINST THE EMPLOYMENT OF UNDERAGE WORKERS**\n\nAs regards child labor, to address the issues arising from the various legislative, economic and social contexts of the countries in which it operates, the Group prohibits any use of child labor.\n\nIn 2023, the internal human rights audit procedure, which is described in the \"working conditions\" duty of care cycle, highlighted and reiterated the importance and robustness of existing HR processes.\n\nIn addition, through its sponsorship actions, the Group supports various associations and involves its subsidiaries and employees in projects that improve the economic and social situation of young people, thereby increasing access to education – an essential link in the fight against child labor. The company's contribution to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including access to education and training (SDG no. 4), forms the foundation of the Earthtalent by Bolloré action program.\n\nThough the Earthtalent by Bolloré solidarity program, the Group supported around 100 projects advancing education in 2023.\n\nThese projects include the Solucham association, which promotes education and health in the Solukhumbu region of Nepal. Bolloré Logistics helped\n\n# **THE FIGHT AGAINST ALL FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION(1)**\n\nThe Bolloré Group prohibits any discrimination against workers on grounds such as ethnicity, sex, religion, political opinion, sexual orientation and national or social origin. The Group's entities are deploying various local initiatives to promote inclusion.\n\nIn particular, professional gender equality is seen as a lever for transformation, with a potential to bring people together that is common to all the Group's divisions.\n\n- **Development of a dedicated tool:** to disseminate best practices and ensure compliance with the principles of diversity and inclusion, the Group developed a special tool that comprises all internal processes and guidelines, as well as the Group charters. Launched in the first half of 2021, this tool is now intended for the entire HR network and will enable the relaying and proper appropriation of Group commitments and processes to be improved.\n- **Roll-out of a diversity awareness campaign:** the fight against discrimination relies, in particular, on raising awareness among all employees. A diversity e-learning curriculum, with several modules on the various topics,\n\nundertakes to facilitate employee expression and to guarantee that workers involved in representative structures are not discriminated against (see section 1.2.1.2.2. – Promoting social dialog and quality working conditions).\n\nforeign workers, so the agencies could provide more guarantees regarding the conditions of recruitment, accommodation, etc.\n\nFurthermore, the internal human rights audit approach deployed in 2023 within the priority scope in Asia-Pacific, did not identify any non-compliance on this point in the targeted countries. Nevertheless, preventive actions have been taken to update local HR processes and practices. These actions are detailed in the \"working conditions\" duty of care cycle.\n\nfinance the construction of a vocational training center to enable local young people to gain technical and practical skills to find a job locally and avoid having to leave their region. Various associations in India have also received support for their actions in favor of education:\n\n- for example, Jagriti A Pioneering Society provides vulnerable young women with housing, medical care and access to education, and;\n- the Thoughtshop Foundation is creating new means of communication to address societal issues. In particular, the organization works to prevent underage Indian girls from marrying by developing communication strategies and participatory tools for local communities.\n\nFurthermore, for the past five years, Bolloré Asia-Pacific Corporate has helped fund the French organization Passerelles numériques, amounting to more than 400,000 euros in total support. With a presence in Cambodia, the Philippines and Vietnam, the association's mission is to give talented but disadvantaged young people access to education and technical and vocational training in the digital sector.\n\nhas been deployed to HR employees, all managers and executive teams. Work was undertaken in 2022 to update these modules as part of a new awareness campaign. This effort continued in 2023 and led to the launch of a new campaign coinciding with International Women's Day on March 8. At the end of the campaign, 84% of employees had been made aware of diversity issues.\n\nIn addition to the measures taken to promote gender equality, a project dedicated to inclusion for people with disabilities was also launched in 2023. It resulted in the creation of a network of disability officers in France and in all the BUs of the Bretagne, Systems and telecoms, Transportation and logistics divisions. This network, comprising 12 employees, works through the HR reporting lines and organization to carry out specific actions.\n\nIn addition, since 2021 IER has partnered with an Esat (\"labor assistance establishments and services\") to welcome workers with disabilities as part of a service program to offer suitable professional employment in an ordinary setting.\n\n(1) In accordance with the commitments set out in the Diversity and Inclusion Charter published in 2018 (see section 1.2.1.2. – Being an attractive employer).\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **2.3.3. DUTY OF CARE POLICY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN**\n\nThe Group launched a first project to identify the social, human and environmental risks and issues associated with its procurement activities in 2018. This approach, presented in the duty of care plan reports of previous years, has made it possible to draw up an overview of the tools and processes used in the selection phase of service providers, suppliers and subcontractors, according to the Group's different purchasing families. The approach resulted in an initial campaign to raise awareness on the issues surrounding duty of care among buyers, and notably led to the appointment of CSR and ethics representatives in the main purchase families. Workshops are organized regularly in order to assess the existing situation, optimize the development and proper appropriation of new processes and tools, train and raise the awareness of the teams on the issues of duty of care and the Group's CSR strategy.\n\n# **2.3.3.1. STRUCTURING OF THE DUTY OF CARE APPROACH WITHIN THE BOLLORÉ GROUP PURCHASING DEPARTMENT**\n\nIn accordance with the commitments expressed in the last duty of care plan, the CSR Department has organized a project to formalize its \"duty of care purchasing\" approach, jointly with the Group Compliance and Legal departments. This duty of care approach consists of three concrete actions: the publication of the Group Responsible Purchasing Charter, the definition of a CSR clause, and the refinement of the duty of care risk mapping within the supply chain.\n\n# **THE GROUP RESPONSIBLE PURCHASING CHARTER**\n\nDeveloped and signed by the Group Purchasing director, the Responsible Purchasing Charter forms the basis of the duty of care approach to be rolled out across the supply chain. This charter is part of the Group's ethics system and defines:\n\n- principles designed to ensure ethical and lasting commercial relations with subcontractors and suppliers of goods and services; and\n- the Group's various commitments to its business partners. This dual commitment reflects the Group's desire to make every effort to prevent and reduce risks in its value chain through a process of dialog, reciprocity\n\nand support with its suppliers and subcontractors. Available on the website in English, French, Spanish and Italian, this charter is systematically shared when the Group forms new business relationships.\n\nEfforts continued in 2023 to communicate CSR commitments, which were also sent to all existing core suppliers.\n\n2023 dissemination indicators:\n\nintegrating the CSR clause.\n\n• the Responsible Purchasing Charter was sent to 100% of the supplier base as well as 100% of new suppliers, managed centrally;\n\nresulting in the development of guidelines to support the negotiating in\n\nIn 2023, nearly 100% of core suppliers (suppliers managed by the Purchasing Department at the head office level) signed our compliance and CSR clauses. The Group uses a dedicated document management solution to target suppliers with which the business relationship is not formalized in a contract. This solution, which is used for listing purposes, facilitates the management of all documents relating to purchasing processes and the transmission of specific conditions that incorporate aspects of the compliance and CSR clauses for this category of suppliers. In 2022, the tool was deployed to all central purchasing, excluding road freight purchases, and to production purchases related to battery activities, improving the\n\n• 99% of the charters sent out were returned signed.\n\nreliability and monitoring of purchasing indicators.\n\n# **DEPLOYMENT OF THE CSR CLAUSE**\n\nWith a view to favoring business partners that respect its principles, the Group CSR Department has drawn up a CSR clause in collaboration with the Group Legal, Purchasing and Compliance departments. This clause aims to anchor the importance of the commitments described in the ethical system in the contractualization processes.\n\nWhile the purpose of these documents is to establish a common foundation, adapted to the Group's business lines, subsidiaries and locations, the Group Purchasing Department has developed procedures, listing processes and dedicated tools adapted to the organization of its different purchasing families.\n\nWhen contracting with new suppliers, our commitments (charters, etc.) and CSR clauses are systematically discussed and integrated into the processes. To achieve the smoothest and most efficient implementation of the Group's commitments, projects were carried out in collaboration with the purchasing teams and in-house lawyers to ensure that these tools are used properly,\n\n# **GROUP PURCHASING RISK MAPPING**\n\nSince 2017, the Compliance Department has been working on the implementation of a dedicated methodology for mapping corruption risks in the supply chain. The policy for assessing the integrity of suppliers and subcontractors was formalized and implemented in 2021, then updated in September 2022. It is now known as the \"compliance procedure\". The procedure describes the processes for evaluating the specific risk caused by the existing or potential relationship with a given supplier or subcontractor, for the scope of transport and logistics activities initially. It provides for classification into four types of risk: minor, moderate, high and major, and details the actions and procedures to be applied.\n\nWhile it focuses specifically on responding to corruption issues, it is a shared approach under the aegis of ethics and human rights. As it can lead to circumvention of or disregard for laws and regulations protecting social or environmental rights, corruption can have a significant impact on people's ability to exercise their fundamental rights. This is how combating\n\ncorruption helps to safeguard human rights. With a view to optimizing and aligning with existing methodologies, responsible purchasing procedures are being formalized and adapted on the basis of this compliance procedure. This work is already complete for non-production purchases.\n\nIt should be noted that work to refine the purchasing risk map will be carried out in 2024 when the scope of the Group's activities has stabilized following on the significant disposals of Bolloré Africa Logistics and Bolloré Logistics. These efforts will be especially focused on the methodologies required by the new European regulations. Some workshops and projects already took place at the end of 2023 to involve the various governance bodies and support functions such as Human Resources, Legal and Purchasing, to lay the groundwork for the dual materiality analysis. This work will continue in 2024.\n\n# **2.3.3.2. REPORT ON THE DUTY OF CARE APPROACH WITHIN THE GROUP SUPPLY CHAIN**\n\nWhile adhering to Group values and the commitments in its ethical policy is an essential condition for the selection of a partner, the organizational specificities of the various families of Group purchases mean that priority risks must be identified according to the categories and subcategories of purchases and by region, and that appropriate procedures must be deployed. The Group Purchasing Department is divided into four large families of purchases: general or non-production purchases, purchases relating to freight – specific to freight forwarding activities –, building and infrastructure purchases, and purchases of items necessary for operating activities.\n\n2023 Annual report – Compagnie de l'Odet\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **NON-PRODUCTION PURCHASES**\n\n# Scope\n\nThis category refers to supplies used for the company's daily operations not including production activities. The Non-Production Purchasing Department manages the entire Bolloré scope, including Vivendi, in a centralized manner, from head office.\n\n# Subcategories\n\nDigital Infra and Applications, service and facilities, Mobility (vehicles, business travel, telephony), and MICE (meeting, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions).\n\n# Risks\n\nThis category refers to several products and services, which may be associated with significant duty of care issues. For example, purchases relating to travel and vehicle rentals have an environmental impact associated with the issues of greenhouse gas emissions and purchases of services (cleaning, catering or security) may be related to social and human rights issues depending on the geographic area.\n\n# Specific duty of care processes\n\nThe non-production purchasing category is covered by a responsible purchasing policy that describes the CSR and duty of care monitoring processes to be deployed according to the risks identified. Criteria taking CSR and human rights into account are included in an ethics duty of care questionnaire for the Group's suppliers, subcontractors and intermediaries. It is sent prior to the business relationship and consists of some 20 questions (e.g., minimum contractual age for employment, how minimum wages and weekly hours of work are set, the existence of an environmental management system, health and safety, criteria for selecting suppliers, etc.). The analysis of the answers includes a screening identifying any CSR-type controversies that may arise with each company. The questionnaire is sent in priority to suppliers identified as being the most risky according to the mapping chosen.\n\n# Actions carried out in 2023\n\n- Identification and listing of strategic suppliers on the EcoVadis assessment platform:\n- 87% of listed strategic suppliers were assessed;\n\n# Indicators\n\n- 64% of the strategic suppliers assessed have a rating above 64/100 (a rating of 65/100 corresponding to an advanced level of performance);\n- suppliers with a rating of less than 45 are sent a CAP (corrective action plan): in 2023, five strategic suppliers were contacted as part of this improvement process;\n- in 2023, four strategic suppliers did not wish to submit to the EcoVadis assessment.\n- Increased inclusion of the CSR clause in non-production purchasing processes: the Responsible Purchasing Department trains teams in applying the procedure for onboarding new suppliers, which calls for the signature of charters and the systematic inclusion of clauses. In 2023, 91% of central suppliers in the non-production purchasing category included the CSR clause, compared with 80% in 2022.\n- Integration of CSR performance indicators during the annual assessments of buyers.\n- 87% of suppliers returned the signed Responsible Purchasing Charter and 87% of strategic suppliers underwent a CSR assessment.\n- Development and deployment of a CSR questionnaire, incorporating the inclusive, social, carbon impact and supply chain purchasing components that are specific to temporary employment agencies.

The panel of suppliers was given specific areas for improvement on compliance and human rights points. For each of these issues, the resources and standards available to strengthen their actions in these areas were highlighted.\n\n| (as a percentage)                                                                                   | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Percentage of employees in the general purchasing team who have followed the human rights module    | 91   | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of employees in the general purchasing team who have followed the Code of Conduct module | 91   | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of suppliers who received the compliance pack (charters + Code of Conduct)               | 100  | 99   | 100  |\n| Percentage of suppliers who have returned the signed Purchasing Charter                             | 87   | 86   | 73   |\n| Percentage of suppliers whose contract includes the CSR and compliance clause(1)                    | 91   | 80   | 47   |\n| Percentage of strategic suppliers who have undergone an EcoVadis assessment                         | 87   | 84   | 82   |\n| Percentage of suppliers who have received a corrective action plan from among the identified panel  | 100  | 75   | 50   |\n\n(1) This indicator includes suppliers with a non-contractual relationship but formalized by specific processes such as Mutual Recognition Agreements, including the commitments explained in the clauses.\n\n# **FREIGHT PURCHASES**\n\n# Scope\n\nThis category relates to the selection of freight solutions and services and therefore specifically concerns the freight forwarding activities of Bolloré Logistics, a business line that has been sold as of the date of publication of this document.\n\n# Subcategories\n\nSea, air and road transport.\n\n# Risks\n\nWith regard to sea and air freight, the Group deals for the most part with a panel of identified partners, within the framework of comprehensive contracts with several clauses on ethical and CSR matters. With regard to road transport, many regions – including sub-Saharan Africa – have limited infrastructure. This is why road transport purchases have specific issues (more limited choice of suppliers, need to train subcontractor drivers on Group health and safety standards, significant number of partners with extremely varied profiles depending on regions, listing difficulties, etc.).\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Specific duty of care processes\n\nIntroduction of a due diligence procedure (including the provisions of the Sapin II law and the duty of care law) for major suppliers in the sea and air transport sector: mandatory commitment of compliance with documents setting out Group ethical provisions and quarterly (or monthly for suppliers carrying major risks) business reviews which include contractual environmental requirements. A CSR questionnaire has also been developed specifically for the freight forwarding activities, including environmental criteria. This questionnaire is sent out every year, and the results factor into the supplier's overall rating. With regard to road transport providers, the teams use dedicated solution to list all the providers; the tool includes a questionnaire with sections on ethics, sustainable development and QHSE, and requires the submission of documentary evidence. Once compliance is confirmed, a local or country road representative called a \"transport road manager\" validates the carrier's listing. Since the end of 2018, 100% of active road carriers have been listed. In addition to listing via the dedicated solution, each year the QHSE departments of the various countries carry out face-to-face audits of a selection of road carriers with a special focus on regulatory compliance, health and safety.\n\n# Actions in 2023\n\n- 100% of freight (sea, air, road) is subject to full compliance listing.\n- Development of a sustainable offer for sea freight purchasing: ongoing expansion of the sustainable offer with an emphasis on promoting alternative fuels in 2023.\n- Strengthening of the SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) offer for air freight purchases: this process was verified and validated by an independent third party in 2022 and will undergo another audit in the first quarter of 2024.\n- Increased weighting of CSR criteria in the selection questionnaires sent to suppliers.\n- Development of a multimodal offer in France: in 2022, a tool was developed to facilitate the use of rail or barge transport by freight forwarders.\n- Inclusion of all global freight purchasing teams in the B'Sustainable challenge organized by Bolloré Logistics' CSR Department. This challenge, which originally targeted the sales teams, aims to make the sales staff more knowledgeable and skilled on sustainable supply chain offers.\n\n# Indicators\n\n| (as a percentage)                                                                                   | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Percentage of employees in the freight purchasing team who have followed the human rights module    | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of employees in the freight purchasing team who have followed the Code of Conduct module | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of suppliers who received the compliance pack (charters + Code of Conduct)               | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of suppliers who have returned the signed Purchasing Charter                             | 100  | 100  | 45   |\n| Percentage of suppliers whose contract includes the CSR and compliance clause(1)                    | 100  | 100  | 87   |\n\n(1) This indicator includes suppliers with a non-contractual relationship but formalized by specific processes such as Mutual Recognition Agreements, including the commitments explained in the clauses.\n\n# **INFRASTRUCTURE AND BUILDING PURCHASES**\n\n# Scope\n\nThis category is managed centrally for the whole Group for large and/or complex projects involving significant amounts (over 300,000 euros). Smaller projects are managed by teams locally.\n\n# Risks\n\nWhile purchases can sometimes make up a very significant volume within the context of new project launches, the share of this purchasing category in relation to the overall amount is not constant. In addition to the environmental impacts associated with construction projects, there must be specific duty of care for certain geographic areas since services linked to works can, in certain areas, present risks in the area of safety, working conditions and accommodation. In particular, construction projects can involve a lot of labor, local or foreign workers working in health, economic, infrastructure or cultural contexts that may vary considerably from one territory to another.\n\n# Specific duty of care processes\n\nIn addition to appending the traditional codes of conduct and QHSE requirements, most major construction contracts (Fidic type contracts) in and out of France already include duty of care components. Thus, the subcontracting contracts include requirements on the treatment of personnel relating to: AIDS prevention, respecting the rights of foreign workers, measures against insects and pests, prohibition of alcohol, drugs, weapons and ammunition, respect for local religious customs, access to suitable food and water for workers, the terms of payment for funerals in the event of fatal accidents, the prohibition of forced labor and child labor, non-discrimination and equal opportunities, representation of employees and trade unions, etc. In addition, depending on the issues identified, socio-environment al impact studies are carried out upstream of the projects, enabling a review of related topics (the environment, biodiversity, impact on the local economy, etc.).\n\n# Indicators\n\n| (as a percentage)                                                                                                             | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Percentage of employees in the infrastructure and real estate purchasing team who have followed<br>the human rights module    | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of employees in the infrastructure and real estate purchasing team who have followed<br>the Code of Conduct module | 83   | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of suppliers that have received the compliance pack (charters + Code of Conduct)                                   | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of suppliers that have returned the signed Purchasing Charter                                                      | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of suppliers whose contract includes the CSR and compliance clause(1)                                              | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n\n(1) This indicator includes suppliers with a non-contractual relationship but formalized by specific processes such as Mutual Recognition Agreements, including the commitments explained in the clauses.\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **INDUSTRIAL PURCHASES**\n\n# Scope\n\nThis category relates specifically to Industry activities, including the manufacture of batteries and the development of electricity storage and systems solutions at the Blue and Systems subsidiaries.\n\n# Risks\n\nIn terms of the safety of users of Blue Solutions products, particularly regarding the use of the LMP® battery, Blue Solutions is the only company to master \"all solid\" technology for battery manufacturing, which has the advantage of avoiding the environmental risks associated with the release of hazardous liquids, or the formation of explosive atmospheres in confined environments. Its batteries are exempt from SVHC (Substance of Very High Concern) provisions according to REACH regulations and CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction) according to CLP regulations, and also contain neither cobalt, nor nickel or any of the minerals targeted by the European regulation.\n\n# Specific duty of care processes\n\nIn the Industry division, Blue Solutions has created a document listing sustainable development requirements for suppliers, notably including specific human rights issues (in particular forced and child labor). CSR criteria are incorporated prior to the selection of new suppliers selling to Blue, whose purchasing policy includes environmental criteria.\n\nIn accordance with the commitments formalized in the Group's ethical measures and responsible purchasing approach, the battery production\n\n# Indicators\\*\n\n| (as a percentage)                                                                                      | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| Percentage of employees in the industrial purchasing team who have followed the human rights module    | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of employees in the industrial purchasing team who have followed the Code of Conduct module | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of suppliers that have received the compliance pack (charters + Code of Conduct)            | 100  | 100  | 100  |\n| Percentage of suppliers that have returned the signed Purchasing Charter                               | 82   | 96   | 82   |\n| Percentage of suppliers whose contract includes the CSR and compliance clause(1)                       | 79   | 97   | 62   |\n\n(1) This indicator includes suppliers with a non-contractual relationship but formalized by specific processes such as Mutual Recognition Agreements, including the commitments explained in the clauses.\n\n\\* Indicator monitoring to be implemented for suppliers in the Industry sector.\n\n# **2.3.3.3. OBJECTIVES**\n\n# **OBJECTIVES SET IN 2022**\n\n# Overall objectives\n\n- Increase the inclusion rate of CSR clauses and the return of the signed Responsible Purchasing Charter:\n- target achieved: the Responsible Purchasing Charter is sent to all new suppliers. The inclusion of the Group CSR clause is part of the processes and is systematically negotiated with suppliers. In 2023, 99% of new contractual relationships included the CSR clause. The goal of the Responsible Purchasing Department is to maintain and sustain these results and to ensure compliance with the processes in place for all new suppliers.\n- Ensure that 100% of new arrivals in purchasing teams complete the human rights awareness module:\n- target partially achieved and carried over to 2024.\n- Finalize the purchasing risk map in order to propose action plans dedicated to the issues identified in the different families, prioritizing categories of suppliers and subcontractors:\n- target not achieved and carried over to 2024: the Group's suppliers and subcontractors are nevertheless subject to ethics and anticorruption risk mapping. In addition, non-production suppliers are subject to CSR analysis through the EcoVadis assessment. It should be noted that the Group's risk map, incorporating the value chain, will be revised in 2024 in line with the methodologies required by European CSRD regulations.\n\n# On non-production purchases\n\ncriteria to the selection of a supplier.\n\n• Team training and raising awareness.\n\nassessment questionnaires).\n\nActions in 2023\n\n• Achieve and exceed an 85% assessment rate on EcoVadis: for listed strategic suppliers:\n\nactivity is subject to a specific duty of care process for the supply of lithium in particular. The accreditation process for selecting lithium suppliers is structured in several stages, which can take up to two years. Suppliers must complete several questionnaires, comprising non-financial aspects (human rights, environment, ethics, health and safety). Blue Solutions is sourcing from one of the market leaders, whose processing sites are certified ISO 14001, ISO 45001 and ISO 9001, and which guarantees the traceability of minerals (mostly from Australia). In addition, human and environmental rights criteria are incorporated as part of the IATF 16949 certification. It should be noted, however, that implementing measures of reasonable duty of care may be challenging given the circumstances in certain regions. It is not unusual that certain suppliers or service providers have no competitors in the local, regional or even national market, as for example in the case of railway construction or the procurement of oils. Thus, the Group's entities may have very restricted influence or latitude in applying CSR\n\n• Organization of working meetings to determine industrial purchasing subcategories and refine risk mapping: work continues to establish due diligence procedures specific to the procurement of raw materials for battery activities (including the formalization of specific supplier\n\n- target achieved, with 87% of listed strategic suppliers in 2023. • Continue efforts to achieve a return rate of 80% for the Responsible\n- Purchasing Charter for strategic suppliers assessed on EcoVadis: – target achieved.\n\n# On production purchases\n\n- Formalize a specific duty of care approach on raw materials sourcing: – target achieved: the procedure carried out is currently being validated.\n- Roll out the document collection platform tool within the scope of production purchases: – target achieved.\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **2.3.4. APPROACH BY DUTY OF CARE CYCLE**\n\nThe duty of care cycle approach (see section 2.2. – Methodology) explains the methodology used by employees to manage the risks identified. It is used to illustrate the Group's approach through various concrete and relevant examples in terms of cross-business issues (environment, social and human rights, health and safety).\n\n# **2.3.4.1. \"WORKING CONDITIONS\" DUTY OF CARE CYCLE**\n\n# **IDENTIFICATION OF RISK**\n\n**Activities:** all Bolloré Group logistics and industrial business lines and activities.\n\n**Identified countries:** entities in the human rights priority scope (see section 2.3.3.1. – Structuring of the duty of care approach within the Bolloré Group Purchasing Department).\n\n**Risks:** due to its robust international presence and the diversity of its locations, the Group employs many people, directly and indirectly, in myriad institutional contexts and in regions where the risks of failing to provide safe and decent working conditions may be amplified by the absence or\n\n# **TREATMENT OF RISK**\n\n**Governance:** these risks are handled at various levels of governance, at the head office and within the entities by the Executive management and the support functions directly concerned, under the coordination and supervision of the HR and CSR departments, in particular by:\n\n- the Executive Committee;\n- the Risk Committee; • the Ethics and CSR Committee;\n- \n- the HR Committee;\n- bimonthly Human Rights Steering Committee meetings that bring together the Group Human Resources Department, the Group CSR Department, the Bolloré Logistics CSR Department and, depending on identified needs, the Compliance Department, the Purchasing Department and the Legal Department.\n\nFor more information on these governance bodies, see section 1.1.3. – CSR governance.\n\n# **Special duty of care tools and processes**\n\n# Creation of a network of human rights officers\n\nThe appointment of human rights officers was decided by the Steering Committee in 2022. In accordance with the commitments announced, the network was finalized in 2023 and 38 officers were chosen among the employees of the local Human Resources departments at all the divisions. Working through the HR reporting lines and organization, these officers act as liaisons to identify and report alerts and high-risk situations relating to operational working conditions, and to execute the action plans drawn up at the head office. They are also responsible for ensuring the application of the Group's social and human rights commitments, as defined in the ethical measures (Group Code of Conduct, Ethics and CSR Charter, Responsible Purchasing Charter, Human Rights Charter, Diversity and Inclusion Charter). The officers may also be required to act as liaisons and coordinators during human rights audits and to conduct internal assessments.\n\n# Deployment of a training campaign for the network of human rights officers in 2023\n\nSeveral workshops and webinars were set up to raise awareness among all officers from the Asia, Pacific and Middle East regions.\n\nThe system was supplemented by the launch of a training campaign on new labor compliance standards. In 2023, this training focused on adopting an internal audit methodology was deployed on site in seven countries (Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore). As a result, the local teams were trained in a human rights self-assessment methodology, and learned how to convey these standards to employment agencies, subcontractors and other suppliers.\n\nweakness of local regulatory frameworks. The priority scope was determined, in particular, by analyzing these factors. Indeed, depending on local regulations and organizations, the lack of supervision or monitoring of HR process implementation could lead to risks of poor tracking of overtime, especially for subcontractors. It is important to ensure that all entities, and more specifically the entities in the priority scope, organize special duty of care measures to address these issues, apply national regulations and internal standards, and ensure that workers are paid a wage that enables them to meet their basic needs and compensates them for the hours worked.\n\n# Deployment of a living wage project in 2023\n\n- In line with the commitments made in 2022, the Steering Committee approved the launch of a pilot project to address living wages. The project was implemented in 2023 to explore and expand the Group's requirements on certain social issues. Because earning a living wage is a catalyst for lifting people out of poverty and promoting human rights, it is a key priority among the Group's CSR commitments. For this initial exercise, the study focused exclusively on direct employees from a selection of 10 countries(1) in the human rights priority scope, taking into account the unique characteristics of regional economic contexts. The study took as its starting point the salary earned for full-time equivalent working hours (excluding part-time work and overtime), and was carried out by the Group Human Resources teams and the network of human rights officers with support from an expert consulting firm, using benchmark criteria aligned with the Anker methodology, or provided by the Wage Indicator Foundation or the Fair Wage Network.\n- The project relied on the following definition: a living wage is a wage that allows workers to meet their basic needs and those of their families, and to have discretionary income to deal with other expenses. It takes into account factors such as the cost of housing, health care, education and other basic needs. A living wage is often higher than the legal minimum wage and reflects the cost of living in a given place. It should be noted that the study excluded employee benefits such as annual leave, perks for personal events such as marriage or religious holidays, and non-contractual bonuses (e.g., seniority and performance bonuses). These factors were not included in the calculation of living wages, even though they are often an important source of income.\n- This understanding of the various thresholds acquired by applying the Anker methodology will enable Bolloré Logistics to launch an initiative within the Human Resources Department in 2024 to work on the compensation structure for 146 employees identified during this pilot project.\n\nFor more information, see the \"Deployment of a long-term project on living wages\" paragraph in section 1.2.2.2.2. – Respect for workers' rights throughout the value chain.\n\n(1) Cambodia, China, Qatar, Malaysia, Indonesia, United Arab Emirates, Mexico, Vietnam, Philippines, Singapore.\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Continuation of the corrective actions implemented as a result of audits carried out in 2022\n\nIn 2023, following on the audits conducted last year at industrial sites in Malaysia, actions were taken to specifically target the risks associated with the monitoring of hours worked and the risks associated with migrant workers:\n\n- issues relating to the management of working time, overtime and rest time were analyzed in an in-depth study that mapped and inventoried laws and practices for all the entities in the priority scope;\n- smart biometric systems have been put in place to replace the physical time-clock machines used by local employment agencies, which improves the monitoring of hours worked by subcontractors, who are now integrated into the automated HR payroll information system. These measures were put in place after educating and collaborating with local employment agencies, and make the monitoring and control of working hours and remuneration more reliable;\n- to address the issues around migrant workers, as part of their discussions and work with employment agencies, local and regional HR teams in the Asia-Pacific region first identified branches that may use foreign workers, then began negotiating to validate the guarantees provided in connection to hiring and accommodation conditions. In particular, a team organized a trip to Nepal, which is a country of origin for many foreign workers employed by certain service providers. The team conducted an in-depth due diligence initiative and deployed risk prevention measures (e.g., verification of contracts, verification of hiring procedures, verification that the agency charges no upstream fees, confirmation that the terms of the contract are written in a language understood by the worker, etc.).\n\nFurthermore, the Steering Committee also deployed a central monitoring tool in 2023 to oversee the corrective action plans implemented when non-conformities are identified during audits:\n\n- the Steering Committee introduced a protocol to manage alerts and • duty of care policy in the supply chain; support from the Executive management of Bolloré Logistics, and the Group CSR and Human Resources departments, this protocol was rolled out to all internal stakeholders, including the network of human rights officers;\n- the goal is to be able to centralize all information about social audits completed, scheduled and in progress, and to assist the local teams with managing these audits and taking any corrective actions required;\n- in 2023, operational sites in Malaysia, Vietnam, France and Germany received support with external audits required by strategic clients.\n\n# Strengthening of internal auditing methodology in 2023\n\nVarious assessments and surveys were carried out internally, with a special emphasis on the priority issues identified, such as compensation and the tracking of working time, based on a special questionnaire that was created as part of the self-assessment methodology development process.\n\nThe team in charge of social issues and human rights at the Human Resources Department provided on-site training to local staff so they could use the questionnaire to conduct formal internal controls and self-assessments of their activities. In 2023, 16 self-assessments took place in several countries within the priority scope – in Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore. Where applicable, these analyses included the employees of subcontracting companies present at the sites.\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **2.3.5. TABLE OF DUTY OF CARE INDICATORS**\n\nThe data presented in the table are intended to illustrate the results obtained by the Group's due diligence approach for the Transportation and logistics, excluding Bolloré Energy, as well as in the priority geographical area identified (see section 2.2. – Methodology). These data serve to guide the choices of action plans to be implemented.\n\n• Group scope: 125 entities (including four incoming and two outgoing entities) in 41 countries, with a workforce of 18,329

id=\"page-151-0\"></span>**1. Risk factors**\n\nThe Group periodically evaluates and reviews the risk factors that might have a negative impact on its operations or its financial performance. This review is presented to the Risk Committee. In addition, several factors unique to the Bolloré Group and its strategy, such as the diversification of its activities and its geographical sites, limit the magnitude of risks to which the Group is exposed. The Group has not identified any significant risk besides those discussed below.\n\nThis section reflects the provisions of (EU) regulation no. 2017/1129 of June 14, 2017 (\"Prospectus 3\"), which took effect on July 21, 2019. The risk factors are presented hereafter in decreasing order of importance within each category.\n\nAmong all these risks, the Group considers the financial risks to be the most significant. The risks are presented in order of importance within this category.\n\nThe most significant risks are nevertheless singled out by an asterisk.\n\n# <span id=\"page-151-1\"></span>**1.1. Financial risks**\n\n# **1.1.1. MAIN FINANCIAL RISKS**\n\nThe Group has conducted a review of the risks that could have a material adverse effect on its activity, financial situation or results. Only certain financial risks are liable to impact the Group's overall results.\n\n# **1.1.1.1. RISK ASSOCIATED WITH LISTED SHARES\\***\n\nThe Group holds a large portfolio of listed securities, which exposes it to changes in stock market price.\n\nUnconsolidated securities are valued in the financial statements at 6,838.9 million euros as of December 31, 2023. This includes listed securities worth 2,425.3 million euros.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9 \"Financial instruments\", these equity investments are valued at fair value at year end, i.e. for listed securities at year-end share price, and are classified as financial assets (see note 8.3 – Other financial assets to the consolidated financial statements – chapter 5, section 5.1.).\n\nAt December 31, 2023, a variation of 1% in the stock market price would have an impact of 101.1 million euros on the value of the equity investments in the financial statements, with an impact on profit and loss, of which 42.9 million euros for revaluations of the Group's stakes in Omnium Bolloré, Financière V and Sofibol.\n\nThe valuation of these unlisted securities, which are held directly and indirectly in Omnium Bolloré, Financière V and Sofibol, depends on the stock market price of Compagnie de l'Odet shares (see note 8.3 – Other financial assets to the consolidated financial statements – chapter 5, section 5.1.). As at December 31, 2023, the reevaluated value of these equities was 4,297.2 million euros. The shares of these unlisted companies are not very liquid. The value of unconsolidated companies is regularly monitored under the aegis of the Group's Finance Department. In addition, the value of these\n\n# **1.1.1.2. LIQUIDITY RISK\\***\n\nThe Group's liquidity risk stems from obligations to repay its debt and from the need for future financing in connection with the development of its various lines of business. To deal with liquidity risk, the Group's strategy has been to maintain a level of unused credit lines that will allow it to deal at any point with cash requirements. As at December 31, 2023, the amount of confirmed and unused credit lines was 8,259 million euros (of which 3,792 million euros for the Vivendi group). Additionally, the Group strives to diversify its sources of financing by using the bond market, the banking market and over-the-counter financing (NEU CP).\n\nFor the Group's main syndicated bank financing facilities as at December 31, 2023:\n\n• Bolloré SE has two revolving credit lines. One of 1,300 million euros, of which 13.6 million euros was drawn down at December 31, 2023 (drawdowns in euros and US dollars), maturing in 2025. And another of 400 million euros, maturing in 2028, undrawn at December 31, 2023. They are subject to a gearing covenant that caps the net debt to equity ratio at 1.75;\n\nsecurities is assessed on the basis of the most recent market prices at the year end.\n\nThe Group also owns listed shares in consolidated subsidiaries, such as Vivendi, and in companies accounted for using the equity method, notably Telecom Italia, Universal Music Group, MultiChoice Group and the Socfin group. The valuation of these companies in the consolidated financial statements is based directly on the market price. The drop in the price, accompanied by other indicators, especially deterioration in the prospects for significant and lasting results, is, however, an indicator of impairment, which leads to a review of the value that may lead to the recognition of an impairment in the consolidated financial statements. See notes 7.1 – Goodwill and 8.2 – Investments in companies accounted for under the equity method in the notes to the financial statements – chapter 5, section 5.1.\n\nAt December 31, 2023, the market value of the Group's listed companies accounted for using the equity method amounted to 13,352 million euros for Universal Music Group (UMG), 1,071 million euros for Telecom Italia, 597 million euros for MultiChoice Group and 258 million euros for the Socfin group. The valuation of investments in companies accounted for under the equity method is detailed in note 8.2 – Investments in companies accounted for under the equity method to the consolidated financial statements (chapter 5, section 5.1.).\n\n- Compagnie de l'Odet has a credit facility of 1,150 million euros, of which 375.0 million euros was drawn down (in euros) as at December 31, 2023, maturing in 2026.\n- Vivendi SE has a syndicated credit line maturing of 1,500 million euros in January 2026 and eight bilateral credit lines for a total amount of 800 million euros maturing in December 2027;\n- none of these credit lines are subject to compliance with financial ratios and they contain the usual default clauses present in unsecured financing; • Lagardère SA has a syndicated credit line of 982 million euros maturing in\n\nApril 2025. Bonds issued by Vivendi SE are subject to the usual default, negative pledge and pari passu clauses. They also contain an early repayment clause in the event of a change of control (excluding a change of control to the benefit of the Bolloré Group) that would apply if, following such an event, Vivendi SE's long-term rating was downgraded below Baa3.\n\nAs at March 4, 2024, when the Vivendi Management Board met to approve the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, Vivendi's ratings were as follows:\n\n| Rating agency | Type of debt                    | Ratings | Outlook        |\n|---------------|---------------------------------|---------|----------------|\n| Moody's       | Senior unsecured long-term debt | Baa2    | Stable outlook |\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\nApart from the proposed spin-off, the feasibility of which is under review (see note 1 – Highlights), the Group considers that the cash flows generated by its operating activities, its cash surpluses net of sums used to reduce its debt, as well as the funds available via unused bank credit lines, will suffice to cover the expenses and investments necessary for its operation, debt servicing, tax payments, dividend payments, possible share buybacks under existing ordinary authorizations, as well as its planned investments over the next twelve months.\n\nSome other lines may have early repayment covenants connected with respect of financial ratios, generally involving ratios of net debt to equity. These bank covenants and financial ratios were all met as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\nThe portion due in less than one year of loans used as at December 31, 2023 includes 67 million euros of short-term negotiable securities at Bolloré SE, 60 million euros at Compagnie de l'Odet and 561 million euros at Vivendi out of a program of up to 4,550 million euros (of which 3,650 million euros for Vivendi, undrawn as at December 31, 2023) and 21.9 million euros of receivables factoring.\n\n# **1.1.1.3. GOODWILL RISK**\n\nThe Group's financial statements included goodwill of 9,762.4 million euros as at December 31, 2023 (16.3% of the Group's total consolidated assets) and 7,802 million euros restated as at December 31, 2022 (14.4% of the Group's total consolidated assets). Most of the goodwill relates to Vivendi (9,631.5 million euros) itself, mainly relating to Groupe Canal+ for 4,203.4 million euros, Havas Group for 2,431.7 million euros and Lagardère for 2,401.3 million euros.\n\nUnder current regulations, goodwill is not amortized but subjected to an impairment test at least once a year and whenever there is an indication of impairment. This test consists of comparing the book value to the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit (CGU) or group of CGUs. This recoverable amount is generally determined by present-discounting the future cash flows of the CGU or the CGUs group, by using cash flows\n\n# **1.1.1.4. RISKS RELATED TO PRODUCTION PURCHASES**\n\nPurchases of raw materials, energy, services, equipment and components from third parties have a significant impact on the Group's business activity. An unexpected increase in these costs or a disruption in the supply chain may have an adverse effect on the financial situation of one of the Group's All bank lines of credit, both drawn and undrawn, are repayable as follows:\n\n| 2024        | 24%  |\n|-------------|------|\n| 2025        | 22%  |\n| 2026        | 28%  |\n| 2027        | 8%   |\n| 2028        | 17%  |\n| Beyond 2028 | 1%   |\n| TOTAL       | 100% |\n\nprojected from the operating budgets, which are extrapolated over a set time horizon (usually five years), by applying a growth rate appropriate to the potential expansion of the markets in question and using assumptions made by management based on past experience. After the stated time horizon, the terminal value is based on the perpetuity value of the cash flows. The discount rate is determined by basing it on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of each CGU; it includes potential risks specific to each activity (business lines, markets and geographical areas); the rate selected was determined on the basis of information communicated by an outside consulting firm. When impairment is found, the difference between the asset's book value and its recoverable amount is recognized among operating expenses for the fiscal year.\n\nbusiness lines. However, the diversity of the Group's businesses makes it possible to significantly limit the financial impacts on the Group as a whole. In addition, the divisions pass on most of the impact of price increases to the end customer.\n\n| Sector         | Main purchases                                                           | Risk management                                                                                                                                                            |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Oil logistics  | • Oil products<br>• Biofuels/CEE                                         | • Sale price passed on to end customer<br>• Hedging of forward product purchases and sales<br>• Purchases fractioned in relation to the marketing of oil products          |\n| Communications | • Exclusive content<br>and premium rights                                | • See chapter 3 of Vivendi’s 2023 universal registration document<br>– section 1.1.1. “Risks related to the inflation of costs of exclusive<br>content and premium rights” |\n| Industry       | • Resins<br>• Lithium<br>• Energy<br>• Electronic components<br>• Metals | • Policy on supplier diversification and selection<br>• Supply contracts<br>• Sale price passed on to end customer                                                         |\n\n# **1.1.1.5. INTEREST RATE RISK**\n\nGiven its financial debt, the Group is exposed to changes over time in interest rates in the eurozone, primarily on the portion of debt which is at variable rates, as well as to changes in the lending margins of credit institutions. To deal with this risk, Executive management may decide to set up interest rate hedges. Firm hedging (rate swaps, FRAs) may be used to manage the interest rate risk on the Group's debt.\n\nNote 8.5 – Financial debt in chapter 5, section 5.1. of the notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the various derivatives used to hedge the Group's interest rate risk.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, after hedging, fixed-rate gross financial debt amounted to 26% of total gross debt.\n\nIf interest rates were to rise uniformly by +1%, the cost of gross debt would increase by 57.5 million euros after hedging on interest-bearing gross debt. If interest rates were to rise uniformly by +1%, the cost of gross debt would decrease by –1.8 million euros after hedging on interest-bearing debt.\n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.1.1.6. INVESTMENT AND COUNTERPARTY RISK**\n\nSurplus cash is invested in a prudent manner in low-risk liquid products with counterparties featuring a high credit rating.\n\n**1.1.1.7. CURRENCY RISK**\n\nFor the Bolloré Group, the breakdown of revenue by currency area (63% in euros, 10% in US dollars, 5% in CFA francs, 5% in zloty, 4% in pounds sterling, and less than 3% for all other currencies individually) and the fact that a large proportion of operating expenses is in local currencies limit its exposure to operating currency risk.\n\nThe Group is reducing its exposure to currency risk further by hedging its main operations in currencies other than the euro and the CFA franc with large international banks. The management of currency risk is largely centralized at Bolloré SE and Vivendi SE for subsidiaries which are attached to them directly.\n\n<span id=\"page-153-0\"></span>At the Bolloré SE level, at the end of each month, each subsidiary declares its currency positions to be hedged to the Cash Department, which may arrange a firm hedge (forward buy or sell). In addition to these rolling transactions, other hedges may be taken from time to time. Bolloré Energy hedges its positions directly on the market each day.\n\n# **1.2. Risks related to business activities**\n\nEach Group division is responsible for managing its industrial, environmental, market, and compliance risks. The type of risks and the associated management methods are regularly analyzed by each divisional management.\n\nMoreover, Vivendi and Bolloré spread their investments across a number of selected banks and limit the investment amount per vehicle.\n\nWith regard to Vivendi, the Group's foreign exchange risk management policy primarily aims to hedge budgetary exposures for the next year related to monetary flows from operations in currencies other than the euro, as well as external firm commitments entered into in the context of the acquisition of editorial content (sports, TV and film rights, etc.) and certain industrial investments (i.e. set-top boxes) made in currencies other than the euro. The hedging instruments are currency swap, forward purchase or forward sale contracts, the majority of which mature in less than one year. Given the currency hedges in place, an unfavorable and uniform change of 1% in the euro against any of the currencies accounted for at end-December 2023 would have an immaterial aggregate effect on net income.\n\nThey are also supervised by the Group's Risk Committee and Insurance Department.\n\nThe occurrence of one of the following risks may also entail reputational risk from the media storm it might create.\n\n# **1.2.1. PRINCIPAL RISKS RELATED TO BUSINESS ACTIVITIES**\n\n# **1.2.1.1. MARKET RISK (OIL LOGISTICS, FILMS)**\n\nBolloré Energy is exposed to the risk of changes in demand for petroleum products, particularly domestic fuel oil.\n\nCivil society, the government and other stakeholders are calling for a reduction in the consumption of petroleum products and the implementation of a lowcarbon energy mix.\n\nWhile defending the position of domestic fuel oil in the French energy mix, Bolloré Energy is committed to the energy transition by offering new lowcarbon products.\n\nHowever, Bolloré Energy's financial situation and outlook could be impacted by the acceleration of regulatory changes, by constraints related to the policy of encouraging the consumption of biofuels for the diesel sector, by a rapid\n\n# **1.2.1.2. GEOPOLITICAL RISKS**\n\nThe Group has industrial and commercial activities in a large number of countries.\n\nThe breakdown of revenue by geographic area for the 2023 fiscal year (excluding Vivendi) was as follows: France (2.5 million euros), Europe excluding France (0.6 million euros) and the Americas (0.1 million euros).\n\nThe Group may be impacted directly and indirectly by global geopolitical developments, but the diversity of its activities, its mainly European geographical presence and the limited dispersion of the rest of its activities around the world limit the potential economic and operational impacts arising from political, trade, regulatory or health tensions on its results.\n\nThe recent conflicts have not had a significant impact on the Group results and their impact on Vivendi has been limited (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 3 \"Risks associated with conducting operations in various countries\").\n\nThe Group uses internal resources to monitor and anticipate these risks in order to limit their impacts on its order books, supply chain and customer deliveries.\n\ndrop in demand for carbon products, or by the cost of low-carbon energies being deemed too high by consumers.\n\nBolloré Innovative Thin Films is exposed to changes in French (AGEC Law) and European regulations, the pillars of which notably concern reducing, reusing and recycling single-use plastic packaging.\n\nBolloré Innovative Thin Films is also exposed to changes in distributor/ consumer behaviour and technological disruption.\n\nTo meet these challenges, Bolloré Innovative Thin Films has for several years, through investment in industrial equipment and research and development, been offering a broad and deep range of \"biobased and recyclable\" products to respond to these changes.\n\nIn addition, the Bolloré Group has a Safety and Security Department to oversee the protection of Compagnie de l'Odet's, the Bolloré Group's and Vivendi's human and physical assets in France and abroad. Its tasks focus on the following:\n\n- monitoring and analysis of global security events and a proactive approach to crises;\n- crisis management in conjunction with the departments concerned (Executive management, Legal, QHSE, HR);\n- safety audits in France and abroad and the verification of emergency crisis procedures (non-combatant evacuation operations);\n- travel safety based on a rigorous travel policy. This includes the management and monitoring of business trips abroad via a location platform;\n- maintenance of a safety & security network through the consolidation of the Group's security networks in France and abroad and the hiring of local safety and security liaisons.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.2.1.3. CUSTOMER RISK**\n\nThe Group operates several businesses in very diverse sectors, which significantly reduces overall risks.\n\nAs regards risk management, monthly monitoring is carried out by the Bolloré Group's Cash Department, which centralizes the working capital requirement (WCR). In the Group's main divisions, credit risk management is the responsibility of a credit manager.\n\nThe Group has frequent recourse to credit insurance when a receivable is not covered by insurance. The Group performs a forward-looking evaluation of the credit losses expected from its trade receivables. To measure the provision expense for expected credit losses on its trade receivables on origination, the Group assesses the probability of default at the date of initial recognition. Subsequently, provisions for expected credit losses on trade receivables are remeasured in light of changes in the credit risk of the asset during each fiscal year.\n\n# **1.2.1.4. TECHNOLOGICAL RISK (INDUSTRY)**\n\nThe Group is making significant investments in new activities such as electricity storage, the main technological challenge being to make \"all-solidstate\" lithium battery technology a benchmark in both the bus market and in stationary batteries for electricity storage. Even though it is extremely confident about the prospects offered by these new activities, the Group remains prudent given the technological risk that such capital expenditure\n\n# **1.2.1.5. RISKS RELATED TO ACTIVITIES IN THE COMMUNICATIONS SECTOR**\n\nThis sector mainly includes the risk factors related to the activities of Vivendi and its subsidiaries. These are detailed further in chapter 3 of Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document. They primarily comprise:\n\n<span id=\"page-154-0\"></span>• risks related to the cost of key rights and concessions for the Group's various activities;\n\n• risks related to piracy;\n\n# **1.3. Legal risks**\n\n# **1.3.1. MAIN LEGAL RISKS**\n\n# **1.3.1.1. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DISPUTES**\n\nThe activities of the Group's companies are not subject to any specific dependency. In the normal course of their activities, Bolloré SE and its subsidiaries are party to a number of legal, administrative or arbitrational proceedings. The potential costs of these proceedings are the subject of provisions insofar as they are probable and quantifiable. The provisioned amounts are subject to a risk assessment on a case-by-case basis (see note 10.2 – Litigation in progress to the financial statements [chapter 5, section 5.1.]).\n\n# **Togo Guinea inquiry**\n\nOn December 12, 2018, criminal charges were brought in a purely mechanical manner against Bolloré SE for corruption of a foreign public agent, complicity in falsification and use and complicity in breach of trust, following the criminal charges brought on April 25, 2018 against two of its senior executives.\n\nThe allegations at the heart of the judicial inquiry go back to 2009-2010 and concern two operations in Togo and Guinea.\n\nThe inquiry seeks to determine whether the concessions obtained by local subsidiaries of the Group in Togo and Guinea were obtained because of communications services provided by Havas Group in those countries for, respectively, 300,000 euros and 170,000 euros.\n\nBolloré SE is vigorously contesting the alleged facts, which have been the subject of numerous appeals before courts and tribunals.\n\nIn Guinea, the Group was named operator of the concession in 2010 because it had come in second during the international tender offer of 2008, after the default of the operator that had come in first.\n\nTrade receivables are regularly monitored at both Group and division level and are impaired individually when this is deemed necessary.\n\nThe aged balance of past due receivables without provisions at year end, the breakdown of changes in provisions for trade receivables and the expenditure and income in respect of these receivables are shown in note 6.6 – Trade and other receivables in the notes to the consolidated financial statements (chapter 5, section 5.1).\n\nVivendi believes that there is no significant collection risk for operating receivables for its activities: the large number of individual customers, the diversity of customers and markets, as well as the geographical distribution of Vivendi's activities minimize the concentration of credit risk related to trade receivables.\n\nmay present. Accordingly, the efforts devoted to these developments are at all times measured on the basis of the performance of the traditional activities and in such a way that they do not call into question the Group's overall equilibrium. This risk is also addressed directly by Executive management at its monthly meetings.\n\n• risks related to cybercrime;\n\n- risks related to disintermediation and changes in consumption patterns;\n- risks related to data protection;\n- risks linked to talents;\n- risks related to conducting business in different countries.\n\nIn Togo, the concession agreement was signed on August 29, 2001, whereas the facts alleged would have occurred in 2009 and 2010, which is to say ten years later.\n\nIn these two countries, the Group's investments in port infrastructure currently total over 500 million euros.\n\nIn a ruling handed down on September 26, 2019, the Second Examining Chamber of the Paris Court of Appeal canceled the indictment of Bolloré SE (and its two senior executives mentioned above) for complicity in forgery and use of forged documents in Togo, bribery of a foreign public official in Guinea and complicity in forgery and use of forged documents in Guinea.\n\nTo limit the length of these proceedings, Bolloré SE and Compagnie de l'Odet (formerly Financière de l'Odet SE) agreed to sign a deferred prosecution agreement *(convention judiciaire d'intérêt public* or CJIP) with the French National Financial Prosecutor's Office (Parquet national financier or PNF). This agreement, which was signed on February 9, 2021 and validated by the Paris court on February 26, 2021, is neither an admission of guilt nor a guilty verdict. It is a deal under which the PNF agreed to drop the charges against Bolloré SE, which agreed in turn to subject its compliance program to controls by the French anticorruption agency (AFA) for a period of two years and to bear the costs thereof up to 4 million euros. The Group's parent company Compagnie de l'Odet (formerly Financière de l'Odet SE) agreed to pay a public interest fine of 12 million euros (which it paid on time). The CJIP put an end to all charges brought against Bolloré SE.\n\nThe audits and checks carried out by the AFA under the deferred prosecution agreement ended on March 8, 2023. Bolloré SE then received a draft final audit report from the AFA and provided its observations.\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Autolib' vs. the Syndicat mixte Autolib' et Vélib' Métropole**\n\nOn February 25, 2011, Syndicat mixte Autolib' et Vélib' Métropole (\"the SMAVM\") and Autolib' SA entered into a public service delegation for the purpose of installing, managing and maintaining a self-service electric automobile service and electric vehicle recharging infrastructure (\"the agreement\" or \"the concession\").\n\nIn light of the updated 2016 Business Plan and the updated 2017 Business Plan that Autolib' forwarded to the SMAVM, it was clear that the agreement was not economically attractive as defined in its article 63.2.1. and Autolib' notified the SMAVM of this fact on May 25, 2018, in accordance with the agreement.\n\nSince the SMAVM did not wish to pay Autolib' the compensation called for in article 63.2.2 of the agreement in the event the concession should prove economically unattractive, it terminated the agreement per its article 63.3 in deliberation no. 2018-18 of June 21, 2018.\n\nArticle 63.3 of the agreement provides that, should the agreement be terminated pursuant to that article, the indemnification schedule in article 61 of the agreement shall apply.\n\nTherefore, Autolib' sent the SMAVM a letter dated September 25, 2018 with its request for indemnification for a total amount of 235,243,366 euros, calculated in accordance with articles 63.3 and 61 of the agreement. The SMAVM, however, in a letter dated November 27, 2018, expressed its refusal to pay the indemnification referred to in item (vi) of article 61 of the agreement (indemnification and compensation due to Autolib' from the SMAVM since the threshold defined in article 63 of the agreement had been exceeded) by challenging Autolib's right to be compensated due to the threshold having been exceeded and to the agreement thus being recognized as economically unattractive.\n\nGiven this refusal by the SMAVM to pay the compensation called for in item (vi) of article 61 of the agreement, thereby demonstrating a profound disagreement between the SMAVM and Autolib' about the amount of compensation to be paid under article 61 of the agreement, Autolib' notified the SMAVM, in accordance with article 61 of the agreement and in a letter dated November 29, 2018, that it was bringing the matter before the Arbitration Panel mentioned in article 70 of the agreement.\n\nArticle 61 of the agreement provides that: \"The Arbitration Panel may be appealed to by either party in the event of disagreement about the amount of this compensation.\"\n\nArticle 70.1 of the agreement concerning the establishment of an Arbitration Panel provides inter alia that, \"the Arbitration Panel shall consist of three (3) members whose personal and moral qualities and experience in publicprivate arrangements for comparable complex projects is well known.\n\nWithin fifteen (15) calendar days after the appeal to the Arbitration Panel, each party will designate one (1) member, and the third member, who will be Chairman of the Arbitration Panel, will be chosen by common agreement between the two (2) members so designated. Failing an agreement within fifteen (15) calendar days, the Chairman of the Arbitration Panel will be designated by the Chief Judge of the Administrative Court of Paris, at the request of the first party to act\".\n\nTherefore, and in compliance with said article 70.1 of the agreement, Autolib' and the SMAVM each proceeded on their own, on December 11 and 12, 2018 respectively, to designate the two out of three members of the Arbitration Panel.\n\nDespite numerous conversations held and proposals made by the members of the Arbitration Panel designated by the SMAVM and Autolib', the two members were unable to reach an agreement as to the choice of a Chairman of the Arbitration Panel, even more than two months after the appeal to the Arbitration Panel on November 29, 2018.\n\nTherefore, and pursuant to article 70.1 of the agreement, Autolib' appealed to the Chief Judge of the Administrative Court of Paris in a request dated February 12, 2019 so that she might appoint the Chairman of the Arbitration Panel. When the Chief Judge of the Administrative Court recused herself from making that appointment, Autolib' and the SMAVM granted the arbitrators a one-month extension to reach an agreement on the choice of a Chairman of the Arbitration Panel.\n\nHowever, no agreement on the selection of the Chairman of the Arbitration Panel had been reached between the two members of the Panel already appointed as of March 20, 2019.\n\nDespite the lack of agreement by the deadline agreed to between Autolib' and the SMAVM, Autolib' remained keen to give the conciliation one last chance to take place.\n\nAs such, in a letter dated March 22, 2019, Autolib' referred the matter back to a new Arbitration Panel, replacing the Arbitration Panel to which the matter was referred on November 29, 2018.\n\nHowever, unlike Autolib', the SMAVM, in a letter dated March 27, 2019, initially refused to appoint a member to the new Arbitration Panel other than the one originally designated.\n\nIn response to a letter from Autolib' dated March 29, 2019 calling on SMAVM to appoint a new member of the Arbitration Panel and a reminder letter dated April 8, 2019, SMAVM, in a letter dated on the same day, finally agreed to make every effort to appoint a new member to the Panel before April 23, 2019.\n\nHowever, contrary to all expectations, the SMAVM, in a letter dated April 23, 2019, subsequently informed Autolib' that it had been unable to appoint a new member to the Arbitration Panel within the agreed period, and that it intended to designate as a member of the new Panel the person appointed to the first.\n\nAs the arbitration proceeding was manifestly impossible, in the light of all the foregoing, Autolib', in a letter dated May 20, 2019, asked the SMAVM, prior to referring the matter to the Administrative Court of Paris in accordance with article 71 of the Autolib' Public Service Delegation agreement, to pay it the compensation due in accordance with article 63 and article 61 of the Autolib' Public Service Delegation agreement, i.e. the sum of 235,243,366 euros, subject to adjustments, to cover the termination of the agreement.\n\nAs this request was implicitly rejected by the SMAVM on July 20, 2019, Autolib' applied to the Administrative Court of Paris on September 9, 2019, asking it to force the SMAVM to pay it an amount of 235,243,366 euros, for the termination of the agreement, with interest and, where applicable, the compounding of accrued interest.\n\nUnder the terms of a judgment dated December 12, 2023, the Paris Administrative Court rejected Autolib's request while also refusing the requests of the SMAVM and the defendant municipalities made on the basis of article L. 761-1 of the French administrative justice code *(Code de justice administrative).* The court held that the SMAVM was liable to bear the entire share of the operating losses of the concession exceeding the threshold of losses accepted by the concession holder and set at 60 million euros in the contract, but that such a mechanism constituted a gift granted by a public entity, without, however, substantiating this characterization, thereby rendering the contract null and void. Autolib' appealed this judgment and intends to assert its rights in respect of all legal grounds available to it in this context.\n\nThere are no other governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings of which the company is aware that are pending or being threatened and are likely to have, or have had over the course of the last twelve months, a significant effect on the financial situation or profitability of the company and/or the Bolloré Group.\n\nThe main disputes and inquiries in which Vivendi is involved are covered by a description in note 11.2 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n# **1.3.1.2. TAX RISKS**\n\nThe Group's activities are subject to changing and restrictive legislation and regulation. However, these factors are not such that they create particular risks for the Group.\n\nIn the normal course of business, some companies in the Group undergo tax audits. These audits do not raise significant risks or risk factors.\n\nAccounting provisions are regularly set up for the consequences of these audits if they appear probable and indicate a future financial cost to the Group (see note 11.2 – Litigation in progress – Tax disputes to the financial statements [in chapter 5, section 5.1]).\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-156-0\"></span>**1.4. Risks related to corporate social responsibility**\n\nThe management of CSR risks is detailed in chapter 2 – Non-financial performance statement – of the 2023 universal registration document. The risks specific to the Communications sector are detailed in Vivendi's universal registration document (see 2.2. and 2.3. \"The main risks\").\n\n# **1.4.1. SOCIAL RISKS**\n\n# **1.4.1.1. HEALTH AND SAFETY OF EMPLOYEES AND THIRD PARTIES**\n\nBolloré Energy and the Industry sector carry out their business activities in environments with a potentially high risk of accidents. The issue is particularly material with regard to industrial activities, such as handling, production and assembly, and the handling, storage and transportation of hazardous goods.\n\nAs for its employees, one of the Group's priority risks is ensuring the health and safety of partners and subcontractors working on its sites, as well as local communities which could be impacted by its activities. The risks relating to the safety of users and third parties in the context of hazardous goods and passenger transport operations are particularly material.\n\n# **1.4.1.2. ATTRACTING AND RETAINING SKILLS**\n\nThe ability to reveal and support talent is one of the pillars of the Group's performance. Internally, the group develops talented individuals so that they can adapt to today's complex and rapidly changing world and create the conditions for individual and collective success. To meet the requirement for quality in our services and ensure the sustainability and growth of our activities, Bolloré Group\n\n# **1.4.1.3. WORKING CONDITIONS AND SOCIAL DIALOG**\n\nThe Group acknowledges that working conditions and social dialog, if they are not fully taken into account, would constitute a major risk in terms of preserving the health and safety of its employees, attracting new talent, retaining employees and ensuring a calm social climate conducive to the development of the business and the company's performance.\n\nWith a diverse range of activities, business lines and stakeholders, the Group has always considered the development of social status and, more specifically, working conditions, as a priority.\n\nfocuses on attracting then retaining and developing the skills of its employees, who are a real lever for operational efficiency and innovation. These initiatives fall into seven categories: school relations, recruitment, diversity, mobility, training, professional support and compensation.\n\nIt maintains local dialog on the ground to ensure the best possible working conditions and promote permanent social dialog with employee representatives and similar bodies, and facilitates employee expression in countries where the ILO conditions on trade union freedoms have not been ratified.\n\n# **1.4.2. ETHICAL RISKS**\n\n# **1.4.2.1. CORRUPTION AND INFLUENCE-PEDDLING (SEE COMPLIANCE RISK)**\n\nThe French Sapin II law of December 9, 2016 requires French companies with at least 500 employees and with revenue or consolidated revenue in excess of 100 million euros to take measures to prevent and detect corruption and influence-peddling. Corruption risk mapping is intended to respond to a dual challenge: (i) to understand the factors liable to affect the various activities and their performance, with the aim of guarding against the legal, human, economic and financial consequences resulting from insufficient care; and (ii) to foster greater knowledge and in turn better control of these risks. As a tool for managing risks, corruption risk mapping\n\n# **1.4.3. HUMAN RIGHTS RISKS**\n\n# **1.4.3.1. RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN RIGHTS**\n\nOwing to its international presence, the Group hires many people, directly or indirectly, in institutional contexts that vary from one country to another, where human rights are at times threatened. This is why respect and the promotion of human rights have been defined as a priority for the Group, covering such issues as guaranteeing decent working conditions, promoting social dialog and the freedom of association of trade unions, the principle of non-discrimination (respecting the rights of individuals regardless of their origin, gender, sexual orientation, political views, trade union membership, enables corruption risks to be identified, the handling of corruption risks to be compared and assessed, the corruption risks that persist after mitigating strategies have been implemented to be identified and the organization to be mobilized using a common method and system. It is the foundation of the Bolloré Group's strategy for managing corruption risks in accordance with article L. 233-3 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)*. In an endeavor to use a risk-based approach, the same strategy is carried out for all the Group's activities. Attention has been focused on the geographic areas and the exposure of the Group's activities to corruption risks.\n\nor the state of the their health, etc.), and the fight against all forms of harassment. These risks are managed through the measures and internal controls set up when hiring employees, health and safety risk management systems, and through the performance of internal social audits.\n\nThe Group also pays special attention to its supply chain and subcontractors. The Group's duty of reasonable care must be adapted to meet local needs in certain regions: offers and services may sometimes be restricted by a restrictive competitive fabric at local, regional or even national level.\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.4.4. ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS**\n\n# **1.4.4.1. CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES**\n\nThe Group is aware of the physical climate risks of its activities, such as the increase in extreme climate events (rising temperatures, etc.), the transition risks and opportunities linked to changes in the market (carbon pricing, decrease in demand for oil products, etc.) and technology (electric transportation, industrial-scale battery storage, etc.), which is why it positions these challenges at the core of its business development and operational management strategy. It has also analyzed the physical risks linked to climate change. The Group, which is committed to long-term investment processes, increases its resistance to market fluctuations and its competitiveness by diversifying its activities, basing its innovation processes on a strict low-carbon strategy to develop its products and services in accordance with the major challenges of the energy transition and climate change.\n\n# **1.4.4.2. LOCAL POLLUTION, INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS AND MANAGEMENT OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS**\n\nDue to its industrial activities, the Bolloré Group has identified local pollution risks and those related to industrial accidents as priorities. The transport and storage of hazardous products and the occurrence of industrial accidents or fires represent major environmental risks and are a top priority for prevention.\n\n# **1.4.5. LOCAL IMPACT**\n\n# **1.4.5.1. RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO RELATIONS WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES**\n\nThrough its activities and relationships with local communities, the Bolloré Group is a key player in regional social and economic development. It must therefore prevent, mitigate and compensate for the negative externalities generated by its activity while maximizing beneficial impacts for local populations and the territories where it operates.\n\n# **1.4.6. SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO ACTIVITIES IN THE COMMUNICATIONS SECTOR**\n\n# **1.4.6.1. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ATTRACTING AND RETAINING EXTERNAL TALENT**\n\n(See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2, sections 4.3.2.1. \"Identifying and encouraging artistic talent in all its diversity\".)\n\n# **1.4.6.2. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DIALOG WITH CUSTOMERS AND USERS AND THEIR SATISFACTION WITH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES**\n\n(See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2, section 1.3.2. \"Emphasis on customer care\".)\n\n# **1.4.6.3. RISKS RELATED TO THE CULTURAL RELEVANCE OF CONTENT**\n\n<span id=\"page-157-0\"></span>(See Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 2, sections 1.3.2. \"Emphasis on customer care\", 4.2.1.1 \"Promoting and sharing culture in our activities\", in particular the sections \"Promoting local cultures\"\n\nand \"Preserving and promoting heritage cinematographic works\", and 4.3.2.1. \"Identifying and encouraging artistic talent in all its diversity\".\n\n# **1.5. Risk management and internal control tools**\n\n# **1.5.1. RISK MAPPING**\n\nMeasuring and controlling the risks inherent in the functioning of each entity are the Group's central preoccupations. Since 2005, the Group has adopted a risk mapping exercise, its primary objectives being to:\n\n- identify the major risks that could affect its divisions' operations;\n- initiate/improve the Group's processes so as to reduce and/or eliminate the impact of these risks;\n- analyze the adequacy of the Group's insurance policy and its purchasing of capacity and guarantees;\n- consider the Group's options regarding the transferring of risks to the insurance and reinsurance market, and/or the use of self-insurance;\n- strengthen crisis management and emergency communication procedures.\n\nThe Group has decided to regularly update the risks of all its business lines in order to enable the implementation and monitoring of action plans specific to each division. To this end, the Group is continuing its program of preventative inspections of its sites. Identified risks are the subject of a series of measures detailed in the action plans drawn up by the various \"owners\" of risks who are nominated within each division to manage and reduce the exposure to these risks.\n\nThe updating of consolidated risk mapping, including CSR and ethical risks, is validated every six months by the Risk Committee.\n\nFor its part, Vivendi also regularly reviews risk factors, which are presented to its Audit Committee. The Risk and Vigilance Committee also assesses whether internal procedures are adequate for dealing with potential risks.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.5.2. INSURANCE – COVERAGE OF THE RISKS THE GROUP MAY ENCOUNTER**\n\nThe Group's insurance policy is primarily aimed at enabling the activities of its various companies to continue in the event of any incident, the policy being based on:\n\n- internal prevention and protection procedures;\n- the transfer of risks to the insurance and reinsurance market through international insurance programs, regardless of the branch of activity and/ or the geographic area.\n\n# **1.5.2.1. INDUSTRIAL RISK COVERAGE**\n\nThe Group's industrial and agricultural operating sites and its storage/ warehousing sites are covered by property insurance programs up to their\n\n# **1.5.2.2. CIVIL LIABILITY COVERAGE**\n\nThe Group has taken out a set of civil liability policies given its various activities and its exposure to various risks.\n\nThe civil liability that any Group company may incur as a result of its activities, in particular general and professional civil liability and civil liability due to products, is covered by a Group insurance program adapted to each activity's risk, in all areas it does business.\n\n# **1.5.3. CYBERSECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT**\n\n# **1.5.3.1. CYBERSECURITY RISK GOVERNANCE**\n\nIn recent years, there has been a marked increase in cybersecurity threats against countries, companies or even hospitals and local authorities with the aim of taking control of their infrastructure or steal confidential information. The Group is aware that these attacks may seriously harm the proper functioning of its activities and impact the data it owns or that are entrusted to it. The level of information system security and the robustness of the control processes implemented in each of its divisions are key focuses for the Group.\n\nAs such, the Bolloré Group has established a specific governance structure to support its security systems. The Chair and Chief Executive Officer or, by delegation, the business and cross-functional departments, approves the objectives of the security policy and ensures the allocation of the resources necessary for its proper implementation:\n\n• the Group Chief Information Officer (CIO) informs the CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) of any work likely to impact the security systems in place.\n\n# **1.5.3.2. BOLLORÉ GROUP CYBERSECURITY POLICY**\n\nThe objective of the information security policy drafted by the Information Systems Department is to continuously improve security. The policy is regularly updated to take into account changes in the cybersecurity risk assessment. This policy is applied in all divisions of the Group. All policies and procedures are reviewed annually.\n\nGiven the cybersecurity risks identified by the Group, an Information Security Management System (ISMS) has been set up at head office. The ISMS obtained ISO 27001-2013 certification in December 2021 for Bolloré SE and Bolloré Energy. The certification was renewed for the initial scope in followup audits in 2022 and 2023. The Group's objective is to obtain ISO 27001- 2022 certification and extend it to other sites in 2024.\n\n# **Cyber risk coverage**\n\nThe Group took out a cyber insurance policy in 2014 to guard against risks related to the Group's information systems.\n\nThe Group is covered in all its areas of activity against the consequences of such events that are liable to affect its facilities, in particular its industrial sites. The Group also has civil liability coverage for all its activities.\n\nRegarding customer risk (chapter 3, section 1.2. \"Risks related to business activities\", under the heading \"Customer risk\"), the Group makes widespread use of credit insurance whenever this is indicated.\n\nreconstruction/replacement value. In most cases, they are also covered by \"Operating loss\" insurance for 100% of the annual gross margin.\n\nThis cover is supplemented by an excess insurance capacity covering all Group companies in addition to the above program.\n\nThe Group's entities also have \"environmental damage\" and \"cyber risk\" civil liability coverage.\n\nThe CIO and the CISO work together to ensure security and technological monitoring, in particular by regularly checking the vulnerability of the Group's technical infrastructure;\n\n- the CISO is responsible for the operational implementation of the information security program, in close collaboration with the CIO;\n- the network of local correspondents applies the security policy at the local level. In 2024, this network will be extended to all Group entities.\n\nSecurity is integrated into the Group's control system . Audits are conducted to assess the resilience of information systems to cyberattacks and the results of these audits are reported to senior management at annual management reviews during which action plans corresponding to these risks are presented at which the actions plans associated with these risk are presented.\n\nIn 2021, the Bolloré Group became an associate member of SAS Campus Cyber, a project initiated by the French President with a view to creating a community of public and private players to unlock synergies.\n\n# **Training**\n\nAccording to several studies, human error is responsible for more than 90% of security incidents.\n\nAs such, employees are the first line of defense in reducing the risk of cyberattacks. To raise employee awareness, three mandatory information security e-learning modules were rolled out in 2021 on phishing (the tactic the most commonly used by cybercriminals [in 90% of cases]), social engineering (breach of trust, baiting, manipulation, fraud) and e-mail security.\n\n- The \"Phishing\" and \"E-mail security\" modules have two main objectives: • understanding what phishing is and identifying threats to information security;\n- recognizing and identifying the components of a phishing message and website.\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the last module, \"Social Engineering\" employees learn how cybercriminals gain employees' trust and encourage them to disclose information enabling them to better target their attacks.\n\nThese modules have been made available to all Group divisions via the internal training platform.\n\nIn 2022, two new training modules based on the IT charter were implemented. As at December 31, 2022, 77% of Bolloré Group employees had completed training courses in the importance of cybersecurity. The Group strengthened its phishing campaigns and actively participated in Cybersecurity Month in October:\n\n• internal communication on cybersecurity best practices via a lock screen on Group employees' workstations;\n\n• transfer of communications made available by the French national agency for information systems security (Anssi);\n\n• recurring communications on phishing and ransomware;\n\n• a monthly phishing campaign.\n\nIn 2023, to raise employee awareness, three mandatory information security e-learning modules were rolled out across all our subsidiaries:\n\n- an introductory module presenting the organization and duties of the Cyber Department;\n- a module reviewing the Information System User Charter;\n- a Cyber-resilience module aimed at giving greater visibility on all aspects relating to business continuity and understanding current threats and major risks.\n\nFinally, there is an optional module, \"Ransomware is everywhere\", which raises awareness and provides training in this type of threat.\n\n| Area of action                                                  | Group objectives                                              | Timeframe | Next steps in 2024                                                                                               |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Strengthen, extend, test and learn                              | Protect against the internal threat                           | 2024      | Strengthen IT security, awareness and testing                                                                    |\n| Implement and extend the ISMS                                   | Obtain ISO 27001: 2022 certification                          | 2024      | Implement a holistic approach to security                                                                        |\n| Strengthen our security operations<br>center (SOC) capabilities | Defend against external threats                               | 2024      | Protect our sensitive data<br>Leverage our tools by detecting our threats on the network                         |\n| Strengthen our cyber<br>resilience approach                     | Implement the BCMS (Business<br>Continuity Management System) | 2024      | Assess our resilience through tests, crisis management,<br>business recovery plans and business continuity plans |\n\n# **1.5.3.3. CYBERSECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS**\n\nUsing the IT risk management tool, the Group has identified two major risks and twelve scenarios of internal and external threats that could seriously harm it. This risk mapping tool is used to assess the criticality and occurrence of these threats in an annual review, allowing the Group to align its action plan and investments with these scenarios.\n\nThe Group has put in place an organization and processes to reduce risks and protect itself in the event of a cyberattack.\n\nMeasures taken to reduce these major risks include the assessment of third parties, the integration of security in projects, and the performance of audits and pentests.\n\nIn addition, the Group has invested in the latest generation of defense and supervision tools to ensure it has the capacity to contain any attacks. The system comprises:\n\n• SIEM - Security Information and Event Management: to collect security events and correlate them with security use cases previously established in the identified risk scenarios;\n\n# **1.5.3.4. RESILIENCE OF INFORMATION SECURITY SYSTEMS**\n\nThe Group's resilience process is based on the principles set out in ISO 22301 and on an incident monitoring and detection program. Organizational resources and supervision tools monitor activity at the level of the information systems. In addition, the Group has put in place a process to offset any prolonged shutdown of critical systems and applications.\n\nIn the Cybersecurity Department, the GRC (governance, risk and compliance) team is in charge of cyber resilience, among others. It defines and oversees the implementation of an IT system continuity management system (methodological framework, crisis simulations and tests).\n\n- EDR Endpoint Detection and Response: to respond to cyberthreats using artificial intelligence and behavioral analysis, going beyond traditional antivirus software. The Group's EDR system ranks among the best in the industry according to Gartner;\n- NDR Network Detection and Response: to strengthen the protection of the company's networks and correlate information with the analysis of the activities of computers and servers to counter cyberattacks;\n- Active Directory security monitoring tool: to monitor the company's directory in real time to detect deviations in administration or cyberattacks.\n\nThe Group has also subscribed to a CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) service to identify the threats and risks associated with the exposure of its assets on the Internet.\n\nThrough this service, the Group benefits from very precise monitoring, enabling it to trigger alerts in a very short time and take appropriate actions to ensure the company's peripheral defense. Vulnerabilities can therefore be detected before they are exploited by attackers.\n\nThe Group's IT business continuity plan (IT BCP) is drawn up based on business impacts of crisis scenarios.\n\nRegular reviews are organized to adapt the plan to changes in business line needs and information systems.\n\nThe Group aims to regularly test and adapt its plans and processes for IT business continuity and cybersecurity crisis management with a view to continued improvement.\n\nSimilar actions are carried out within the Vivendi group, which has its own Cybersecurity Department (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 3, section 1.1.3. \"Cybercrime risks\").\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.5.4. PERSONAL DATA RISK MANAGEMENT**\n\n# **1.5.4.1. DESCRIPTION OF THE RISK**\n\n# **Protection of personal data**\n\nThe risk connected with the failure to protect personal data concerns all the Group's companies and is particularly high for divisions whose activities involve individuals. The Group is aware of the issues relating to the\n\n# **1.5.4.2. GROUP POLICY**\n\nThe strengthening of legal provisions on personal data protection in Europe, the emergence of similar legislation internationally and the increasing digitalization of the Group's activities require systems able to reassure individuals (employees, consumers, etc.) that their personal data remain secure and are processed securely.\n\nPersonal data protection is also a major issue for legal entity customers, which are subject to the same transparency and security obligations as Group entities.\n\nIn response to this new data governance, the Group has incorporated personal data protection into its Code of Conduct and has set up a dedicated Steering Committee whose main duties include:\n\n# **1.5.4.3. OUTCOMES AND PERFORMANCE INDICATORS**\n\nSince 2019, new hires at the Group's French companies follow an online training module (elearning) on personal data protection. This module is supplemented by face-to-face sessions with employees, hosted by the divisions' DPOs and tailored to the specificities of the business lines. In 2023, the e-learning course was revamped to raise awareness among Group employees of the main principles governing personal data protection and the procedures to be applied in the event of a possible data breach. It has been rolled out in the European companies and international subsidiaries. 68% of entities in the Group, consisting of Compagnie de l'Odet, Bolloré SE and its subsidiaries (excluding Vivendi), have successfully completed this training.\n\n# **1.5.5. INTERNAL CONTROL**\n\n# **1.5.5.1. ORGANIZATION AND FEATURES OF INTERNAL CONTROL**\n\nIn accordance with the definition provided in the reference framework of the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF), internal control is a system within the company, defined and implemented under its own responsibility, with the aim of ensuring:\n\n- compliance with legislation and regulations;\n- application of instructions given and strategies set by Executive management;\n- the proper functioning of the company's internal processes, particularly those helping to safeguard its assets;\n- reliable financial reporting;\n- and, more widely, helping it to manage and carry out its business effectively and use its resources efficiently.\n- Under this framework, internal control covers the following elements:\n- an organization including a clear definition of responsibilities, having adequate resources and skills and using appropriate information systems, operating procedures or methods, tools or practices;\n- the internal distribution of relevant and reliable information, knowledge of which enables each person to carry out his or her duties;\n\nprocessing personal data and the supervision of their use. It has set up dedicated organizational structures and continues to deploy appropriate technical measures within its various companies to reduce or even eliminate the impact of this risk on individuals and entities.\n\n- providing tools and procedures governing the protection of personal data (e.g. register of data processing activities, impact analysis procedure, security incident management procedure, etc.);\n- defining actions/action plans to reduce the risks incurred by the physical persons identified within the scope of personal data processing mapping;\n\n• harmonizing the practices put in place in the various companies. This Steering Committee consists of Data Protection Officers (DPOs) appointed within the Group as well as other representatives (lawyers and representatives from the Information Systems, Human Resources, Purchasing Departments, etc.). It meets regularly to assess the action being taken and to determine the next stages of deployment.\n\nIn 2022, the ISMS used by Bolloré SE to manage security in all subsidiaries worldwide was certified ISO 27001.2013 compliant.\n\nThis certification was renewed in 2023.\n\nIn 2024, a program of audits relating to personal data protection will be established jointly by the Group DPO Department and the Internal Audit Department at Bolloré SE subsidiaries to ensure that the processes and procedures made available to them are duly implemented. Regarding the actions taken by the Vivendi group on personal data protection, please refer to Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 3, section 1.1.5 \"Data protection risks\".\n\n- a risk management system intended to list, analyze and tackle the main identifiable risks with regard to the company's objectives and to ensure that procedures are in place to manage these risks;\n- audit activities proportionate to the issues involved in each process and designed to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to manage risks that may affect the achievement of objectives;\n- operation and permanent monitoring of the internal control system and regular examination to ensure that it is functioning correctly.\n\nAs indicated in the reference framework, however, no matter how well designed and applied it is, the internal control system cannot absolutely guarantee that the company will achieve its objectives.\n\nIn the description that follows, the \"Bolloré Group\" covers the parent company and the consolidated subsidiaries. This description of the internal control system was made from the reference framework devised by the working group led under the aegis of the AMF, supplemented by its application guide.\n\nThe principles and key points contained in this guide are followed where they are applicable.\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.5.5.2. A CONTROL SYSTEM ADAPTED TO THE SPECIFIC NATURE OF THE GROUP'S ORGANIZATION**\n\nThe Group's internal control system is based on the following principles:\n\n# **Separation of functions**\n\nIn order to guarantee the independence of the control function, the operational and finance departments have been systematically separated at every level within the Group.\n\nEach entity's Finance Department is responsible for ensuring that financial information is complete and reliable. All this information is regularly forwarded to senior executives and the operational departments (Human Resources, Legal, Finance, etc.).\n\n# **Independence and responsibility of subsidiaries**\n\nThe Group is organized into operational divisions which, owing to the diversity of their activities, have considerable scope to manage their own affairs. The divisions are responsible for:\n\n- specifying and implementing an internal control system suited to their specific situation and features;\n- optimizing their operational and financial performance levels;\n- safeguarding their own assets, and;\n- managing their own risks.\n\nThis system of delegated responsibility ensures that the various entities' practices comply with the legal and regulatory framework in force in the countries where they are established.\n\n# **1.5.5.3. INTERNAL DISTRIBUTION OF RELEVANT INFORMATION**\n\n# **Compliance with legislation and regulations**\n\nThe Group's operational departments enable it to:\n\n- keep abreast of the various laws that apply to it;\n- be advised, in good time, of any changes to them;\n- incorporate these rules into its internal procedures;\n- keep its staff informed and properly trained to comply with the rules and legislation concerning them.\n\n# **Application of the instructions and directions set by the Group's Executive management**\n\nExecutive management sets the Group's targets and overall strategies, ensuring that all staff are informed of them.\n\nIn this respect, the Group's budget process involves strict undertakings by the entities with respect to Executive management:\n\n- during the fourth quarter of the year, each operational division prepares a budget on the basis of the overall strategic directions set by Executive management; the budget gives a breakdown of forecast profits and cash flow, as well as the main indicators for measuring operational performance levels;\n- once approved by Executive management, this budget, broken down into months, serves as the reference for budgetary control. Discrepancies between this budget forecast and the monthly results are analyzed each month at Results Committee meetings attended by the Group's Executive management, divisional management and the Group's operational departments (Human Resources, Legal and Finance).\n\n# **1.5.5.4. RELIABLE FINANCIAL REPORTING**\n\n# **Procedure for preparing the consolidated financial statements**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared every half-year; they are verified by the Statutory Auditors in a limited review at June 30 and a full audit at December 31, covering the separate financial statements of all entities within the consolidation scope and the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThey are published once they have been approved by the Board of Directors. The Group relies on the following elements for consolidating its financial statements:\n\n- the Group's Consolidation Department, which ensures the standardization and monitoring of bookkeeping in all companies within the parent company's consolidation scope;\n- strict adherence to accounting standards linked to the consolidation operations;\n- the use of a recognized IT tool, developed in 2005 to keep the Group abreast of new information transmission technology and to guarantee secure procedures for reporting information and standardized presentation of the accounting aggregates;\n\n# **Joint support and control functions for all Group companies**\n\nThe Group establishes mandatory accounting, financial and control procedures for the central processes, usually circulated by e-mail to the operating divisions. The latter are responsible for circulating them within their organization. In addition to these procedures that the Group has established for central processes, the operating divisions have their own accounting, financial, administrative and control procedures, collected on an intranet site or regularly sent out to the entities by e-mail in order to disseminate and manage the standard framework created by the Group and the divisions. The Group Internal Audit Department regularly assesses the entities' control systems, especially with regard to their observance of Group procedures and the procedures specific to each operating division. It suggests the best ways to make improvements.\n\n# **Human resources policy fostering a good internal control environment**\n\nThe human resources policy contributes to the enhancement of an effective internal control environment through job descriptions and an appraisal system based particularly on annual reviews and regular training programs.\n\n# **Proper functioning of the company's internal processes, particularly those helping to safeguard its assets**\n\nThe Information Systems Department has introduced safety and security procedures for ensuring the quality and security of the Group's operations, even in the event of major difficulties.\n\nThe process of monitoring all capital expenditure, conducted jointly by the Purchasing, Management Control and Insurance Departments, contributes to keeping a close watch over the Group's tangible assets and safeguarding their value in use through appropriate insurance cover.\n\nAlthough devolved to the various operating divisions, client accounts are nonetheless subject to monthly reporting to the Group's Finance Department, which is responsible for identifying the main client default risks and taking remedial action along with the divisions.\n\nThe Group's cash flow is monitored by:\n\n- daily notification of the divisions' cash flow figures;\n- monthly updates to the Group's cash flow forecasts;\n- optimization of exchange rate and interest rate risks (studied by the Risk Committee, which meets semi-annually under the authority of Executive management);\n- the availability of short-, medium- or long-term credit from financial partners.\n- decentralization of a portion of the consolidation restatements at operational division or company level, allowing the accounting treatment to be positioned as closely as possible to the operational flows.\n\n# **Financial reporting process**\n\nThe Group's Cash and Management Control Departments organize and monitor the reporting of monthly financial information and indicators from the divisions and, in particular, their income statements and net debt reports. Within each division, the financial reporting details are validated by its Executive management and forwarded by its Finance Department. The figures are submitted in a standardized format that complies with the rules and standards for consolidation, making it easier to crosscheck against the items in the half-yearly and annual consolidated financial statements. Specific reports for each of these are forwarded to the Group's Executive management. The monthly financial reports are supplemented by budget reviews throughout the year in order to update the year's targets in accordance with the latest figures.\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.5.5.5. LIMITATION OF RISK RELATED TO PUBLICLY-TRADED SECURITIES**\n\n# **Stock market ethics rules**\n\nIn accordance with European regulation no. 596/2014 of April 16, 2014 on market abuse (known as the MAR) and the AMF \"Guide on ongoing disclosure and management of insider information\", published on October 26, 2016 and updated on April 29, 2021, the Group regularly updates the list of people with access to inside information that, if it were made public, could have a significant influence on the price of financial instruments.\n\nThese individuals (employees, directors or third parties in a close professional relationship with the company) are notified of the ban on using or disclosing such price-sensitive information with a view to any purchase or sale of these instruments.\n\nIn addition, information is regularly disseminated on article 19.11 of MAR, which prohibits any person discharging managerial responsibilities from carrying out transactions on their own behalf or on behalf of third parties during \"closed\" periods.\n\nThese transactions are prohibited for a period of thirty calendar days before the publication of the company's half-yearly and annual financial statements, including the publication date, as well as for a period of fifteen calendar days preceding the publication date of the company's quarterly revenue, up to and including this day.\n\nTo limit exposure to the risks associated with regulations and their changes and litigation, the Group's Legal Department sees to the security and legal compliance of the Group's activities, in liaison with the divisions' legal departments. When a lawsuit arises, the Group's Legal Department ensures that it is settled in the Group's best interests.\n\n# **1.5.6. RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**\n\nIn accordance with the AMF's reference framework definition, risk management is a dynamic system, defined and implemented under the company's responsibility, which enables the company to:\n\n- create and preserve the company's value, assets and reputation;\n- secure decision-making and corporate processes to facilitate the achievement of company objectives;\n- promote consistency between the company's actions and its values;\n- unite company employees behind a shared vision of the main risks.\n\nUnder this framework, risk management covers the following elements:\n\n- an organizational framework that defines roles and responsibilities, a risk management policy and an information system that allows risk information to be disseminated internally;\n- a three-stage risk management process: risk identification, risk analysis and risk management;\n- continuous supervision of the risk management system with regular monitoring and review.\n\n# **1.5.7. CONTROL ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THESE RISKS**\n\n# **1.5.7.1. RISK MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING RULES**\n\nLitigation and risks are monitored by each division. The Legal Department and the Insurance Department, for managing claims, also provide assistance in all major disputes, as well as on every draft contract of major financial significance. Finally, risk management methods are subject to regular in-depth reviews by the Risk Committee.\n\n# **1.5.7.2. SCOPE OF DEPLOYMENT OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**\n\nThe internal control procedures cover all of Compagnie de l'Odet, Bolloré SE and its consolidated subsidiaries, excluding Vivendi, which has its own internal control and risk management system (see Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document, chapter 3, section 2. \"Internal control and risk management\"). Regarding acquisitions, in addition to the internal procedures already in place within the companies concerned, procedures are gradually harmonized and internal control and risk management mechanisms are gradually deployed.\n\n# **1.5.8. OPERATION AND MONITORING OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM**\n\n# **1.5.8.1. THE MAIN PARTICIPANTS IN INTERNAL CONTROL AND THEIR TASKS**\n\nThe arrangements for exercising internal control are implemented by:\n\n# **The Board of Directors of the Group's parent company**\n\nThe Board of Directors monitors the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems as determined and implemented by Executive management. If need be, the Board can use its own general powers to undertake such actions and verification work as it sees fit.\n\n# **The Group's Executive management**\n\nExecutive management is responsible for specifying, implementing and monitoring suitable and effective internal control and risk management systems. In the event of any deficiency in the systems, it ensures that the necessary remedial measures are taken.\n\n# **The Monthly Results Committee**\n\nEach division submits a monthly report to the Group's Executive management and central departments detailing, for all companies within its scope, the operational and financial indicators for its business as well as an analysis of the evolving trends with reference to the targets approved by Executive management.\n\n# **The Audit Committee**\n\nThe role, remit and mission of this Committee are set forth in the report of the Board of Directors on corporate governance prepared in accordance with article L. 225-37 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)*. This Committee meets twice a year.\n\n# **The Ethics, CSR and Anticorruption Committee**\n\nThis Committee meets once or twice a year. Its objective is to ratify priorities in terms of ethics and compliance and to review CSR performance. It determines the outlook, projects and action plans to be implemented within the divisions with regard to priority CSR risks and opportunities.\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **The Risk Committee**\n\nThe Risk Committee is in charge of carrying out a regular and in-depth review of risk management methods. This Committee, which meets at least twice a year, consists of the Group's Executive management, the Finance, Legal, Insurance, Compliance, Risk, CSR, GDPR and Internal Audit Departments, and the operational divisions depending on the agenda.\n\n# **Subsidiaries' governing bodies**\n\nThe governing body of each Group subsidiary considers the company's strategy and policies as put forward by Executive management, monitors their implementation, sets operational targets, allocates resources and carries out verification and control work as it sees fit. All officers receive all the information needed to carry out their assignments and may request any documents they consider useful.\n\n# **The subsidiaries' management**\n\nThey apply the directions given by the governing bodies within their own subsidiaries. With the assistance of their management control departments, they ensure that the Group's internal control system operates effectively. They report to their own governing bodies and also to the management committees.\n\n# **Group Internal Audit**\n\nThe Group has an Internal Audit Department, reporting to the Group's Executive management, operating in all entities within the scope (excluding Vivendi, which has its own internal audit department).\n\nThe Department carries out internal audits with a systematic review of financial and operational risks, audits to monitor and implement the recommendations made, and more targeted assignments according to the needs expressed by the divisions or Executive management. It has a dedicated team that performs compliance audits with a short-term objective of assessing the implementation of the Sapin II law, and which will ultimately be responsible for auditing all compliance matters (GDPR, duty of care, CSRD).\n\nIt works on an annual plan put together with the help of the divisions and Executive management, based on evaluation of the risks affecting each subsidiary and a cyclical audit for the whole Group.\n\nAs a priority, it aims to cover the most sensitive risks and to review the other major risks in the medium term for all Group entities. The auditors receive internal training in the divisional business lines so that they can better understand the operational particularities of each one.\n\nIt is the Internal Audit Department's responsibility to assess the functioning of the internal control system and to make any recommendations for its improvement within the scope of its responsibility. Audit reports are sent to the companies audited, the divisions to which they are attached and to Executive management.\n\n# **1.5.9. STATUTORY AUDITORS AND INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTIES**\n\nIn accordance with their appointment to review and certify the financial statements, and in accordance with their professional standards, the Statutory Auditors acquaint themselves with the accounting and internal control systems. They accordingly carry out interim investigations assessing the operational methods used in the various audit cycles that have been decided on; they guarantee the proper application of generally accepted accounting principles, with the aim of producing accurate and precise information. They submit a half-year summary of the conclusions of their work to the Finance Department, the Group's Executive management and the Audit Committee.\n\n<span id=\"page-163-0\"></span>The Group's financial statements are certified jointly by Wolff et Associés (appointed by the Ordinary General Meeting of May 25, 2022), represented by Patrick Wolff, and AEG Finances (reappointed by the Combined General Meeting of May 29, 2019), represented by Samuel Clochard.\n\nFor the corporate social and environmental transparency obligations, EY & Associés, represented by Philippe Aubain, is the independent thirdparty appointed to verify the non-financial performance statement. This verification consists in verifying the existence of policies, action plans and performance monitoring indicators to ensure an internal due diligence approach that mitigates risks in the conduct of all the Group's activities and in all the areas in which it operates. Following its work, the independent third-party body issues a limited assurance opinion on the compliance of the non-financial performance statement and the truthfulness of the information provided.\n\n# **1.6. Compliance**\n\n# **1.6.1. COMPLIANCE PROGRAM**\n\n# **1.6.1.1. NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT**\n\nThis point is covered in detail in chapter 2.\n\n# **1.6.1.2. ANTICORRUPTION**\n\nThis point is covered in detail in the non-financial performance statement in chapter 2, section 1.2.2.1.\n\n# **1.6.1.3. THE FIGHT AGAINST TAX EVASION**\n\nThis point is covered in detail in the non-financial performance statement in chapter 2, section 1.2.2.1.3.\n\n# **1.6.1.4. DUTY OF CARE PLAN**\n\nThis point is covered in detail in chapter 2, \"Bolloré Group's non-financial performance\", section 2 – Duty of care plan.\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Corporate governance\n\n| 1.    | Administrative and management bodies

This decision must be made in the event of any appointment or renewal of the term of office of the Chairman or Chief Executive Officer.

At its meeting of May 25, 2022, the Board of Directors, having noted the reappointment of Vincent Bolloré as a director, decided to maintain the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as a single office.\n\nIt was considered that this type of governance corresponds to the company's guidelines and its shareholding structure. It is also part of discussions on\n\nthe organization of governance within the Group.\n\n# **1.3. Powers and possible limitations by the Board of Directors of the powers of the Chief Executive Officer (article L. 22-10-10, 3° of the French commercial code** *[Code de commerce]***)**\n\nIf the Board of Directors chooses not to separate the functions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman assumes, under his/her responsibility, the company's Executive management.\n\nSubject to the powers accorded by law to General Meetings and to the Board of Directors and within the scope of the company's corporate purpose, the Chief Executive Officer, in his capacity as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is granted the broadest powers to act in the name of the company in all circumstances. He represents the company in its dealings with third parties.

He/she ensures the proper functioning of the corporate bodies and ensures in particular that the directors are able to fulfill their missions.\n\nOn March 14, 2024, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was granted the authority by the Board to issue bonds, endorsements and guarantees to third parties on behalf of the company for a period of one year for the Group's day-to-day operations, up to an overall limit of two hundred million euros (200,000,000 euros), it being specified that an unlimited amount of bonds, endorsements and guarantees may be granted to the tax and customs authorities.\n\nThe balance of powers within the Board is based on its composition, its diversity, the profiles and experience of its members, as well as those of the two Committees designated to support the Board – the Audit Committee and the Compensation and Appointments Committee. The involvement of the directors, as well as the attendance rate at the meetings, contributes fully to the balance of powers.\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-166-0\"></span>**1.4.

FAMILY TIES BETWEEN DIRECTORS**\n\nSébastien Bolloré, Yannick Bolloré, Cyrille Bolloré and Marie Bolloré are the children of Vincent Bolloré. Cédric de Bailliencourt is the nephew of Vincent Bolloré.\n\n# **1.7.2. CONVICTIONS FOR FRAUD, BANKRUPTCY OR PUBLIC SANCTIONS IMPOSED IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS**\n\nTo the best of the company's knowledge, over the course of the last five years, no member of the Board of Directors:\n\n• has been convicted of fraud;\n\n<span id=\"page-170-1\"></span>• has been associated with any bankruptcy, receivership or liquidation;\n\n- has been officially charged or sanctioned by the statutory or regulatory authorities;\n- has been disqualified by a court from serving on a Board of Directors, a Management Board or a Supervisory Board of a company issuing stock or from acting in the management or the conduct of such a company's affairs.\n\n# **1.8. Corporate Governance Code**\n\nThe Group refers to the French Corporate Governance Code for listed companies established by the Afep and the Medef and revised in December 2022.\n\nAt its meeting of March 14, 2024, the members of the Board of Directors, after reviewing the recommendations submitted for annual review, confirmed that the company will continue to use the Afep-Medef Code as a reference tool.\n\nIn accordance with the \"comply or explain\" rule set out in article 28.1 of the Afep-Medef Code, the company considers that its corporate governance structure complies with the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code.\n\nThe Afep-Medef Code makes a distinction between corporate officers (Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Executive Officer, Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and members of the Management Board, managers of limited partnerships) and non-executive corporate officers (separate Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chairman of the Supervisory Board of public limited companies with a Management Board or of limited partnerships).\n\nThe Code's recommendations must therefore be considered having regard to the precise nature of the position held, it being noted that the term \"corporate officer\" encompasses all the senior executives listed above and, where noted, directors and members of the Supervisory Board.\n\n# **1.8.1. RECOMMENDATIONS SUBJECTED TO A SPECIFIC REVIEW**\n\n# **1.8.1.1. EQUITY HOLDING OBLIGATION**\n\nAt its meeting on March 14, 2024, the Board of Directors recognized that the minimum number of company shares that the corporate officers are required to hold, as decided by the Board at its meeting of March 20, 2014 (i.e. 30 shares), had been met.\n\n# **1.8.1.2. CUMULATIVE MANDATES**\n\nAt its meeting of March 14, 2024, the Board of Directors, having been reminded of the provisions relating to multiple corporate offices, examined the situations of Vincent Bolloré, Chief Executive Officer, and Sébastien Bolloré, Deputy Chief Executive Officer, in this respect.\n\nThe Afep-Medef Code calls for different rules concerning the concurrent holding of offices depending on what position a company officer holds.\n\nFor executive corporate officers, article 20 of the Afep-Medef Code states that the number of directorships that may be exercised by the executive corporate officer in listed companies outside his or her Group, including non-French companies, should be limited to two, it being specified that the limit of two offices does not apply \"to directorships held by an executive corporate officer in subsidiaries and shareholdings, held alone or together with others, of companies whose main activity is to acquire and manage such shareholdings\".\n\nThe application guide for the Afep-Medef Code confirmed the following details previously provided for applying this exemption:\n\n- it is attached to a person, in view of the time that he or she is in a position to devote to exercising an office;\n- it concerns persons who hold a position as corporate officer in a listed company whose main activity is to acquire or manage shareholdings;\n- it applies to each of the listed companies in which the corporate officer holds an office, whenever they are subsidiaries and shareholdings, directly or indirectly held solely or in concert by the company whose main activity is to acquire or manage shareholdings in which he or she exercises a term of office as corporate officer;\n- it does not apply to a corporate officer of a listed company whose main activity is not to acquire or manage holdings (i.e. an operating company) with regard to their offices held in listed companies in which a subsidiary of the company in which they are an executive holds a stake and is itself a holding company.\n\nThe Board of Directors took note:\n\n- that Vincent Bolloré does not hold any other office within the Group's listed companies;\n- that the directorships held by Sébastien Bolloré within the Group constitute an exception;\n- that the directorships held by the corporate officers in listed entities outside their Group fall within the exemption, except for those for which not enough of the share capital is held to characterize them as either subsidiaries or equity investments.\n\nAccordingly, the corporate offices that Vincent Bolloré holds within companies of the Socfin group (39.75% of whose capital is indirectly owned by Compagnie de l'Odet as at December 31, 2023) are covered by the exemption provided in the Afep-Medef Code. The same applies to those exercised by Sébastien Bolloré in Vivendi, Bigben Interactive and Nacon.\n\nAs such, the executive corporate officers of Compagnie de l'Odet, whose purpose is to acquire or manage company holdings, may hold positions in entities outside their group as long as they are Compagnie de l'Odet subsidiaries or holdings (direct or indirect).\n\nAccordingly, the corporate officers' situation is compliant with the Afep-Medef provisions concerning the holding of multiple corporate offices.\n\nMoreover, on March 14, 2024, the Board of Directors noted the compliance of the situation of its corporate officers with regard to the legal provisions governing the non-cumulative nature of offices held applicable to individuals who hold a corporate office in France.\n\nFinally, the Board noted that, in accordance with recommendation 20.2 of the Afep-Medef Code, the corporate officers must obtain the opinion of the members of the Board prior to accepting a new term of office in a listed company outside their group.\n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.8.1.3. AMENDMENTS TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS' INTERNAL RULES OF PROCEDURE**\n\n# **Shares owned and held by members of the Board of Directors (article 21 of the Afep-Medef Code)**\n\nAt its meeting on March 20, 2014, the Board of Directors adopted, in its internal rules of procedure, provisions relative to the requirement that directors hold and retain shares.\n\n# **1.8.1.4. DEFINITION OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR**\n\nBeing required to state its view with respect to the independence criteria for directors, the Board, acting at its meeting on March 14, 2024 on a proposal by the Compensation and Appointments Committee, confirmed its previous analysis.\n\nThus, for the determination of the status of independent director, it was decided:\n\n- to set aside the length of service criterion of twelve years since the sole criterion of the term of a director's duties does not, as such, call his/her independence into question;\n- to consider that acting as a director in another company within the Group does not call a director's independence into question.\n- To be classified as independent, a director must not:\n- be an employee or corporate officer of the company/employee, executive corporate officer of a fully consolidated company/employee, executive\n\n# **1.8.1.5. REVIEW OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF DIRECTORS**\n\nOf the 15 members of the Board of Directors and in accordance with the independence criteria confirmed by the Board of Directors at its meeting on March 14, 2024, Ingrid Brochard, Hubert Fabri, Janine Goalabré, Alain Moynot, Olivier Roussel and Martine Studer are considered independent.\n\nTo comply with the internal rules of procedure, each director is required to allocate at least 10% of the compensation received for performing their duties as a director to purchasing Compagnie de l'Odet securities each year until the value of his/her number of shares reaches the equivalent of one year of compensation received.\n\ncorporate officer of the company's parent company or a company that is fully consolidated by that parent company/or have been in the previous five years;\n\n- be a client, supplier, investment banker, corporate banker or advisor: – significant to the company or its Group,\n\t- or for which the company or its Group represent a significant proportion of the business;\n- have a close family tie with a corporate officer/director/member of the Supervisory Board;\n- have been an auditor of the company within the previous five years.\n\nThe provisions of the Corporate Governance Code for listed companies not applied by our company are set out in a summary table in section 4.1.9.\n\nThe summary hereinafter shows the situation (compliant or not) of the directors in relation to the criteria defined by the Afep-Medef Code in relation to directors' independence.\n\n| Independent directors |\n|-----------------------|\n| Ingrid Brochard       |\n| Hubert Fabri(1)(2)    |\n| Janine Goalabré(1)    |\n| Alain Moynot(2)       |\n| Olivier Roussel(1)(2) |\n| Martine Studer(1)     |\n\n(1) Notwithstanding the exercise of a corporate office as director in another company of the Group (or during the last five fiscal years).\n\n(2) Notwithstanding the length of time during which the director has held office.\n\n# **1.8.1.6. LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR**\n\nOn March 14, 2024 the Board of Directors confirmed that it was not appointing a lead independent director.\n\nIt was the view of the Board that the measures already taken ensure that the Board will function properly (including the duties given to the Committees and the Vice-Chairmen, the application of the Board's internal rules of procedure concerning conflicts of interest, and the Board's self-assessment process).\n\nWith respect to interactions with the stakeholders, direct discussions with the Group's senior executives have always been given priority. Communication with shareholders occurs either directly with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or with the departments in charge of financial communications and shareholder relations.\n\n# **1.8.1.7. ASSESSMENT OF THE MATERIALITY OF A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH A DIRECTOR**\n\nThe Board of Directors, at its meeting on March 14, 2024, upon the proposal of the Compensation and Appointments Committee, reaffirmed that the assessment of the materiality of business relationships must not exclusively be based on the amount of the commercial transactions that may be entered into between the Bolloré Group and the company (or the group) in which the director in question holds another position, keeping in mind that the materiality threshold for business relationships decided upon by the Board is deemed to have been attained whenever the amount of commercial transactions exceeds 1% of Group revenue for the fiscal year in question.\n\nThe Board, at its meeting of March 23, 2017, decided that, pursuant to the provisions of AMF Recommendation no. 2012-02, priority would be given to multiple criteria in the process of assessing the materiality of a business relationship with a director, particularly the duration of the relationship, any potential economic dependence, the financial conditions in relation to market prices, the officer's position in the co-contracting company and his/ her involvement in the implementation or performance of the business relationship.\n\nThe Board of Directors, at its meeting on March 14, 2024, in accordance with AMF Recommendation no 2012-02 amended on December 14, 2023, confirmed its position and noted that none of the directors described as independent had significant direct or indirect business relationships with the Group.\n\n{172}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **1.8.1.8. MANAGEMENT OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST**\n\n<span id=\"page-172-0\"></span>Section 21 of the December 2022 revision of the Afep-Medef Corporate Governance Code, \"Ethical rules for directors\", provides that a director must inform the Board of any conflict of interest, even potential, and must abstain from related discussions and voting on the issue.\n\nTo this effect, the Board of Directors, at its meeting on March 14, 2024, was reminded that these obligations are written into the Board's internal rules of procedure and that the directors are obliged to disclose any situation presenting a conflict of interests, even if it is only potential. It was noted that directors must declare the absence of conflicts of interest at least once a year during the preparation of the universal registration document.\n\n# **1.9. Information on corporate governance (article L. 22-10-10, 4° of the French commercial code** *[Code de commerce]***)**\n\nOn March 14, 2024, the Board of Directors of Compagnie de l'Odet was asked to confirm that the company continued to use the Afep-Medef Corporate Governance Code as a reference.\n\nSome of the recommendations in that Code are reviewed each year by the Board of Directors, and those not selected for application are included in the table below.\n\nThis Corporate Governance Code may be viewed on the Medef website (www.medef.com/fr).\n\n| Afep-Medef Code<br>recommendations

Afep-Medef considers<br>that a director is not<br>independent if he/she has<br>exercised his/her<br>corporate office for over<br>twelve years. | The length of service criterion of twelve years is set aside since the term of a director's duties does not as such call his or<br>her independence into question.<br>The Board of Directors conducts an annual review of each director's situation in this respect.<br>Accordingly, at its meeting held on March 14, 2024, the Board confirmed that, irrespective of the term of directors' duties, it<br>valued the personal qualities, experience, and industrial and financial expertise enabling directors to give useful opinions<br>and advice through exchanges in which they can express their position.<br>Moreover, it should not be forgotten that the length of service improves understanding of the Group, its history and its<br>different jobs within a Group comprising many very technical jobs on an international scale.<br>The perfect understanding of the Group by a director through his length of service is a major asset, particularly when<br>examining the strategic directions of the Group, or the implementation of complex projects or projects involving new<br>businesses without altering the director's capacity with regard to Management's decisions.<br>A length of service of twelve years cannot be associated with a loss of independence. |\n| The same is true if a<br>director exercises a<br>corporate office in a<br>subsidiary company.                                                      | Acting as a director in another company within the Group does not call a director's independence into question.<br>The Board feels that the Bolloré Group, controlled by the founding family, is unusual in that it is diversified across a number<br>of businesses, with operations in France and abroad.<br>One of the Group's strategic directions is to optimize and develop synergies between its various businesses.<br>In order to implement this strategy, it is necessary to have high-level managerial expertise combined with in-depth<br>knowledge of all the Group's businesses and understanding of any geopolitical issues critical to the international<br>operations.<br>In addition, directors holding office in a parent company as well as in one of its subsidiaries are invited to abstain from<br>taking part in decisions made by the Board of Directors of the parent company in the event of a conflict of interest between<br>the parent company and the subsidiary.

ORGANIZATION OF THE BOARD'S WORK**\n\nTwo weeks before the Board meets, a convening notice is sent to each director together with a draft of the minutes of the previous meeting, so that they can make any comments on the draft before the actual Board meeting. This allows the Board meeting to be devoted to discussing the agenda.\n\nFor each Board meeting, a complete report setting forth each of the items on the agenda is submitted to all the directors, who may request any other information that they consider useful. Discussions are conducted with the constant aim of encouraging an exchange between all the directors on the basis of complete information, and with careful attention to keeping the discussion focused on the important issues, especially those of a strategic nature.\n\nDuring the 2023 fiscal year, the Board met five times and was called upon to give its opinion on points that included the following:\n\n# **• Meeting on March 14, 2023 (attendance rate: 100%):**\n\n- review and approval of the consolidated financial statements for the 2022 fiscal year;\n- review and approval of the annual financial statements for the 2022 financial year;\n- management report;\n- 2023 projected income statement 2023 forecast financing plan reports;\n- proposed allocation of income for the fiscal year;\n- governance;\n- compensation policy for corporate officers;\n- review of the extent to which the performance criteria relating to the variable compensation of corporate officers have been met;\n- preparation of the Combined General Shareholders' Meeting convening – agenda set-up – reports – draft Resolutions;\n- implementation of the process for assessing current agreements;\n\n# **1.10.4.

Presentation of the compensation policy for corporate officers, directors and members of the Supervisory Board for the 2024 fiscal year, drafted pursuant to article L. 22-10-8 of the French commercial code** *(Code de commerce)*\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of article L. 22-10-8 section I of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* the compensation policy for corporate officers, directors and members of the Supervisory Board must be in line with the company's corporate interests, contribute to its sustainability and be part of its business strategy.\n\nThe compensation policy for corporate officers, directors and members of the Supervisory Board is set by the Board of Directors based on the recommendations of the Compensation and Appointments Committee.\n\nIn the course of their discussions, the Board of Directors and Compensation and Appointments Committee take note of and rigorously apply to all components of compensation the principles of completeness, balance between compensation components, comparability, consistency the intelligibility of rules and moderation. In accordance with article L. 22-10-8 section II of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* the compensation policy must be the subject of a draft resolution submitted to the Ordinary General Meeting. It must be voted on every year and whenever a major change is made to the compensation policy. If the Ordinary General Meeting does not approve the draft resolution submitted to it and if it has previously approved a compensation policy, then the latter continues to apply and the Board of Directors must submit to the next Ordinary General Meeting a draft resolution containing a revised compensation policy and\n\nstating in what way the shareholders' vote and any opinions expressed by the\n\nMeeting were taken into account. Should the resolution presented be voted down and if no compensation policy has previously been approved, then the compensation shall be set in accordance with that of the preceding fiscal year or, in the absence of compensation granted for the preceding fiscal year, in accordance with the company's existing practices. The Board of Directors must submit to the next Ordinary General Meeting a draft resolution presenting a revised compensation policy.\n\n# **2.1.1. WITH REGARD TO THE COMPENSATION POLICY FOR MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS**\n\nPursuant to article L. 225-45 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)*, the General Shareholders' Meeting may allocate to the Board directors in compensation for their work a fixed yearly sum that the Meeting determines without being bound by statutory provisions or by previous decisions. How it is apportioned among the directors is determined by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe maximum overall amount of compensation that the Board of Directors may allocate to its members during a fiscal year was set by the Ordinary General Meeting of May 28, 2020 at an amount of five hundred thousand euros (500,000 euros).\n\nThe gross amount (before taxes and withholdings) paid to the directors for the 2023 fiscal year was 487,525 euros.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Compensation and Appointments Committee, the Board of Directors voted at its meeting on March 14, 2024, to add to the meeting's agenda a resolution on increasing the annual amount of directors' compensation to 800,000 euros and to renew the terms and conditions for distributing this compensation so that part of it is correlated with the participation in Board meetings and thus to apply the following distribution rule:\n\n• payment of a portion related to membership of the Board (if applicable, pro rata to the duration of his/her term of office over the year in question) equivalent to half of the compensation.\n\nFor 2024 and subsequent fiscal years until a new decision by the Board, this portion is set at 17,000 euros per fiscal year;\n\n• and a portion related to the effective participation of the director in Board meetings.\n\nFor 2024 and subsequent fiscal years until a new decision by the Board, this portion is set at 4,250 euros per meeting.\n\nThe portions tied to membership of the Board and to actual attendance at meetings are capped at a gross maximum amount per director per calendar year.\n\nFor fiscal year 2024 and subsequent years until a new decision by the Board, this cap is set at 34,000 euros per director.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors voted that each member of the Audit Committee will continue to receive specific yearly compensation of \n\n{177}------------------------------------------------\n\n10,000 euros deducted from the total amount of compensation allocated to the Board of Directors.\n\nApart from this compensation, the Board of Directors has the right, in accordance with the provisions of articles L. 225-46 and L. 22-10-15 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* to allocate exceptional compensation to directors for the duties or mandates it entrusts to them.\n\nMembers of the Board of Directors holding an executive corporate office within an affiliated company or holding an employment contract with the company may benefit, if applicable, from the granting of free shares, under the conditions provided for in article L. 225-197-1 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)* or share subscription or purchase options pursuant to articles L. 277- 177 et seq. of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce).*\n\nThe draft resolution on the compensation policy for members of the Board of Directors will be submitted to a vote of the shareholders in the Combined General Meeting of June 14, 2024 under the following terms:\n\n# \"TWELFTH RESOLUTION\n\n**(Approval of the compensation policy for directors established by the Board of Directors – ex ante vote)**\n\nThe General Shareholders' Meeting, acting under the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings and having reviewed the report on the company's corporate governance called for by article L. 225-37 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)* describing the components of the compensation policy for corporate officers, directors and members of the Supervisory Board, approves, pursuant to article L. 22-10-8 section II of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* the compensation policy for directors as it appears in the universal registration document.\"\n\n# **2.1.2. WITH REGARD TO THE COMPENSATION POLICY FOR THE CORPORATE OFFICERS**\n\nThe Board of Directors decided on March 14, 2024 to pursue a compensation policy including a variable component likely to promote the implementation of strategic guidelines and long-term value creation in line with the interests of all stakeholders.\n\nAt its meeting on March 14, 2024, the Board of Directors also decided to maintain the alignment of the compensation structures for corporate officers, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer.\n\n# **2.1.3. WITH REGARD TO THE COMPENSATION OF THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER**\n\nThe compensation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer currently has the following different components:\n\n# **FIXED COMPENSATION**\n\nFixed compensation is determined on the basis of the responsibilities and duties attached to the corporate office.\n\nIt serves as a basis for calculating the maximum percentage of target annual variable compensation.\n\nThe Board of Directors at its meeting of March 14, 2024, having noted the recommendations of the Compensation and Appointments Committee and based on the studies relating to compensation for comparable positions, decided to renew the fixed compensation paid to Vincent Bolloré at an annual gross amount of 900,000 euros for the current and subsequent financial years until a new decision by the Board.\n\nIn addition, entertainment, travel, hospitality and security costs related to the performance of their duties may be reimbursed if supporting documents are provided or paid directly if invoices are provided.\n\n# **VARIABLE COMPENSATION**\n\nAnnual variable compensation seeks to reward officers' performance over the year.\n\nAt its meeting on March 14, 2024, the Board of Directors decided that the annual variable compensation will be based on quantifiable and qualitative criteria. The annual variable compensation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may represent one hundred percent (100%) of the fixed component if the objectives are met one hundred per cent (100%).\n\nAnnual variable compensation is based on the achievement of quantifiable objectives and qualitative objectives. These two types of objectives, set at the beginning of each period in question, are communicated to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and account for 2/3 and 1/3 of variable compensation, respectively.\n\n# **WITH REGARD TO VARIABLE COMPENSATION CRITERIA (QUANTIFIABLE PORTION)**\n\nThe quantifiable financial criteria relate to i) the value of Compagnie de l'Odet's portfolio, both in terms of its own performance and that which is attributable to changes in the SBF 120 index, and ii) Group EBITA, each of which accounts for 1/3 of the \"target\" variable compensation.\n\n# **WITH REGARD TO VARIABLE COMPENSATION CRITERIA (QUALITATIVE PORTION)**\n\nThe qualitative criteria that represent 1/3 of the \"target\" variable compensation are subject to four based on four CSR themes, including one theme linked to the Group's commitment to climate issues.\n\nThese indicators are as follows:\n\n- support for the continuation of Bolloré SE's story, particularly through the dissemination of its culture and the promotion of its values;\n- the company's commitment to a social policy that promotes gender equality at Compagnie de l'Odet;\n- the development of the company's CSR policy, in particular by continuing to immplement its FA Mayday project;\n- the company's commitment to climate issues through training and raising awareness of the issues involved in tackling global warming and reducing its carbon footprint.\n\nEach of these themes is assigned an identical coefficient to determine the level of achievement of the qualitative portion of variable compensation.\n\n# **COMPENSATION RELATED TO HIS PARTICIPATION IN THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS**\n\nThe Chairman and Chief Executive Officer receives, as do all directors, compensation based on participation in the Board of Directors. This compensation allocated to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer shall be distributed according to the same terms as the directors.\n\n# **OTHER BENEFITS OR COMPENSATION**\n\nWithin the framework of his duties, the corporate officer has a company car. The insurance, maintenance and fuel costs are covered by the company.\n\n{178}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **LONG-TERM COMPENSATION**\n\n# **OBJECTIVES OF THE LONG-TERM COMPENSATION POLICY**\n\nAt the meeting of March 4, 2021, the Board of Directors decided, taking into account strategic and organizational guidelines, to strengthen the compensation policy within the company in order to integrate long-term compensation mechanisms to foster the involvement and loyalty of managers.\n\nAs this compensation mechanism was particularly suited to the functions of senior executives, given their involvement and the level of responsibility\n\n# **SYSTEMS IMPLEMENTED**\n\nIn order to be able to implement this policy, the Board has the option, under the authorizations granted by the Combined General Meeting on May 26, 2021, to allocate free shares and options for share subscription (new shares of the company to be issued by way of a capital increase) or the purchase of shares (existing shares of the company) to employees and corporate officers, directors and members of the Supervisory Board of the company and associated companies.\n\nAs such, the Board of Directors has the right to grant corporate officers:\n\n# i) **performance shares.**\n\nThe total number of shares to be granted may not represent more than 2% of the share capital, and shares granted to corporate officers are limited to a sub-ceiling of 1%.\n\nThe allocation of shares to their beneficiaries will be final at the end of a vesting period of two years, which is then not subject to any holding period. ii) **share subscription or purchase options.**\n\nThe maximum number of options that may be granted by the Board of Directors shall not give the right to subscribe or acquire a number of shares attached to their duties, the Board wanted to include a long-term component in the overall compensation of its senior executives that would serve the interests of all stakeholders, including the shareholders, and considered that it would be appropriate to have several long-term compensation mechanisms in order to mix them or choose the most appropriate depending on the circumstances, where applicable.\n\nrepresenting more than 2% of the share capital, and shares granted to corporate officers are limited to a sub-ceiling of 1%.\n\nThe subscription price or the acquisition price by the beneficiaries will be set by the Board of Directors as follows, it being specified that no discount will be applied when the share options are allocated:\n\n- for the subscription options, the price of the share subscription shall be determined on the day on which the options are granted, and shall not be lower than the average opening price of the company's shares listed on the regulated market Euronext Paris, or on any other market used as a substitute, during the twenty trading days preceding the allocation date;\n- in terms of the purchase options, the purchase price of the existing shares shall be determined on the day on which the options are granted, and shall not be lower than the value indicated above or the average purchase price of the shares held by the company pursuant to articles L. 225-208 and L. 22-10-62 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce).*\n\nThe duration of the exercise period of options granted, as approved by the Board, may not exceed four (4) years from the date they are allocated.\n\n# **PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS**\n\nFree shares and share subscription or purchase options allocated to the corporate officer will be subject in their entirety to performance conditions determined by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Appointments and Compensation Committee.\n\n# **ATTENDANCE CONDITIONS**\n\nThe vesting of the performance shares and the exercise of share subscription or purchase options is subject to the condition of the corporate officer's presence in the Group as of the vesting date and the date of exercise of the options.\n\n# **HOLDING REQUIREMENT**\n\nCorporate officers must hold a portion of the shares so granted or vested in registered form until they leave their position. The proportion will be set by the Board of Directors upon delegation.\n\nThe draft resolution concerning the compensation policy of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to be submitted to the shareholders' vote at the Combined General Meeting of June 14, 2024 is as follows:\n\n# \"THIRTEENTH RESOLUTION\n\n#### **(Approval of the compensation policy for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer established by the Board of Directors – ex ante say on pay)**\n\nThe General Shareholders' Meeting, acting under the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings, having reviewed the report on the company's corporate governance referred to by article L. 225-37 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)* describing the components of the compensation policy for corporate officers, approves, pursuant to article L. 22-10-8 II of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* the compensation policy for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as it appears in the universal registration document.\"\n\n# **2.1.4. WITH REGARD TO THE COMPENSATION OF THE DEPUTY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER**\n\nThe compensation policy for the Deputy Chief Executive Officer is as follows:\n\n# **FIXED COMPENSATION**\n\nOn March 14, 2024, the Board of Directors decided to renew the fixed compensation allocated to Sébastien Bolloré, in his capacity as Deputy Chief Executive Officer, at an annual gross amount of 900,000 euros for the current financial year and for subsequent financial years, until a new decision by the Board. In addition, entertainment, travel, hospitality and security costs related to the performance of their duties may be reimbursed if supporting documents are provided or paid directly if invoices are provided.\n\n{179}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **VARIABLE COMPENSATION**\n\nThe annual variable compensation of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer represents one hundred percent (100%) of the fixed component if the objectives are met one hundred percent (100%).\n\nAnnual variable compensation is based on the achievement of quantifiable objectives and qualitative objectives. These two types of objectives, set at the beginning of each period in question, are communicated to the Deputy Chief Executive Officer and account for 2/3 and 1/3 of variable compensation, respectively. The Board of Directors meeting of March 14, 2024, on the proposal of the Appointments and Compensation Committee, decided that the structure of the variable compensation of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer will continue to be aligned with that set for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The performance criteria for the variable portion of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer's compensation are as follows:\n\n# **WITH REGARD TO VARIABLE COMPENSATION CRITERIA (QUANTIFIABLE PORTION)**\n\nThe quantifiable financial criteria relate to i) the value of Compagnie de l'Odet's portfolio, both in terms of its own performance and that which is attributable to changes in the SBF 120 index, and ii) Group EBITA, each of which accounts for 1/3 of the \"target\" variable compensation.\n\n# **WITH REGARD TO VARIABLE COMPENSATION CRITERIA (QUALITATIVE PORTION)**\n\nThe qualitative criteria that represent 1/3 of the \"target\" variable compensation are subject to four indicators based on the following themes:\n\n- support for the continuation of Bolloré SE's story, particularly through the dissemination of its culture and the promotion of its values;\n- the company's commitment to a social policy that promotes gender equality at Compagnie de l'Odet;\n- the development of the company's CSR policy, in particular by continuing to immplement its FA Mayday project;\n- the company's commitment to climate issues through training and raising awareness of the issues involved in tackling global warming and reducing its carbon footprint.\n\nEach of these themes is assigned an identical coefficient to determine the level of achievement of the qualitative portion of variable compensation.\n\n# **COMPENSATION RELATED TO HIS PARTICIPATION IN THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS**\n\nThe Deputy Chief Executive Officer receives, as do all directors, compensation based on participation in the Board of Directors.

As in 2023, net commitments given remained at over 2 billion euros (see note 7.2 – Assets and contractual obligations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements) and mainly concern Groupe Canal+.\n\nIn Industry, the Group is continuing its R&D efforts in batteries and in the modernization of the equipment used in its Films businesses.\n\n# **1.3.3. PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURE**\n\n<span id=\"page-199-0\"></span>The Group has made future commitments due in more than one year in the framework of content assets which are detailed in note 7.2 – Assets and contractual content obligations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. These total more than 3.7 billion euros.\n\nIt intends to continue to grow by investing in all the sectors in which it operates.\n\n# <span id=\"page-199-1\"></span>**2. Research and development, patents and licenses**\n\n# **2.1. Research and development**\n\nFor many years, the Group has been committed to finding new activities. Research and development (R&D) is an essential element of the Group's industrial branch. This was demonstrated by the creation of the Blue Solutions division in October 2013.\n\nFor Group (excluding Vivendi), the R&D budget (including the subsidiary Blue Solutions) increased by 19.1% from 2022 to 2023, driven in particular by the R&D efforts of Blue Solutions. This confirms the Group's commitment to continue investing in R&D and, more specifically, to focus its R&D efforts on the next generations of all-solid batteries, which are experiencing very strong growth.\n\nFor Blue Solutions, the total amount of R&D spent on batteries was 23 million euros, with 11.6 million euros for Blue Solutions (formerly Batscap in Quimper) and 11.4 million euros for Blue Solutions Canada (formerly Bathium in Canada), including 1.8 million euros for its subsidiary Capacitor Sciences Inc. On the R&D side, efforts in 2023 were focused on the search for a new high potential electrolyte (known as Gen4) that can operate at ambient temperature, allowing access to the automotive market, particularly passenger cars, and offering rapid charging solutions for these vehicles. The Canadian and French teams are working in close collaboration on this project. The work covers the electrolyte as well as cathode materials (LMFP, NMC) and lithium thinning. These aspects are the keys that will enable Blue Solutions to offer its customers a battery cell with a density at least 40% higher than the best Li-ion batteries currently on the market.\n\nFor Capacitor Sciences Inc., in 2023, research efforts once again focused on improving the synthesis of new polymers intended to be introduced as a base element for the future high potential electrolyte with high conductivity at ambient temperature for the Gen4 project.\n\nFor Bluebus, R&D spending amounted to 2.6 million euros, focused on the optimization of thermal comfort and safety aspects of the vehicle.\n\nFor Bolloré Innovative Thin Films, R&D expenditure totaled 0.8 million euros. Its R&D efforts focused on the development of innovative solutions for food films and the launch of circular versions for packaging, and on the study of ultra-thin dielectric films or UTF (Ultra Thin Films) for capacitors intended for electric vehicles.\n\nIn 2023, IER continued to invest in the development of new products. A total of 1.2 million euros was invested in the optimization of identification and localization technologies (RFID, IoT, barcode, Wirepas, etc.) to enable intervention at all stages of the supply chain and to respond to the problems of various companies, and 0.6 million euros in the optimization of solutions for the electronic processing of fines, post-parking fees and other road-related penalties. IER also invested 4.8 million euros in the software and hardware optimization and development of innovative solutions for passenger processing in public transit stations and airports. Automatic Systems invested 5.6 million euros developing new products and optimizing existing products. At Vivendi, research and development efforts are detailed on pages 42, 46, 48, 50, 53, 59, 62, 65 of Vivendi's 2023 universal registration document.\n\n{200}------------------------------------------------\n\n| (in millions of euros)             | Change<br>2023-2022 | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2018  | 2017  |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------|------|------|------|------|------|-------|-------|\n| Bolloré Films                      | 0                   | 0.8  | 0.8  | 0.7  | 0.6  | 0.6  | 0.6   | 0.6   |\n| Blue Solutions (France and Canada) | 47.2%               | 21.2 | 14.4 | 9.4  | 10   | 16   | 20.1  | 19.7  |\n| Capacitor Sciences Inc.            | 0                   | 1.8  | 1.8  | 1.4  | 1.6  | 3.1  | 4.3   | 7.5   |\n| Bluecar                            | 0                   | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 19.3 | 27.2  | 28.6  |\n| Bluestorage                        | -100%               | 0    | 0.8  | 1.5  | 2    | 2.5  | 10.6  | 13.7  |\n| Bluetram/Blueboat                  | 0                   | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0    | 0.4   | 0.8   |\n| Bluebus                            | 8.3%                | 2.6  | 2.4  | 5.4  | 6.4  | 7.1  | 13.5  | 19.9  |\n| IER(1)                             | 2.5%                | 12.2 | 11.9 | 11.8 | 11.9 | 9    | 9.8   | 10.6  |\n| Bolloré Telecom                    | -100%               | 0    | 0.5  | 3    | 11   | 19.2 | 19.2  | 19.6  |\n| TOTAL                              | 19.1%               | 38.6 | 32.6 | 33.2 | 43.5 | 76.8 | 105.7 | 121.0 |\n\n# **RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS**\n\n<span id=\"page-200-0\"></span>(1) Including Automatic Systems (5.6 million euros in 2023).\n\n# **2.2. Patents and licenses**\n\nThe Group's patent portfolio was stable between 2022 and 2023 (with a decrease of 5.8%), mainly due to the end of the protection period for some of the patent families for Blue Solutions Canada, the resumption of new filings for Blue Solutions France and Canada, and the streamlining of the Bluecarsharing portfolio.\n\nIn addition, the in-depth review of the Blue Solutions portfolio continued with the primary goal of maintaining a substantially constant portfolio of holdings with a strong legal scope and/or relevant geographical scope. This streamlining results from the Group's desire to optimize its expenditure on the management of its patent portfolios and to simultaneously increase its number of patent filings in order to build a portfolio of key intangible assets related to new developments for the new generation of Gen4 batteries (with a view to licensing its most promising technologies, mainly in the areas of batteries, buses and stationary applications). Blue Solutions' overall portfolio (France and Canada) was stable with a very slight decline of 4.3%.\n\n|                            | Patents filed in 2023 |                    | Total portfolio in effect |                      |                  |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|------------------|\n|                            | Total                 | Of which in France | 2023 (all countries)      | 2022 (all countries) | Change 2023-2022 |\n| Bolloré Films              | 0                     | 0                  | 9                         | 9                    | 0%               |\n| Blue Solutions             | 35                    | 2                  | 294                       | 257                  | 14.4%            |\n| Blue Solutions Canada Inc. | 17(2)                 | 2(1)               | 302(3)                    | 366(3)               | -17.5%           |\n| IER                        | 0                     | 0                  | 13                        | 17                   | -23.5%           |\n| Bluecarsharing             | 0                     | 0                  | 17                        | 26                   | -34.6%           |\n| Bluebus                    | 5                     | 0                  | 57                        | 60                   | -5%              |\n| Automatic Systems          | 0                     | 0                  | 4                         | 4                    | 0%               |\n| TOTAL                      | 57                    | 4                  | 696                       | 739                  | -5.8%            |\n\n(1) For Blue Solutions Canada, the United States saw the greatest number of filings, and not France.

Inflows related to the disposal of minority interests related to the sale of shares in Vivendi by Compagnie de Cornouaille for +177.2 million euros.\n\n# Impact of reclassification of discontinued operations and assets held for sale\n\nIn 2023, –122.5 million euros of the change corresponds to the reclassification of the net cash of Bolloré Logistics, which was the subject of a put option granted by the CMA CGM group on May 8, 2023 and which was actually disposed of on February 29, 2024, to assets and liabilities held for sale (see note 1 – Highlights), while –84.6 million euros corresponds to disbursements relating to the sale of Bolloré Africa Logistics in 2022 and –111.0 million euros corresponds to items relating to discontinued operations and assets held for sale at Vivendi (in particular relating to Editis).\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **5.1.5.

possibility of splitting Vivendi into several entities, each of which would be listed on the stock market, and structured around Groupe Canal+, Havas, a company combining publishing and distribution assets through the majority stake in the Lagardère group and the 100% stake in Prisma Media, and a company holding listed and unlisted financial interests in the culture, media and entertainment sectors.\n\nBy way of reminder, if Vivendi's Supervisory Board authorizes the Management Board to go ahead with the project, a number of important steps will have to be taken. These include consultation with the employee representative bodies of the entities concerned, before which no decision in principle may be taken, obtaining the necessary regulatory authorizations, the required approvals from the Vivendi group's creditors and the consent of Vivendi's shareholders at a General Meeting. As indicated in Vivendi's press release on December 13, 2023, such a transaction would take between twelve and eighteen months to complete.\n\nAccordingly, Vivendi may need to restructure its debt, and new financing may need to be arrangements. The availability of sufficient funding is one of the conditions for the proposed split, the feasibility of which is under review.\n\n# **COMBINATION WITH LAGARDÈRE**\n\n# Vivendi's investment in Lagardère\n\nBy way of reminder, as at December 31, 2022, Vivendi held 81,380,480 shares in Lagardère, representing 57.66% of Lagardère's share capital and 48.35% of the voting rights in Lagardère at that date.

OUTLOOK FOR THE GROUP IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT**\n\nThe Group remains vigilant about the current and potential consequences of the macroeconomic uncertainties, but remains confident about the resilience of its main business lines.\n\nThe uncertainties linked to the various ongoing global conflicts have had a significant impact on financial markets and raw material prices and has affected the global economy as a whole. The Group cannot accurately assess all the indirect consequences of these crises, but is constantly adapting to demonstrate resilience and ensure the continuity of its activities.\n\nIn 2023, the Group's cash position fell by –2,616 million euros, from a net cash position of +709 million euros as at December 31, 2022 to a net financial debt of –1,907 million euros as at December 31, 2023. This was mainly due to the full consolidation of Lagardère with effect from December 1, 2023 (see note 1 – Highlights) but also due to cash flows from ongoing activities, which amounted to 1,401 million euros. At the end of December 2023, the Group also had 8,259 million euros in confirmed and unused credit lines.\n\n{215}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-215-0\"></span>**NOTE 3.

CONSOLIDATION SCOPE**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\n# **• Consolidation scope**\n\nCompanies over which the Group exercises exclusive control are fully consolidated.\n\nGenerally, the control exercised by the Group is materialized by the holding of at least 50% of the capital and voting rights of the companies involved. However, in some cases, and in accordance with the criteria addressed by IFRS 10, the Group may consider that it controls entities in which it holds less than 50% of the capital and voting rights.\n\nIn the first half of 2023, Compagnie de Cornouaille sold 18.6 million shares in Vivendi SE, reducing the Group's percentage control over Vivendi SE to 30.04% as at December 31, 2023 (excluding treasury shares). This change in the Group's shareholding in Vivendi over the fiscal year does not call into question its role as the sole reference shareholder or the analysis of other facts and circumstances, allowing the Group to consider that its position of control over Vivendi, which began initiated on April 25, 2017 continues.\n\nThose companies on which the Group has a considerable influence are consolidated by the equity method.\n\nCompanies over which the Group has joint control by virtue of a contractual agreement with other shareholders are analyzed, whatever the percentage held, in order to define whether they are \"joint ventures\" or \"joint operations\" pursuant to the criteria defined by IFRS 11. \"Joint ventures\" are consolidated by the equity method, whereas \"joint operations\" are accounted for, where applicable, at the level of the control directly held over the partnership's assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Group did not identify any joint operations as at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Group assesses, on a case-by-case basis in respect of each shareholding, all of the details enabling the type of control exercised by it to be characterized and reviews this assessment if there are changes affecting governance or if facts and circumstances indicate a change in control exercised by the Group.\n\nPotential voting rights held in consolidated entities are analyzed on a caseby-case basis. In accordance with IFRS 10 \"Consolidated financial statements\", only the potential voting rights conferring, either alone or by virtue of other facts and circumstances, substantial rights over the entity are taken into account for the assessment of control. The Group then analyzes whether these potential rights enable it to have immediate access to the variable returns on the investment and then takes account of the holding resulting there from when calculating percentage interests. This is the case, for example, if there are reciprocal purchase or sale options that can be exercised at a fixed price and on the same date.\n\nCompanies that are of no significance either individually or collectively in relation to the consolidated financial statements are excluded from the consolidation scope. Their materiality is assessed before the end of each fiscal year.\n\n# **• Translation of the financial statements of non-French companies**\n\nThe financial statements of non-French companies whose operating currency is not the same as that in which the Group's consolidated financial statements are presented (euros), and which are not suffering hyperinflation, have been translated according to the \"closing date exchange rate\" method. Their balance-sheet items are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the close of the fiscal period, and profit and loss items at the average rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded under foreign currency translation adjustments in the consolidated reserves.\n\nGoodwill relating to non-French companies is regarded as part of the assets and liabilities acquired and accordingly translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the closing date.\n\n# **• Transactions in foreign currencies**\n\nForeign currency transactions are initially recognized in the entity's functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate for the entity's functional currency prevailing at the closing date. All differences are recorded in the net income for the period, with the exception of differences on borrowings in foreign currencies that are hedges of net investment in a foreign entity. These are directly charged to other income and expenses recognized directly in equity as long as the net investment is held.\n\n## **• Business combinations**\n\nAs at January 1, 2010, the Group has applied the provisions of the revised IFRS 3 \"Business combinations\".\n\nCombinations initiated after January 1, 2004 but before January 1, 2010 are entered in the accounts in accordance with the former version of IFRS 3. Goodwill is equal to the difference between:\n\n- the sum of:\n\t- the consideration transferred, i.e. the acquisition cost excluding acquisition fees and including the fair value of any earn-out payment,\n\t- the fair value on the date control is taken of minority interests in the case of partial acquisition for which the full-goodwill option is chosen,\n\t- the fair value of the interest previously held, where applicable;\n\n{218}------------------------------------------------\n\n- and the sum of:\n- the share of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities of the entity acquired on the date control is taken relative to controlling interests (including, where applicable, previously held interests),\n- the share relating to minority interests if the full-goodwill option is retained.\n\nOn the acquisition date, the assets, liabilities and identifiable potential liabilities of the entity acquired are individually assessed at their fair value, whatever their intended purpose. The analyses and expert assessments required for the initial valuation of these items must be completed within twelve months of the acquisition date. An interim valuation is given if financial statements must be established during this period.\n\nIntangible assets are entered separately from goodwill if they can be separately identified, i.e. if they arise from a legal or contractual right or are separable from the activities of the entity acquired and are expected to yield a financial return in the future.\n\nAcquisition fees are recognized in the income statement, as is any change outside the period for the allocation of items included in the calculation of goodwill.\n\n<span id=\"page-218-0\"></span>If a controlling interest is gained through successive acquisitions, the share previously owned is remeasured at fair value on the date the controlling interest is acquired as a debit or credit to income.\n\n# **5.1. CHANGES IN THE CONSOLIDATION SCOPE IN 2023 AND 2022**\n\n# 5.1.1. Changes in consolidation scope in the 2023 fiscal year\n\n# **• First consolidation in the Bolloré Energy sector**\n\nOn July 11, 2023, the Group finalized the purchase of 100% of the shares in Sicarbu Ouest, a subsidiary of the Eureden cooperative specializing in the distribution of petroleum products. The agreement for the acquisition of Sicarbu Ouest was signed on April 28 but remained subject to approval from the French Competition Authority, which has since been obtained without reservation.\n\n# **• First consolidations in the Communications sector**\n\nOn June 21, 2023, Groupe Canal+ and PCCW Limited announced that they had entered into a strategic partnership to accelerate the development of Viu, Asia's leading streaming platform. As a result of the transaction, Groupe Canal+ has become a significant minority shareholder in Viu thanks to a staggered investment of 300 million US dollars, including an initial payment of 200 million US dollars (186 million euros) that enabled Groupe Canal+ to acquire a 27.32% stake in Viu. Groupe Canal+ exercises significant influence over Viu, which is accounted for using the equity method as from June 21, 2023. On February 26, 2024, Groupe Canal+ announced that it held 30% of Viu's share capital. Groupe Canal+ holds a call option to increase its stake in Viu to 51%.\n\nHavas continued its policy of making targeted acquisitions with ten new agencies joining the Group in 2023. Havas thus continued to grow in strategic geographical areas (HRZN and Eprofessional in Germany, Pivot Roots and PR Pundit in India, Noise in Canada, and Uncommon in the United Kingdom) and in specific business lines: Australian Public Affairs in Australia, Cunha Vaz & Associados in Portugal and Klareco in Singapore strengthened the international H/Advisors network.\n\nIn July 2023, Prisma Media acquired a majority interest in MilK, a publisher of high-end decoration and fashion magazines. On November 30, 2023, Prisma Media acquired the Côté Maison group, a publisher specializing in high-end interior decoration.\n\n# **• Change in consolidation method in the Communications sector**\n\nThe Group has fully consolidated Lagardère since December 1, 2023 (see note 1 – Highlights). Before November 30, 2023, the Group accounted for Lagardère using the equity method. As at December 31, 2023, taking into account the exercise of disposal rights since November 30, 2023, the Group held 84,399,064 Lagardère shares, representing 59.80% of the capital and 50.62% of the voting rights. At that date, 27,683,985 million transfer rights were exercisable, representing a financial commitment of 667 million euros on 19.62% of Lagardère's share capital, recognized in the balance sheet as a financial liability.\n\n# **• Deconsolidation in the Communications sector**\n\nOn June 21, 2023, the date on which the European Commission approved the administrator and its engagement contract, Vivendi transferred the power to govern Editis's operational and financial policies to the administrator, The Group assesses, on a case-by-case basis with respect to each partial acquisition, whether to choose the full-goodwill option (goodwill including the share attributable to minority interests).\n\nThe Group enters the effects of business combinations under \"Other financial income (expenses)\".\n\n# **• Accounting for changes in consolidated ownership interests without loss of control**\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 10, in the event of the acquisition or disposal of securities in an entity controlled by the Group not resulting in a change in control, the entity recognizes the difference between the adjustment of the value of non-controlling interests and the fair value of the consideration paid or received directly in equity, Group share.\n\n## **• Loss of control**\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 10, the Group recognizes in the income statement, on the date of the loss of control, the difference between:\n\n- the sum of:\n- the fair value of the consideration received,\n- the fair value of any interests retained;\n- and the book value of these items.\n\nThe Group includes the effect of losses of control in \"Other financial income (expenses)\".\n\nby withdrawing from the direct management of Editis and by giving the administrator the power to exercise its voting rights over 100% of Editis's share capital. As at that date, in accordance with IFRS 10, the Group ceased to consolidate Editis. By way of reminder, since December 31, 2022, under IFRS 5 \"Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations\", Editis has been presented as held for sale.

Work on determining the fair value of assets and liabilities were finalized within the one-year period permitted under the standard.\n\n• Vivendi committed to gradually sell on the market over a five-year period all of its stake in Mediaset (renamed MediaForEurope on November 25, 2021) held by Simon Fiduciaria SpA.

BUSINESS DATA**\n\n# **6.1. REVENUE**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nIncome from ordinary activities is recognized as revenue when the performance obligation promised in the contract is fulfilled for an amount that is highly unlikely to be revised down significantly. Revenue is presented net of discounts granted.\n\nContracts are analyzed in accordance with IFRS 15 \"Revenue from contracts with customers\". The Group uses the practical expedient (since its contracts mainly have short cycles) allowing it not to present its order book in the notes to the financial statements (IFRS 15.122).\n\n# **Analysis of the agent/principal relationship in sales transactions involving a third party**\n\nIf the entity's promise is by its nature an obligation to provide the specified goods or services itself, then it is acting on its own behalf and is \"principal\" in the sale transaction. As such, the gross amount of the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods or services provided is recognized in revenue, and the commission paid to the third party is recognized in cost of sales. If the entity makes the necessary arrangements for the third party to provide the specified goods or services, it is acting as an \"agent\" and it then recognizes the net amount of the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods or services provided in revenue.\n\n{221}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe table below shows the specific characteristics of each sector associated with the entry of income from ordinary activities in the financial statements:\n\n| Sector                                           | Business line                                                                                                                                        | Recognition of revenue                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Bolloré Energy                                   | Distribution of oil<br>products                                                                                                                      | Revenue includes specific taxes on oil products included in sale prices.

INFORMATION ON OPERATING SEGMENTS**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nUnder the provisions of IFRS 8 \"Operating segments\", the operating segments used for segment disclosures are those used in internal Group reporting, as reviewed by Executive management (the Group's main operational decision maker), and reflect the Group's organization, which is based on business lines. The operating segments used are as follows:\n\n- Bolloré Energy: refers to the distribution and warehousing of oil products in Europe;\n- Communications: includes the publishing and distribution of pay and free TV and production, the sale and distribution of cinema films and TV series, the design and release of downloadable video games on mobile devices and consoles, ticketing and venue services, communications consulting and advertising agencies, magazine sales, sales of goods and circulation of publications, travel retail sales, sales of licenses and subscription services. The Group's equity-accounted shareholding in UMG is also included in this segment;\n- Industry: includes the production and sale of electric batteries and their applications: electric vehicles, electricity storage and solutions and films.\n\nOther activities mainly concern holding companies.\n\nThe breakdown of segment information by geographic area is as follows: • France, including overseas departments, regions and local authorities;\n\n- Europe excluding France ;\n- Africa ;\n- Asia-Pacific ;\n- Americas.\n\nTransactions between different segments are conducted under market conditions.\n\nNo single individual client represents more than 10% of the Group's revenue. The Group considers adjusted operating income (EBITA), a non-GAAP measure, as a measure of the performance of the operating segments presented in segment reporting. This indicator makes it possible to compare the performance of the operating segments, whether their activity results from internal growth in the operating segment or from acquisitions. In the Travel Retail business, the fees paid to the grantors or concessions are either variable, fixed or variable with a guaranteed minimum. The application of IFRS 16 to these contracts creates a distortion in the figures on the segment's performance since it only applies to the fixed portion of the rent, disconnecting the financial statements from the operational monitoring. In order to maintain a relevant indicator that reflects the economics of these contracts, the Group has decided to neutralize the effect of IFRS 16 on EBITA for concession agreements only.\n\n{222}------------------------------------------------\n\nTo calculate adjusted operating income (EBITA), the accounting impact of the following items is eliminated from operating income as reflected in the Group's financial statements:\n\n- the amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations and other rights catalogs acquired by our content production businesses;\n- goodwill impairment, other intangible assets related to business combinations and other rights catalogs acquired by our content production businesses;\n- other income/expenses related to transactions with shareholders (except when these are recognized directly in equity);\n- items related to concession agreements (IFRS 16): excluding gains or losses on leases and depreciation of right-of-use assets, including decreases in lease liabilities, interest paid on lease liabilities and changes in working capital relating to lease liabilities.\n\nWhen companies under significant influence have an operating nature in line with the Group's activities, the share of net income from companies accounted for using the equity method is classified in adjusted operating income.\n\nAdjusted operating income (EBITA) must be considered as additional information that cannot replace any measurement of the Group's operating and financial performance of a strictly accounting nature as presented in the consolidated financial statements and their notes. The Group considers that this is a relevant indicator of the Group's operational and financial performance.\n\nAdjusted operating income (EBITA) for each segment is the main indicator used by Executive management to assess the performance of the various segments and allocate resources to them.\n\nThe accounting and valuation methods used in internal reporting are identical to those used to draw up the consolidated financial statements, with the exception of the allocation of trademark and Group fees.\n\nRevenue and investments are also regularly monitored by Executive management.\n\nInformation on depreciation, amortization and provision expenses is provided to show the reader the main non-cash items of operating income but is not included in internal reporting.\n\n# 6.2.1.

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nTrade and other receivables are current financial assets (see note 8.3 – Other financial assets) initially recorded at their fair value, which generally corresponds to their par value, unless the effect of discounting is significant. At each year end, receivables are valued at amortized cost, after deducting any impairment losses due to collection risk.\n\nThe Group assesses the expected credit losses associated with its financial assets carried at amortized cost on a prospective basis. To assess the provision for expected credit losses on its original financial assets, the Group takes into account the probability of default at the date of initial recognition. Subsequently, provisions for expected credit losses on financial assets are revalued based on change in the credit risk of the asset during each fiscal year.\n\nTo assess whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk, the Group compares the default risk on the asset at the closing date with the credit risk at the date of initial recognition, based on reasonable forwardlooking information and events, credit ratings where available, and material or anticipated material adverse changes in the economic, financial or business environment that may result in a material change in the borrower's ability to meet its obligations. The notion of default and the full impairment policy are defined specifically within each operating entity.\n\nReceivables sold to third parties through receivable factoring contracts are recorded under \"trade receivables\" if their associated risks and benefits essentially remain with the Group, financial debts and loans being increased accordingly.\n\n|                                                 | 12/31/2023  |            |           | 12/31/2022  |            |           |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|-----------|-------------|------------|-----------|\n| (in millions of euros)                          | Gross value | Provisions | Net value | Gross value | Provisions | Net value |\n| Trade accounts receivable                       | 5,295.0     | (316.3)    | 4,978.7   | 5,259.4     | (222.3)    | 5,037.1   |\n| Operating receivables – tax and social security | 240.4       | (16.1)     | 224.3     | 156.6       | (16.6)     | 140.0     |\n| Other operating receivables                     | 1,598.5     | (209.6)    | 1,388.8   | 1,622.7     | (199.3)    | 1,423.4   |\n| TOTAL                                           | 7,133.9     | (542.0)    | 6,591.9   | 7,038.7     | (438.2)    | 6,600.5   |\n\n{225}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 6.6.1.

LEASES**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nThe Group elected to apply IFRS 16 retrospectively as at January 1, 2019, without restating the comparative periods in the financial statements.\n\nThe amount of lease liabilities relating to leases arising from business combinations after January 1, 2019 is measured at the present value of the remaining fixed and minimum guaranteed lease payments, in accordance with IFRS 16, as if the leases acquired were new leases on the date control is acquired. The amount of the rights of use is measured at the amount of the lease liabilities, adjusted to reflect the favorable or unfavorable nature of the lease terms compared with market terms.\n\nAs intellectual property licenses granted by a lessor and rights held by a lessee under licensing agreements are excluded from the scope of IFRS 16, and Groupe Canal+'s commercial contracts for the provision of satellite capacity are generally commercial service agreements for which contract costs are expensed as operational costs for the period, the Group's main leases comprise Lagardère's concession agreements in transport hubs and hospitals and property leases for which the Group is the lessee.\n\nThe Group also subleases retail or office space and acts as lessor. Where the subleases cover substantially all the risks and rewards of the main lease, they are accounted for as finance sub-eases. As a consequence, the right of use under the main lease is not recognized and a financial receivable is recognized.\n\nAll other subleases are classified as operating subleases. The associated sublease income is recognized directly in operating income.\n\nOn the consolidated balance sheet, lease-related right-of-use assets are presented in property, plant and equipment or other intangible assets according to the asset they target. Lease liabilities are recorded in other current or non-current liabilities according to their maturity. They are not included in the Group's financial debt.\n\n# **• Specialterms of concession agreements in Lagardère's Travel Retail business**\n\nAs part of its day-to-day operations, Lagardère Travel Retail enters into agreements with grantors of concessions (airports, stations, hospitals, etc.). These agreements grant the concession operator access to certain passenger flows and to the resulting revenue, in return for the payment of fees for the provision of retail space and the right to operate. These fees may be either fixed, variable or variable subject to a guaranteed minimum. They can be renegotiated with the grantor in the event of changes in the economic conditions applicable to the agreement or changes in law.\n\nThe formulas used to calculate the variable fees are generally based on a percentage of revenue achieved by product category, and/or on changes in passenger flows, and/or on changes in various external indices, including inflation.\n\nThe guaranteed minimum may be set out in the agreement, and/or calculated based on a minimum percentage of the previous year's fees, which may include a minimum amount. It is then considered to be a fixed payment in substance, because even if contains a variable component, it is unavoidable.\n\n# **• Measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability**\n\nLeases under which the Group is the lessee are recognized on the effective date of each lease and result in the recognition on the balance sheet of a lease liability equal to the present value of the fixed lease payments and the guaranteed minimum amounts under the Travel Retail concession agreements, in exchange for a right-of-use asset in respect of the leased assets.\n\nLease-related right-of-use assets are recorded at cost on the effective date of the lease. The cost of the right-of-use asset includes:\n\n- the amount of the associated lease liability;\n- initial direct costs (marginal costs of obtaining the lease);\n- payments made before the start of the lease after deduction of the incentives received;\n- decommissioning and restoration costs (recognized and assessed in accordance with IAS 37);\n\nThe right-of-use asset is then depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease term, as determined in accordance with IFRS 16.\n\nAfter initial recognition, the amount of the liability is:\n\n• increased by the accretion effect (interest expenses on lease liabilities);\n\n- reduced by the rent payments made;\n- remeasured in the event of modification of the lease.\n\nThe term of the lease corresponds to the time for which the lease is noncancellable, taking into account any extension option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise and any termination option that the Group is reasonably certain not to exercise. This period is assessed by the lessees, lease by lease, and is revised on the occurrence of a significant event or a change in circumstances under the entity's control.\n\nFor concession agreements, the term is fixed by the grantor of the concession. The lessee does not generally have the ability to extend the term of the concession. Similarly, most concessions are extended through a tender process.\n\nIFRS 16 requires the discount rate for each contract to be determined by reference to the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee entity. In practice, given the organization of the Group's financing, the incremental borrowing rates are based on the swap rate curve of the currency of the contract plus the financing component, carried or guaranteed almost exclusively by Bolloré SE or Vivendi SE, depending on which entity holds the contract. The rate applied to each lease takes into account the lease payment profile.\n\n# **• Lease amendments and revaluations**\n\nIn the event of a reduction in the lease term or in the surface area leased, the right-of-use asset and lease liability are reduced accordingly in line with the percentage decrease, with a corresponding gain or loss as a result of the amendment of the lease recognized in the income statement. The residual lease liability is then adjusted against the right-of-use asset, after discounting at the new rate on the date of the amendment.\n\nIncreases in the lease term or surface area do not generate gains or losses on lease amendments, but rather result in a revaluation of the lease liability using the new discount rate on the date of the amendment, in exchange for an adjustment of the right-of-use asset.\n\n{228}------------------------------------------------\n\nChanges in the amount of the rent, provided for in the lease, without any adjustment of the surface area or term, will result in a revaluation of the lease liability without any revision of the discount rate in exchange for an adjustment of the right-of-use asset.\n\n# 6.11.1. Expense on lease liabilities\n\nThe expense on lease obligations recorded in profit and loss stood at 206.0 million euros as at December 31, 2023 (179.8 million euros as at December 31, 2022 restated, see note 4 – Comparability of financial statements).\n\n# 6.11.2. Lease-related right-of-use assets\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, net total lease-related right-of-use assets stood at 2,943.3 million euros (823.8 million euros at December 31, 2022) after deduction of accumulated depreciation in the amount of 788.7 million euros as at December 31, 2023 (815.0 million euros as at December 31, 2022). These rights of use mainly relate to concession agreements and real estate leases. Following the takeover of Lagardère by Vivendi on November 21, 2023, Lagardère has been fully consolidated in Vivendi's consolidated financial statements since December 1, 2023. The impacts of the leases were determined as if the leases acquired were new leases on the date on which control was acquired:\n\n- the lease liabilities are measured at the present value, using the discount rate in force on that date, of the remaining fixed and guaranteed minimum lease payments;\n- the amount of the rights of use is measured at the amount of the lease liabilities, adjusted to reflect the favorable or unfavorable nature of the lease terms compared with market terms.\n\n|                                    | 12/31/2023  |              |           | 12/31/2022  |              |           |\n|------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|-----------|\n| (in millions of euros)             | Gross value | Depreciation | Net value | Gross value | Depreciation | Net value |\n| Right-of-use assets on concessions | 2,036.1     | (34.1)       | 2,002.0   | 2.1         | (0.5)        | 1.6       |\n| Right-of-use assets on PP&E        | 1,695.8     | (754.6)      | 941.3     | 1,636.8     | (814.6)      | 822.2     |\n| TOTAL                              | 3,732.0     | (788.7)      | 2,943.3   | 1,638.9     | (815.0)      | 823.8     |\n\n# *Change in right-of-use assets*\n\n| Net values<br>(in millions of euros) | At<br>12/31/2022 | Gross<br>acquisitions | NBV<br>of disposals | Net<br>allowances | Changes in<br>consolidation<br>scope(1) | Exchange<br>rate<br>fluctuations | Other<br>movements(2) | At<br>12/31/2023 |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|\n| Right-of-use assets on concessions   | 1.6              | 6.7                   | 0.0                 | (34.3)            | 2,022.3                                 | (2.2)                            | 7.9                   | 2,002.0          |\n| Right-of-use assets on PP&E          | 822.2            | 115.3                 | (3.1)               | (161.4)           | 394.5                                   | (6.3)                            | (220.0)               | 941.3            |\n| NET VALUES                           | 823.8            | 122.0                 | (3.1)               | (195.7)           | 2,416.8                                 | (8.5)                            | (212.1)               | 2,943.3          |\n\n(1) Mainly comprising Lagardère, consolidated from December 1, 2023 in Vivendi.\n\n(2) Mainly comprising the effects of the reclassification of Bolloré Logistics as an asset held for sale (see note 1 – Highlights).\n\n# 6.11.3.

FIXED ASSETS**\n\n# **7.1. GOODWILL**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nGoodwill on controlled companies is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet assets under \"Goodwill\". Goodwill is not amortized but subjected to an impairment test at least once a year and whenever there is an indication of impairment. When impairment is found, the difference between the asset's book value and its recoverable amount is recognized among operating expenses for the fiscal year. This goodwill impairment cannot be reversed. Negative goodwill (badwill) is charged directly to income for the year of\n\nacquisition. Intangible and tangible assets are tested for impairment under certain circumstances. In the case of non-current assets with indefinite lives (e.g., goodwill), a test is carried out at least once a year, as well as whenever there is an indication of impairment. For other non-current assets, a test is carried out only when there is an indication of impairment.\n\nAssets tested for impairment are grouped in cash-generating units (CGUs), each corresponding to a homogeneous set of assets whose use generates an identifiable cash flow. When a CGU's recoverable amount is less than its net book value, an impairment is recognized and charged as an operating expense. The CGU's recoverable amount is the market value (less selling costs) or its value in use, whichever is higher. The value in use is the discounted value of the foreseeable cash flow from the use of an asset or a CGU. The discount rate is calculated for each cash-generating unit in accordance with its geographic area and the risk profile of its business.\n\n# 7.1.1.

Definition and reorganization of CGUs\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, the Group had some 20 cash-generating units (CGUs) before the grouping of CGUs. The division of operations into CGUs is based on the particular features of each of the Group's business lines.\n\nThe principal CGUs or groups of CGUs are the following: \"Groupe Canal+\" (excluding Studiocanal), \"Lagardère\", \"Havas\" and \"Bolloré Energy\".\n\nThese business activities are described in note 6.2 – Information on the operating segments.\n\nThe goodwill relating to Vivendi is tested on the basis of the CGUs and CGUs combinations as defined in the Vivendi financial statements in the same way as the assets identified as part of the purchase price allocation (PPA).\n\n# 7.1.4. Recoverable amount based on value in use\n\nThe main assumptions used for the estimation of recoverable amount are:\n\n- the discount rate is determined by basing it on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of each CGU; it includes potential risks specific to each activity (business lines, markets and geographical areas); the rate selected was determined on the basis of information communicated by an outside consulting firm;\n- cash flows are calculated on the basis of operating budgets, then extrapolated by applying, up to the fifth year or for a specific longer period for some CGUs, based on plans approved by Management in advance\n\ncovering this longer period, a growth rate reflecting the growth potential of the relevant markets and management's judgment based on past experience.\n\nAfter the specified period, the terminal value is based on the perpetuity value of the cash flows, except for CGUs with finite cash flows.\n\nThese tests are carried out using an after-tax discount rate. The method adopted did not lead to a material difference with a calculation based on a pre-tax discount rate (test performed in accordance with IAS 36 BCZ 85).\n\nAt its meetings held on December 13, 2023 and January 30, 2024, Vivendi's Supervisory Board authorized the Management Board to review the possibility of splitting Vivendi into several entities, each of which would be listed on the stock market, and structured around Groupe Canal+, Havas, a company combining publishing and distribution assets through the majority stake in the Lagardère group and the 100% stake in Prisma Media, and an investment company holding listed and unlisted financial interests in the culture, media and entertainment sectors (see note 1 – Highlights).\n\nIn this context, without changing the valuation methods used each year, the Group reviewed the value of the goodwill allocated to its cash-generating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs, which are part of the Communications segment, by ensuring that the recoverable amount of the CGUs or groups of CGUs tested was at least equal to their net carrying amount as at December 31, 2023, including goodwill.\n\n{230}------------------------------------------------\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the test was carried out by the Group on each CGU or group of CGUs based on recoverable values determined internally or with the help of independent valuers. Following this review, and notwithstanding the current macroeconomic uncertainties (see note 2 – Outlook for the Group in light of the uncertainties related to the economic environment), the Group's Management concluded that the recoverable amount of each CGU or group of CGUs in the Communications segment that was tested was at least equal to its carrying amount as of December 31, 2023.\n\n- a 30% change in the recoverable amount of Havas would not result in an impairment loss; • given the recent nature of the acquisition of Prisma Media, the recoverable\n- amount of Prisma Media is considered to be equal to its carrying amount;\n- given the impairment of goodwill relating to Gameloft as at December 31, 2021, the recoverable amount of Gameloft is considered to be equal to its carrying amount;\n- lastly, no impairment test on goodwill relating to Lagardère was performed as at December 31, 2023 given that the takeover date (see note 1 – Highlights) was close to the end of the financial year.\n\nAccordingly, based on the recoverable amounts determined for each CGU or groups of CGUs as part of the goodwill impairment test as at December 31, 2023:\n\n• a 10% change in the recoverable amount of Groupe Canal+ would not result in an impairment loss;\n\nThe following table summarizes the assumptions used for the most significant tests on goodwill:\n\n| 2023<br>(in millions of euros)                      | Groupe Canal(1)                              | Havas        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Net book value of goodwill                          | 4,203.4                                      | 2,431.7      |\n| Other intangible items with indefinite useful lives | 1,709.4                                      | 397.6        |\n| Impairment losses recognized over the fiscal year   | (1.4)                                        | 0.0          |\n| Base used for recoverable amount                    | Comparable<br>(Value in use for Studiocanal) | Value in use |\n| Parameters of cash flow model used:                 |                                              |              |\n| – growth rate on terminal value                     | Comparable<br>(1.0% for Studiocanal)         | 2.25%        |\n\nNA: not applicable.\n\n(1) Canal+ Group's recoverable amount, excluding Studiocanal, was determined using multiple valuations, observed on stock markets or in recent mergers/acquisitions of about twenty similar companies, using financial parameters consistent with those of previous years, which are as follows: a multiple of EBITDA for pay-TV and a multiple of revenues for free-TV.

CONTENT ASSETS AND CONTRACTUAL CONTENT OBLIGATIONS**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nContent assets only concern the following Vivendi activities:\n\n# **• Groupe Canal+**\n\nRights to broadcast films, television programs and sporting events\n\nWhen contracts are signed for the acquisition of broadcasting rights of films, television programs and sporting events, the acquired rights are shown as contractual commitments. They are then entered in the balance sheet and classified among content assets under the following conditions:\n\n- the broadcasting rights of films and television programs are recognized at their acquisition cost when the program is available for its initial release, and are expensed in the period in which they are broadcast;\n- the rights to broadcast sporting events are recorded at their acquisition cost, at the start of the broadcasting period of the sports season concerned or as soon as the first significant payment is received, and are expensed in the period in which they are broadcast;\n- the consumption of broadcasting rights of films, television programs and sporting events is included in the cost of sales.\n\n# Films and television programs produced or acquired\n\n# for sale to third parties\n\nFilms and television programs produced or acquired prior to their first use with a view to being sold to third parties are recorded as content assets at their cost (mainly direct production costs and overheads) or at their acquisition cost. The cost of films and television programs is amortized and other related costs are expensed using the estimated revenue method (i.e. the ratio of the period's gross revenues to estimated total gross revenues from all sources on an individual production basis). Vivendi considers that amortization using the estimated revenue method reflects the rate at which the entity expects to consume the future economic benefits from the assets and that there is a strong correlation between income and the consumption of economic benefits from intangible assets.\n\nWhere applicable, estimated impairment losses are provisioned for their full amount in the profit or loss for the period, on an individual basis by product, at the time of estimation of these losses.\n\n#### Film and TV rights catalogs\n\nThe catalogs consist of second-run films acquired or transfers of films and television programs produced or acquired with a view to being sold to third parties after their first run (i.e. once first broadcast on a free broadband channel). They are recorded on the balance sheet at their acquisition or transfer cost, and are amortized respectively by group of films or individually according to the estimated revenue method.\n\n# **• Lagardère**\n\n# Copyright\n\nAdvances paid to authors (retainers, guaranteed advances, minimum guaranteed amounts) are recognized as intangible assets.\n\n# 7.2.1.

These are recognized as content assets when the program is available for initial broadcast or as soon as the first significant payment has been received. As at December 31, 2023, provisions were recognized on these commitments for 56 million euros (no change from December 31, 2022).\n\nThese amounts do not include commitments as to contracts for network broadcasting rights and non-exclusive network distribution for which Groupe Canal+ has not granted or obtained a guaranteed minimum. The variable amount of these commitments, which may not be reliably determined, is not recognized on the balance sheet and is not listed among commitments. It is recognized in income and expenses in the period in which the charge they are incurred. Based on an estimate of the future number of subscribers at Groupe Canal+,\n\nnet commitments received amounted to 75 million euros as at December 31, 2023, compared with 32 million euros in net commitments given as at December 31, 2022. These amounts include the distribution agreement signed with beIN Sports for the period from June 1, 2020 to May 31, 2025.\n\nOn December 2, 2021, Groupe Canal+ and the cinema organizations, represented by BLIC, BLOC and ARP, announced the signing of a new agreement which replaced the 2018 agreement, and extended the partnership between Canal+ and the French film industry until at least the end of 2024.\n\nWith regard to obligations to invest in audiovisual production, Canal+ must, pursuant to decree no. 2021-1926 of 30 December 2021, dedicate at least 4.2% of its total net revenue for the previous year to heritage works (drama, animation, creative documentaries, music videos and actual footage or reenactments of live performances). Part of this expenditure (at least 2.8% of revenue) is devoted to independent production activities.\n\nOnly films for which an agreement in principle has been given to producers are valued in off-balance sheet commitments; the total future estimate of the commitments under\n\nagreements with professional film-making organizations and producers' and authors' organizations is unknown. (2) Mainly includes the broadcasting rights of Groupe Canal+ for the following sporting events:\n\nAs at December 31, 2023:\n\n– European football competitions (UEFA): Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League, for the 2024-2025 to 2026-2027 seasons. As a reminder, Groupe Canal+ held exclusive rights to the Champions League for the two premium lots up to the 2023-2024 season, for which Groupe Canal+ had granted exclusive co-broadcasting rights to Altice group through a sub-licensing agreement; – on 21 September 2023, Groupe Canal+ announced the renewal of the entire English Premier League rights until the 2027-2028 season in France, as well as in the Czech Republic,\n\n- on 21 September 2023.

As at December 31, 2022:\n\n– European football competitions (UEFA): on June 29, 2022, Groupe Canal+ announced that it had secured all competitions for the first time: UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League, for the 2024-2025 to 2026-2027 seasons. As a reminder, Groupe Canal+ holds exclusive rights to the Soccer Champions League for the two premium lots up to the 2023-2024 season, for which Groupe Canal+ has granted exclusive co-broadcasting rights to Altice group through a sub-licensing agreement for the same seasons;\n\n– Premier League soccer in the United Kingdom until the 2024-2025 season, and in the Czech Republic and Slovakia until the 2024-2025 season;\n\n– lot 3 of the French Professional Soccer Ligue 1 until the 2023-2024 season, with the deal signed with beIN Sports on February 12, 2020;\n\n– exclusive rights to the National French Rugby Championship (Top 14) until the end of the 2026-2027 season;\n\n– Formula 1: on April 6, 2022, Groupe Canal+ announced a new exclusive broadcasting agreement until the 2029 season;\n\n– MotoGP™ on an exclusive basis until the 2029 season.\n\n{233}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### *Commitments received*\n\n| At December 31, 2023<br>(in millions of euros) | Total | Under 1 year | From 1 to 5 years | More than 5 years |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Broadcasting rights for films and programs     | 248.0 | 159.0        | 89.0              |                   |\n| Broadcasting rights for sporting events        | 81.0  | 75.0         | 6.0               |                   |\n| COMMITMENTS RECEIVED FOR CONTENT ASSETS        | 329.0 | 234.0        | 95.0              | 0.0               |\n\n| At December 31, 2022<br>(in millions of euros) | Total | Under 1 year | From 1 to 5 years | More than 5 years |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Broadcasting rights for films and programs     | 204.0 | 114.0        | 91.0              |                   |\n| Broadcasting rights for sporting events        | 224.0 | 144.0        | 80.0              |                   |\n| COMMITMENTS RECEIVED FOR CONTENT ASSETS        | 428.0 | 258.0        | 171.0             | 0.0               |\n\n# <span id=\"page-233-0\"></span>**7.3. OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nOther intangible assets mainly include trademarks and concession entry fees, customer relationships, operating rights, rights of use of leased intangible assets, computer software, and assets arising from concessions resulting from the reclassification of infrastructures held under concessions in application of IFRIC 12.\n\nOnce acquired, other intangible assets appear in the balance sheet at their acquisition cost. The non-current assets produced appear on the balance sheet at cost; they are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life.\n\nConcession entry fees, acquired through business combinations, are valued based on the estimated cash flows forecast over the residual term of the contract acquired plus any renewal period, in order to take into account the ability of the acquired entity to renew these agreements with the grantors of the concession. The value corresponding to the estimated cash flows forecast over the residual term of the contract acquired is amortized over the remaining term of the concession. The value representing the future economic benefits arising from the renewal of the concession is amortized over the term of the renewed concession, as from the effective date of the renewal. If it appears likely that the agreement will not be renewed, the value of the concession is written down. Concessions are amortized over periods ranging from 6 to 30 years, with the average amortization period being 15 years.\n\nThe useful lives of the main categories of other intangible assets are as follows:\n\n| Concession entry fees           | 6 to 30 years |\n|---------------------------------|---------------|\n| Software and IT licenses        | 1 to 5 years  |\n| Customer relationships acquired | 7 to 19 years |\n\nIn line with IAS 38 \"Intangible assets\", R&D expenditures are entered as expenses in the fiscal year in which they are incurred, with the exception of development costs, which are recorded under intangible assets if the following capitalization criteria are met:\n\n- the project is clearly identified, and its associated costs reliably separated and monitored;\n- the technical feasibility of the project has been demonstrated;\n- the intention is to complete the project and use or sell its products;\n- there is a potential market for the product developed under this project, or its internal utility has been demonstrated;\n- the resources needed to complete the project are available.\n\nDevelopment costs are amortized over the estimated lifetime of the projects concerned from the date on which the product becomes available.\n\n- In the particular case of software, the lifetime is determined as follows:\n- if the software is used in-house, over the probable useful life;\n- if the software is for external use, according to the prospects for sale, rental or any other form of marketing.\n\nCapitalized software development costs are those incurred during the programming, coding and testing stages. Previously incurred expenditures (planning, design, product specification and architecture) are entered as an expense.\n\nThe development costs of games are capitalized when the technical feasibility and the intention of the management to complete the development of the game and to market it have been established and if the costs are regarded as recoverable. The uncertainty existing until the launch of the game generally does not make it possible to fulfill the capitalization criteria required by IAS 38. The development costs of games are therefore recognized as expenses when they are incurred.\n\nTotal research and development expenses recognized in the profit and loss statement for the 2023 fiscal year amounted to 155.5 million euros and related mainly to developments by the Vivendi group.\n\n{234}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 7.3.1.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are entered at their acquisition or production cost, less cumulative depreciation and any recognized impairment.\n\nImpairment is generally determined using the straight-line method over the asset's useful life; the accelerated depreciation method may nevertheless be used if it appears more relevant to the conditions under which the equipment concerned is used. In the case of certain complex non-current assets with different components (buildings, for instance), each component is depreciated over its specific useful life.\n\nThe main useful lives of the various categories of property, plant and equipment are as follows:\n\n| Buildings and fittings              | 5 to 50 years |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Plant, machinery and equipment      | 3 to 20 years |\n| Set-top boxes                       | 5 to 7 years  |\n| Other property, plant and equipment | 2 to 15 years |\n\nDepreciable lives are periodically reviewed to check their relevance.\n\nThe start date for depreciation is that on which the asset came into service. In the case of an acquisition, the asset is depreciated over its residual useful lifetime, which is determined as at the date of acquisition.\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 7.4.1.

INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nCompanies accounted for using the equity method include companies over which the Group has a significant influence and joint ventures. To clarify the financial information provided further to the implementation of IFRS 10 \"Consolidated financial statements\" and IFRS 11 \"Joint arrangements\", the Group elected to recognize the shares of net income from operating companies accounted for using the equity method whose activities are linked to the Group's operating activities in operating income, under \"Share in net income of operating companies accounted for using the equity method\". The shares of net income from the Group's holding companies are presented in \"Share in net income of non-operating companies accounted for using the equity method\".\n\nShareholdings in associated companies and joint ventures are recognized pursuant to the revised IAS 28 as soon as a significant degree of influence or a controlling interest has been jointly acquired. Any difference between the cost of the shareholding and the acquired share in the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the company is entered under goodwill. Goodwill thus determined is included in the book value of the shareholding.\n\nAn impairment test is carried out as soon as an objective indication of impairment has been identified, such as a significant fall in the stock market price of the shareholding, the anticipation of a significant fall in future cash flows or any information suggesting likely significant negative effects on the entity's income.\n\nThe recoverable amount (in the case of shareholdings consolidated by the equity method) is then tested as described in the note on impairment of non-financial non-current assets (see note 7.1 – Goodwill).\n\nThe value in use of the shareholdings is calculated on the basis of an analysis of various criteria including the stock market value for listed securities, discounted future cash flows and comparable listed companies. These methods use the price targets set by financial analysts for listed securities.\n\nImpairment losses, if any, are recognized in profit and loss under \"Share in net income of operating companies accounted for using the equity method\" or \"Share in net income of non-operating companies accounted for using the equity method\", according to their classification.\n\nIn the event a significant degree of influence or a controlling interest has been jointly acquired through successive purchases of securities, the Group applies IAS 28.\n\nThe Group considers itself as involved in any losses realized by entities accounted for using the equity method even if the losses exceed the initial investment. The share of losses realized during the fiscal year is recognized in liabilities under \"Share in net income of companies accounted for using the equity method\", a provision is recognized under \"Provisions for contingencies\" for the share of losses exceeding the initial investment.\n\n#### (in millions of euros)\n\n| At December 31, 2022

Compagnie de l'Odet). As at December 31, 2023, UMG's stock market price was 25.81 euros per share and the value of investments in companies accounted for under the equity method on the consolidated balance sheet was 23.38 euros per share.\n\n# (\\*\\*) Lagardère\n\nThe Group has fully consolidated Lagardère since December 1, 2023.

South African regulations prohibit any foreign investor (excluding those from countries in the African Union that have entered into bilateral agreements) from holding a direct or indirect financial interest of more than 20% of the voting rights or from controlling a company holding a commercial broadcasting license. The MultiChoice Group's articles of association therefore limit the voting rights of all foreign shareholders to 20%, with, where appropriate, a reduction in their voting rights in due proportion (the scale-back mechanism). Groupe Canal+ is now the largest shareholder in MultiChoice Group, qualified as a material shareholder by MultiChoice Group, which is accounted for under the equity method as at January 1, 2022.\n\n# (\\*\\*\\*\\*) Viu\n\nOn June 21, 2023, the Group announced an investment of 200.0 million US dollars (186.0 million euros) in Viu, Asia's leading streaming platform.\n\n# **Financial information of Universal Music Group and MultiChoice Group at 100% ownership used to prepare the Group's financial statements**\n\nThe main aggregates of the consolidated financial statements as published by Universal Music Group and MultiChoice Group are as follows:\n\n| (in millions of euros)                    | Universal Music Group | MultiChoice Group     |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Balance sheet                             | June 30, 2023(1)      | September 30, 2023(2) |\n| Reporting date                            | July 26, 2023         | November 15, 2023     |\n| Non-current assets                        | 8,590                 | 1,224                 |\n| Current assets                            | 3,861                 | 1,189                 |\n| <b>Total assets</b>                       | <b>12,451</b>         | <b>2,413</b>          |\n| Equity                                    | 2,559                 | 38                    |\n| Non-current liabilities                   | 3,676                 | 1,108                 |\n| Current liabilities                       | 6,216                 | 1,267                 |\n| <b>Total liabilities</b>                  | <b>12,451</b>         | <b>2,413</b>          |\n| of which net financial position/(debt)(3) | (2,300)               | NA                    |\n\n{238}------------------------------------------------\n\n| (in millions of euros)                           | Universal Music Group                                               | MultiChoice Group                                           |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Profit and loss statement                        | Financial statements for the fiscal year<br>ended December 31, 2023 | Interim financial statements as at<br>September 30, 2023(2) |\n| Reporting date                                   | February 28, 2024(4)                                                | November 15, 2023                                           |\n| Revenue                                          | 11,108                                                              | 1,407                                                       |\n| EBITDA(3)                                        | 1,808                                                               | 330                                                         |\n| Net income, Group share                          | 1,259                                                               | (66)                                                        |\n| of which ongoing activities                      | 1,259                                                               | (66)                                                        |\n| discontinued operations and assets held for sale | –                                                                   | –                                                           |\n| Net income, Group share(5)                       | 189                                                                 | (89)                                                        |\n| Other comprehensive income                       | 60                                                                  | (6)                                                         |\n| Dividends paid to the Group                      | (264)                                                               |                                                             |\n\nNA: not applicable.\n\n(1) To consolidate Universal Music Group (UMG) using the equity method, the Group relies on its published financial information.

OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nOn initial recognition, financial assets are carried at fair value, which generally corresponds to the acquisition cost plus directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, financial assets are measured at fair value or amortized cost depending on the category to which they belong.\n\nFinancial assets are classified as \"Financial assets at fair value through equity\", \"Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\" and \"Financial assets at amortized cost\".\n\nThis classification depends on the entity's management model of financial assets and the contractual conditions for determining whether the cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Financial assets that include an embedded derivative are considered as a whole to determine whether their cash flows are SPPIs.\n\nNon-current financial assets include the portion due in over one year of financial assets recognized at fair value or at amortized cost.\n\nCurrent financial assets include trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and the portion due in less than one year of financial assets carried at fair value or amortized cost.\n\n# **• Financial assets at fair value**\n\nThese assets include assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, derivative financial instruments with a positive value and whose underlying is financial, and other financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nMost of these financial assets are actively traded on organized financial markets, their fair value being determined by reference to published market prices at the closing date. For financial assets for which there is no quoted market price in an active market, the fair value is estimated. The fair value of unlisted securities is determined on the basis of the revalued net assets and, if applicable, for transparency, the value of any underlying assets. The Group ultimately measures financial assets at historical cost less any potential impairment losses when no reliable estimate of their fair value can be made by valuation techniques and in the absence of an active market.\n\n# **• Financial assets at fair value through**\n\n**other comprehensive income**\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income include:\n\n• non-consolidated investments that are not held for trading purposes and for which the Group has made an irrevocable election to classify them at fair value through other non-recyclable items of comprehensive income. Unrealized gains and losses on financial assets measured at fair value through other non-recyclable items of comprehensive income are recorded in other income and expenses recognized directly in equity until the financial asset is sold, cashed in or otherwise removed from the balance sheet, at which time the accumulated gain or loss, previously recorded in other expenses and income recognized directly in equity, is transferred to consolidation reserves and is not reclassified in profit or loss. Dividends and interest received from non-consolidated investments are recognized in the profit and loss statement;\n\n• debt instruments whose contractual cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest on the outstanding principal, and where the Group's management intention is to collect contractual cash flows and to sell the financial assets. Unrealized gains and losses on these financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are recognized in other income and expenses recognized directly in equity. Where the financial asset is sold, cashed in or otherwise removed from the balance sheet or where there is objective evidence that the financial asset has lost all or part of its value, the accumulated gain or loss, recorded until then in other expenses and income recognized directly in equity is transferred to the profit and loss statement in other financial income and expenses.\n\n# **• Assets at fair value through profit and loss**\n\nOther financial assets at fair value through profit or loss mainly include heldfor-trading assets that the Group intends to resell in the near future (notably marketable securities) and other financial assets not meeting the definition of other categories of financial assets, including derivative financial instruments. Unrealized gains and losses on these assets are recognized in other financial income and expenses.\n\nShort-term investments (term deposits, interest-bearing current accounts and medium-term negotiable notes) do not meet the criteria for classification as cash equivalents according to IAS 7; similarly, the money market funds not meeting the requirements of the decision issued by the French Accounting Standards Authority (Autorité des normes comptables – ANC) and the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) in November 2018 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss in current financial assets.\n\n# **• Financial assets at amortized cost**\n\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost include debt instruments where the Group's management intention is to collect contractual cash flows that correspond solely the payment of principal and interest on the outstanding principal. They include receivables from equity interests, current account advances to associated or non-consolidated entities, security deposits, other loans, receivables and obligations.\n\nAt each year end, these assets are valued at amortized cost using the \"effective interest\" method.\n\nAn impairment is recognized if there is an objective indication of such a loss. The impairment corresponding to the difference between the net book value and the recoverable amount (discount of expected cash flows at the original effective interest rate) is charged to the income statement. This may be reversed if the recoverable amount should rise at a future date.\n\n| At December 31, 2023<br>(in millions of euros)                    | Gross value | Provisions | Net value(1) | Including<br>non-current | Including<br>current |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income |             |            | 6,840.9      | 6,840.9                  | 0.0                  |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss             |             |            | 317.6        | 0.1                      | 317.5                |\n| Financial assets at amortized cost                                | 652.0       | (199.1)    | 452.9        | 438.0                    | 14.9                 |\n| TOTAL                                                             |             |            | 7,611.4      | 7,279.0                  | 332.4                |\n\n(1) Net financial assets notably include listed and unlisted equity investments in the amount of 6,838.9 million euros, derivative assets in the amount of 10 million euros, cash management assets in the amount of 309.6 million euros and financial assets at amortized cost in the amount of 452.9 million euros.\n\n| At December 31, 2022<br>(in millions of euros)                    | Gross value | Provisions | Net value(1) | Including<br>non-current | Including<br>current |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|--------------|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income |             |            | 6,056.2      | 6,055.6                  | 0.6                  |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss             |             |            | 127.0        | 0.0                      | 127.0                |\n| Financial assets at amortized cost                                | 434.7       | (171.6)    | 263.1        | 247.7                    | 15.4                 |\n| TOTAL                                                             |             |            | 6,446.3      | 6,303.3                  | 143.0                |\n\n(1) Net financial assets notably included listed and unlisted equity investments in the amount of 6,046.7 million euros, derivative assets in the amount of 10.7 million euros, cash management assets in the amount of 125.8 million euros and financial assets at amortized cost in the amount of 263.1 million euros.\n\n{240}------------------------------------------------\n\n# (\\*) Breakdown of changes over the period\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                               | At 12/31/2022<br>Net value | Change in<br>consolidation<br>scope | Acquisitions(1) | Disposals | Change in fair<br>value(2) | Other<br>movements | At 12/31/2023<br>Net value |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------|----------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| Financial assets at fair value through<br>other comprehensive income | 6,056.2                    | 28.7                                | 175.7           | (16.1)    | 608.8                      | (12.4)             | 6,840.9                    |\n| Financial assets at fair value through<br>profit or loss             | 127.0                      | 10.5                                | 309.5           | (125.7)   | (3.7)                      | (0.0)              | 317.6                      |\n| Financial assets at amortized cost                                   | 263.1                      | 124.2                               | 152.6           | (30.1)    | 0.0                        | (56.9)             | 452.9                      |\n| TOTAL                                                                | 6,446.3                    | 163.4                               | 637.8           | (171.9)   | 605.1                      | (69.3)             | 7,611.4                    |\n\n(1) The change in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss includes term deposits of +309.5 million euros for Bolloré SE.\n\n(2) The change in the fair value of financial assets through other comprehensive income includes: +390.3 million euros for the Group's holding companies;

This valuation resulted in the recognition of a discount of 8.40% as at December 31, 2023.\n\nAll listed securities are classified in level 1 of the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy.

INFORMATION RELATING TO MARKET RISK AND THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES**\n\n# **9.1. INFORMATION ON RISK**\n\nThis note is to be read in addition to the information provided in the Board's' report on corporate governance included in the notes to the universal registration document.\n\nThe Group identifies three categories of risk:\n\n- main risks concerning the Group: risks that may impact the Group as a whole;\n- risks specific to activities: risks that could impact a given business line or geographic area without threatening the financial structure of the Group as a whole;\n- legal risks.\n\nActivity-specific risks are detailed in chapter 3 – Risk factors of the universal registration document.\n\n# Main market risks concerning the Group\n\n# **• Risk associated with listed shares**\n\nThe Compagnie de l'Odet Group, which holds a securities portfolio valued at 6,838.9 million euros as at December 31, 2023, is exposed to fluctuations on stock market prices.\n\nThe Group's equity investments in non-consolidated companies are measured at fair value at year end in accordance with IFRS 9 \"Financial instruments\" and are classified as financial assets (see note 8.3 – Other financial assets).\n\nAs far as shares in listed companies are concerned, this fair value is the closing stock market value.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, revaluations of equity investments in the consolidated balance sheet determined on the basis of stock market prices amounted to 3,233.9 million euros before tax.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, a 1% variation in stock market prices would have an impact of 67.1 million euros on the valuation of equity investments, which would affect the other comprehensive income before tax, including 42.9 million euros for revaluations of the Bolloré Group's shareholdings in Omnium Bolloré, Financière V and Sofibol.\n\nThese unlisted securities, whose value is dependent on the valuation of Compagnie de l'Odet securities, are therefore also impacted by fluctuations in stock market prices (see note 8.3 – Other financial assets). As at December 31, 2023, the revalued amount of these securities was 4,297.2 million euros, for a gross value of 183.9 million euros. The shares of these unlisted companies are not very liquid.\n\n# **• Liquidity risk**\n\nThe Group's liquidity risk stems from obligations to repay its debt and from the need for future financing in connection with the development of its various lines of business. To deal with liquidity risk, the Group's strategy has been to maintain a level of unused credit lines that will allow it to deal at any point with cash requirements in addition to its investments and available cash reserves. As at December 31, 2023, the amount of confirmed and unused credit lines was 8,259 million euros (of which 3,792 million euros for the Vivendi group). Additionally, the Group strives to diversify its sources of financing by using the bond market, the banking market and over-thecounter financing (NEU CP).\n\nFor the Group's main syndicated bank financing facilities as at December 31, 2023:\n\n- Bolloré SE has two syndicated revolving credit lines: one of 1,300 million euros, of which 13.6 million euros was drawn as at December 31, 2023 (in US dollars) maturing in 2025, and another of 400 million euros, undrawn as at December 31, 2023, maturing in 2028. They are subject to a gearing covenant that caps the net debt to equity ratio at 1.75;\n- Compagnie de l'Odet has a credit line of 1,150 million euros, of which 375.0 million euros was drawn as at December 31, 2023 (in euros) maturing in 2026.\n- Vivendi SE has a syndicated credit line of 1,500 million euros maturing in January 2026 and eight bilateral credit lines for a total amount of 800 million euros maturing in December 2027;\n- none of these credit lines are subject to compliance with financial ratios and they contain the usual clauses seen in unsecured financing arrangements;\n- Lagardère SA has a syndicated credit line of 982 million euros maturing in April 2025.\n\nBonds issued by Vivendi SE are subject to the usual default, negative pledge and pari passu clauses. They also contain an early repayment clause in the event of a change of control (other than a change of control in favor of the Bolloré group) that would apply if, following such an event, Vivendi SE's longterm rating was downgraded below Baa3.\n\nAs at March 4, 2024, when the Vivendi Management Board met to approve the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, Vivendi's ratings were as follows:\n\n| Rating agency | Type of debt                       | Rating | Outlook        |\n|---------------|------------------------------------|--------|----------------|\n| Moody's       | Senior unsecured<br>long-term debt | Baa2   | Stable outlook |\n\nApart from the proposed spin-off, the feasibility of which is under review (see note 1 – Highlights), the Group considers that the cash flows generated by its operating activities, its cash surpluses net of amounts used to reduce its debts, as well as the funds available under undrawn bank credit facilities will be sufficient to cover its operating expenses and investments, debt servicing, tax payments, dividend payments, any potential share buybacks under existing ordinary authorizations, as well as its proposed investments over the next twelve months.\n\nSome other lines may have early repayment covenants connected with respect of financial ratios, generally involving ratios of net debt to equity and/or debt service coverage. These bank covenants and financial ratios were all met as at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\nThe portion due in less than one year of loans used as at December 31, 2023 includes 67 million euros of short-term negotiable securities at Bolloré SE, 60 million euros at Compagnie de l'Odet and 561 million euros at Vivendi out of a program capped at 4,550 million euros (of which 3,650 million euros for Vivendi as at December 31, 2023) and 21.9 million euros of receivables factoring.\n\nAll bank lines of credit, both drawn and undrawn, are repayable as follows:\n\n| 2024        | 24% |\n|-------------|-----|\n| 2025        | 22% |\n| 2026        | 28% |\n| 2027        | 8%  |\n| 2028        | 17% |\n| Beyond 2028 | 1%  |\n\n# **• Interest rate risk**\n\nBecause of its financial debt, the Group is exposed to changes over time in interest rates in the eurozone, primarily on the portion of debt which is at variable rates, as well as to changes in the lending margins of credit institutions. To deal with this risk, Executive management may decide to set up interest rate hedges. Firm hedging (rate swaps, FRAs) may be used to manage the interest rate risk on the Group's debt.\n\nNote 8.5 – Financial debt describes the various derivative instruments for hedging the Group's interest rate risk.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, after hedging, fixed-rate gross financial debt amounted to 26% of total debt.\n\nIf interest rates were to rise uniformly by 1%, the cost of gross debt would increase by 57.5 million euros after hedging on interest-bearing gross debt. If interest rates were to rise uniformly by 1%, the cost of gross debt would decrease by –1.8 million euros after hedging on interest-bearing debt.\n\n{246}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **• Investment and counterparty risk**\n\nSurplus cash is invested in a prudent manner in low-risk liquid products with counterparties featuring a high credit rating.\n\nMoreover, Vivendi and Bolloré spread its investments across a number of selected banks and limit the investment amount per vehicle.\n\n# **• Currency risk**\n\nFor the Group, the breakdown of revenue by currency area (63% in euros, 10% in US dollars, 5% in CFA francs, 5% in zloty, 4% in pounds sterling, and less than 3% for all other currencies) and the fact that a large proportion of operating expenses is in local currencies limit its exposure to operating currency risk.\n\n<span id=\"page-246-0\"></span>The Group is reducing its exposure to currency risk further by hedging its main operations in currencies other than the euro with large international banks. The management of currency risk is largely centralized at Bolloré SE and Vivendi SE for subsidiaries which are attached to them directly.\n\n# **9.2. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**\n\nThe Group uses financial derivatives to manage and reduce its exposure to risks of change in interest rates and exchange rates. These are instruments traded on organized markets or over the counter, negotiated with first-class counterparties. They include interest rate or foreign currency swaps, as well as forward foreign exchange contracts. These instruments are all used for hedging purposes.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at the closing date of each fiscal year. The recognition of subsequent changes in fair value depends on the designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument and, where applicable, the nature of the hedged item and the type of hedging relationship designated. When these contracts qualify as hedges in accounting terms, the profits and losses made on these contracts are recognized in net income, symmetrically with the recognition of the income/expense of the items hedged.\n\nWhen the derivative instrument hedges a risk of change in the fair value of an asset or a liability recognized on the balance sheet, or a firm off-balance sheet commitment, it is termed a fair-value hedge. On an accounting basis, the instrument is remeasured at its fair value as a debit or credit to income and the item hedged is symmetrically remeasured for the portion hedged, on the same line of the profit and loss statement; or, if part of a planned At the Bolloré SE level, at the end of each month, each subsidiary declares its currency positions to be hedged to the Cash Department, which may arrange a firm hedge (forward buy or sell). In addition to these transactions carried out on a rolling basis, other hedges may be arranged on an ad hoc basis. Bolloré Energy hedges its positions directly on the market each day.\n\nWith regard to Vivendi, the Group's foreign exchange risk management policy primarily aims to hedge budgetary exposures for the next year related to monetary flows from operations in currencies other than the euro, as well as external firm commitments entered into in the context of the acquisition of editorial content (sports, TV and film rights, etc.) and certain industrial investments (i.e. set-top boxes) made in currencies other than the euro. The hedging instruments are currency swap, forward purchase or forward sale contracts, the majority of which mature in less than one year. Given the currency hedges in place, an unfavorable and uniform change of 1% in the euro against any of the currencies accounted for at end-December 2023 would have an immaterial effect on net income. In addition, the Vivendi group may hedge the foreign exchange risk on financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.\n\ntransaction on a non-financial asset or a liability, in the initial cost of the asset or liability.\n\nWhen the derivative instrument hedges a cash flow, it is termed a cash flow hedge. In that case, in accounting terms, the instrument is remeasured at its fair value as a debit or credit to other income and expenses recognized directly in equity with respect to the effective portion and by a debit or credit to income with respect to the ineffective portion. When the item hedged is recognized, the amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified in profit and loss on the same line as the item hedged; if part of a planned transaction on a non-financial asset or a liability, it is reclassified in the initial cost of the asset or liability.\n\nWhen the derivative instrument is a hedge of the net investment in a foreign company, it also qualifies as a cash flow hedge. For derivative instruments that do not qualify as hedges in accounting terms, the changes in their fair value are carried directly in profit and loss without remeasurement of the underlying asset or liability.\n\nIn addition, the income/expense related to the foreign exchange instruments used to hedge highly likely budgetary exposures and firm commitments, contracted as part of acquisition of rights on editorial content (sports, TV and film rights, etc.), are recognized in operating income. In all other cases, changes in the fair value of the instruments are recognized in other financial income and expenses.\n\n# Financial derivatives\n\n# **Balance sheet value**\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                   | 12/31/2023 | 12/31/2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Other non-current financial assets                       | 0.1        | 0.0        |\n| Trade and other receivables                              | 18.5       | 37.5       |\n| Other current financial assets                           | 0.6        | 1.8        |\n| TOTAL ASSET DERIVATIVES, EXCLUDING FINANCIAL DEBT(1)     | 19.2       | 39.3       |\n| Trade and other payables                                 | 23.6       | 14.3       |\n| Other current liabilities                                | 0.6        | 45.7       |\n| TOTAL LIABILITY DERIVATIVES, EXCLUDING FINANCIAL DEBT(1) | 24.2       | 60.0       |\n\n(1) Derivatives purchased for the management of currency risk, mainly within the Vivendi group.\n\n{247}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Currency risk management instruments\n\nThe tables below present the instruments for managing currency risk used by Vivendi;

directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices);\n- level 3: fair value estimated based on valuation techniques using significant data relating to the asset or liability which are not based on directly observable market data.\n\n# <span id=\"page-249-1\"></span>**NOTE 10.

NOTE 11. PROVISIONS AND DISPUTES**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nProvisions are liabilities whose actual due date or amount cannot be precisely determined.\n\n<span id=\"page-251-1\"></span>They are recognized when the Group has a present obligation resulting from a past act or event that will probably entail an outflow of resources that can be reliably estimated. The amount recorded must be the best estimate of the expenditure necessary to settle the obligation present at the closing date. It is discounted if the effect is significant and the due date is more than one year in the future.\n\nProvisions for restructuring are recognized as soon as the Group has a detailed formal plan of which the parties concerned have been notified. Provisions for contractual obligations mainly concern the restoration of premises used under service concession contracts. They are calculated at each fiscal year ended according to a work schedule extending over more than one year and revised annually to take account of the expenditure schedules.\n\n# **11.1.

LITIGATION IN PROGRESS**\n\nIn the normal course of their activities, Compagnie de l'Odet and its subsidiaries are party to a number of legal, administrative or arbitration proceedings.\n\nThe potential costs of these proceedings are the subject of provisions insofar as they are probable and quantifiable. The provisioned amounts are subject to a risk assessment on a case-by-case basis.\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, there are no other lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, governmental or legal proceedings or exceptional events (including any action of which the issuer has knowledge, and any currently suspended or threatened actions), that are likely to have or have had in recent months a significant impact on the financial situation, income, activity or assets of the company and the Group other than those described below.\n\n# Togo Guinea inquiry\n\nOn December 12, 2018 criminal charges were brought in a purely mechanical manner against Bolloré SE for bribery of a foreign public official, complicity in forgery and use of forged documents, and complicity in breach of trust, following the criminal charges brought on April 25, 2018 against two of its senior executives at the time. The allegations at the heart of the judicial inquiry go back to 2009-2010 and concern two operations in Togo and Guinea.\n\nThe inquiry seeks to determine whether the concessions obtained by local subsidiaries of the Group in Togo and Guinea were obtained because of communications services provided by Havas Group in those countries for 300,000 euros and 170,000 euros, respectively.\n\nBolloré SE has always strongly denied the facts alleged, which have been subject to numerous appeals before courts and tribunals.\n\nIn Guinea, the Group was named operator of the concession in 2010 because it had come in second during the international tender offer of 2008, after the default of the operator that had come in first.\n\nIn Togo, the concession agreement was signed on August 29, 2001, whereas the facts alleged would have occurred in 2009 and 2010, which is to say ten years later.\n\nIn these two countries, the Group's investments in port infrastructure today total over 500 million euros.\n\nIn a ruling handed down on September 26, 2019, the Second Examining Chamber of the Paris Court of Appeal canceled the indictment of Bolloré SE (and its two former senior executives) for complicity in forgery and use of forged documents in Togo, bribery of a foreign public official in Guinea and complicity in forgery and use of forged documents in Guinea.\n\nTo limit the length of these proceedings, Bolloré SE and Compagnie de l'Odet (formerly Financière de l'Odet SE) agreed to sign a deferred prosecution agreement (*convention judiciaire d'intérêt public* or CJIP) with the French National Financial Prosecutor's Office (*Parquet national financier* or PNF). This agreement signed on February 9, 2021 and validated by the Paris Judicial Court on February 26, 2021 is neither an admission of guilt nor a guilty verdict. It is a deal under which the PNF agreed to drop the charges against Bolloré SE, which agreed in turn to subject its compliance program to controls by the French anticorruption agency (Agence française anticorruption or AFA) for a period of two years and to bear the costs thereof up to 4 million euros. The Group's parent company, Compagnie de l'Odet (formerly Financière de l'Odet SE), agreed to pay a public interest fine of 12 million euros (which it paid on time).\n\nThe CJIP ended all charges brought against Bolloré SE.\n\nThe audits and checks carried out by the AFA with respect to the deferred prosecution agreement ended on March 8, 2023. Bolloré SE then received a draft final audit report from the AFA and provided its observations.\n\n# Autolib' vs. the Syndicat mixte Autolib' et Vélib' Métropole\n\nOn February 25, 2011, Syndicat mixte Autolib' et Vélib' Métropole (\"the SMAVM\") and Autolib' entered into a public service delegation for the purpose of installing, managing and maintaining a self-service electric automobile service and an electric vehicle recharging infrastructure (\"the agreement\" or \"the concession\").\n\nIn light of the updated 2016 business plan and the updated 2017 business plan that Autolib' forwarded to SMAVM, it was clear that the agreement was not economically attractive within the meaning of its article 63.2.1, and Autolib' notified SMAVM of this fact on May 25, 2018, in accordance with the agreement.\n\nSince the SMAVM did not wish to pay Autolib' the compensation called for in article 63.2.2 of the agreement in the event the concession should prove economically unattractive, it terminated the agreement per its article 63.3 in deliberation no. 2018-18 of June 21, 2018.\n\nArticle 63.3 of the agreement provides that, should the agreement be terminated pursuant to that article, the indemnification schedule in article 61 of the agreement shall apply.\n\nTherefore, Autolib' sent the SMAVM a letter dated September 25, 2018, with its request for indemnification for a total amount of 235,243,366 euros, calculated in accordance with articles 63.3 and 61 of the agreement.\n\nThe SMAVM, however, in a letter dated November 27, 2018, expressed its refusal to pay the indemnification referred to in item (vi) of article 61 of the agreement (indemnification and compensation due to Autolib' from the SMAVM since the threshold defined in article 63 of the agreement had been exceeded) by challenging Autolib's right to be compensated due to the threshold having been exceeded and to the agreement thus being recognized as economically unattractive.\n\nGiven this refusal by the SMAVM to pay the indemnification called for in item (vi) of article 61 of the agreement, thereby demonstrating a profound disagreement between the SMAVM and Autolib' about the amount of indemnification to be paid under article 61 of the agreement, Autolib' notified the SMAVM, in accordance with article 61 of the agreement and, in a letter dated November 29, 2018, that it was bringing the matter before the Arbitration Panel mentioned in article 70 of the agreement.\n\nArticle 61 of the agreement provides that: \"The Arbitration Panel may be appealed to by either party in the event of disagreement about the amount of this indemnification\".\n\n{253}------------------------------------------------\n\nArticle 70.1 of the agreement concerning the creation of an Arbitration Panel provides that, \"the Arbitration Panel shall consist of three (3) members whose personal and moral qualities and experience in public-private arrangements for comparable complex projects is well known. Within fifteen (15) calendar days after the appeal to the Arbitration Committee, each party will designate one (1) member, and the third member, who will be Chairman of the Arbitration Panel, will be chosen by common agreement between the two (2) members so designated. Failing an agreement within fifteen (15) calendar days, the Chairman of the Arbitration Panel will be designated by the Chief Judge of the Paris Administrative Court, at the request of the first party to act\".\n\nTherefore, and in compliance with said article 70.1 of the agreement, Autolib' and the SMAVM each proceeded on their own, on December 11 and 12, 2018, respectively, to designate the two out of three members of the Arbitration Panel.\n\nDespite numerous conversations held and proposals made by the members of the Arbitration Panel designated by the SMAVM and Autolib', the two were unable to reach an agreement as to the choice of a Chairman of the Arbitration Panel, even more than two months after the appeal to the Arbitration Panel on November 29, 2018.\n\nTherefore, and pursuant to article 70.1 of the agreement, Autolib' appealed to the Chief Judge of the Paris Administrative Court in a request dated February 12, 2019, so that she might appoint the Chairman of the Arbitration Panel.\n\nWhen the Chief Judge of the Administrative Court recused herself from making that appointment, Autolib' and the SMAVM granted the arbitrators a one-month extension to reach an agreement on the choice of a Chairman of the Arbitration Panel.\n\nHowever, no agreement on the selection of the Chairman of the Arbitration Panel had been reached between the two members of the Panel already appointed as at March 20, 2019.\n\nDespite the lack of agreement by the deadline agreed to between Autolib' and SMAVM, Autolib' remained keen to give the conciliation one last chance to take place. As such, in a letter dated March 22, 2019, Autolib' referred the matter back to a new Arbitration Panel, replacing the Arbitration Panel to which the matter was referred on November 29, 2018.\n\nHowever, unlike Autolib', the SMAVM, in a letter dated March 27, 2019, initially refused to appoint a member to the new Arbitration Panel other than the one originally designated.\n\nIn response to a letter from Autolib' dated March 29, 2019, calling on the SMAVM to appoint a new member of the Arbitration Panel and a reminder letter dated April 8, 2019, the SMAVM, in a letter dated on the same day, finally agreed to make every effort to appoint a new member to the Panel before April 23, 2019.\n\nHowever, contrary to all expectations, the SMAVM, in a letter dated April 23, 2019, subsequently informed Autolib' that it had been unable to appoint a new member to the Arbitration Panel within the agreed period, and that it intended to designate as a member of the new Panel the person appointed to the first.\n\nAs the arbitration proceeding was manifestly impossible, in the light of all the foregoing, Autolib', in a letter dated May 20, 2019, asked the SMAVM, prior to referring the matter to the Paris Administrative Court in accordance with article 71 of the Autolib' public service delegation agreement, to pay it the compensation due in accordance with article 63 and article 61 of the Autolib' public service delegation agreement, i.e. the sum of 235,243,366 euros, subject to adjustments, to cover the termination of the agreement.\n\nAs this request was implicitly rejected by the SMAVM on July 20, 2019, Autolib' applied to the Paris Administrative Court on September 9, 2019, asking it to force the SMAVM to pay it 235,243,366 euros, for the termination of the agreement, with interest and, where applicable, the compounding of accrued interest.\n\nUnder the terms of a judgment dated December 12, 2023, the Paris Administrative Court rejected Autolib's request while also refusing the requests of the SMAVM and the defendant municipalities made on the basis of article L. 761-1 of the French administrative justice code *(Code de justice administrative).* The court held that the SMAVM was liable to bear the entire share of the operating losses of the concession exceeding the threshold of losses accepted by the concession holder and set at 60 million euros in the contract, but that such a mechanism constituted a gift granted by a public entity, without, however, substantiating this characterization, thereby rendering the contract null and void. Autolib' appealed this judgment and intends to assert its rights in respect of all legal grounds available to it in this context.\n\n# LBBW *et al.* vs. Vivendi\n\nOn March 4, 2011, 26 institutional investors from Germany, Canada, Luxembourg, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Belgium and Austria sued Vivendi in the Paris Commercial Court for seeking damages for losses allegedly incurred due to four financial releases in October and December 2000, September 2001, and April 2002. On April 5 and April 23, 2012, two similar suits were filed against Vivendi: one by an American pension fund, the Public Employee Retirement System of Idaho, and the other by six German and British institutional investors. On August 8, 2012, British Columbia Investment Management Corporation also sued Vivendi on the same grounds. On January 7, 2015, the Paris Commercial Court appointed a third party responsible for checking the standing of the claimants and reviewing the documentation provided by them to evidence their alleged holding of the securities prior to the proceedings on the merits; this third party completed its task during the first half of 2018. On July 7, 2021, the Court issued its decisions on these various cases. The Court found Vivendi not liable in the absence of fault relating to the publication of inaccurate financial statements, the dissemination of false information and Vivendi's general communications from October 2000 to August 2002. The Court therefore dismissed all the plaintiffs' claims and ordered them to reimburse Vivendi's costs in the amount of 1,085,000 euros. The Court also ordered the provisional execution of the judgment. Almost all plaintiffs have appealed the judgment. All cases were distributed to the International Chamber of the Paris Court of Appeal. During a hearing on December 13, 2022, the timetable for the proceedings was set with pleadings scheduled for December 4 and 5, 2023, which were subsequently postponed to June 3 and 4, 2024.\n\n# California State Teachers Retirement System *et al.* vs. Vivendi\n\nOn April 27, 2012, 67 foreign institutional investors sued Vivendi in the Paris Commercial Court seeking damages for losses they allegedly incurred as a result of the financial communication of Vivendi between 2000 and 2002. On June 7 and September 5 and 6, 2012, 26 further parties joined the lawsuit. In November 2012 and March 2014, twelve plaintiffs withdrew. On January 7, 2015, the Paris Commercial Court appointed a third party responsible for checking the standing of the claimants and reviewing the documentation provided by them to evidence their alleged holding of the securities prior to the proceedings on the merits; this third party completed its task during the first half of 2018. On July 7, 2021, the Court issued its decisions on these various cases. The Court found Vivendi not liable in the absence of fault relating to the publication of inaccurate financial statements, the dissemination of false information and Vivendi's general communications from October 2000 to August 2002. The Court therefore dismissed all the plaintiffs' claims and ordered them to reimburse Vivendi's costs in the amount of 2,450,000 euros. The Court also ordered the provisional execution of the judgment. Almost all plaintiffs have appealed the judgment. The case was distributed to the International Chamber of the Court of Appeal of Paris. During a hearing on December 13, 2022, the timetable for the proceedings was set with pleadings scheduled for December 4 and 5, 2023, which were subsequently postponed to June 3 and 4, 2024.\n\n# European Commission investigation\n\nOn July 25, 2023, the European Commission announced that it had opened a formal investigation to determine whether, when acquiring Lagardère, Vivendi breached the notification and standstill obligations set out in the EU Merger Regulation, as well as the conditions and obligations attached to the Commission's decision to approve the Vivendi/Lagardère transaction. Vivendi is fully cooperating with this investigation.\n\n# Telecom Italia\n\nOn August 5, 2017, the Italian government informed Vivendi that it was opening a formal investigation to verify whether Telecom Italia and Vivendi had complied with certain provisions of legislative decree no. 21 of March 15, 2012 on \"regulating special powers in the areas at defense and national security\" (article 1) and \"activities of strategic importance in the energy, transportation and communications sectors\" (article 2). It was Vivendi's view that the provisions of this law did not apply to Vivendi.\n\n{254}------------------------------------------------\n\nOn September 28, 2017, the President of the Council of Ministers found that the notification made as a precautionary measure by Vivendi under article 1 of the aforementioned legislative decree was made late and that Telecom Italia had failed to make the required notification under article 2 of the decree after the change in control over its assets of strategic importance in the energy, transportation and communications sectors. The President of the Council of Ministers thus initiated proceedings against Telecom Italia for failure to give notice under article 2 of the same legislative decree. Vivendi and Telecom Italia appealed this decision. On September 6, 2022, the Administrative Court of Latium dismissed Vivendi's appeal, which appealed this decision to the Council of State. On July 5, 2023, the Italian Council of State dismissed Vivendi's appeal.\n\nMoreover, in this same context, Consob declared on September 13, 2017 that Vivendi exercises de facto control over Telecom Italia. Vivendi and Telecom Italia formally contest this position, and have appealed to the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio. On April 17, 2019, the Court dismissed the appeal brought by Telecom Italia and Vivendi, which subsequently appealed to the Italian Council of State on July 16 and 17, 2019, respectively. On December 14, 2020, the Italian Council of State ruled in favor of Vivendi and Telecom Italia. On June 11, 2021, Consob appealed against the Italian Council of State's decision before the Italian Supreme Court. On January 24, 2023, the Italian Supreme Court rejected Consob's appeal, putting a definitive end to this procedure.\n\n# Vivendi against TIM SpA\n\nOn December 15, 2023, Vivendi filed a complaint against TIM SpA before the Court of Milan seeking the annulment of the resolution adopted by TIM's Board of Directors on November 5, 2023, which approved the sale of the company's fixed-line network, and requesting a declaration that the transaction agreement entered into on November 6, 2023 was unenforceable. The first court hearing has been scheduled for May 21, 2024.\n\n# Epac against Interforum and Editis\n\nIn 2015, Interforum entered into an on-demand printing contract with Epac Technologies Ltd. In 2020, a disagreement emerged regarding the execution of the contract. On March 29, 2021, Epac informed Interforum and Editis that it was terminating the agreement entered into in 2015 as at March 31, 2021 and filed a lawsuit against them with the Supreme Court of the State of New York, claiming they had allegedly not paid invoices or complied with several contractual obligations and requesting the defendants be ordered to pay damages. On July 20, 2021, Epac extended the lawsuit to Vivendi which, on September 30, 2021, filed a motion to dismiss this lawsuit before the New York courts. In September 2021, discovery proceedings commenced against Editis. On December 29, 2021, Epac also called for a discovery proceedings against Vivendi. On June 16, 2022, a hearing was held on the motion to dismiss filed by Vivendi, under which the judge accepted Vivendi's dismissal. Epac appealed this decision on August 5, 2022. The parties have agreed to suspend any discovery during the appeal proceedings and until a decision is made. On June 29, 2023, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York granted Epac's appeal, thereby reinstating Vivendi as a defendant in the case. On August 10, 2023, Vivendi filed an appeal, which was opposed by Epac, against this decision before the Court of Appeal. This request was denied on November 9, 2023. On December 12, 2023, Vivendi filed a new motion before the New York Court of Appeal seeking leave to appeal.\n\n# Cameron Parish and the State of Louisiana against Texas Pacific Oil Company and others\n\nIn 2016, Cameron Parish and the State of Louisiana sued a number of oil companies, including Texas Pacific Oil Company (a former Seagram subsidiary, now owned by Vivendi). The companies were accused of conducting various oil and gas exploration and production activities that had allegedly damaged and contaminated the coastline. Of the 1,000 oil wells at issue in the case, 7 belonged to Texas Pacific Oil Company. Following mediation, the parties entered into a settlement agreement on December 13, 2023, thereby ending the proceedings.\n\n# Parabole Réunion\n\nOn August 11, 2009, Parabole Réunion lodged a fast-track claim against Groupe Canal+ with the Paris Regional Court, seeking that Groupe Canal+ be ordered to provide a channel of equivalent attractiveness to TPS Foot in 2006 and to pay damages. On April 26, 2012, Parabole Réunion also sued Canal+ France, Groupe Canal+ and Canal+ Distribution before the Paris Regional Court for the purpose of establishing the breach by Groupe Canal+ companies of their contractual obligations towards Parabole Réunion and their commitments to the minister of the Economy. These two claims were combined in a single suit. On April 29, 2014, the Regional Court ruled that the Parabole Réunion claims were partly admissible for the period after June 19, 2008 and accepted the contractual liability of Groupe Canal+ for the inferior quality of the channels made available to Parabole Réunion. The Court also ordered an expert appraisal of damages suffered by Parabole Réunion, rejecting the company's own appraisals. On June 3, 2016, the Court of Appeal upheld the Regional Court's April 29, 2014 ruling. Groupe Canal+ appealed to have the ruling quashed but was denied on January 31, 2018.\n\nOn January 17, 2017, the Paris Regional Court ordered Groupe Canal+ to pay 37,720,000 euros with provisional enforcement. Parabole Réunion appealed this ruling to the Paris Court of Appeal on February 23, 2017.\n\nOn May 29, 2017, Parabole Réunion raised an incidental question in order to have the court appoint an additional expert to assess the loss in value of its business. On October 12, 2017, the pre-trial judge of the Paris Court of Appeal granted this request and a judicial expert was appointed. On January 15, 2021, the judicial expert filed his final report. On 30 March 2021, Parabole Réunion filed submissions claiming that the expert's report was invalid.\n\nOn February 11, 2022, the Paris Court of Appeal issued its decision. It denied the request to nullify the appraisal report and confirmed the ruling of January 17, 2017 in all its provisions except for the amount of compensation for Parabole Réunion's operating losses. As a result, it ordered Groupe Canal+ to pay 48.55 million euros for operating losses over the 2008-2012 period, and to pay 29.5 million euros for operating losses over the 2013-2016 period, all with capitalization at the interest rate of 11% from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016. It also ordered Groupe Canal+ to pay one million euros in compensation for reputational damage and 500,000 euros in compensation for non-pecuniary losses.\n\nOn February 17, 2022, Parabole Réunion referred two requests to the Court of Appeal: one for correction of material errors relating to the amount of the compensation for operating losses as at December 31, 2012; the other failing to rule on interest and the compound interest rate applicable between January 1, 2017 and February 11, 2022. In a ruling dated April 15, 2022, the Court of Appeal dismissed Parabole Réunion's claims in respect of its request for omission, considering that it had rejected the request relating to the compound interest as from January 1, 2017. However, it granted its request for correction of the material error, considering that compensation for the operating loss suffered between 2008 and 2012 should be compounded over this period.\n\nOn April 19, 2022, Parabole Réunion sent a new request for correction of a material error against the decision of the Paris Court of Appeal of April 15, 2022, considering that, with regard to compensation for the operating loss suffered until 2012, the compounding was to apply from 2008 to 2016 and not from 2008 to 2012. On May 13, 2022, the Court of Appeal dismissed this request.\n\nOn May 16, 2022, Groupe Canal+ filed two appeals against the rulings of the Paris Court of Appeal of February 11, and April 15, 2022. On May 25, 2022, Parabole Réunion also filed an appeal against the judgments of the Court of Appeal. However, Groupe Canal+ withdrew from its second appeal on September 15, 2022. The hearing before the Commercial Chamber of the Cour de Cassation (French Supreme Court) was held on January 10, 2023. On March 1, 2023, it issued a partial cassation ruling, under which it confirmed the amount of the main sentence handed down by the Court of Appeal on February 11, 2022, but dismissed and canceled the provisions of the ruling condemning Groupe Canal+ to pay Parabole Réunion interest at the compound rate of 11% and referred the case to the Paris Court of Appeal, otherwise composed.\n\n{255}------------------------------------------------\n\nOn March 28, 2023, Parabole Réunion filed an appeal before the Paris Court of Appeal. On June 27, 2023, Parabole Réunion filed pleadings, primarily seeking payment for compensatory damages and interest, including (i) interest capitalized at 11% for the period 2008 to 2012, (ii) 190 million euros in respect of 2013 and 2014, and (iii) interest capitalized at the regulatory rates applied by Arcep since 2013 (i.e., ranging from 4.8% to 10%). It is still seeking publication of the decision and 12.5 million euros under article 700 of the French civil code *(Code civil)* procedure. The hearing before the Court of Appeal has been scheduled for June 24, 2024.\n\nOn July 4, 2023, Parabole Réunion filed a motion for a material correction to the operative part of the Paris Court of Appeal's decision of February 11, 2022, which related to the principal amount of the operating losses for the period from June 2008 to 2012 for which Canal+ Group was ordered to compensate Parabole Réunion, seeking to increase such principal mount from 48.55 million euros to 49,302,878 euros.\n\n# \"Touche Pas à Mon Poste\"\n\nOn 7 June 2017, the Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA, recently replaced by the Regulatory Authority for Audiovisual and Digital Communication (Autorité de régulation de la communication audiovisuelle et numérique or \"Arcom\")) decided to sanction C8 for a sequence with the columnist Capucine Anav, broadcast during the \"TPMP\" show on December 7, 2016, which it considered to have degraded the image of women. On the same day, the CSA also penalized C8 for another sequence in the \"TPMP ! La Grande Rassrah\" show of November 3, 2016. The CSA considered that this other segment had violated the dignity of a columnist on the show. In both cases, the sanction consisted of suspending advertising during the show and any rebroadcasts.\n\nOn July 3, 2017, following these two CSA rulings, C8 filed two requests for annulment with the French Council of State *(Conseil d'État).* On July 4, 2017, C8 also filed two actions for damages with the CSA, which were implicitly rejected. On November 2, 2017, C8 appealed these decisions to the Council of State. On June 18, 2018, the Council of State rejected C8's first petition for judicial review but did uphold its second petition by overturning the decision of the CSA. The Council of State's rejection of the first petition was appealed to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in December 2018 and was rejected on February 9, 2023. On November 13, 2019, the Council of State rejected the first action for damages but allowed the second, ordering the CSA to pay 1.1 million euros to C8, for the week during which the channel was deprived of advertising. The Council of State's decision to dismiss C8's claim for compensation over the segment with Capucine Anav was the subject of an appeal before the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which was filed in December 2018 and dismissed on February 9, 2023. On May 4, 2023, C8 filed an appeal before the Grand Chamber of the ECHR, which was dismissed on June 26, 2023, thereby rendering the ECHR's decision to dismiss the case on February 9, 2023 final.\n\nOn July 26, 2017, the CSA decided to penalize C8 for a sequence broadcast during \"TPMP Baba hot line\" on May 18, 2017, judging that the channel had ignored the principle of respect for private life and its obligation to fight against discrimination, levying a cash fine of 3 millions euros. Following this decision, on September 22, 2017, C8 filed a petition for judicial review with the French Council of State, which was rejected on June 18, 2018. An appeal against this decision was filed with the ECHR in December 2018. On February 18, 2019, Groupe Canal+ sent a letter to the CSA requesting the cancellation of the aforementioned 3 million euros fine. This request was denied on April 5, 2019. An appeal against this decision was filed with the Council of State on June 5, 2019 and was rejected on September 28, 2020. In March 2021, an appeal was filed with the ECHR. By decision of February 9, 2023, the ECHR rejected the appeal. On May 4, 2023, C8 filed an appeal before the Grand Chamber of the ECHR, which was dismissed on June 26, 2023, thereby rendering the ECHR's decision to dismiss the case on February 9, 2023 final.\n\nOn November 17, 2022, the Arcom referred the matter to the independent rapporteur as part of the launch of a disciplinary procedure against channel C8 after the host of \"TPMP\", Cyril Hanouna made remarks that could be considered offensive against the member of parliament Louis Boyard during the program broadcast on November 10, 2022. On November 29, 2022, the independent rapporteur sent a statement of complaints to the channel. A hearing was held at Arcom on February 8, 2023 and the Arcom decided on February 9, 2023 to impose a fine of 3.5 million euros on C8. In a supplementary decision dated February 9, 2023, the Arcom also sent a formal notice to C8 on the same issue. On April 7, 2023, C8 filed an appeal against the fine and a summary appeal against the formal notice before the Council of State.\n\nOn November 18, 2022, Arcom issued a formal notice to C8 for comments made during several \"TPMP\" programs in October 2022 relating to the killing of a teenager. On January 17, 2023, C8 filed an appeal against this decision with the Council of State, which was dismissed on December 21, 2023.\n\nOn January 11, 2023, the Arcom independent rapporteur initiated disciplinary proceedings against C8 and notified the channel of its complaints following a \"TPMP\" program broadcast on October 5, 2022, in which Cyril Hanouna made statements about certain mayors, including the Mayor of Paris, which could be qualified as offensive. On May 31, 2023, the Arcom imposed a fine on the channel, ordering it to pay 300,000 euros. On July 27, 2023, the channel filed an appeal before the Council of State.\n\nOn January 13, 2023, the Arcom independent rapporteur initiated disciplinary proceedings against C8 and notified the channel of its complaints following a promotion of the films *Les Segpa* and *Ténor* in the programs \"Le 6 à 7\" and \"TPMP\" on April 19, 2022 and May 4, 2022, which could be qualified as surreptitious advertising. On June 21, 2023, the Arcom decided not to impose a sanction on the channel.\n\nOn January 16, 2023, the Arcom independent rapporteur initiated disciplinary proceedings against C8 following several occurrences in the programs \"Le 6 à 7\" and \"TPMP\" in November 2022, in which certain brands could be seen, which could be qualified as surreptitious advertising. On March 15, 2023, the Arcom independent rapporteur initiated disciplinary proceedings against C8 following several occurrences in the programs \"Le 6 à 7\" and \"TPMP\" in January 2023, in relation to the display of several brands, which could be qualified as surreptitious advertising. On June 21, 2023, the Arcom imposed a total fine on the channel of 200,000 euros in respect of these two proceedings. On August 18, 2023, C8 filed an appeal before the Council of State against this decision.\n\nOn April 14, 2023, following statements made by Gérard Fauré during a \"TPMP\" broadcast on March 9, 2023, the independent rapporteur of the Council of State, at the request of the Arcom, initiated sanction proceedings on April 14, 2023 for breaches of human rights, the requirement to exercise discretion in dealing with ongoing legal proceedings and the obligation to maintain editorial control over the broadcast. On July 26, 2023, the Arcom imposed a fine of 500,000 euros on C8. On September 25, 2023, C8 filed an appeal against this decision.\n\nOn June 12, 2023, following the broadcast of images and videos of Joy Smet (known as Hallyday) and comments made by Cyril Hanouna and his panelists during a segment of \"TPMP\" on January 30, 2023, the independent rapporteur of the Council of State initiated sanction proceedings against C8 for breaches of Joy Smet's image rights, respect for honor and reputation, and the obligation to maintain editorial control over the broadcast. On July 13, 2023, C8 submitted its observations to the independent rapporteur and believes that it did not commit any breach in the context of this segment. On January 17, 2024, the Arcom imposed a fine of 50,000 euros on C8.\n\n# Broadcasts on CNews\n\nOn December 3, 2019, the CSA gave formal notice to the CNews channel to comply with its obligations to respect human dignity and to promote the values of integration and solidarity, following comments made on the \"Face à l'info\" show on October 23, 2019 which were considered to encourage discrimination on religious grounds. CNews filed an appeal before the Council of State seeking to annul the CSA's decision, but this appeal was dismissed in June 2021. In December 2021, CNews filed an appeal before the European Court of Human Rights, which was dismissed on November 30, 2023.\n\nIn October 2020, the independent rapporteur, at the request of the CSA, initiated sanction proceedings against CNews, following comments made on the \"Face à l'info\" show on September 29, 2020 with respect to unaccompanied migrant minors. On March 17, 2021, the CSA imposed a fine of 200,000 euros on CNews. CNews filed an appeal before the Council of State, which was dismissed on July 12, 2022. On November 12, 2022, CNews filed an appeal before the European Court of Human Rights.\n\n{256}------------------------------------------------\n\nOn 15 May 2023, the Arcom's independent rapporteur initiated sanction proceedings against CNews in relation to two segments on the shows \"La Matinale Week-End\" and \"Midi News Week-End\" which were broadcast on September 24, 2022, and a segment on \"Face à l'info\" which was broadcast on September 26, 2022. These segments related to an \"international ranking of the safest cities\" conducted by the Numbeo website and were deemed to constitute a breach of honesty and accuracy with respect to their presentation and handling of information, as well as a failure to provide different points of view. On June 19, 2023, C8 submitted its observations to the independent rapporteur and believes that it did not commit any breach in the context of these segments. On January 17, 2024, the Arcom imposed a fine of 50,000 euros on CNews.\n\nOn 5 January 2024, the Arcom's independent rapporteur initiated sanction proceedings against CNews targeting three segments aired on CNews during which statements were made that could constitute breaches of the channel's obligations (inciting hatred and encouraging discriminatory behavior, as well as of the obligation to maintain editorial control over the broadcast).\n\n# Groupe Canal+ vs. Mediapro\n\nOn September 18, 2020, Groupe Canal+ filed a lawsuit against Mediapro before the Nanterre Commercial Court for unequal treatment and discriminatory practices in the context of discussions that had taken place between the two companies regarding the distribution of the Telefoot channel, which has been discontinued. On October 2, 2020, the Nanterre Commercial Court referred the case to the Paris Commercial Court.\n\nOn November 20, 2020, Mediapro filed a lawsuit against Groupe Canal+ before the Paris Commercial Court, requesting the Court to rule that Groupe Canal+ (i) abused its dominant position in the channel distribution market by unfairly discriminating against Mediapro and (ii) made disparaging statements constituting unfair competition. The two cases were joined at a hearing on February 8, 2021.\n\nOn June 16, 2022, Mediapro Internacional sued Groupe Canal+ on similar grounds. In a ruling of October 18, 2022, the Court decided to include the question of the admissibility of Mediapro International's action and its relevance to the case with the debates on the merits.\n\nOn January 31, 2023, the Paris Commercial Court dismissed all of their respective claims. On March 30, 2023, Mediapro appealed against the Paris Commercial Court's decision.\n\n# Groupe Canal+ vs. the Professional Football League\n\nFollowing the cancellation of a number of Ligue 1 championship matches between December 2018 and April 2019 due to the \"Yellow Vests\" movement, and their unilateral postponement by decision of the League of Professional Football (LFP), Groupe Canal+ sued the LFP on July 4, 2019, seeking damages to cover the financial losses suffered as a result of these postponements. Having acquired broadcast rights of matches and magazines for time slots identified during the tender process for the seasons from 2016-2017 to 2019-2020, Groupe Canal+ considers that the LFP violated the outcome of the tender process and has requested 46 million euros in damages. At a hearing on November 25, 2019, the LFP asked for Groupe Canal+'s requests to be rejected and for Canal+ to be ordered to pay compensation for the damages it allegedly caused by the publicity surrounding these proceedings. On June 1, 2021, the Paris Commercial Court denied Groupe Canal+'s claims and ordered it to pay 10,000 euros to the LFP for wrongful disparagement, as well as 50,000 euros in legal fees. Groupe Canal+ appealed this decision. The LFP filed a cross-appeal to have Groupe Canal+'s penalty for denigration (for publishing the lawsuit in the newspaper *L'Équipe*) to be reassessed From 10,000 euros to 500,000 euros. Oral arguments were heard on December 7, 2023 and a decision is expected to be issued on March 29, 2024.\n\nOn January 22, 2021, Groupe Canal+ brought summary proceedings against the LFP before the Paris Commercial Court, following the call for tenders launched by the LFP on January 19, 2021 for the sale of the Ligue 1 rights returned by Mediapro and seeking, among other things, the cancellation of the call for tenders and an order requiring the LFP to pay Groupe Canal+ the difference between the price of lot 3 acquired by it in connection with the 2018 call for tenders and not included in the contested call for tenders and its actual economic value. On March 11, 2021, the Paris Commercial Court issued its judgment, dismissing all of Group Canal+'s claims and ordering it to pay 50,000 euros in legal fees. On April 6, 2021, Groupe Canal+ appealed against this decision before the Paris Court of Appeal. On June 23, 2022, the pre-trial judge issued an order postponing judgment pending the appeal against the decision of the French Competition Authority of June 11, 2021, which was rejected on June 30, 2022 (see below). The case hearing before the Court of Appeal took place on December 8, 2022. On February 3, 2023, the Versailles Court of Appeal upheld the original ruling. Groupe Canal+ filed an appeal with the French Supreme Court on March 10, 2023.\n\nOn January 29, 2021, Groupe Canal+ also filed a complaint and a request for protective measures against the LFP before the French Competition Authority, seeking to require the LFP to organize a new call for tenders for all Ligue 1 broadcasting rights. On June 11, 2021, the French Competition Authority denied Groupe Canal+'s request to file a claim on the merits for lack of sufficiently probative evidence, and consequently, its request for precautionary measures. Groupe Canal+ appealed this decision and its appeal was rejected on June 30, 2022. Groupe Canal+ filed an appeal with the French Supreme Court on July 28, 2022.\n\nOn July 26, 2021, beIN Sports sued the LFP, in the presence of Groupe Canal+, before the Paris Judicial Court in order to ask the Court to recognize the expiry of the contract relating to lot 3 and, alternatively, to terminate it on the basis of article 1195 of the French civil code *(Code civil).* On March 29, 2022, the pre-trial judge ordered a deferment until the Paris Court of Appeal, to which the appeal against the decision of the Commercial Court of March 11, 2021 referred to above was referred, issued its ruling. This ruling was made on February 3, 2023, confirming the Commercial Court's decision. BeIN Sports appealed the deferment. On December 2, 2022, the Court of Appeal confirmed the deferment and extended it until the termination of appeals against the decision of the French Competition Authority of November 30, 2022 (see below). Groupe Canal+ and beIN Sports renounced appealing against the decision of the French Competition Authority of November 30, 2022 to put an end to the deferment. As a result, a hearing was held before the pre-trial judge on April 3, 2023, which scheduled the end of the discussions on April 24, 2023. Oral arguments were heard on June 20, 2023. On September 19, 2023, the Paris Judicial Court dismissed all of beIN Sports and Canal+ Group's claims. Canal+ Group and beIN Sports appealed against this decision on October 19 and November 6 2023, respectively.\n\nOn December 24, 2021, Groupe Canal+ filed a second complaint as well as a request for precautionary measures to the French Competition Authority against the LFP. Groupe Canal+ asked the French Competition Authority to note that LFP has used discriminatory practices by awarding most of the rights to broadcast Ligue 1 games to Amazon for a price of 250 million euros per season while Canal+ is forced to operate a Ligue 1 lot awarded in 2018 for 332 million euros per season and that these practices constitute abuse of a dominant position. It also asked the French Competition Authority to recognize the nullity of the contracts entered into by the LFP with beIN Sports in May 2018 and by the LFP with Amazon in June 2021, and to order the companies implicated to pay any financial penalties that it deems appropriate. Finally, it requested the issuance of precautionary measures consisting of the suspending the agreement concluded with Amazon on June 11, 2021 following the broadcast of the Ligue 1 2021-2022 season and a new award of lot 3 and lots operated by Amazon for the 2022-2023 to 2023-2024 seasons under non-discriminatory conditions. On November 30, 2022, the French Competition Authority rejected all requests made by Groupe Canal+ (complaint on the merits and request for precautionary measures). Groupe Canal+ and beIN Sports have waived the right to appeal this decision by the French Competition Authority in order to put an end to the deferment in the proceedings brought before the Court of Justice by beIN Sports against the LFP relating to the expiry of the lot 3 contract (see above).\n\n# BeIN Sports vs. Groupe Canal+\n\nAs part of the 2018 call for tenders for the rights to broadcast the Ligue 1 soccer championship for the 2020-2021 to 2023-2024 seasons, beIN Sports was awarded lot 3 and subsequently sub-licensed these rights to Groupe Canal+. Following the return of the Ligue 1 championship broadcasting rights for lots 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7 by Mediapro in January 2021, the French Professional Football League (LFP) subsequently awarded these rights to Amazon on June 11, 2021, for 250 million euros (compared to the 780 million euros paid for these same lots when they were awarded to Mediapro). Considering the price paid by Groupe Canal+ for the rights to broadcast the lot 3 matches compared to the price of the matches sold to Amazon, Groupe Canal+ believes that it has been subject to serious inequality of treatment and discriminatory practices. Accordingly, it has notified the LFP that it will no longer broadcast this lot 3 once the championship resumes in August.\n\n{257}------------------------------------------------\n\nAt the same time, Groupe Canal+ enjoined beIN Sports, in its capacity as licensee of the rights of lot 3, to carry out any legal proceedings to bring about the expiry of the contract relating to lot 3 entered into between beIN Sports and LFP and to refer the matter to the French Competition Authority on the grounds of discriminatory practices and distortion of competition. In view of the inaction of beIN Sports, Groupe Canal+ notified the latter, on July 12, 2021, that it suspended the performance of its obligations under the sub-licensing agreement, considering that beIN Sports itself failed to fulfill its essential obligation to carry out the above-mentioned legal actions. On July 16, 2021, beIN Sports, considering that the suspension of performance of the sub-licensing agreement constituted a manifestly unlawful disturbance and exposed beIN Sports to imminent damages vis-à-vis the LFP, filed an injunction against Groupe Canal+ with the Nanterre Commercial Court, requesting that the Court order Groupe Canal+ to produce, broadcast and pay for the matches in lot 3 of the French Ligue 1 championship, subject to a fine in the event of non-compliance.\n\nOn July 23, 2021, the Nanterre Commercial Court dismissed beIN Sports' requests.\n\nOn July 29, 2021, beIN Sports sued Groupe Canal+ again before the Nanterre Commercial Court to force it to perform its obligations under the sub-licensing agreement. On August 5, 2021, the Commercial Court issued a summary order asking Groupe Canal+ to honor all said obligations pending a decision on the merits of the termination or expiry of the contract. With a limit of 90 days, the fine for non-compliance was determined at one million euros per day. Groupe Canal+ appealed this decision. On March 31, 2022, the Versailles Court of Appeal issued two judgments confirming the interim orders of the Nanterre Commercial Court of July 23, 2021 and August 5, 2021, ordering Groupe Canal+ to continue the execution of the contract relating to Lot no. 3. Groupe Canal+ filed an appeal against the Versailles Court of Appeal ruling on the order of August 5, 2021. BeIN filed an appeal against the Versailles Court of Appeal ruling on the order of July 23, 2021. On May 10, 2023, the Counselor of the Commercial Chamber of the French Supreme Court issued a report on the two appeals. On October 25, 2023, the French Supreme Court dismissed, without providing any reason, the appeal filed by beIN Sports against the Versailles Court of Appeal's decision issued on March 31, 2022. On December 13, 2023, the French Supreme Court also dismissed the appeal filed by Canal+ Group against this March 31, 2022 decision.\n\nFurthermore, on February 2, 2022, beIN Sports filed summary proceedings against Groupe Canal+ before the Paris Commercial Court asking it to rule that the termination clause provided for in the sub-licensing agreement did not comply with the requirements in article 1225 of the French civil code *(Code civil)* and that it was therefore null and void, consequently ordering Groupe Canal+ to fulfill all of its obligations under the sub-licensing agreement. On July 5, 2022, the Commercial Court ruled that the termination clause was valid but that Groupe Canal+ was not entitled to terminate its sub-license agreement with beIN Sports. On August 2, 2022, Groupe Canal+ appealed against this decision before the Paris Court of Appeal. The hearing before the Paris Court of Appeal has been scheduled for April 4, 2024.\n\n# Proceedings before the Bobigny Labor Court\n\nSeveral employees of the Canal+ call center in Saint-Denis have initiated proceedings against Groupe Canal+ with the Bobigny employment tribunal to seek the cancellation of their dismissal on the grounds that the employment protection plan implemented in the call center is discriminatory. In two decisions handed down in May and October 2021, the plaintiffs' case was dismissed and they appealed this decision. The appeal proceedings are ongoing.\n\n# Thierry Ardisson, Ardis, and Télé Paris vs. C8 and SECP\n\nOn September 24, 2019, Thierry Ardisson and the companies Ardis and Télé Paris initiated summary proceedings against C8 and SECP before the Paris Commercial Court for termination of trade relations with no notice, following the non-renewal of the shows \"Les Terriens du Samedi\" and \"Les Terriens du Dimanche\", citing a situation of economic dependence. The plaintiffs sought an order in solidum from C8 and SECP to pay Ardis 5,821,680 euros, Télé Paris 3,611,429 euros and Thierry Ardisson 1 million euros to cover his alleged non-pecuniary losses. On January 21, 2020, a judgment was rendered under which C8 was ordered to pay 811,500 euros to Ardis and 269,333 euros to Télé Paris. Thierry Ardisson's case was dismissed and SECP was found not to have grounds for its claim. On March 16, 2020, Thierry Ardisson, Ardis and Télé Paris appealed this decision. On September 10, 2021, the Paris Court of Appeal ordered C8 to pay 3,800,476 euros to Ardis and 2,293,657 euros to Télé Paris, as well as a total of 417,587 euros for the latter's damages related to layoffs, representing an overall amount of 6.5 million euros. On September 20, 2021, C8 filed an appeal with the French Supreme Court.\n\nOn October 19, 2022, the Cour de Cassation (French Supreme Court) issued its ruling under which it issued a partial annulment of the Court of Appeal's ruling on the determination of the loss resulting from the sudden termination and thus canceled the provisions of the ruling condemning C8 to pay Ardis the sum of 3,800,476 euros and Télé Paris the sum of 2,293,657 euros in damages. The case is referred to the Paris Court of Appeal, which is otherwise composed.\n\nOn August 3, 2023, C8 and SECP entered into a settlement agreement with Télé Paris, thereby putting an end to part of the litigation. The proceedings in relation to Ardis's claims are continuing before the Paris Court of Appeal.\n\n# Groupe Canal+ vs. Technicolor\n\nIn December 2016, Groupe Canal+ and Technicolor entered into an agreement to manufacture and deliver G9 set-top boxes (for mainland France) and G9 Light set-top boxes (for Poland). In 2017, Technicolor challenged the prices agreed with Groupe Canal+ and ultimately decided to terminate this agreement at the end of 2017. As a result, Groupe Canal+ brought summary proceedings against Technicolor before the Nanterre Commercial Court for breach of contract. On December 15, 2017, Groupe Canal+'s claim was rejected. However, on December 6, 2018, the Versailles Court of Appeal ruled in its favor, recognizing the wrongful nature of the termination of the contract by Technicolor. Technicolor filed an appeal with the French Supreme Court which was dismissed on June 24, 2020.\n\nIn parallel, on September 2, 2019, Groupe Canal+ sued Technicolor before the Paris Commercial Court for breach of its contractual commitments. In its complaint, Groupe Canal+ alleged that Technicolor had failed to deliver the G9 and G9 Light set-top boxes in accordance with the manufacturing and delivery agreements entered into between the two companies. Groupe Canal+ requested reimbursement of the additional costs paid and alternative transport costs, the payment of late fees and damages. On October 9, 2019, Technicolor, in turn, brought summary proceedings against Groupe Canal+ as well as Canal+ Réunion, Canal+ Antilles and Canal+ Calédonie before the Nanterre Commercial Court for non-payment. On September 2, 2020, the Paris Commercial Court declared that the matter lay outside its jurisdiction and referred the dispute to the Nanterre Commercial Court. On October 22, 2021, the Nanterre Commercial Court issued a decision under which it acknowledged that Technicolor's termination of the contract was unfair, as were its requests for price increases. The Court also ordered an appraisal to determine the amounts requested by Groupe Canal+ in connection with this dispute. Technicolor appealed this decision. On February 3, 2022, a hearing was held on Technicolor's appeal, which was rejected in a ruling on March 3, 2022. The proceedings before the Nanterre Commercial Court are ongoing with regard to the appraisal ordered.\n\n# \"Free-to-air\" cases\n\nOn April 22, 2021, TF1, TMC, TFX, TF1 Séries Films, LCI, TF1 Films Production and TF1 Acquisition of Rights filed a complaint against Groupe Canal+ and SECP before the Paris Judicial Court, claiming that Canal+'s national free-toair broadcasting in March 2020 during the first lockdown constituted an act of piracy and unfair or prejudicial competition against them. Oral arguments were heard on September 26, 2023. On January 25, 2024, the Paris Judicial Court issued its decision, ordering SECP et Groupe Canal+ to pay GIE TF1 the sum of 681,000 euros and to pay TF1, TMC, TFX, and TF1 Films Productions to pay the sum of 739,062.50 euros. SECP and Groupe Canal+ were also ordered to pay the sum of 100,000 euros for the non-pecuniary loss suffered by the plaintiffs and 20,000 euros under article 700 of the French civil code *(Code civil)* procedure.\n\nOn April 23, 2021, France Télévisions, France 2 Cinéma and France 3 Cinéma filed a lawsuit against SECP before the Paris Judicial Court on similar grounds. On December 9, 2023, the parties entered into a settlement agreement, thereby ending the proceedings.\n\n{258}------------------------------------------------\n\n# UFC Que Choisir against Groupe Canal+ and SECP\n\nOn April 20, 2018 the Direction départementale de la protection des populations des Hauts-de-Seine (DDPP92) took out an injunction against Groupe Canal+ to cease placing its subscribers on contract into enhanced products, a practice which the DDPP92 deemed to be an \"unordered sale.\" At the same time, DDPP92 informed Groupe Canal+ that it had referred the case to the office of the Nanterre Public Prosecutor along with a statement that it deemed Canal+ Group to have committed the offense of a forced sale of services which is prohibited under the French consumer code *(Code de la consommation).* On July 8, 2020, the Nanterre Judicial Court approved a plea bargain agreement between Groupe Canal+ and the Nanterre Deputy Public Prosecutor.\n\nOn April 27, 2021, UFC Que Choisir brought proceedings against Groupe Canal+ and SECP before the Nanterre Judicial Court, as part of a class action for reimbursement of amounts overpaid to subscribers.\n\nIn an order dated November 25, 2022, confirmed by a decision of the Paris Court of Appeal issued on November 14, 2023, the pre-trial judge rejected Groupe Canal+'s motions to dismiss.\n\n# \"Audiovisual production obligations\" case\n\nOn March 24, 2021, the CSA (now Arcom) issued a formal notice to the Canal+ channel to \"comply, in the future, with its obligations to contribute to the development of the production of French films, independent French films and original French-language films\". The breaches referred to by the CSA relate to the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years. On May 19, 2021, Canal+ appealed this notice with the Council of State, which was rejected on January 27, 2023.\n\n# Sacem against Groupe Canal+\n\nOn June 9, 2023, Sacem brought proceedings against Groupe Canal+ before the Nanterre Judicial Court, alleging that Groupe Canal+ had infringed copyrighted works held in its catalog by distributing the TNT SAT offer without authorization since 2007.\n\nGroupe Canal+ is being asked to disclose the following to Sacem, under penalty of a fine, the revenue generated from the sales of reception equipment to which the TNT SAT offer applied, any revenue received from linear television and radio service providers in exchange for their inclusion in the TNT SAT offer, and the list of linear television and radio services included in the TNT SAT offer since its inception. Such information is required in relation to the period from 2007 to 2022.\n\n# Inquiry by US judicial authorities into commercial practices in the advertising industry\n\nOn June 11, 2018, Havas Group received an injunction to provide documents concerning one of its subsidiaries in Spain – Havas Media Alliance WWSL. These documents were sent to the relevant American authorities. This request from the US judicial authorities seems to concern commercial practices followed in the area of discounts and rebates. At this point, Havas Group is not part of any proceedings and no claims have been made against it. There have been no new developments since then.\n\n# Proceeding concerning the services provided by Havas Paris to Business France\n\nOn February 7, 2019, Havas Paris, a subsidiary of Havas SA, was indicted for having benefited from favoritism in an amount of 379,319 euros. This indictment took place as part of a judicial investigation opened by the Paris Prosecutor's Office into illegal favoritism alleged to have been practiced by Business France when it arranged for communications services to be provided by Havas Paris. Havas Paris denies the allegations and has filed an appeal against this decision. Havas Paris's Deputy Chief Executive Officer was indicted on December 21, 2023 for illegal favoritism. He denies the allegations and has filed an appeal against this decision. These indictments have no significant financial or pecuniary consequences for Havas Paris.\n\n# Investigation by the Swiss Competition Commission\n\nFollowing the rejection by referendum on March 11, 2012 of measures to introduce a single price for books in Switzerland, the Swiss Competition Commission (Comco) reopened an investigation into imports of Frenchlanguage books by distributors.\n\nFollowing this procedure, Comco made a final decision on May 27, 2013 under which Diffulivre (a subsidiary of Hachette Livre) was held liable for territorial exclusivity practices with the intention or effect of partitioning the Swiss French-language publishing market. Under this decision, the infringement concerned services provided to publishers of the Hachette group, services provided by Hachette, and Swiss third-party publishers.\n\nThis decision was upheld by the Swiss Administrative Court on October 30, 2019.\n\nOn January 13, 2020, Diffulivre filed an appeal with the Federal Court, which suspended the effects of the Administrative Court's ruling.\n\nIn a decision handed down on August 3, 2022, the Federal Court partially accepted Diffulivre's appeal, considering that only the agreements between Diffulivre and the Swiss publishers, as well as an agreement between Diffulivre and the publisher Harlequin, infringed Swiss competition law. It referred the case back to the Swiss Administrative Court, which will reduce the fine imposed by the Comco in 2013 accordingly.\n\n# Competition investigation in the school textbook market in Spain\n\nFollowing a complaint filed by a publisher, the Spanish Competition Authority (CNMC) carried out searches at the premises of the Anele (the school textbook publishers' trade association) and three publishers (including Anaya, a subsidiary of Hachette Livre), and subsequently launched a sanction procedure in October 2017.\n\nOn May 30, 2019, the CNMC issued its ruling which followed the recommendation of its investigating officers, and ordered Anaya and a number of its subsidiaries to pay total damages of approximately 8 million euros for:\n\n- discussions held between publishers with a view to promoting ethical behavior and ensuring buyers' independence – about providing for a special clause in an Anele Code of conduct that limits the bonuses and gifts offered by publishers to buyers' organizations when those organizations order textbooks, and;\n- discussions between publishers about the terms and conditions for selling digital versions of textbooks when negotiations are carried out with certain regions.\n\nAnaya has filed an appeal against this decision with the Spanish national court (Audiencia Nacional), which had the effect of suspending payment of the fine.\n\n# Class actions against Hachette Book Group\n\nIn 2021, class actions were filed in the United States against Amazon and certain print and e-book publishers, including Hachette Book Group (HBG). The plaintiffs allege that certain agreements between publishers and Amazon constitute price-fixing agreements that breach US antitrust laws. The defendants, including HBG, dispute these allegations, along with the admissibility of the class action. These motions to dismiss were granted by a decision dated September 29, 2022, with the judge considering that the appeals lacked sufficient evidence to succeed. However, as they were dismissed \"without prejudice\", the plaintiffs can amend and re-file their class actions.\n\nAmended appeals were accordingly filed on November 21, 2022, reiterating the arguments already put forward and attempting to resolve the problems identified in the September 29, 2022 ruling. The defendants, including HBG, have again filed motions to dismiss.\n\n# Monla/Lagardère Travel Retail & Chalhoub arbitration\n\nBetween end-2016 and early 2017, Lagardère Travel Retail (LTR), Monla Group SAL Holding (Monla) and Chalhoub Group Limited (Chalhoub) began talks regarding a potential joint response to a request for proposals for a duty free concession at Beirut airport.\n\nOn May 10, 2017, Monla had filed an arbitration claim against LTR and Chalhoub with the International Chamber of Commerce, asserting wrongful behavior in the conduct and suspension of their three-party discussions. Monla was seeking damages (plus miscellaneous expenses) from the respondents for the alleged harm caused, in particular to its image, and for loss of opportunity. The decision handed down by the arbitration tribunal at the end of December 2019 dismissed all of Monla's claims and ordered it to repay the costs incurred by LTR and Chalhoub in the arbitration. LTR has initiated proceedings to enforce the decision, which Monla is trying to resist. Monla may submit an action for annulment of the decision, subject to the applicable legal deadlines.\n\n{259}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Class action against The Paradies Shops\n\nThe Paradies Shops was the victim of a cyberattack on the company's computer servers in October 2020, which resulted in a breach of the personal data of tens of thousands of employees and customers. The parties concerned were informed and were offered credit monitoring services. One of the individuals involved initiated a class action filed in the United States in July 2021. The Paradies Shops filed a motion to dismiss the class action, which was granted by the judge in August 2022. The plaintiff has appealed this decision.\n\n# Disputes with photographers\n\nDisputes are ongoing with freelance photographers or employees who have contributed to magazines published by the Lagardère group. Most of these disputes concern returns of analogue photographic archives and retaining photographs, as well as the resulting operating losses. The proceedings are still ongoing and are progressing in a manner generally favorable to the Group.\n\nIn 2022, a final appeal decision in favor of the Lagardère group marked the end of one of these proceedings, in which very high claims for compensation were made against the Lagardère group.\n\n# WSG India and WSG Mauritius/Indian Premier League contracts\n\nIn 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (\"BCCI\") launched a call for tenders for the worldwide rights to its new cricket competition, the Indian Premier League (IPL), until 2017. WSG India, which became a subsidiary of Lagardère Sports and Entertainment in May 2008, was awarded most of these rights in early 2008, with the remainder awarded to an unrelated operator, MSM.\n\nA global reorganization of the distribution of these rights took place in March 2009 at the initiative of the BCCI. As part of the negotiations, the BCCI granted WSG India the IPL rights worldwide, excluding the Indian subcontinent, for the period from 2009 to 2017.\n\nIn June 2010, the BCCI terminated the 2009/2017 contract to market IPL rights worldwide, excluding the Indian subcontinent. WSG India immediately brought proceedings to protect its rights.\n\nIn spring 2011, the Indian Supreme Court took a series of interim measures that, without calling into question the marketing already carried out by WSG India and without prejudice to the merits of the case, temporarily granted the BCCI, under the supervision of the Court and pending the final ruling, media rights to the IPL outside the Indian subcontinent that are not already marketed by WSG India, as well as recovery of the amounts owed by the broadcasters and held in escrow. An arbitration award was handed down on July 13, 2020 in respect of the proceedings on the merits of the case, dismissing WSG India's compensation claim. Based on this award, the BCCI recovered the amounts held in escrow. WSG India has filed an appeal for annulment of the award on the grounds that it has no legal basis, and has applied to the competent Indian courts to have the sums concerned taken back into escrow. On March 16, 2022, the Bombay High Court issued a ruling granting WSG India's application to set aside the arbitration award handed down on July 13, 2020. The BCCI has appealed against this judgment.\n\nOn October 13, 2010, the BCCI filed a criminal complaint with the Chennai police authorities in India against seven individuals, including the former President of the IPL and four managers of WSG India, alleging breaches of the Indian criminal code in connection with the award to WSG India in March 2009 of certain IPL media rights for the 2009-2017 seasons. An investigation has been ongoing since 2010.\n\nFollowing the Indian tax authorities' audit of WSG India's operations, the company was issued with tax reassessment notices representing an overall liability of around 13.1 million euros as at December 31, 2022. WSG India has paid a deposit for part of the amount and launched an appeal.\n\nLastly, as part of an investigation by the Indian authorities into money laundering allegations concerning the former managers of the BCCI and its commercial partners in the IPL, on May 24, 2016 WSG Mauritius received a notification from Mauritius' Attorney General requesting it to provide certain documents. The hearings before the Attorney General took place in July 2016. WSG India's managers have since received requests for information and documentation, to which WSG India has responded. WSG India and WSG Mauritius are subsidiaries of Lagardère Participation. They are not part of the scope sold to HIG Capital.\n\n# Delta TV vs. Dailymotion\n\nOn March 1, 2022, Dailymotion received an order to pay from Delta TV claiming the sum of 2,065,000 euros in penalties regarding 59 videos which Delta TV claims had been notified in a previous dispute and uploaded again to Dailymotion's platform, in violation of an order of June 3, 2015 which applied the penalty. Dailymotion contested this order to pay in a summons dated March 21, 2022.\n\n# VSD and Georges Ghosn vs. Prisma Media, Rolf Heinz, Gruner+Jahr Communication and Bertelsmann\n\nOn September 12, 2022, VSD and Georges Ghosn, who acquired *VSD* from Prisma Media in 2018, summoned Prisma Media, Rolf Heinz, Gruner+Jahr and Bertelsmann before the Commercial Court of Paris. In particular, they are accused of breaches of their pre-contractual obligation of good faith and information during the negotiations and the purchase of *VSD* and more specifically of providing incorrect accounting estimates, concealing the extent of the losses on the date of the sale and knowingly concealing the number of journalists likely to implement their transfer clause.\n\n# See Tickets class action\n\nIn April 2021, Vivendi Ticketing US LLC (exercising its business as See Tickets US, hereinafter \"See Tickets\") was alerted of activity showing that a third party was able to obtain unauthorized access to certain pages of its website dedicated to the payment of event tickets.\n\nSee Tickets immediately initiated investigations, with the assistance of an expert, and took steps to end this unauthorized access. See Tickets definitively removed the malicious software from its platform in January 2022 and implemented a series of measures to improve its security.\n\nStarting in October 21, 2022, See Tickets notified all persons whose data have been impacted by e-mail. On the same day, it also notified the regulators of the US states concerned.\n\nOn October 28, 2022, a class action lawsuit was filed against See Tickets before the United States District Court for the Central District of California, in which the plaintiffs alleged that See Tickets had failed to adopt adequate security measures to protect the information of users of its ticketing platform, including credit card details, resulting in this security incident. See Tickets was also accused of having delayed notifying the individuals whose data have been impacted and the regulators. The parties submitted the case to mediation on January 12, 2023, which led to a settlement agreement that was preliminarily approved by the Court at the end of May 2023. On October 31, 2023, the Court issued its final approval of the settlement agreement, effectively ending the proceedings.\n\nSee Tickets experienced another information security incident that affected the personal data of individuals who had made purchases on the www.seetickets.com website between February 28, 2023 and July 2, 2023. See Tickets notified the potentially impacted customers and applicable state regulators of this incident on September 5, 2023. At the same time, See Tickets implemented appropriate measures to further protect the security of payment card information provided on its website. Since September 11, 2023, five class actions have been filed in the State of California and these were consolidated by the Court on October 3, 2023. On December 11, 2023, See Tickets was served with a joint complaint, consolidating the claims of these five class actions. A settlement mediation has been scheduled for March 11, 2024.\n\n{260}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Vivendi's tax disputes\n\nRegarding the tax inspections for 2008 to 2012, Vivendi SE was the subject of an assessment with the tax authorities challenging the accounting and tax treatment for the NBC Universal securities received in consideration upon the 2004 disposal of the securities of Vivendi Universal Entertainment and challenging the deduction of the 2.4 billion euros loss on the disposal of these securities. The French National Board for Direct Taxation to which this dispute was referred gave its opinion on December 9, 2016, in which it called for the assessments proposed by the tax authorities to be dropped. The dispute moreover being based on administrative principles, Vivendi asked for its cancellation on the grounds that it was creating new law. On May 29, 2017, the French Council of State favorably received Vivendi's appeal for misuse of authority. By letter dated April 1, 2019 and after various appeals, the tax authorities confirmed the order. On June 18, 2019, Vivendi therefore initiated litigation before the department responsible for the taxation. As no reply was received from the tax authorities, on December 30, 2019, Vivendi filed a complaint before the Administrative Court of Montreuil. On December 2, 2021, the Administrative Court of Montreuil dismissed Vivendi's complaint. On February 9, 2022, Vivendi filed a motion to appeal before the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal. This Court handed down its ruling, which was unfavorable for Vivendi, on December 13, 2023. In February 2024, Vivendi filed a motion before the Council of State to set aside this decision.\n\nRegarding the tax audit for fiscal years 2013 to 2017 in respect of the group's consolidated earnings, on June 14, 2021, Vivendi SE received an adjustment proposal. As at December 31, 2023, these proceedings were still ongoing, pending a response following the referral to the Legal Security and Tax Audit Department of the Directorate General for Public Finances (DGFiP) on March 15, 2022.\n\nRegarding the tax audit of Vivendi SE's individual earnings for fiscal years 2013 to 2016, on June 4, 2020, the tax authorities proposed a set of adjustments for 33 million euros (base) for these four fiscal years. This proposal will lead to a correction of Vivendi's tax losses carried forward and will not result in any current tax liabilities as any tax claimed will be paid by way of foreign tax receivables. By way of reminder, the decision of the Council of State of December 19, 2019 allows Vivendi to seek a refund of any additional corporate tax payment already made for the 2012-2016 period. Following a response from Vivendi on July 21, 2020, the authorities confirmed their position on September 14, 2020. Vivendi does not fully agree with the position taken by the tax auditing authorities, but does not intend, given the issues at stake, to challenge them.\n\nRegarding the tax audit of Vivendi SE for fiscal years 2018 to 2021, an adjustment proposal was received on December 15, 2023, which does not have any significant financial consequences. Vivendi sent a response to this proposal on February 13, 2024 and the proceedings are ongoing.\n\nWith regard to the dispute concerning the right to defer foreign tax receivables upon the exit from the consolidated global profit tax system without any time limitation, the Montreuil Administrative Court issued a first judgment against Vivendi on December 21, 2023 for fiscal year 2017 and a second judgment against Vivendi on February 15, 2024 for fiscal year 2018. Vivendi filed a joint appeal against these two judgments, in the same terms, before the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal in submissions filed on February 21, 2024. For the 2018 and 2019 financial years, the proceedings are still pending before the Montreuil Administrative Court.\n\nIn relation to Canal +, in proposed adjustments dated June 4 and June 7, 2021, the French tax authorities challenged Canal +'s right to break down, by type of service and by VAT rate, its revenue from composite offers comprising services that, if they were marketed separately, would be subject to different VAT rates. The tax authorities did not, however, take any account of scenarios in which, as a result of using this breakdown method, Canal + increased the amount of VAT it paid to the Treasury. They also failed to take\n\ninto account the deductibility of VAT from the corporate tax base for which they expected payment for the years 2016 to 2019. The tax authorities also intend to impose penalties for deliberate non-compliance, even if Canal+ is able to demonstrate that its practices are based on formal positions taken by the tax authorities, both in the context of either direct responses that may have been given to it or previous tax audits or litigation initiated by the audited companies. In a letter dated August 3, 2021, Canal+ formally disputed these assessments. In letters dated March 29 and April 20, 2022, the tax assessments notified to Canal+ were confirmed. Following a hierarchical appeal on June 28 and 29, 2022, the reminders were again confirmed. Canal+ therefore requested that the departmental contact become involved in a final appeal against the assessments that were the subject of a dispute between it and the tax auditing authorities. In a letter dated December 8, 2022, the departmental contact asked the central departments of the Directorate General of Public Finance to intervene, in view of the impact of the assessment proposals. The tax audit in respect of fiscal years 2016 to 2019 is ongoing. No tax has yet been collected under the assessment. With regard to 2020 and 2021, an audit was begun in 2023. As part of these audits, the tax authorities consider that Canal+ does not market television services and therefore refuse to apply the 10% VAT rate for these services and propose to apply the standard rate of 20% to all of Canal+'s revenues. Vivendi Management believes that it has solid legal grounds to defend its positions on the VAT liabilities of its subsidiaries. Vivendi's Management therefore considers that the outcome of the ongoing tax audits is unlikely to have a material impact on the group's financial position or liquidity.\n\nFinally, with respect to Havas, Havas SA brought an action seeking the repayment of the withholding tax paid by the company between 2000 and 2002 on the redistribution of dividends from European subsidiaries. Following a decision by the Administrative Court and later by the Court of Appeal, on July 28, 2017, the Council of State rejected an appeal by Havas against the decision of the Versailles Court of Appeal. This decision permanently ends this tax dispute and means that Havas won't be refunded the withholding tax. However, to restore Havas' right to compensation, three combined actions were taken: (i) a claim before the European Commission, (ii) an application for referral to the European Court of Human Rights and (iii) a claim for compensation under an action for damages against the French state. In a decision dated May 19, 2022, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the application was inadmissible. In an application filed on May 29, 2018 at the Cergy-Pontoise Administrative Court, Havas sought compensation for the loss it had suffered as a result of the decision not to admit its appeal to the Cour de Cassation (French Supreme Court). This is Havas's only pending dispute concerning the withholding tax. The loss for which it is seeking compensation is 59 million euros (amount of the withholding tax paid plus late-payment interest that it should have received). On March 28, 2023, the Court dismissed Havas' claims. On May 26, 2023, Havas filed an application before the Versailles Administrative Court of Appeal to set aside the judgment of the Administrative Court and order the State to pay it compensation for the loss suffered.\n\nLastly, when GVT was sold to Telefónica Brasil in May 2015, Vivendi realized a capital gain that was subject to withholding tax in Brazil. On March 2, 2020, the Brazilian tax authorities challenged the methods used to calculate this capital gain and ordered Vivendi to pay 1.2 billion Brazilian reals (approximately 226 million euros) in taxes, late-payment interest and penalties. This additional tax assessment and the refusal to take into account the reduction of the capital gain resulting from price adjustments were unsuccessfully challenged before the administrative authorities. Vivendi has brought an appeal in order to assert its rights, and believes it has a strong chance of success. Accordingly, no provision has been recorded in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 in respect of this assessment.\n\n{261}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-261-1\"></span><span id=\"page-261-0\"></span>**NOTE 12.

PENSION BENEFITS AND RELATED OBLIGATIONS**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\n# **• Post-employment benefits**\n\nPost-employment benefits include end-of-service payments, retirement schemes, as well as life insurance and healthcare benefits granted to the retirees of certain subsidiaries (primarily in the US).\n\nCommitments relating to post-employment benefits mainly concern subsidiaries in the euro zone and the United Kingdom. In the case of Vivendi, virtually all group employees enjoy retirement benefits under employee defined contribution plans, which are incorporated into local social security schemes and multi-employer schemes, or defined benefit plans, which are typically managed under group pension plans. The Group's plan financing policy is in line with applicable public regulations and obligations.\n\n# **• Other long-term benefits**\n\nOther long-term benefits are entered in the balance sheet as provisions. These include commitments relating to incentives associated with length of service and to mutual insurance.\n\nThis provision is valued according to the projected unit credit method.\n\nExpenses related to these commitments are recognized in the operating income, with the exception of interest expenses net of the expected return on assets, which is recognized in financial income.\n\n# 12.2.1. Types of plans\n\n# **• Employee defined benefit plans**\n\nIn line with the revised IAS 19 \"Employee benefits\", the Group's commitments under employee defined benefit plans, and likewise their cost, are valued by actuaries in accordance with the projected unit credit method. Valuations are carried out each year for the various plans.\n\nThese plans are either \"funded\", in which case their assets are managed separately from and independently of the Group's, or \"not funded\", in which case the commitment appears as a liability on the balance sheet. In the case of funded plans, they may be funded by investments in different instruments, such as insurance policies or equity securities and bonds, excluding Group debt instruments or shares.\n\nFor funded employee defined benefit plans, the shortfall or surplus of the assets' fair value compared to the discounted value of the obligations is recognized as a balance sheet liability or asset. If plan assets exceed recognized obligations, a financial asset is generated up to the present value of expected future refunds and reductions in future contributions. If such a surplus is not available or does not represent any future financial benefit, it is not recognized.\n\nCommitments associated with employee benefits are valued using assumptions as to future wages, age when rights are claimed, mortality rate and rate of inflation, and then discounted using the interest rate of firstclass long-term private bonds. The discount rate is thus determined for each country, by reference to the return on AA-rated corporate bonds with an equivalent maturity to the duration of the plans valued, generally based on representative indices. The benchmark rates used for primary plans are iBoxx AA Corporate and Merrill Lynch AA Corporate on the valuation date of the plans maturing in a time frame comparable to the average horizon of the particular plan in question. The benchmark rates used for these primary plans were not changed during the fiscal year.\n\nA cost for past services is generated when the company institutes an employee defined benefit plan or changes benefit levels in an existing plan, and the cost for past services is immediately recognized as an expense.\n\nThe actuarial cost recorded in operating income for employee defined benefit plans includes the cost of services provided during the fiscal year, the cost of past services, and the effects of any reductions or liquidation of the plan.\n\nThe financial component, recognized in other financial income and expenses, is comprised of the accretion effect of commitments, net of the expected return on plan assets using the discount rate used to measure commitments.\n\nActuarial differences arise mainly from changes in assumptions and from the difference between the results using the actuarial assumptions and the actual outcome of the employee defined benefit plans. Actuarial differences are recognized in full on the balance sheet, with an offsetting entry in equity except for other long-term benefits for which the effects of the changes are recognized in profit and loss.\n\n# **• Employee defined contribution plans**\n\nCertain benefits are also provided under employee defined contribution plans. The contributions for these plans are entered as personnel costs when they are incurred.\n\n# 12.2.2. The Group's employee defined benefit plans\n\nThe Group has employee defined benefit plans, in particular in the United Kingdom.\n\nThese plans are managed and monitored by trustees. In accordance with current legislation, the trustees implement an investment strategy to ensure the best long-term returns on investment with a level of risk that is appropriate to the nature and length of the agreements. The manager is in charge of the daily management of assets in accordance with the defined strategy.\n\nThe plans are analyzed on a regular basis by an independent actuary.\n\n{262}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Assets and liabilities included on the balance sheet**\n\n|                                                                | At

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nThe valuation and accounting arrangements for share subscription or share purchase plans relating to shares in the parent company and its subsidiaries are set out in IFRS 2 \"Share-based payment\".\n\nThe granting of shares and stock options is a benefit for their beneficiaries and as such counts as supplementary compensation. These benefits are recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis in the vesting period against an increase in equity for plans that can be repaid in the form of shares and as debts to staff for plans that can be repaid in cash.\n\nThey are valued at the time of their granting based on the fair value of the equity instruments granted.\n\n# 12.3.1. Bolloré SE free share allocation plan\n\nThe Bolloré Group granted free Bolloré SE shares to Group employees. These transactions were completed in accordance with the conditions set:\n\n- by Bolloré SE's General Shareholders' Meeting of May 29, 2019 for the plans approved at the Board of Directors' meetings of March 12, 2020, March 4, 2021, and March 10, 2022;\n- by Bolloré SE's General Shareholders' Meeting of May 25, 2022 for the plans approved at the Board of Directors' meetings of May 25, 2022, March 14, 2023, and July 28, 2023.\n\nThe Group applied IFRS 2 \"Share-based payment\" to this free share allocation plan. On the grant dates of March 12, 2020, March 4, 2021, March 10, 2022, May 25, 2022, March 14, 2023, and July 28, 2023, the fair value of the shares granted was calculated by an independent expert, this value equaling the expense to be recognized for the period corresponding to the vesting period of the shares.\n\n{265}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe fair value of the shares is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. This amount is included in the income statement under \"Personnel costs\" with an offsetting entry in equity. The employer's contributions due under these plans were immediately recognized as expenses. In 2023, the expense relating to all Bolloré SE share allocation plans was 5.3 million euros, compared with 4.5 million euros in 2022 (excluding the\n\nTransportation and Logistics business, classified as discontinued operations and assets held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5).\n\nBolloré SE plans 2020 2021 2022-03 2022-05 **2023-03 2023-07 Allocation conditions** Grant date March 12, 2020 March 4, 2021 March 10, 2022 May 25, 2022 March 14, 2023 July 28, 2023 Number of shares originally granted 765,000 2,563,500 606,000 3,652,500 631,000 80,000 Share price on grant date (in euros) 2.50 4.060 4.40 4.90 5.07 5.95 Vesting period 36 months 36 months 36 months 36 months 36 months 36 months Lock-up period None at the end of the vesting period, i.e. March 12, 2023 None at the end of the vesting period, i.e. March 4, 2024 None at the end of the vesting period, i.e. March 10, 2025 None at the end of the vesting period, i.e. May 25, 2025 None at the end of the vesting period, i.e. March 14, 2026 None at the end of the vesting period, i.e. July 28, 2026 **Main assumptions** Dividend rate (as a percentage) 2.4 1.5 1.4 1.2 1.2 1.0 Risk-free rate (as a percentage) 0 to 2 years 0 to 2 years 0 to 2 years 0 to 2 years 2.89 to 2 years 3.23 to 2 years 0 to 5 years 0 to 5 years 0 to 5 years 0 to 5 years 2.74 to 5 years 2.87 to 5 years Fair value of the option (including lock-up discount) (in euros) 2.32 3.88 4.22 4.72 4.89 5.78 **AT DECEMBER 31, 2023** Number of remaining shares(1) 0 2,493,500 606,000 3,632,500 631,000 80,000 Expense recognized in profit and loss (in millions of euros) (0.1) (1.3) (0.9) (2.2) (0.8) (0.1)\n\n(1) The plan approved on March 12, 2020 matured on March 12, 2023 and gave rise to a capital increase of 765,000 shares. See note 10 – Equity and earnings per share.\n\n# 12.3.2. Plans granted by Vivendi\n\n# **• Vivendi performance share plans**\n\nOn March 8, 2023, Vivendi's Supervisory Board confirmed the final allocation of the 2020 performance share plan, for 100% of the initial award.\n\nOn March 8, 2023, Vivendi SE also awarded its employees and senior executives 1,915 thousand performance shares, including 247,500 to members of the Executive Committee. The terms and conditions of the grant are set out in the Vivendi 2023 financial report.\n\nOn July 28, 2022, Vivendi SE awarded employees and senior executives 1,900 thousand performance shares, including 247,500 to members of the Executive Committee.\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, there remained 4,667 thousands performance shares. The average remaining time before delivery of performance shares is 2.0 years. 897 thousand shares were vested as at December 31, 2023, including cancellations over the year of 97 thousand share following the departure of certain beneficiaries as well as a positive adjustment by a decision of Vivendi's Management Board on November 13, 2023 to vest 57 thousand performance shares. The conditions of this adjustment, which has no impact on the calculation of the accounting expense related to the performance shares in question, are described in detail in Vivendi's 2023 financial report.\n\nIn 2023, the expense related to all the performance share plans awarded by Vivendi SE was 11 million euros, compared to 12 million euros in 2022.\n\n# **• Group savings plan and Vivendi leveraged plan**\n\nOn July 20, 2023, Vivendi SE carried out an employee shareholding transaction through the sale of treasury shares restricted to employees of the French subsidiaries who were members of the group savings plan and corporate officers of the Vivendi group. The shares were previously repurchased by Vivendi SE under the authorizations granted by Vivendi's General Shareholders' Meeting on April 24, 2023.\n\nBy way of reminder, on July 26, 2022, Vivendi SE had carried out an employee shareholding transaction through the sale of treasury shares under a group savings plan and a leveraged plan restricted to the group's employees, retirees and corporate officers. The shares had previously been repurchased by Vivendi SE under the authorizations granted by Vivendi's General Shareholders' Meetings on April 20, 2020 and April 15, 2019.\n\nThe valuation assumptions for the 2023 plan can be found in Vivendi's 2023 financial report.\n\nAs part of the group savings plan, 1,597 thousand shares were acquired in 2023 through an employee investment fund at a price of 8.171 euros per share, compared with 1,394 thousand shares acquired in 2022 at 9.298 euros per share. In 2023, no expense was recognized in respect of the group savings plan, compared with 0.3 million euros in 2022 (excluding Editis, which was classified as an asset held for sale under IFRS 5).\n\nUnder the leveraged plan, 7,000 thousand shares had been acquired in 2022 through a company mutual fund at a price of 9.298 euros per share. The leveraged plan entitled employees, retirees, corporate officers, directors and members of the Supervisory Board who are beneficiaries of Vivendi SE and its French and foreign subsidiaries, to acquire Vivendi shares at a discounted price and to ultimately receive capital gains (calculated pursuant to the terms and conditions of the plan) attached to 10 shares for each share acquired. This transaction had been underwritten by a financial institution commissioned by Vivendi. In 2022, the expense recognized for the leveraged plan was 1.2 million euros (excluding Editis, which was classified as an asset held for sale under IFRS 5).\n\n# 12.3.3. Dailymotion's long-term incentive plan\n\nSome senior executives of Dailymotion benefit from a long-term incentive plan, covering a period up to June 30, 2026, indexed to the increase in the value of Dailymotion at the time of disposal of at least 10% of the company's capital or on the basis of an independent expert valuation carried out at the plan's maturity compared to its acquisition price at June 30, 2015. Should the value of Dailymotion increase, the amount of compensation under the incentive plan is capped at a percentage of this increase, depending on the beneficiaries. Pursuant to IFRS 2, an expense must be estimated for the cost of this compensation and recognized at each closing date up to the date of payment.\n\n{266}------------------------------------------------\n\n# 12.3.4.

TAXES**\n\n# Accounting principles\n\nThe Group calculates its corporate income tax in accordance with the tax law in force at the time.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 12 \"Income taxes\", the timing differences between the book values of assets and liabilities and their tax-base values give rise to recognition of a deferred tax asset or liability, according to the variable carryforward method using the tax rate adopted or virtually adopted on the closing date.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized for all timing differences unless the deferred tax is generated by goodwill or by the initial recognition of an asset or liability which is not a business combination and does not affect either accounting or fiscal income on the transaction date.\n\nA deferred tax is recognized for all fiscal timing differences connected with shareholdings in subsidiaries, associate companies and joint ventures or capital expenditure in branches, unless the date on which the timing difference is to be reversed is within the Group's control and it is probable that it will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognized for the carryforward of tax losses and of unused tax credits insofar as it is probable that there will in the future be sufficient taxable income to which these tax losses and unused tax credits can be applied or if there are liability timing differences.\n\nThe book value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each fiscal year and, where necessary, revalued or reduced, to reflect changes in the likelihood of generating taxable profits resulting in these deferred tax assets being used. To assess the likelihood of generating an available taxable profit, the track record of results over past fiscal years is taken into account along with forecasts for future results, non-recurring items that are unlikely to reoccur in the future and the tax strategy. As a result, the evaluation of the Group's ability to use its tax loss carryforwards relies largely on judgment. If the Group's future tax results were to vary materially from what was anticipated, the Group would then be required to revise the book value of the deferred tax assets up or down, which could have a material effect on the Group's balance sheet and results.\n\nIn line with IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\n\n{267}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-267-0\"></span>**13.1.

Vivendi tax consolidation and consolidated global profit system\n\nVivendi SE benefits from the tax consolidation system and, up until December 31, 2011 inclusive, it benefited from the \"Consolidated global profit\" system pursuant to article 209 quinquies of the French general tax code *(Code général des impôts).* As from January 1, 2012, Vivendi SE has only benefited from the tax consolidation system.\n\n- The tax consolidation system allows Vivendi to fiscally consolidate the profits and losses of the French companies at least 95% directly or indirectly controlled, i.e., as at December 31, 2023, mainly entities belonging to Groupe Canal+, Havas, Prisma Media and Gameloft in France, as well as the companies involved in the Group's development projects in France (Vivendi Village, Dailymotion, etc.).\n- Up to December 31, 2011, the approved consolidated global profit system allowed Vivendi to fiscally consolidate its profits and losses with those of Group companies at least 50% directly or indirectly controlled, both in France and abroad. It initially received approval for a five-year period, namely from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2008, which was renewed on May 19, 2008 for a three-year period, namely from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2011. For reference, on July 6, 2011, Vivendi filed a further application with the French Ministry of Finance to renew its authorization to use the consolidated global profit tax system for a three-year period from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014.\n- Changes in French tax law in 2011 ended the consolidated global profit tax system for companies ending their fiscal years starting September 6, 2011 and capped the use of tax loss carryforwards at 60% of taxable profit. Since 2012, the allocation of tax losses carried forward has been capped at 50% of taxable profit.\n\nThe French tax consolidation and consolidated global profit systems have the following impact on the valuation of Vivendi's tax attributes (tax losses, foreign tax receivables and carryforwards):\n\n• as Vivendi considers that its entitlement to use the consolidated global profit system was effective until the end of the authorization granted by the French Ministry of Finance (i.e. until December 31, 2011), in 2012, Vivendi submitted a 366 million-euro refund request with respect to the 2011 fiscal year. At the end of the proceedings conducted before the administrative bodies, the French Council of State, by its decision of October 25, 2017, recognized Vivendi's right to make a claim of reasonable confidence authorizing it to apply the consolidated profit system over the entire period covered by the authorization, therefore including the period ended December 31, 2011;\n\n{268}------------------------------------------------\n\n- as Vivendi considered that the foreign tax receivables held by it upon exiting the consolidated global profit tax system can be carried forward until expiry of the authorization, Vivendi asked for repayment of the tax paid for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012. At the end of the proceedings before the administrative courts, the Council of State, in its decision of December 19, 2019, recognized Vivendi's right to use foreign tax receivables on exiting the consolidated global profit system. In addition, in light of the decision of the Regional Court in its litigation relating to the year 2012, Vivendi requested a refund of tax due for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. The decision of the French Council of State of December 19, 2019 led the tax authorities to issue a refund of the tax paid by Vivendi for 2012 and to automatically reduce the tax paid by Vivendi for 2015;\n- having won its case before the Council of State, which recognized (i) Vivendi's right to apply the consolidation system until the end of the authorization it held (Council decision of October 25, 2017 no. 403320 for the 2011 fiscal year) and (ii) Vivendi's right to use foreign tax receivables upon exiting the system in accordance with the provisions of article 122a of the French general tax code *(Code général des impôts),* i.e. over five years (Council decision of December 19, 2019 no. 426730 for the 2012 fiscal year), Vivendi sued in relation to the enforceability of the rule capping deferral at five years. The purpose of this dispute is to restore Vivendi's right to use the tax receivables still available on exiting the consolidated global profit system, representing 793 million euros. Vivendi also filed a complaint with the tax authorities demanding reimbursement of the tax paid for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, for 46 million euros. The outstanding tax receivables carried forward as at December 31, 2023 were 747 million euros. The proceedings are continuing before the administrative courts and Vivendi will, in 2024, submit a claim to request that its available foreign tax credits be set against the tax paid in 2021;\n- as a reminder, after taking into account the consequences of ongoing tax audits over the amount of losses accepted by the tax authorities, Vivendi SE carried forward 201 million euros in losses at January 1, 2021, fully recognized in the calculation of corporate income tax for the 2021 fiscal year. Vivendi SE therefore did not carry forward any more losses as at December 31, 2021. Given the reported taxable income for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, Vivendi carried forward a loss estimated at 119 million euros as at December 31, 2023. The amount of this loss does not include the amount of the losses that could be reinstated in favor of Vivendi SE under the ongoing NBC Universal litigation, in which Vivendi SE is requesting the reinstatement of 2.4 billion euros of losses;\n- at its meetings held on December 13, 2023 and January 30, 2024, Vivendi's Supervisory Board authorized the Management Board to review the possibility of splitting Vivendi into several entities, each of which would be listed on the stock market, and structured around Groupe Canal+, Havas, a company combining publishing and distribution assets through the majority stake in the Lagardère group and the 100% stake in Prisma Media, and an investment company holding listed and unlisted financial interests in the culture, media and entertainment sectors. In this context, given the uncertainty weighing on Vivendi SE's tax consolidation group, no deferred tax asset was recognized as at December 31, 2023 in respect of the amount of losses carried forward by Vivendi SE.\n\n# 13.1.4. Tax liabilities relating to discontinued operations and assets held for sale\n\nBolloré Logistics and its subsidiaries generated taxes totaling –86.7 million euros in 2023 and (for comparison) –108.5 million euros in 2022.\n\nIn addition, the activities of Bolloré Africa Logistics and its subsidiaries and Editis generated taxes in 2022 of –89 million euros and –16 million euros, respectively.\n\nThe tax effects discontinued operations or assets held for sale generated an impact of 17.3 million euros in 2023 (see note 1 – Highlights) and –105.8 million euros in 2022 (disposal of BAL).\n\n# <span id=\"page-268-0\"></span>**13.2.

As at December 31, 2023, goodwill is recorded in the balance sheet for a<br>net book value of 9,762 million euros compared to total assets of<br>59,981 million euros.

We familiarized ourselves with<br>the key assumptions adopted for all of the CGUs or groups of CGUs and,<br>according to the case:<br>• reconciled the business forecasts underlying the determination of the<br>cash flows with the information available, including market outlooks<br>and past achievements, and with Management's latest estimates<br>(assumptions, budgets, strategic plans, where applicable);<br>• compared the infinite growth rates used for the forecast cash flows with<br>the market analyses and the consensus of the principal professionals<br>concerned;<br>• compared the discount rates used with our internal databases, by<br>including financial evaluation specialists in our teams;<br>• examined the selection of companies from among transaction or stock<br>market

consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\n# **NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE STATEMENT**\n\nWe attest that the consolidated non-financial performance statement provided for in article L. 225-102-1 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)* is included in the disclosures relating to the Group presented in the management report, it being specified that, in accordance with article L. 823-10 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* we have not verified the fairness of the information contained in this statement or its consistency with the consolidated financial statements that must be verified in a report by an independent third party.\n\n# **REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS**\n\n# **PRESENTATION FORMAT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT**\n\nIn accordance with the professional practice standard on the due diligence of Statutory Auditors in relation to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with the single European electronic information format, we have also verified compliance with this format defined by European delegated regulation no. 2019/815 of December 17, 2018 in the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended for inclusion in the annual financial report referred to in I of article L. 451-1-2 of the French monetary and financial code *(Code monétaire et financier),* which have been drawn up under the responsibility of the Chairman and Chief Excecutive Officer.

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in article L. 821-55 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the company or the quality of management of the affairs of the company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,\n\n# **REPORT TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE**\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as significant audit findings. We also bring to its attention any significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration referred to in article 6 of regulation (EU) no. 537/2014, confirming our independence pursuant to the rules applicable in France as defined in particular by articles L. 821-27 to L. 821-34 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)* but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n\n- evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management in the consolidated financial statements;\n- assesses the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the Statutory Auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities included in the consolidation scope to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The Statutory Auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements as well as for the audit opinion.\n\nand in the French code of ethics for statutory auditors. *(Code de déontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes).* Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Chamalières, April 22, 2024\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\n| AEG Finances                 | Wolff et Associés |\n|------------------------------|-------------------|\n| French Member of             |                   |\n| Grant Thornton International |                   |\n| Samuel Clochard              | Patrick Wolff     |\n\n{281}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-281-1\"></span><span id=\"page-281-0\"></span>**6.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n# **6.1.4.1. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE FISCAL YEAR**\n\nThere were no significant events during the year.\n\n# **6.1.4.2. ACCOUNTING METHODS AND PRINCIPLES**\n\nThe annual financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles, standards and methods taken from the 2014 French General Chart of Accounts, in compliance with ANC regulation no. 2014-03 and all subsequent amending regulations as well as the further opinions and recommendations of the French national accounting council (Conseil national de la comptabilité) and the French Accounting Regulatory Committee.\n\nGeneral accounting standards were applied in line with the prudential principle, according to the following basic assumptions:\n\n# **INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**\n\nNon-current assets are valued at cost of acquisition, the value at which they were contributed, or at the cost of production.\n\nAmortization and depreciation for impairment are calculated on a straightline basis in accordance with the expected useful life of the assets.\n\nThe principal useful lifetimes applied for the acquisition of new assets are as follows:\n\n# **NON-CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS**\n\nEquity investments are recorded at their historical acquisition cost or their transfer value. The acquisition costs for the equity investments are recorded when incurred. At the end of the fiscal year, an impairment is booked when the net asset value is lower than the balance sheet value. The net asset value • going concern;\n\n- consistency of accounting methods from one fiscal year to another;\n- independence of the fiscal years.\n\nAdditionally, they were prepared in accordance with the general rules regarding the preparation and presentation of annual financial statements. The basic method used for the valuation of accounting entries is the historical cost method.\n\n| Software and licenses               | 3 to 5 years   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Buildings                           | 15 to 20 years |\n| Fixtures and fittings               | 10 to 20 years |\n| Other property, plant and equipment | 3 to 10 years  |\n\nis calculated according to the revalued net book value, profitability, future prospects and the value in use of the shareholding.\n\nThe technical loss from merger, if any, is included in the net book value of the underlying assets during impairment tests.\n\n# **TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES**\n\nReceivables are valued at nominal value. A provision for impairment is made when the net asset value is lower than the book value.\n\n# **BOND ISSUE COSTS**\n\nBond issue costs are recognized under deferred expenses and are amortized over the life of the bond. In the event of repayment of the loan, the amount of these costs is recognized as an expense.\n\n# **SEVERANCE PAY AND PENSIONS**\n\nLegal or conventional severance pay and supplementary pensions for personnel in service are entered under off-balance sheet commitments, in accordance with the option provided by article L. 123-13 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)*.\n\nFor the valuation of its retirement commitments, Compagnie de l'Odet applies method 2 of ANC recommendation no. 2013-02.\n\nThe amount of the commitment is valued using the PUC (Projected Unit Credit) method based on the following assumptions:\n\n• gross discount rate: 4%;\n\n- inflation rate: 2%;\n- nominal salary increase: 2.70%.\n\nThere are no specific commitments towards the governing bodies or executive management.\n\n{287}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **6.1.5.

We believe that the evidence we have obtained provides an appropriate, sufficient basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are set out in the section entitled \"Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors with respect to the auditing of annual financial statements\" of this report.\n\n# **INDEPENDENCE**\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence requirements of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)* and the French code of ethics for statutory auditors *(Code de déontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes)* for the period from January 1, 2023 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non audit services referred to in article 5(1) of regulation (EU) no. 537/2014.\n\n# **JUSTIFICATION OF OUR ASSESSMENTS – KEY AUDIT MATTERS**\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of articles L. 821-53 and R. 821-180 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)* relating to the justification of our assessments, we would like to inform you of the key audit matters relating to the risks of material misstatement which, according to our professional judgement, were the most important for the audit of the annual financial statements for the year, as well as the responses we have given in relation to these risks.\n\nSuch assessments are thus part of our audit of the annual financial statements considered as a whole, approved in the context described above, and of the formation of our opinion expressed above. We express no opinion on items in these annual financial statements considered individually.\n\n# **VALUATION OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND FINANCIAL ASSETS**\n\n*(note 2 to the annual financial statements)*\n\n| Key audit matter

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the annual financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement. \"Reasonable assurance\" means a high level of assurance, but does not entail a guarantee that an audit performed in accordance with professional standards will systematically detect any material misstatement. Misstatements may result from fraud or error and are considered material where it can reasonably be expected that, considered individually or cumulatively, they may influence the business decisions made by users of these financial statements, based on the latter.\n\nAs stated in article L. 821-55 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* our assignment to certify the accounts does not consist of guaranteeing the viability or the quality of the management of the company. Statutory Auditors exercise their professional judgement throughout audits conducted in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France. In addition, Statutory Auditors:\n\n• identify and assess the risks of the annual financial statements containing material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, and define and implement audit procedures for such risks, and collect evidence they consider sufficient and appropriate on which to base their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than that of a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, falsification, voluntary omissions, misrepresentation or the circumventing of internal control;\n\n# **REPORT TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE**\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee, which outlines the scope of the audit work and the work programme implemented, as well as the findings of our work. We also inform, where appropriate, the significant internal control weaknesses that we have identified with respect to the procedures relating to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information.\n\nIncluded in the information disclosed in the report to the Audit Committee are the risks of material misstatements that we consider to have been the most significant for the audit of the financial statements for the year and which therefore constitute the key audit matter, which it is our responsibility to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in article 6 of regulation (EU) no. 537-2014 confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France as established in\n\n- become aware of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to define audit procedures that are appropriate to the circumstances, and not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control;\n- assess the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as the information concerning them provided in the annual financial statements;\n- assess how appropriately management applies the going concern accounting policy and, depending on the evidence gathered, whether there is significant uncertainty related to events or circumstances likely to affect the company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the evidence gathered up to the date of their report, taking into account that subsequent circumstances or events could affect business continuity. If they conclude that there is significant uncertainty, they direct the readers of the report to the information provided in the annual financial statements concerning such uncertainty or, if this information is not provided or is not relevant, they certify the financial statements with reservations, or refuse to certify them;\n- assess the overall presentation of the annual financial statements and evaluate whether the annual financial statements reflect their underlying transactions and events so as to give a true and fair view of them.\n\nparticular under articles L. 821-27 to L. 821-34 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce)* and in the French code of ethics for statutory auditors *(Code de déontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes).* If necessary, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks to our independence and the safeguards applied.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Chamalières, April 22, 2024\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nAEG finances French member of Grant Thornton International Samuel Clochard Patrick Wolff\n\nPatrick Wolff\n\n{295}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-295-1\"></span><span id=\"page-295-0\"></span>**7.

Dividends**\n\n# **4.1. Distribution of dividends for the past three fiscal years**\n\nThe amount of the dividends per share distributed for the three previous fiscal years were as follows:\n\n| Fiscal year                        | 2022      | 2021      | 2020      |\n|------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Number of shares                   | 6,585,990 | 6,585,990 | 6,585,990 |\n| Dividends (in euros)               | 3.60(1)   | 3.60(1)   | 3(1)      |\n| Amount paid (in millions of euros) | 23.7      | 23.7      | 19.8      |\n\n(1) Since January 1, 2018, dividends received by natural persons that are tax domiciled in France are subject to a single flat-rate withholding tax (PFU or flat tax) of 30% at the time\n\nof payment, i.e. 12.8% for income tax and 17.2% for social contributions.\n\nIndividuals whose reference taxable income for the previous year was lower than a certain threshold (50,000 euros for single, widowed or divorced taxpayers, 75,000 euros for taxpayers who file jointly) may request an exemption from the withholding of the flat income tax (12.8%).\n\nThe request must be made, under the shareholders' responsibility, by November 30 at the latest of the year preceding the dividend payment.\n\nAt the time of their declaration, dividends may also optionally be subject to the progressive income tax scale, after the application of a 40% rebate. If applicable, this option gives rise to a regularization of the income tax paid in respect of the single flat tax.\n\n<span id=\"page-302-5\"></span>In all cases, dividends received must be declared the year following their payment and may give rise, if applicable, to additional income tax in respect of the exceptional contribution on high revenues.\n\n# **4.2.

Dividend registration**\n\nThe legal time limit on unclaimed dividend entitlements is five years from the date of payment. Dividends left unclaimed after this five-year period will be paid to the French State.\n\n{303}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-303-0\"></span>**5.

SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE BYLAWS, THE CHARTER AND THE INTERNAL RULES OF PROCEDURE CONCERNING THE MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND MANAGEMENT BODIES**\n\nThe provisions related to the administrative and management bodies appear in chapter III of the bylaws.\n\nThe Board of Directors is made up of three to eighteen members, subject to the exemption provided by law in the event of a merger.\n\nTheir term of office lasts three years, and the age limit for exercising their duties is set at 99 years.\n\nThe rules of procedure of the Board of Directors include a provision requiring each director to allocate 10% of the compensation received for performing his/her duties as a director to purchase shares in Compagnie de l'Odet until the number of shares held reaches the equivalent of one year's compensation received.\n\nThe Board of Directors elects from among its members a Chairman/ Chairwoman of the Board of Directors, a natural person who organizes the Board's work and ensures that the directors are in a position to fulfill their assignments.\n\nRegardless of the period for which they have been conferred, the Chairman/ Chairwoman's duties end automatically at the end of the first Ordinary General Meeting held after the date on which he/she reaches the age of 75. However, the Board of Directors may in this case decide to renew the Chairman/Chairwoman's term of office for one or two periods of two years.\n\nThe Board may appoint from among its members one or more Vice-Chairmen/ Vice-Chairwomen to preside at Board meetings in the event of the absence or incapacity of the Chairman/Chairwoman.\n\nFailing this, the position of Chairman/Chairwoman falls on a member of the Board especially chosen by his/her colleagues at each meeting.\n\nThe Board may also appoint a secretary who may be selected from outside the members of the Board.\n\n{328}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Executive management of the company is carried out, under its responsibility, either by the Chairman/Chairwoman of the Board of Directors or by another natural person appointed by the Board of Directors, bearing the title of Chief Executive Officer.\n\nUpon the proposal of the Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors may mandate one or more persons (but no more than five) to assist him/her as Deputy Chief Executive Officer.\n\n# **1.5.3.

RIGHTS, PRIVILEGES AND RESTRICTIONS ATTACHED TO SHARES**\n\nArticle 11 of the bylaws provides that, apart from the voting right granted to it by law, each share entitles the holder to a portion, in proportion to the number and par value of existing shares, of the share capital, the profits or the proceeds of liquidation.\n\nArticle 19 of the bylaws states that:\n\n*\"[…] The voting rights attached to shares are proportional to the capital share they represent. At equivalent par value, each capital share or dividend share carries one voting right.*\n\n*However, a double voting right compared to that granted to other shares, taking into account the portion of the share capital that they represent, is granted to all fully paid-up shares held in registered form in the name of the same shareholder for at least four years […]\".*\n\n# **1.5.5. MEASURES TO BE TAKEN TO AMEND SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS**\n\nThe company's bylaws do not provide more restrictive provisions than the law in this area.\n\n# **1.5.6.

INTERNAL CHARTER FOR CHARACTERIZING AGREEMENTS**\n\nIn light of changes in regulations and various standards, the Board of Directors, at its meeting on September 12, 2019, adopted a new internal charter for the Group to characterize agreements and as such distinguish, firstly, between agreements subject to the Board's \"prior authorization\" scheme and approval by the General Shareholders' Meeting (so-called \"regulated\" agreements) and, secondly, between agreements regarding ongoing operations concluded under normal conditions (known as \"arm's length\" agreements).\n\nIn addition, after noting the conditions of application of the legal regime governing regulated agreements and the various phases of the control procedure, the charter, pursuant to the provisions of article L. 22-10-12 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* provides for the implementation of a procedure allowing a regular assessment as to whether the arm's length agreements fulfill these conditions.\n\n# **TYPOLOGY OF ONGOING AGREEMENTS CONCLUDED UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS**\n\nThe typology, established on the basis of agreements concluded regularly within the Group, was determined based on the work of the financial and legal departments and assessed together with the Statutory Auditors.\n\nThe following are regarded as arm's length agreements and therefore not subject to prior authorization:\n\n- invoices from Compagnie de l'Odet to other Group companies, related in particular to administrative assistance or management services;\n- asset transfers from any Group company within the limit of 1.5 million euros per transaction;\n- options or authorizations granted within the framework of a Group tax regime (tax consolidation agreement);\n- disposals of securities of minor importance that are purely administrative in nature, or disposals of securities as part of a reclassification of securities\n\n# **INTERNAL ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE FOR ARM'S LENGTH AGREEMENTS**\n\nThe conditions governing agreements characterized as ongoing and concluded under normal conditions will be assessed each year by the Board at the meeting called to approve the financial statements.\n\nTo that end, the Board will have access to the work of the Chief Financial Officer and the Group Legal Counsel. Both of these officers will have previously reported on their work to the Audit Committee, which will report (having links with the company as defined in article L. 225-38 of the French commercial code *[Code de commerce]*) for up to 1,000,000 euros per transaction, whereby transactions relating to listed companies have to be carried out at a price corresponding to an average of the prices listed in the last twenty trading days;\n\noccurring between the company and natural persons or legal entities\n\n- transfers between the company and one of its directors of a number of securities equal to that set for exercising his/her duties as a corporate officer within the issuer of securities transferred;\n- cash management and/or loan transactions, provided the transaction is carried out at the market rate with a maximum differential of 0.50%.\n\ntheir findings to the Board of Directors' meeting called upon to approve the characterization of the relevant agreements. The implementation of the assessment procedure that took place at the\n\nmeetings of the Audit Committee on March 14, 2024 and the Board of Directors on March 14, 2024 showed that the characterization of the agreements adopted at the end of the meetings meets the requirements.\n\n# **1.5.10.2. REVIEW OF AGREEMENTS APPROVED DURING PREVIOUS FISCAL YEARS AND CONTINUED DURING THE YEAR**\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of article L. 225-40-1 of the French commercial code *(Code de commerce),* the Board of Directors meeting on March 14, 2024 examined the agreements signed and authorized in previous fiscal years whose performance continued in 2023 and noted that the reasons for signing the agreements and the different interests that presided over their implementation are still applicable to each of the agreements.
