The supply chain (especially for semiconductors) was greatly affected in the first half of the year, and the logistics situation was made difficult by the various lockdowns within Asia. The impact of high energy costs and the high rate of inflation continued to be felt and adversely affected the company's competitiveness in Central Europe. Nevertheless, we have shown ourselves to be a growing company because, despite the various crises and the current trend in the market, we increased our revenue by 9.2 % in the 2023 financial year to a new record revenue of € 2,661.2 million. The preliminary operating result (EBIT) decreased by around 32.0 % to € 160.0 million, which equates to an EBIT margin of 6.0 %. As well as the high energy and labor costs, this result was negatively affected by the restructuring in the bicycle segment.\n\n#### KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AREA OF SUSTAINABILITY\n\nIn our seventh sustainability report, we can report numerous areas of progress and developments in the area of ESG. The main topics in the 2023 financial year were the comprehensive revision of the materiality analysis, which resulted in a fundamental restructuring of this report as well as the implementation of the requirements set out in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the associated reporting of taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-compliant shares of the KPIs for revenue, CapEx and OpEx.\n\nIn operational terms, we very much focused on all three pillars of sustainability and we are striving to make improvements in the areas of social and environmental sustainability as well as in our performance when it comes to governance. A key element for improving our environmental performance is to conduct intensive research and development to produce innovative components and products that deliver a viable future. In 2023, our investments in research and development were € 195 million, with around € 27 million of this being invested in alternative drive technologies. We are aiming to exceed the legal requirements by helping to decarbonize transport and by conducting research into alternative drive systems that embrace new technology. In addition, we are constantly taking measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as reducing packaging, shortening transport routes, and modernizing engines. In 2023, an energy ring that connects a number of the group's buildings and helps to ensure the company uses a high proportion of the solar energy that it produced itself was set up at the sites in Munderfing.\n\nOur employees are a key factor in making us successful. We employ a number of measures to continuously improve working conditions and the level of employee satisfaction and take action to counter the shortage of skilled workers. On the one hand, we offer attractive pay and flexible working hours. On the other hand, we offer an extensive apprenticeship program and dual training. This allows us to attract a relatively high number of apprentices and we are continuing to increase the numbers we recruit. In addition to improvements in occupational safety and health protection, we also focus on delivering targeted training and education for our employees. In 2023, we invested around € 3.9 million in the training program to help our employees develop the skills they need for their job.\n\n# AMONG THE BEST IN THE INDUSTRY FOR ESG RISK RATING\n\nOur range of commitments also scores well in industry-wide sustainability ratings. In January 2024, PIERER Mobility AG received its new ESG risk rating from Sustainalytics1 . The company was rated as having a low risk of material financial impacts from ESG factors (value: 10.0). This ESG risk rating means that we came 1st in the Sustainalytics ranking of the automotive sector. In addition, we were once again recognized by Sustainalytics as an \"ESG Regional Top Rated\" and \"ESG Industry Top Rated\" company in 2024.\n\n<sup>1</sup> <https://www.sustainalytics.com/esg-ratings>(retrieved, or \"last full update\" received, on January 23, 2024)\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/0 description: A man in a suit is standing next to an orange KTM motorcycle. The man is wearing glasses, a white shirt, a blue suit jacket, and dark jeans. The motorcycle is orange and black, and it has the KTM logo on it. The background is a gray wall. The text \"KTM ©Philip Platzer\" is in the bottom right corner of the image.\n\n# OUTLOOK\n\nOur goal for the 2024 financial year is to continue bolstering our efforts to run the business in a responsible and sustainable way and to continue optimizing our performance when it comes to sustainability. We analyze the environmental and social impact of our products right along the value chain in order to make them more sustainable in every aspect. For example, we want to work together with our suppliers to promote ESG issues and in so doing identify potential ways we can improve social and environmental sustainability in the supply chain. Furthermore, we are developing a decarbonization strategy that will cover both emissions at our own sites and in the upstream and downstream value chain. The strategy will include both measures and CO2 reduction targets for 2030 and 2050. By doing this, we want to help achieve the European Union's\n\ntarget of net zero in 2050 and contribute to the decarbonization of transport. Our strategy is based on embracing new technology and the concept of \"Right Vehicle, Right Place, Right Energy Carrier\" so we can contribute efficiently and effectively to creating a more sustainable future.\n\nStefan Pierer Chairman of the Executive Board\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Content\n\n|                        | Key Sustainability Goals for 2024                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                          |          |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n|                        | and beyond                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 3                                                        |          |\n| Key Figures Highlights |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                          |          |\n|                        | Introduction by the Executive Board                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                          |          |\n| I.                     | GENERAL INFORMATION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 11                                                       |          |\n|                        | About PIERER Mobility<br>Group structure<br>Value chain<br>Management structure and composition<br>Corporate culture and business ethics<br>Sustainability management<br>1.

ESG STAKEHOLDER DIALOG\n\nThe growing presence of the products from the company's different business segments means that PIERER Mobility now engages with a range of stakeholders in the global market. Their individual interests and approaches are balanced as fairly as possible. The group always strives to maintain a continuous, intensive dialog with its stakeholders.\n\nThis sustainability report informs the stakeholders about measures and their results. Equally, a selection of ESG topics are presented at various events (such as roadshows/investor conferences or symposiums). In addition, the company regularly publishes its activities in relation to its various commitments within society on social media channels and on the company website.\n\nThe stakeholder groups were first identified in 2018 as part of an internal analysis of the key stakeholder groups that regularly contact various divisions of the company or with which a very large amount of information is already exchanged. Since then, and on the basis of ongoing activities with stakeholders during the year, the forms of dialog have been reviewed at least once a year to ensure they are current and updated if necessary. An overview of the stakeholder groups and the forms of dialog can be found below.\n\nEmployees, racers and factory riders: Employee appraisals, feedback meetings, training, information events, works meetings, intranet\n\nCapital market (shareholders, investors, analysts, banks and rating agencies) and ESG professionals: Bilateral exchange on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues with investors and ESG analysts.\n\nUniversities and scientific partners: Cooperations, conducting studies, practical partner on projects, visits to educational institutions\n\nSuppliers and dealers: Trade fairs, product presentations and test rides, joint events, training courses, lectures, regular dealer meetings on delivery and quality assurance agreements, exchange of information via Dealer.Net.\n\nUsers: Customer experience camps, youth support programs, website, social media channels\n\nBusiness partners: Knowledge sharing at specialist conferences and expert workshops.\n\nMedia: Interviews, press releases, close contact with business journalists, test rides, trade fairs, product presentations.\n\nPoliticians, networks and associations: European Association of Motorcycle Manufacturers (ACEM, Stefan Pierer is Vice-President); Presidency (Stefan Pierer) of the Federation of Upper Austrian Industry; at the PIERER Mobility Group locations, the management is in regular contact with relevant local/regional government officials and authorities (provision of company data, annual report and sustainability report); involvement in the association z.l.ö. – zukunft.lehre. österreich (Viktor Sigl is Vice-President); cooperation with Hotspot (Lebensraum) Innviertel and Innovations- und Technologietransfer Salzburg; part of the regional advisory board at the Arbeitsmarktservice (AMS) in Braunau; cooperation with Arbeitsmedizinischer Dienst; Delta Academy at the University of Leoben (Stefan Pierer is a member of the management board); ESG activities are reinforced by membership of the \"respACT-Austrian Business Council for Sustainable Development\" and \"CIRA – Circle Investor Relations Austria\".\n\nKey topics described in the following chapters were identified and evaluated by involving the various stakeholder groups. This forms the basis for implementing the measures taken and assessing their effectiveness in order to be able to take further steps and, if required, adaptation measures. The actions taken in the 2023 reporting year can be found in the \"Taking action and further explanations\" section for each key topic.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-19-0\"></span>II. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS – CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n# 1. DISCLOSURES ACCORDING TO THE TA XONOMY REGUL ATION FOR THE 2023 FINANCIAL YEAR\n\nWithin the framework of the Action Plan on Financing Sustainable Growth (EU Action Plan on Sustainable Finance6), the redirection of capital flows into sustainable investments is a key objective. Considering this, the EU Taxonomy Regulation (Taxonomy Regulation, Regulation (EU) 2020/852) came into force in mid-2020 as a uniform and legally binding classification system that defines which economic activities are considered \"environmentally sustainable\" in the EU. The results of this classification are to be reported annually on a company-specific basis.\n\nArticle 9 of the Taxonomy Regulation identifies the following six environmental objectives:\n\n- 1 climate change mitigation;\n- 2 climate change adaptation;\n- 3 the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources;\n- 4 the transition to a circular economy;\n- 5 pollution prevention and control;\n- 6 the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nIn 2021, the EU published guidelines on sustainable economic activities within the meaning of the Taxonomy Regulation for two environmental objectives (\"Climate change mitigation\" and \"Climate change adaptation\"), and it did so for the other environmental objectives in 2023. The regulation distinguishes between taxonomy eligibility and taxonomy alignment. The former must be reported for all six environmental objectives in the 2023 financial year. Taxonomy alignment only has to be disclosed in the 2023 financial year for the environmental objectives of \"Climate change mitigation\" and \"Climate change adaptation\". For environmental targets three to six, the reporting requirement is lower in 2023. An economic activity is taxonomy-eligible if it is listed in the catalog of the Taxonomy Regulation. For taxonomy alignment, the cumulative test and fulfillment of the three alignment conditions must be demonstrated:\n\n- substantial contribution to an environmental objective by complying with the assessment criteria formulated for the economic activity;\n- fulfilling the Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criterion to prevent the impairment of one or more other environmental objectives;\n- complying with the minimum social protection criteria (minimum safeguards).\n\n#### REPORTING FOR THE 2023 FINANCIAL YEAR\n\nBased on Art. 8 (1) of the Taxonomy Regulation in conjunction with Section 243b and Section 267a of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB), PIERER Mobility AG is obliged to apply the regulatory provisions of the Taxonomy Regulation. Pursuant to Section 245a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB), the consolidated financial statements of PIERER Mobility AG have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as of the closing date. The amounts used to calculate the revenue, CapEx and OpEx ratios were based on the figures reported through full consolidation. Consequently, companies accounted for using the equity method are not included. The scope of consolidation is the same as that for the financial reporting (for further information, go to page 214 in the 2023 Annual Report).\n\nFor the 2023 financial year, there was a complete analysis of the company's economic activities followed by a review to establish whether they can be assigned to an economic activity as listed in the Taxonomy Regulation for all six environmental objectives. This analysis resulted in a comprehensive change to the underlying assessment methodology. The new assessment methodology includes criteria for clear assignment of an economic activity to an economic activity listed in the Taxonomy Regulation. This produces better industry comparability and greater transparency because of the change to the way that the economic activities are assigned to the relevant economic activities. The entire vehicle fleet was assigned to the economic activities for transport (6.4. – 6.6.) because an assignment to these economic activities was deemed more appropriate. No building renovations were identified for the 2023 financial year because the investments made were extensions or repairs and maintenance work on a building. Only buildings and associated developed plots of land were assigned to the economic activity \"7.7. Acquisition and ownership of buildings\". Owing to their affiliation to the revenue-related economic activities, all fixtures and fittings, tools and equipment were classified as being associated with the economic activity \"3.3. Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport\". The key figures for the previous year were calculated in accordance with the new calculation method and adjusted retroactively so that a comparison can be made with the previous year.\n\nThe requirements of the DNSH criterion for taxonomy-eligible economic activities that met the corresponding technical assessment criteria of the Taxonomy Regulation were fully reviewed in the 2023 financial year and all necessary analyses were implemented, which led to a significant change in reporting compared to the previous year. This also includes the first implementation of a climate risk and vulnerability analysis and, as this had not been carried out previously, no taxonomy-aligned shares could be reported in the 2022 financial year.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\nTaxonomy eligibility and alignment was ascertained in the following process steps:\n\n| PROCESS                                                                      | DEPARTMENTS INVOLVED                                              |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1.

If necessary, these changes will be explained in the appropriate way and, if the assessment methodology changes, the comparative figures will be recalculated to ensure comparability.\n\n## ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES\n\nThe analysis of business activities was split into the consideration of revenue-related economic activities and non-revenue-related economic activities. Revenue-related economic activities generate revenue for the company and include the entire product range as well as the associated investments and costs. Non-revenue-related economic activities relate to investments and costs that are not related to the business model and revenues, but are necessary in the context of the business activity. A key factor in classifying the activities was differentiating the business model and the drive technology. The business model is divided up into \"retail\" and \"manufacturing/assembly\". If products were bought in and then resold without any significant change, they were assigned to the \"retail\" business model and accordingly reported as non-taxonomyeligible revenue. Examples of such products include bicycles and PG&A items (parts, garments, accessories). The outsourced production of bicycles significantly influenced the key figures. Differentiating the drive technology into combustion engines and battery-powered vehicles is crucial for calculating alignment because only two-wheeled vehicles belonging to Class L with CO2 exhaust emissions of 0 g of CO2-eq/km and associated costs make a substantial contribution to the \"Climate change mitigation\" environmental objective.\n\nIn the case of PIERER Mobility AG, the following economic activities were analyzed:\n\n#### Revenue-related economic activities\n\nPIERER Mobility AG's core business comprises the development, manufacture/assembly and sale of two-wheeled and four-wheeled vehicles. All activities that are directly related to these products have been assigned to the environmental objective \"Climate change mitigation\" and consequently the economic activity \"3.3. Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport\". The two-wheeled and four-wheeled vehicles were therefore classified as a taxonomyeligible economic activity. The assignment to this economic activity does not include vehicles that are assembled by the group's partners (associated companies) or purchased externally (electric balance bikes, Skutta) and have been identified as retail items.\n\nAnother substantial area of business is trading bicycles and electric bicycles. These products are procured mostly for trading purposes and therefore could not be assigned to any of the economic activities listed in the Taxonomy Regulation catalog. Cargo bikes, which are sold under the Johansson brand, have been produced by PIERER Mobility AG since April 2023 and could therefore be assigned to the economic activity \"3.3. Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport\". For the 2023 financial year, the revenue for cargo bikes includes both vehicles produced externally and vehicles that the company produced itself. As it is too complicated to separate, all cargo bike revenues for the financial year under review were deemed to be purchased. In the 2024 financial year, a new analysis and, if necessary, change to the classification will be required.\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\nAll products of PIERER Mobility AG that are purchased exclusively for retail purposes were classified as being not directly attributable to an economic activity. These include PG&A items. Furthermore, direct sales (aftermarket) of chassis components and their technical accessories, sold under the WP brand, were excluded as there is no improvement in environmental performance.\n\nIn addition, the product range comprises activities in the areas of digitalization and research and development. Services from these activities are utilized almost exclusively for internal purposes and were therefore not included in the analysis. Services provided to third parties in the area of software development were analyzed, but could not be assigned to any economic activity and were therefore reported as not being taxonomy-eligible.\n\nFor the 2023 financial year, the following substantial revenue-related economic activities were therefore analyzed in relation to the Taxonomy Regulation:\n\n| ECONOMIC ACTIVITY                                            | DESCRIPTION                         | ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVE            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| 3.3.

For the further\n\nanalysis, the clear assignability of costs to the respective economic activity was verified in order to rule out double counting in the calculation.\n\nFor the 2023 financial year, the following substantial non-revenue-related economic activities were analyzed in relation to the Taxonomy Regulation:\n\n| ECONOMIC ACTIVITY                                                                    | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                           | ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVE         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 6.4.

Vehicles in the motorcycle segment (vehicles belonging to Class L) make a substantial contribution to achieving the environmental objective simply with their CO2 exhaust emissions of 0 g of CO2-eq/km. By December 31, 2025, passenger vehicles (vehicles belonging to Class M1) may emit maximum CO2 emissions of 50 g of CO2/km to fulfill the requirements. Based on these assessment criteria, only battery-powered vehicles meet the requirements for making a substantial contribution to economic activity \"3.3. Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport\".\n\nThe non-revenue-related economic activities for the environmental objective \"Climate change mitigation\" meet the relevant technical assessment criteria for a substantial contribution to the environmental objective, with the exception of all the activities from the economic activity \"6.6. Freight transport services by road\" and all company vehicles with a combustion engine from the economic activity \"6.5. Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles\", which means that a taxonomy-aligned portion could not be reported for these two economic activities. For the economic activity \"4.1. Provision of IT/OT data-driven solutions\", only an analysis of taxonomy eligibility but not of taxonomy alignment was performed, due to the assignment to the environmental objective \"Transition to a circular economy\" and the simplified reporting.\n\n#### Do no significant harm\n\nIn the financial year, the DNSH criterion was examined for all economic activities that fulfilled the technical assessment criteria for the substantial contribution to an environmental objective. The analytical approach used to check the significant impairment of one or more other environmental objectives is presented below. The analysis showed that the economic activities \"7.4. Installation, maintenance and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles\" and \"7.6. Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies\" met the requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation and no further environmental objective was negatively affected in a significant way. At the time that this report was compiled, some of the relevant information or evidence was missing for all other economic activities identified as being taxonomy-eligible, and so it was not possible to assess whether they are taxonomy-aligned.\n\n#### Climate change adaptation\n\nA significant new aspect in the 2023 financial year was that the group conducted a climate risk and vulnerability analysis to fulfill the DNSH criterion, which is why the analysis is described in more detail below. In the course of the analysis, the climate impacts on the locations that are relevant to the economic activities were examined. First of all, the physical climate impacts were reviewed to assess their potential influence on the economic activities and climate projections were then used to identify current and future climate risks at the selected locations. Finally, the impacts on the economic activities and corrective measures were assigned. For more information, please refer to the \"Climate risk and vulnerability analysis\" section.\n\n#### Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nTo be able to rule out any impairment of the other environmental objectives, the corresponding requirements were analyzed and information and evidence were provided if necessary. If no evidence is required or if the economic activity does not fall within the scope of the formulated requirements of the DNSH criterion, the requirement should be regarded as fulfilled. A very substantial amount of evidence needs to be collected to be able to demonstrate that the environmental objective of \"Pollution prevention and control\" is not significantly impacted for the economic activity \"3.3. Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport\". At the time this report was compiled, the criterion was assessed as not being met and for this reason taxonomy alignment is not reported for this economic activity.\n\n#### Minimum safeguards\n\nFinally, an established minimum protection procedure must be in place to ensure that activities comply with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, ILO Core Labor Standards and the International Bill of Human Rights. This is guaranteed by the group's Code of Conduct, which defines the framework conditions for how it does business. These form the basis for any collaboration within and outside PIERER Mobility AG.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group is thus ensuring the introduction of, and compliance with, a thorough due-diligence process and regularly examines all the relevant risks in great depth including core issues such as human rights (including child labor and forced labor, employment rights and consumer rights), bribery, attempted bribery and extortion, taxation and fair competition. These efforts extend across all company locations and supply chains to identify and address potential impacts on these areas. The basis for this is a new abstract risk analysis at a country level that was established in the 2023 financial year. This considers the countries in which the group operates. The next step will be to expand this by incorporating industry risks and a specific risk analysis. The ratings (country rating) are based on publicly available (country-specific) indices, such as the Global Gender Gap Index, the Corruption Perception Index, and the Environmental Performance Index, which are reviewed and updated annually.\n\nDetailed information about the Code of Conduct can be found in the \"Corporate culture and business ethics\" section.\n\n#### KEY RATIOS\n\nThe share of taxonomy-eligible and/or taxonomy-aligned revenues, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx) in the respective totals according to the Taxonomy Regulation of PIERER Mobility AG for the 2023 financial year was reported based on a complete analysis of the economic activities. In principle, all fully consolidated companies are included in this analysis with regard to their revenues, capital and operating expenditures. Double counting was avoided because it could either be assigned directly to an economic activity or broken down based on the number of taxonomy-aligned products in the total number of units produced at each production site. The amounts reported for 2022 are the values calculated using the new calculation method.\n\n#### Revenue ratios\n\nThe revenue ratios are the ratio of revenues from taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic activities in a financial year to total revenues in this financial year. The amounts reported under this item in the income statement represent the basic measure of revenue.\n\n| REVENUES IN EURk        | 2023      | 2022      |\n|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| From customer contracts | 2,647,853 | 2,433,683 |\n| Other revenues          | 13,357    | 3,517     |\n| Total                   | 2,661,210 | 2,437,200 |\n\nAccording to the Taxonomy Regulation, the total revenues for the 2023 financial year of € 2,661 million (page 115 in the 2023 Annual Report) is the denominator of the revenue ratio. A detailed analysis of the revenues was used to allocate the respective revenue to the taxonomy-eligible economic activities. The relevant allocated percentages form the numerator of the revenues from the taxonomyeligible economic activities for the 2023 financial year.\n\nAll two-wheeled and four-wheeled vehicles were assigned to the economic activity \"3.3. Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport\" and reported as taxonomy-eligible, regardless of their drive technology. The calculation of taxonomy-eligible revenue does not include economic activities that relate to outsourced production (e.g. bicycles, Skutta, products under the MV Agusta brand) or the trade in PG&A products. In the 2023 financial year, cargo bikes were assessed as being non-taxonomy-eligible because it is too complicated to separate them into those produced externally and in-house. The revenue percentages for products produced externally, in particular for bicycles, have a significant impact on the level of the respective key ratios.\n\nTaxonomy alignment for the economic activity \"3.3. Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport\" could not then be determined because the alignment conditions were not fully met.\n\nCompared to the 2022 financial year, there were no material changes in the taxonomy-eligible revenue (+4 % YoY).\n\n#### CapEx ratios\n\nThe taxonomy-aligned CapEx indicates the proportion of capital expenditure (CapEx) that is either associated with a taxonomyaligned economic activity or with the acquisition of products and services from a taxonomy-aligned economic activity.\n\nThe basis for capital expenditure for calculating the taxonomy eligibility is additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets during the financial year under review, before depreciation, amortization and any revaluations for the financial year in question and excluding changes in fair value. It also includes additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets resulting from business combinations (application of IFRS (IAS 16, 38, 40, 41, IFRS 16); and national accounting policies if IFRS are not applied). Additions to goodwill are not to be included in the calculation.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n| CAPITAL EXPENDITURE IN EURk          | 2023    | 2022    |\n|--------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment | 96,748  | 80,080  |\n| IAS 38 Intangible assets             | 170,447 | 168,398 |\n| IFRS 16 Leases                       | 32,548  | 25,877  |\n| Total                                | 299,773 | 274,355 |\n\nThe denominator for the calculation of the taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned share of CapEx is the consolidated additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as well as additions from capitalized rights of use to the aforementioned assets, which amount to around € 299.8 million (see Annual Report 2023 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, additions, Changes in the scope of consolidation and transferts of intangible assets/Chapter 22 and tangible assets/Chapter 23). This includes additions from changes in the scope of consolidation, which were € 116,000 in the 2023 financial year. This does not include additions from advance payments in respect of property, plant and equipment for intangible assets amounting to € 32.6 million. Transfers from tangible and intangible assets of € 12.5 million and € 3.2 million were in taken into account in the calculation.\n\nThe numerator includes taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure for economic activities that could either be directly assigned to a non-revenue-related economic activity or are associated with a revenue-related economic activity, as well as investments that are associated with the acquisition of production and services from a taxonomy-eligible economic activity. If the investments could not be assigned to any economic activity (e.g. undeveloped land and daycare center), they were reported as a non-taxonomy-eligible activity.\n\nThe second step of the analysis was to review the identified economic activities to establish if they meet the alignment conditions. Due to the very time-consuming process of obtaining evidence and often a lack of evidence, taxonomy alignment could not be reported for several non-revenue-related economic activities. This related to investments in motor vehicle transport (\"6.5. Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles\" and \"6.6. Freight transport services by road\") and \"7.7. Acquisition and ownership of buildings\". At the time of the analysis, the necessary evidence to demonstrate cumulative fulfillment of the alignment conditions was unavailable for these economic activities.\n\nInvestments linked to the economic activity \"3.3. Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport\" include all activities related to a revenue-generating activity. These include, but are not limited to, property, plant and equipment, production facilities, capitalized research and development costs, and tools. Investments that were allocated directly to the \"Motorsport\" or \"PG&A\" profit centers were classified as non-taxonomy-eligible because the revenue-related economic activity was assessed in the same way. Investments associated with bicycles were identified as taxonomy-eligible, as it would be possible to record them as taxonomy-eligible revenue if the company produced them itself. The incomplete fulfillment of the alignment conditions meant it was not possible to record the capital expenditure associated with the manufacture of motor vehicles as being taxonomy-aligned.\n\nFor the management of real estate, including its fixtures and fittings, an investment was made in software with the aim of making the best use of resources throughout the entire life cycle and thus making a substantial contribution to the environmental objective of \"Transition to a circular economy\". The software solution was assigned to the economic activity \"4.1. Provision of IT/OT data-driven solutions\". Due to the simplified reporting this year, no check to establish whether the alignment conditions were met was carried out.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, an energy ring was set up to make optimum use of the electricity produced by the installed photovoltaic systems. Costs from this set-up were classified as being related to the economic activity \"7.6. Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies\" and as making a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. The installation of wall boxes for electric vehicles was identified as an acquisition from the economic activity \"7.4. Installation, maintenance and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles\" with a substantial contribution to the environmental objective of \"Climate change mitigation\". In addition, costs directly related to this economic activity (e.g., excavation work) were assigned to economic activity \"7.4. Installation, maintenance and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles\". Both economic activities met the alignment conditions and were reported as taxonomy-aligned, which represents a significant change compared to the 2022 financial year.\n\nA comparison of the financial years 2022 and 2023 shows an increase in investments over the course of the year. This is partly due to extensive investments in building structures for the group's bicycle segment.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### OpEx ratios\n\nThe taxonomy-aligned OpEx ratio indicates the proportion of operating expenditure, within the meaning of the Taxonomy Regulation, associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities or with the acquisition of products from a taxonomy-aligned economic activity.\n\nThe basis for calculating the operating expenses according to the Taxonomy Regulation was the direct, non-capitalized costs of research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases (short-term leasing), service and repair, and all other direct expenses for the ongoing maintenance of property, plant and equipment by the company or by third parties that are necessary to ensure the ongoing and effective functioning of these assets (e.g., costs of cleaning).\n\n| OPERATING EXPENDITURE IN EURk                                                                               | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Short-term leasing                                                                                          | 25,986 | 21,926 |\n| Maintenance and repair                                                                                      | 21,082 | 16,343 |\n| All other direct expenditure related to<br>the daily maintenance of fixed property,<br>plant, and equipment | 2,689  | 2,093  |\n| Total                                                                                                       | 49,757 | 40,362 |\n\nFor the calculation of the denominator of PIERER Mobility AG according to the Taxonomy Regulation, operating expenses for short-term rent and short-term leasing, maintenance and repair expenses and all cleaning costs were included as other direct expenses associated with the daily maintenance of fixed property, plant, and equipment. Operating expenses in the denominator amount to around € 49.8 million.\n\nThe numerator was derived from the analysis of the expenses from the above-mentioned accounts and their assignment to a revenue-related or non-revenue-related economic activity. Taxonomy-eligible operating expenses are either directly related to a taxonomy-eligible economic activity or are associated with the purchase of products from a taxonomy-aligned economic activity. Costs for which assignment to a non-revenue-related economic activity was not possible, and which were directly associated with the \"Motorsport\" or \"PG&A\" profit centers, were again classified as non-taxonomy-eligible. The largest share of taxonomy-eligible operating expenses is directly related to the economic activity \"3.3. Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport\" as these costs safeguard the ongoing functioning of the company. Furthermore, costs for short-term leasing in the area of transport (economic activities \"6.5. Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles\" and \"6.6. Freight transport services by road\") were classified as taxonomy-eligible along with costs linked to servicing the associated vehicles. Costs arising from the acquisition of company bicycles are a low-value asset and were therefore reported as taxonomy-eligible operating costs (economic activity \"6.4. Operation of personal mobility devices, cycle logistics\"). It was not possible to determine whether the alignment conditions for the taxonomy-eligible economic activities had been met, either because the relevant evidence had not been provided or because the substantial contribution to an environmental objective had not been met.\n\nThere are no significant changes in the amounts. The economic activity \"6.4. Operation of personal mobility devices, cycle logistics\" was newly added in the 2023 financial year because of the offer of a company bicycle for employees.\n\nThe detailed notification forms in accordance with the delegated regulations 2023/2486 (KPIs on revenue, CapEx, OpEx) and 2022/1214 (information on activities relating to nuclear energy and fossil gas) can be found in Annex VII.\n\nImage /page/25/Picture/9 description: The image shows an aerial view of a large industrial complex surrounded by green fields and trees.

CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION\n\n# MATERIAL IMPACTS, RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\n#### Impacts\n\nClimate change and its associated consequences, such as the rise in average global temperatures, mean that the use phase and the possibilities for using the PTWs sold by the PIERER Mobility Group can be expected to expand. This includes both travel for specific purposes and the PTWs being ridden as part of leisure activities. The reason for this is the increased use of PTWs in warm temperatures. Furthermore, the increasing number of hours of sunshine each year will make photovoltaic and solar systems more efficient. PIERER Mobility is exploiting this by adding photovoltaic capacities at its Mattighofen and Munderfing sites, thus contributing to the energy transition. The photovoltaic systems are installed and operated by Pierer Green Energy GmbH7 .\n\n#### Risks & opportunities\n\nAcute and chronic risks from climate change were analyzed as part of a climate risk and vulnerability analysis in the 2023 financial year. For the production-relevant sites of the PIERER Mobility Group, physical climate risks were identified using a special software solution, and impacts and corrective measures were established. An overview of the relevant climate risks can be found in the section on climate risk and vulnerability analysis.\n\n## STRATEGIES FOR ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group is very much focused on changing climatic conditions and is constantly adapting to them. Climate change is advancing at pace globally and the impacts of global warming are increasingly affecting global economies and supply chains. The group is responding to this with a diverse and yet local procurement strategy. In order to be well prepared for potential environmental disasters, the group has pinpointed climate risks for the production-relevant sites and identified measures to reduce their impact. At the same time, the PIERER Mobility Group's product range is well adapted to changing climatic conditions, which means that climate change could lead to an expansion of possible uses for its products.\n\n#### Related SDGs:\n\n11.5 Reduce the adverse effects of natural disasters\n\n13.3 Build knowledge and capacity to meet climate change\n\n# TAKING ACTION AND FURTHER EXPLANATIONS\n\n#### Climate risk and vulnerability analysis\n\nTo allow the company to identify significant climate risks affecting the group's business activities, a climate risk and vulnerability analysis was carried out for the PIERER Mobility Group's production-relevant sites in the financial year. A special software solution was used to analyze the physical impact of climate change on the company (chronic and acute)8. Production-relevant sites of the PIERER Mobility Group (primarily plants and warehouses) were examined to establish their current and future level of exposure to physical climate risks. The analysis looked at various development scenarios. These were three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP), which were combined with different levels of intensity of radiative forcing. The scenarios were described in the sixth synthesis report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)9 . By selecting these scenarios, a wide range of different possible developments is covered.\n\n- SSP1-2.6: Achieving net-zero emissions by 2070\n- SSP2-4.5: no change in CO2 emissions before mid-century compared to the current level of emissions\n- SSP5-8.5: CO2 emissions double by 2050\n\n<sup>7</sup> A subsidiary of Pierer Industrie AG.\n\n<sup>8</sup> The software solution processes verified scientific data, which is also used in the assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. These are combined with hazard maps designed by the provider's experts.\n\n<sup>9</sup> IPCC, 2023: Climate Change 2023: Synthesis Report.

The corrective measures will significantly reduce the impacts of the climate risks so there is no need for any further action for the time being. An overview of the physical climate risks identified can be found in the table below. Information on the\n\nclassification of the risk is not to be understood to constitute the level of financial loss, but instead depicts the intensity or change in the intensity of the individual risks, as specified in the software solution that is used. The analysis was also used in an adapted form in the context of the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\n| TYPE    | MANIFESTATION                                               | POTENTIAL IMPACT                                                                                                           | CORRECTIVE MEASURE                                                                                                                                                                               | SSP1-2.6     | SSP2-4.5     | SSP5-8.5     | UP TO 2030   |              |              | UP TO 2060 |  |  |\n|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------|--|--|\n|         |                                                             |                                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                  | SSP1-2.6     | SSP2-4.5     | SSP5-8.5     | SSP1-2.6     | SSP2-4.5     | SSP5-8.5     |            |  |  |\n|         | Heat wave                                                   | Falling productivity                                                                                                       | Installation of air-conditioning systems<br>(completed);<br>option to expand the capacities of<br>air-conditioning systems if necessary                                                          | Very<br>high | Very<br>high | Very<br>high | Very<br>high | Very<br>high | Very<br>high |            |  |  |\n| Acute   | Heavy precipitation (e.g., rain,<br>hail, snow)             | Disruption of<br>journeys to work,<br>the supply chain,<br>and production;<br>disruption of the<br>energy supply           | External factors on routes to work<br>cannot be influenced;<br>electricity: installation of emergency<br>power generators for controlled<br>shutdown of IT systems and<br>production (completed) | Very<br>high | High         | Very<br>high | Very<br>high | High         | Very<br>high |            |  |  |\n|         | River floods                                                | Disruption of<br>journeys to work,<br>the supply chain,<br>and production;<br>disruption of the<br>energy supply           | Flood retention basin in Teichstätt<br>(completed);<br>relocation of IT servers to higher floors<br>to avoid a system failure (completed)                                                        | High         | High         | High         | High         | High         | High         |            |  |  |\n| Chronic | Changes to<br>precipitation<br>patterns (winter,<br>summer) | Disruption of<br>journeys to work,<br>the supply chain,<br>and production;<br>increased demand<br>due to shorter<br>winter | Flood retention basin in Teichstätt<br>(completed);<br>relocation of IT servers to higher floors<br>to avoid a system failure (completed)                                                        | Very<br>high | High         | Very<br>high | Very<br>high | High         | Very<br>high |            |  |  |\n|         | Heat stress                                                 | Falling productivity                                                                                                       | Installation of air-conditioning systems<br>(completed);<br>option to expand the capacities of<br>air-conditioning systems if necessary                                                          | High         | High         | High         | High         | High         | High         |            |  |  |\n\n#### Multiple-sourcing strategy\n\nAs part of its multiple-sourcing strategy, the PIERER Mobility Group is looking to diversify its supply chain. The aim is to have at least one supplier for all its product groups that is located outside of Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy. This will make the company more resilient to fluctuations or delays in delivery in the relevant economic area that may also be caused by climatic or regulatory developments. At the same time, the group is pursuing a local procurement strategy. In the 2023 financial year, 84 % of the volume of components purchased for series production of motorcycles came from Europe. This prevents long delivery routes and reduces the company's susceptibility to climate risks.\n\n#### Expansion of photovoltaic capacities\n\nAs the number of hours of sunshine increases, photovoltaic and solar systems are becoming increasingly efficient. The group is endeavoring to exploit this by operating photovoltaic systems on its roofs. More information about the expansion of capacities can be found in Chapter 4. Energy.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n# KEY FIGURES AND TARGETS\n\n#### Focus on the regional supplier industry\n\n- The purchasing volume of components for the series production of motorcycles (in Mattighofen and Munderfing) was approx. € 913 million in the 2023 financial year. Geographical breakdown: 24 % from Austria, 59 % from Austria/Germany/Italy and 84 % from Europe.\n- The bicycles are purchased assembled from a partner in Europe (approx. 63.4 %) and a partner in Asia (approx. 36.4 %).\n- In the 2023 financial year, the purchasing volume for indirect materials and services for the plants in Austria was approx. € 142 million. The majority was procured within Austria: 77 % within Austria, 91 % within Austria/Germany/Italy and 98 % within Europe.\n\n#### Purchasing volume per continent (series purchasing):\n\nEurope 84 %, Asia 14 %, North America 2 %\n\nImage /page/28/Figure/7 description: This is a world map with countries shaded in different shades of gray. The countries in Europe are shaded in a darker shade of gray than the countries in other parts of the world. The countries in North America, South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia are shaded in a lighter shade of gray.\n\n#### Purchasing volume in Europe (series purchasing):\n\nImage /page/28/Figure/9 description: The image shows a bar chart of purchasing volume in Europe. The countries listed on the y-axis are Austria, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Slovakia, France, Czech Republic, Poland, Portugal, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Sweden, Romania, Denmark, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, Hungary, and Liechtenstein. The x-axis shows the percentage of purchasing volume, ranging from 0% to 25%. Austria has the highest purchasing volume, followed by Italy and Germany. The purchasing volume decreases as you go down the list of countries. There is also a map of Europe on the right side of the image, with Austria highlighted.\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/1 description: This is an aerial shot of the KTM Group House of Brands building. The building is a modern, multi-story structure with a curved facade and a glass-enclosed atrium. The roof of the building is covered in solar panels. The building is surrounded by green lawns and trees. In the background, there are other buildings and a parking lot.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-56-0\"></span>VII.

This has been published annually since 2017 and is published at the same time as the annual financial report. PIERER Mobility's financial year corresponds to the calendar year and ends on December 31. The GRI index, starting on page 72, contains a detailed list of the requirements in this regard as well as PIERER Mobility AG's compliance or reason for non-compliance.\n\nThis consolidated non-financial report, as it is known, essentially covers all fully consolidated subsidiaries of PIERER Mobility AG with its equity holding in KTM AG together with its subsidiaries\\*.\n\nThe key environmental figures generally reflect the key figures of the main company and production sites in Austria. In addition to PIERER Mobility AG in Wels, this includes KTM AG in Mattighofen and Munderfing, KTM Sportcar GmbH in Graz and the Electromobility Center in Anif.\n\n#### External audit\n\nThe published information has been audited by KPMG Austria GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft, Linz/Austria. The aim of PIERER Mobility AG is to document the validation and trustworthiness of the information disclosed for the public in a comprehensible way by conducting this fourth voluntary external audit. The corresponding confirmation can be found in the independent audit report at the end of this sustainability report.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-85-0\"></span>Note by the independent certified public accountant\n\nTo the Management Board of PIERER Mobility AG, Wels\n\n# INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE REPORT ON THE NON-FINANCIAL REPORTING ACCORDING TO § 267A UGB\n\nWe have performed an independent limited assurance engagement on the combined consolidated non-financial report according to § 267a UGB (\"NFI report\") for the financial year 2023, which has been published as Sustainability Report of\n\nPIERER Mobility AG, Wels (referred to as \"PIERER Mobility AG\" or \"the Company\").\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFI report of the Company is not in accordance with the legal requirements of the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (§ 267a UGB), the provisions of Article 8 of the Regulation (EU) 2020/852 as amended and the supplementing delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 (hereafter \"EU Taxonomy Regulation\")] and the sustainability reporting guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards) Option \"in accordance with\" in all material respects.\n\n#### Management's Responsibility\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for the proper preparation of the NFI report in accordance with the reporting criteria. The Company applies the legal requirements of the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (§ 267a UGB) and the sustainability reporting guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards) Option \"in accordance with\" as reporting criteria. In addition, the company prepares disclosures in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation, which are published as part of sustainability reporting.\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for the selection and application of appropriate methods for non-financial reporting (especially the selection of significant matters) as well as the use of appropriate assumptions and estimates for individual non-financial disclosures, given the circumstances. Furthermore, their responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of systems, processes and internal controls that are relevant for the preparation of the sustainability report in a way that is free of material misstatements – whether due to fraud or error.\n\n#### Auditors' Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to state whether, based on our procedures performed and the evidence we have obtained, anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Company's NFI report is not in accordance with the legal requirements of the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (§ 267a UGB), the legal requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the sustainability reporting guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards) Option \"in accordance with\" in all material respects.\n\nOur engagement was conducted in conformity with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE 3000) applicable to such engagements. These standards require us to comply with our professional requirements including independence requirements, and to plan and perform the engagement to enable us to express a conclusion with limited assurance, taking into account materiality.\n\nAn independent assurance engagement with the purpose of expressing a conclusion with limited assurance (\"limited assurance engagement\") is substantially less in scope than an independent assurance engagement with the purpose of expressing a conclusion with reasonable assurance (\"reasonable assurance engagement\"), thus providing reduced assurance. Despite diligent engagement planning and execution, it cannot be ruled out that material misstatements, illegal acts or irregularities within the non-financial report will remain undetected.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment and included the following procedures in particular:\n\n- Inquiries of personnel at the group level, who are responsible for the materiality analysis, in order to gain an understanding of the processes for determining material sustainability topics and respective reporting threshholds of the Company;\n- A risk assessment, including a media analysis, on relevant information on the Company's sustainability performance in the reporting period;\n- Evaluation of the design and implementation of the systems and processes for the collection, processing and monitoring of disclosures on environmental, social and employees matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption as well as bribery and also includes the consolidation of data;\n- Inquiries of personnel at the group level, who are responsible for providing, consolidating and implementing internal control procedures relating to the disclosure of concepts, risks, due diligence processes, results and performance indicators;\n- Inspection of selected internal and external documents, in order to determine whether qualitative and quantitative information is supported by sufficient evidence and presented in an accurate and balanced manner;\n- Assessment of the processes for local data collection, validation and reporting, as well as the reliability of the reported data through a (remotely conducted) survey performed on a sample basis at a site or a subsidiary.\n- Analytical evaluation of the data and trend of quantitative disclosures regarding the GRI Standards listed in the GRI-Index, submitted by all locations for consolidation at the group level;\n- Evaluation of the consistency of the of the Austrian Sustainability and Diversity Improvement Act (§ 267a UGB), the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the GRI Standards, Option \"in accordance with\" to disclosures and indicators of the NFI report, which apply to the Company;\n- Evaluation of the overall presentation of the disclosures by critically reading the NFI report.\n\nThe procedures that we performed do not constitute an audit or a review. Our engagement did not focus on revealing and clarifying of illegal acts (such as fraud), nor did it focus on assessing the efficiency of management. Furthermore, it is not part of our engagement to audit future-related disclosures, prior year figures, statements from external sources of information, expert opinions or references to more extensive external reporting formats of the Company.\n\n#### Restriction on use\n\nBecause our report will be prepared solely on behalf of and for the benefit of the principal, its contents may not be relied upon by any third party, and consequently, we shall not be liable for any third party claims. We agree to the publication of our assurance certificate and NFI report. However, publication may only be performed in its entirety and as a version has been certified by us.\n\n#### General Conditions of Contract\n\nOur responsibility and liability towards the Company and any third party is subject to paragraph 7 of the General Conditions of Contract for the Public Accounting Professions.\n\nLinz 14 March 2024\n\nKPMG Austria GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft\n\nqualified electronically signed: Alexander Gall Wirtschaftsprüfer (Austrian Chartered Accountant) \n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\nSustainability Report\\_2023\n\n",

DEVELOPMENT OF THE PIERER MOBILITY GROUP\n\n### THE COMPANY\n\nPIERER Mobility AG is the umbrella company for Europe's leading manufacturer of powered two-wheelers, and manufactures a full range of premium products under the KTM, GASGAS, Husqvarna and MV Agusta Motorcycles brands. PIERER Mobility's innovative strength makes it a pioneering leader in technology for two-wheeled electric mobility through its motorcycle brands. Husqvarna and GASGAS E-Bicycles complement the two-wheeler range. The premium brand range also includes high-performance components from the WP brand and special KTM X-BOW high-performance sports cars.\n\nFollowing the strategic partnership with Bajaj in India, the company has been able to diversify its production capacities in recent years and increase its competitiveness in the global market. The cooperation with CFMOTO in China and the joint venture with Maxcom in Bulgaria will boost both bicycle and motorcycle production over the long term. With its leading technology in the field of low-voltage electric mobility, PIERER Mobility aims to become the global market leader for electric two-wheelers in the power range from 250 W to 15 kW.\n\nThe shares of PIERER Mobility AG have their primary listing in the Swiss Performance Index (SPI) of the SIX Swiss Exchange in Zurich and are also listed on the Prime Market of the Vienna Stock Exchange.\n\n### DEVELOPMENT OF SALES AND REVENUE IN THE 2023 FINANCIAL YEAR\n\nDespite difficult economic conditions and upheaval in the bicycle industry, in the 2023 financial year the PIERER Mobility Group increased group revenue by 9.2 % to a new record level of € 2,661.2 million (previous year: € 2,437.2 million). With 381,555 motorcycles sold (previous year: 375,492) in the 2023 financial year, the Motorcycles segment achieved an increase in sales of around 2 %. Surplus stocks in the bicycle sector globally meant that the PIERER Mobility Group also faced a sharp drop in market prices. The growth in sales in the Bicycle Division of more than 30 % was driven by inventory adjustments and the sale of the R Raymon brand. In the 2023 financial year, 157,358 bicycles were sold (previous year: 118,465).\n\nThe European sales regions accounted for sales of around 140,000 motorcycles (+15 %), and around two-thirds of motorcycles (around 240,000) were sold in markets outside Europe. Despite a slight\n\ndecline in sales in North America, the group's subsidiary there nevertheless managed to sell more than 100,000 motorcycles for the second time in a row. While sales in South America (-26 %) and Asia (-27 %) declined in the past financial year, sales of around 19,700 motorcycles in Australia were slightly higher (+1 %) than the level recorded in the previous year.\n\nDespite the difficult global economic conditions, demand in the core markets of Europe rose very strongly at a rate of +11 % (~ 820,000 newly registered motorcycles) and also displayed a significantly positive trend in North America (USA & Canada) at +4 % (485,000 motorcycles). The market share of all three brands (KTM, Husqvarna, GASGAS) in 2023 was therefore around 10.6 % in Europe and 12.6 % in North America. The Australian (including New Zealand) motorcycle market declined slightly, with a 3 % drop to 67,000 newly registered motorcycles. Nevertheless, the three brands as a whole managed to increase their share of this market to 21 %. By contrast, just like last year, the relevant Indian motorcycle market is seeing a significant upswing (+22 %). Bajaj sold around 66,000 KTM and Husqvarna motorcycles in India, resulting in a market share of 5.3 %.\n\n### STRATEGIC PROJECTS\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the company stepped up and expanded its cooperation with CFMOTO. On the one hand, February 2023 saw the start of activities in the subsidiary, CFMOTO Motorcycles Distribution GmbH, Munderfing, which was established in the 2022 financial year, and this company distributes CFMOTO motorcycles in Europe, in particular in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Spain and the United Kingdom. On the other, the long-standing cooperation in relation to industrialization projects in the established joint venture Zhejiang CFMOTO-KTMR2R Motorcycles Co., Ltd., Zhejian, China was stepped up even more and the series production of mid-range KTM models was expanded further. The stepping up of the joint venture and the cooperation in the areas of product strategy, product development, industrialization and sales is a further step toward being able to meet the increasing market demand in China and the Asian region, as well as worldwide. In addition, production capacity will be increased from 50,000 to 100,000 vehicles. As a sign of closer cooperation, CFMOTO also increased its equity holding inter alia in PIERER Mobility AG to 2.0 %.\n\nAn important milestone for the company was the conclusion of a strategic cooperation with the Italian premium motorcycle manufacturer MV Agusta S.p.A., based in Varese, in which KTM AG acquired a 25.1 % stake back in November. Since the 2023 financial year, the KTM Group has been responsible for purchasing and sales \n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\nin the most important European countries, marketing and customer support for MV Agusta motorcycles. Furthermore, the Executive Board has made the strategic decision to exercise the call option granted under the cooperation agreement to acquire a further 25.0 % stake in MV Agusta S.p.A. in spring 2026.\n\nThe Executive Board has also made the strategic decision to focus even more on the core business of powered two-wheelers (motorcycles and electrified mobility products) and to concentrate on the premium brands KTM, GASGAS and Husqvarna as well as MV Agusta. As a result of this decision, the Executive Board instigated the sale of the R Raymon and FELT brands and the sale of the non-ebicycle division. In this context, in September 2023 the \"R Raymon\" brand was sold to R RAYMON Bicycles GmbH (formerly: Johansson GmbH), Schweinfurt, Germany. Furthermore, the process of selling the FELT bicycle brand to a consortium led by Florian Burguet was also initiated and is set to be completed in the first half of 2024. Florian Burguet left the Executive Board at the end of December.\n\n#### ACTIVITIES AND SUCCESSES IN RACING\n\n#### Motorsport\n\nThe \"Legends of Dakar\" exhibition was opened in the KTM Motohall in May 2023. The victorious motorcycle on which Kevin Benavides won the Dakar Rally in January 2023 was able to take pride of place in the exhibition. His triumph was KTM's 19th victory in the Dakar Rally in the last 22 years. PIERER Mobility is also successful with all its brands in motocross. Jeffrey Herlings from Red Bull KTM Factory Racing broke the all-time record of 101 wins at the Spanish Grand Prix in the middle of the season, increasing his personal track record to 103 wins. Andrea Adamo secured the MX2 World Championship title. The German Manuel Lettenbichler won his second FIM Hard Enduro World Championship in a row – a phenomenal record of six victories in six races. Jospe Garcia not only triumphed at the International Six Days Enduro, but also claimed the title of world champion in the EnduroGP E1 class. Since the launch of the global Husqvarna Factory Racing Team in 2015, Husqvarna Motorcycles has consistently strengthened its position as a dominant force in off-road racing. In 2023, Billy Bolt's FIM SuperEnduro title improved its track record to a total of 116 world championship titles. GASGAS is the third brand with a successful record in motorsport. Jorge Prado made history with his MXGP World Championship title – it was the very first title for GASGAS in the premier class of motocross. In the last few years, GASGAS has been able to celebrate its greatest triumphs in the FIM EnduroGP World Championship. After winning both the EnduroGP\n\nand Enduro 1 titles in 2022, Andrea Verona switched class and entered the Enduro 2 series in 2023.\n\nHighly specialist trial sport is still extremely important for GASGAS as the brand continues to compete at the highest level both indoors and outdoors. For 2023, GASGAS signed TrialGP number two Jaime Busto so he could team up with Sondre Haga, the 2022 Trial2 world champion, to compete in the premier class.\n\nIn 2023, KTM alone entered 28 riders in MotoGP™ and a whole series of talented young riders at junior events such as the Red Bull MotoGP™ Rookies Cup and the Northern Talent Cup. Red Bull KTM Factory Racing celebrated two wins with Brad Binder in the new MotoGP™ sprint format and claimed a total of ten podium finishes between him and his new teammate Jack Miller. This enabled KTM to come second in the MotoGP™ manufacturers' standings. In Moto2™, Pedro Acosta outperformed the opposition for his second title in just three years of world championship competition after dominating Moto3™ in 2021. He is another talented rider to enhance the GASGAS MotoGP™ project for 2024. As a two-time world champion, Pedro Acosta is undoubtedly one of the most talented young riders in road racing. He will be accompanied on the starting grid in 2024 by Augusto Fernandez, who will be embarking upon his second season at Red Bull GASGAS Tech3. In Moto3™, GASGAS Aspar rider David Alonso celebrated four race victories and eight podium finishes in his debut season. The Spaniard is the favorite to win the Moto3™ crown in the 2024 season. After finishing fourth in the 2022 Moto3™ World Championship, Ayumu Sasaki went into the 2023 season as a title contender for Husqvarna Factory Racing. He once again appeared regularly on the podium throughout the season and finished the season as runner-up in the Moto3™ World Championship. His teammate Collin Veijer also delivered impressive results and celebrated a victory in his debut season.\n\n#### Cycling\n\nSince 2023, the GASGAS E-Bicycles brand has been entering the UCI Mountain Bike World Series, in particular the E-Enduro Pro World Cup. Together with partners from industry, Johannes Fischbach and Alex Marin from GASGAS SRAM Racing and Simon Carlsson and Alexandre Fayolle from GASGAS MOTOREX Racing have been competing in races. After all five rounds, Alex Marin finished fourth and got within reach of the podium for GASGAS E-Bicycles in the team's very first season.\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### IMPACT OF THE RUSSIAN-UKRAINIAN WAR\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group's assessments of the impact of the war that is happening in Ukraine remain unchanged compared to the previous year. The PIERER Mobility Group has not identified any significant reason to materially change its estimates and expectations as of December 31, 2023 on the basis of the war that is happening in Ukraine. The group does not have any investments, other assets or other material business relationships in Ukraine, Russia or Belarus, nor does the group have any material business relationships with suppliers or dealers in these countries. With this in mind, the group does not expect any material impact on the expected future cash flows. Equally, the group has not suffered, and does not expect to suffer, any loss of control, joint control or the ability to exercise significant influence over any entity as a result of the war or the sanctions that have been imposed.\n\nImage /page/5/Picture/3 description: A person is riding a CFMOTO motorcycle on a dirt road.

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND MARKET DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe prospects for the global economy remain gloomy. The impact of the Russian-Ukrainian war, which has been going on since 2022, as well as significantly higher rates of inflation caused by this war, among other factors, have led to a significant slowdown in the global economy. Although the forecasts improved substantially over the course of the 2023 financial year, they are still restrained as a result of this.\n\nAs part of this, there is evidence of a largely positive normalization of business and consumer sentiment, raw material prices are dropping and the disruption to the supply chain seen in the last financial year appears to have largely been overcome as logistics costs and delivery times for the resources the company needs are generally returning to the level they were at before the COVID pandemic. Significant financial and macroeconomic risks exist, on the one hand as a result of the simmering real estate crisis in China, and on the other from the continued development in rates of inflation. While both overall inflation and core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food components, are declining, both are expected to remain high at least in the short and medium term. Looking at the overall picture, economic risks are generally more balanced than they were in the last financial year, but there is still a risk of a downward trend. This illustrates the continuing level of uncertainty, particularly regarding the course of the war in Ukraine, its wider consequences and the recent uncertainties about the outcome of the war that has erupted in the Middle East.\n\nUltimately, the situation that has been outlined means that the global growth forecasts from the leading organizations in this field, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the World Bank, are more uncertain than usual and are constantly being adjusted. The IMF's latest estimates suggest that the forecast for global economic growth remains broadly unchanged at 3.1 % for 2024 and 3.2 % for 2025, compared to previous estimates. These broadly unchanged forecasts indicate that the biggest risks to global economic development are now balanced and stabilized, but there are still downside risks given the issues described above. The estimates published are based on numerous assumptions about a wide range of macroeconomic factors, in particular the trend in the prices of fossil fuels and other resources and the general level of interest rates.\n\nFor industrialized countries, the IMF expects growth of 1.5 % in 2024 and 1.8 % in 2025. For the euro zone, growth of 0.9 % is forecast for 2024. For 2025, the IMF expects growth of 1.7 % for the euro zone, while growth in Germany in particular is forecast to be below average at 0.5 % for 2024 and 1.6 % for 2025.\n\nFor emerging markets and developing countries, the IMF forecasts economic growth of 4.1 % for 2024 and 4.2 % for 2025. A growth rate of 4.6 % is forecast for China in 2024 and 4.1 % in 2025. For India, economic output is forecast to increase by 5.7 % in 2024 and by 6.8 % in 2025.\n\nThe IMF forecasts rates of inflation of 5.8 % for 2024 and 4.4 % for 2025. The future development of the global economy will depend in particular on the successful calibration of monetary policy, taking stock of the cumulative effects of previous interest rate hikes, which could otherwise have serious detrimental effects for the financial sector. Moreover, the course of the war in Ukraine and, more recently, also in the Middle East, and not least the level of economic recovery and demand from China represent key factors that will affect how the global economy develops going forward. This assessment is largely shared by the OECD and the World Bank. The IMF, in particular, also declares that there is increasing divergence in economic growth, as a slowdown in growth appears to be more pronounced in advanced economies than it does in emerging markets and developing countries. With the IMF's forecast for global economic growth broadly unchanged, a major global economic downturn is not expected, although all forecasts in relation to the trend in the global economy remain subject to significant uncertainties.\n\nIn the past 2023 financial year, the global1 motorcycle market displayed a positive trend (+2.7 %, equating to an increase of 90,000 motorcycles). In Europe<sup>2</sup> the market, as measured by new registrations, increased again to more than 800,000 motorcycles (+11 %) following a small decline in 2022. The core markets of Germany (+12 %), France (+14 %), Italy (+15 %) and Spain (+13 %) in particular are benefiting from increased demand. This meant the market share rose from 10.0 % to 10.5 % (measured by the three core brands KTM, Husqvarna and GASGAS).\n\nIn North America, sales (in contrast to Europe including motocross models) also rose and culminated in around 490,000 units sold (+4 %). The growth achieved by the three core brands saw the market share increase from 11 % to 12.6 % (previous year: 11.8 %).\n\nThe trend in the Australian and New Zealand markets showed a slight decline of 3.2 %. However, as the registrations of KTM, Husqvarna and GASGAS rose by 3.4 %, the market share increased to 21.0 % (previous year: 19.7 %). The total volume is almost 67,000 motorcycles.\n\n1 Related to the key sales markets of the KTM Group: DE, FR, IT, UK, ES, SE, BE, NL, AT, CH, FL, DK, NO, GR, PL, SL, HU, BALTIC, USA, CAN, AUS, NZ, JP, SA, TH, CN, AR, BR, CO.\n\n2 Motorcycles = 120 cc excluding motocross, scooters, and ATVs, including electric motorcycles in the markets DE, FR, IT, UK, ES, SE, BE, NL, AT, CH, FI, NO, BALTIC.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe relevant Indian motorcycle market (S2/S3 segment) is once again experiencing a significant upturn (+22 %), with a volume of 1.2 million motorcycles sold. In this context, the strategic partner Bajaj sold more than 65,000 motorcycles of the KTM and Husqvarna brands in India, resulting in a slight increase in market share of 5.3 % (previous year: 5.0 %). The Asian region suffered losses in 2023, with the markets in Thailand (-10.4 %) and China (premium importer market; -17 %) being particularly affected. In Japan (motorcycles >250cc), the decline is -6 %, which is slightly lower. The decline (including Hong Kong, with a volume of approx. 2,000 motorcycles) is almost -12 % and the volume of motorcycles sold is now nearly 200,000 units. Nevertheless, the market share of the KTM core brands in this important growth region rose to 5.2 % (previous year: 4.9 %).\n\nThe New Mobility market is facing major challenges. Whereas recent years and expectations have been very much defined by the after-effects of the increased level of demand produced by the coronavirus pandemic, the forecast published by the German Two-Wheeler Industry Association (ZIV) for the 2023 financial year and at least the year after that suggests a significant slowdown in the market. For 2023 as a whole, the ZIV forecasts sales of around two million electrified New Mobility products. This equates to a decline of approx. 10 % compared to the record-breaking year in 2022 when 2.2 million units were sold. In addition, it should be noted that current macroeconomic uncertainties, as outlined in the introduction, along with impacts on consumer prices, caused not least by high rates of inflation, are having a negative effect on market development. Forecasts indicate that the entire New Mobility market is facing a trend of consolidation.\n\nImage /page/7/Picture/3 description: A person is riding a motorcycle on a paved road.

Approximately 97 % of revenues were earned outside of Austria. Looking at different regions, 54.4 % of revenues were generated in Europe (+7.9 percentage points year-on-year), 29.2 % in North America including Mexico (-4.7 percentage points year-on-year), and 16.4 % in the rest of the world (-3.2 percentage points year-on-year).\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) fell by around 32 % to € 160.0 million (previous year: € 235.3 million), which equates to an EBIT margin of 6.0 %. In the motorcycle segment, the EBIT margin is around 9 %, which is within the range of 8-10 % that was originally envisaged. By contrast, the restructuring of the bicycle sector that was initiated had a significant impact on the result. The earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of € 323.5 million is around 15 % below the previous year's figure, which equates to an EBITDA margin of 12.2 %. The net result after tax amounts to € 76.4 million (previous year: € 170.6 million).\n\nThe overall sales figures of the PIERER Mobility Group as well as the sales of PTWs (motorcycles and e-bicycles) are as follows:\n\nUnit sales total (Number of units)\n\nImage /page/9/Figure/6 description: This image shows a horizontal bar chart comparing the number of PTWs and Bicycles in 2022 and 2023. In 2023, the number of PTWs is 482,195, the number of Bicycles is not explicitly stated on the bar but the total number of PTWs and Bicycles is 538,913. In 2022, the number of PTWs is 449,971, the number of Bicycles is not explicitly stated on the bar but the total number of PTWs and Bicycles is 493,957.\n\nThe two segments \"Motorcycles\" and \"Bicycles\" represent the main operating areas of the PIERER Mobility Group, the development of which is discussed below.\n\n#### MOTORCYCLES\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the Motorcycle Division achieved revenue of € 2,416.4 million (previous year: € 2,262.5 million) (+6.8 % compared to the previous year). In the motorcycle sector, the costs of inventories for dealers rose sharply despite a good level of demand because of significantly higher interest rates. This meant that, in order to strengthen the dealer structure, extended payment terms and higher discounts had to be granted to the dealers. In the 2023 financial year, EBITDA amounted to € 371.0 million (previous year: € 381.2 million) and EBIT was € 214.4 million (previous year: € 241.0 million). This\n\ncorresponds to an EBITDA margin of 15.4 % (previous year: 16.8 %) and an EBIT margin of 8.9 % (previous year: 10.7 %).\n\nIn Europe, revenue rose significantly compared to the previous year's level to € 1,229.0 million (previous year: € 977.4 million), corresponding to a revenue share of 50.9 % (previous year: 43.2 %). In North America, the motorcycle sector recorded revenue of € 754.4 million (previous year: 811.3 million). This meant that 31.2 % of revenue was generated in North America (previous year: 35.9 %). Revenue in the other countries fell slightly compared to the previous year by 8.6 % to € 432.9 million. The share of revenue in the other countries is 17.9 % (previous year: 20.9 %).\n\nWith 280,206 KTM motorcycles sold, 67,462 Husqvarna motorcycles sold and 29,532 GASGAS motorcycles sold in the 2023 financial year, plus the motorcycles sold by MV Agusta (1,852) and CFMOTO (2,503), sales of 381,555 motorcycles (2022: 375,492 units) were achieved (including the motorcycles sold in India and Indonesia by partner Bajaj). The Motorcycle Division thus achieved a 1.6 % increase in unit sales, consolidating its presence in the important motorcycle sales markets with its three motorcycle brands\n\n#### Unit sales 2023 Motorcycles (Number of units)\\* 381,555\n\nImage /page/9/Figure/14 description: This image is a bar chart for the year 2023. The chart contains 5 bars of different colors and lengths, each representing a different value. The first bar is orange and has a value of 280,206. The second bar is dark blue and has a value of 67,462. The third bar is red and has a value of 29,532. The fourth bar is black and has a value of 2,503. The fifth bar is light blue and has a value of 1,852.\n\n\\* includes 8,957 units E-Balance Bikes and 69 units Skutta\n\nUnit sales 2022 Motorcycles (Number of units) 375,492\n\nImage /page/9/Figure/17 description: This bar chart shows the sales of different motorcycle brands in 2022. KTM sold 268,575 motorcycles, Husqvarna Motorcycles sold 75,266 motorcycles, and GASGAS sold 31,651 motorcycles.\n\nIn the European sales regions, unit sales were 140,214 motorcycles (+14.9 %). Around two thirds of the motorcycles produced (241,341) were sold in markets outside Europe. Growth was particularly strong in India/Nepal, where 66,426 motorcycles were sold.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nThis represented an increase of 29.0 % compared to the previous year. Despite a slight decline in sales in North America (-7.7 %), the group's subsidiary there nevertheless managed to sell more than 100,000 motorcycles for the second time in a row, with 101,277 units sold. While sales fell in South America with 27,671 motorcycles sold (-26.4 %) and in Asia with 23,129 motorcycles sold (-27.3 %), sales of 19,648 motorcycles in Australia were slightly above the previous year's level (previous year: 19,478 units) (+1 %).\n\n#### Unit sales by region 2023\n\n- 36.7% Europe\n- 26.5% North America (incl. Mexico)\n- 17.4% India / Indonesia (by Bajaj)\n- 19.3% remaning global region\n\nImage /page/10/Picture/6 description: The image is a donut chart divided into four sections. The sections are shaded in different tones of gray, ranging from light gray to dark gray. The sections appear to be of roughly equal size.\n\n#### Revenue by region 2023\n\n- 50.9% Europe\n- 31.2% North America (incl. Mexico)\n- 17.9% remaning global region\n\nImage /page/10/Picture/11 description: The image is a donut chart divided into four sections. The sections are shaded in different tones of gray, with the lightest gray occupying the largest portion, followed by a medium gray, a darker gray, and the darkest gray.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, 217,160 motorcycles were produced at the Mattighofen production site, thus exceeding 200,000 motorcycles once again. Compared to the previous year, this constitutes a slight decline of -4,881 units or -2.2 %. Taking into account the small-engine KTM and Husqvarna models produced by our partner Bajaj Auto Ltd. in India, the GASGAS trial bikes produced in Spain, and the models produced with our partner CFMOTO in China, 385,330 motorcycles were manufactured worldwide (previous year: 381,823).\n\n#### BICYCLES\n\nSurplus stocks in the bicycle sector globally meant that the PIERER Mobility Group also faced a sharp drop in market prices. The growth of sales in this segment with the Husqvarna, R Raymon, GASGAS and FELT brands of around 33 % was driven by inventory adjustments and the sale of the R Raymon brand. In the 2023 financial year, 157,358 bicycles were sold (previous year: 118,465), of which 100,640 were e-bicycles (previous year: 74,479). In the bicycle segment, the DACH region still represents the largest sales market at around 60 %. In the Bicycle Division, the share of sales in North America in 2023 was 10 %.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, revenue of € 240.7 million was generated in the Bicycle Division (previous year: € 171.2 million). This represents a year-on-year increase in revenue of 40.6 %. EBITDA in 2023 was € -41.8 million (previous year: € 6.5 million) and EBIT was € -47.1 million (previous year: € 2.5 million).\n\nOf the e-bicycles sold in the 2023 financial year, 69.9 % were sold under the R Raymon brand, 20.7 % under the Husqvarna E-Bicycles brand, and 7.6 % under the GASGAS brand. Sales of non-e bicycles were spread between the two brands R Raymon at 60.0 % and FELT at 37.8 % (there was an almost even split in the previous year).\n\nUnit sales 2023 (E-)Bicycles (Number of units) 157,358\n\nImage /page/10/Figure/18 description: This image is a bar chart comparing the unit sales of (E-)Bicycles and Bicycles in 2022 and 2023. In 2023, (E-)Bicycles had unit sales of 100,640, while Bicycles had unit sales of 56,718. In 2022, (E-)Bicycles had unit sales of 74,479, while Bicycles had unit sales of 43,986. The unit sales of (E-)Bicycles in 2022 is 118,465.\n\nAround 87 % of sales were in Europe and here in particular in the DACH region. A further 10 % were in the North American sales region and the remaining sales (around 3 %) were in Asia, South America and Australia.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Unit sales by region 2023\n\n- 60.1% DACH region\n- 26.6% remaining Europe 13.4% remaining global region\n\nImage /page/11/Picture/4 description: The image is a donut chart with three sections. The largest section is white, the second largest is light gray, and the smallest section is dark gray.\n\n#### Revenue by region 2023\n\n71.8% DACH region 17.4% remaining Europe 10.8% remaining global region\n\nImage /page/11/Picture/7 description: The image is a donut chart. The largest segment of the chart is white, followed by a light gray segment, and then a dark gray segment.\n\n#### BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\n\nThe balance sheet structure of the PIERER Mobility Group is as follows:\n\n|                         | 2022      |        |  | 2023      |        |\n|-------------------------|-----------|--------|--|-----------|--------|\n|                         | € million | in %   |  | € million | in %   |\n| Non-current assets      | 1,195.8   | 46.9%  |  | 1,333.8   | 45.2%  |\n| Current assets          | 1,354.8   | 53.1%  |  | 1,619.1   | 54.8%  |\n| Assets                  | 2,550.6   | 100.0% |  | 2,952.9   | 100.0% |\n| Equity                  | 914.4     | 35.8%  |  | 909.3     | 30.8%  |\n| Non-current liabilities | 625.6     | 24.5%  |  | 1,130.0   | 38.3%  |\n| Current liabilities     | 1,010.6   | 39.6%  |  | 913.6     | 30.9%  |\n| Equity and liabilities  | 2,550.6   | 100.0% |  | 2,952.9   | 100.0% |\n\nThe statement of financial position total of the PIERER Mobility Group increased by 15.8 % from € 2,550.6 million to € 2,952.9 million compared to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022.\n\nSimilar to previous years, the increase in non-current assets from € 1,195.8 million to € 1,333.8 million was in particular in the area of development projects, which was above the level of amortization and resulted in an increase in intangible assets. In addition, property, plant and equipment also increased, mainly as a result of investments in the PIERER MAXCOM Mobility OOD production site in Bulgaria.\n\nWithin current assets, inventories in particular increased by € 203.3 million. The other material changes involved firstly the increase in trade receivables of € 80.4 million and secondly the reduction in cash of € 19.8 million. Overall, this resulted in an increase in current assets of 19.5 % to € 1,619.1 million.\n\nCurrent liabilities decreased by € 97.0 million (-9.6 %) compared to December 31, 2022. This decrease was largely due to the fall in trade payables of € -60.6 million and provisions of € -22.2 million.\n\nThe provision of € 20.2 million that was set up in the previous year and formed as part of the cooperation agreement with MV Agusta was fully used up in 2023.\n\nNon-current liabilities increased by 80.6 % to € 1,130.0 million. The increase was largely due to the increase in financial liabilities, in particular from the taking up of a promissory note loan with a volume of € 300.0 million, a research loan from the European Investment Bank amounting to € 100.0 million, and a registered bond amounting to € 50 million.\n\nEquity decreased by € 5.1 million from € 914.4 million to € 909.3 million in the 2023 financial year. On the one hand, equity was strengthened by a net result after tax of € 76.4 million. On the other hand, dividend payments of € 68.1 million led to a reduction in equity. The other effects of € -13.4 million essentially concern the recognition of foreign currency differences with no effect on profit or loss, the measurement of financial instruments and the revaluation of net debt from defined benefit plans. At 30.8 %, the equity ratio is below the value as of December 31, 2023 of 35.8 % due to the balance sheet increase described above.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS\n\nThe cash flow from operating activities was € -110.9 million in the 2023 financial year, and was therefore significantly below the previous year's value of € 280.3 million, which was primarily attributable to the increase in working capital. The cash outflow from investments amounted to € -302.1 million and was higher overall than the previous year's figure of € -283.1 million. This increase was mainly due to the higher payments for the acquisition of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (effect € -66.4 million).\n\nAs has already been explained, in the motorcycle sector the costs of inventories for dealers rose sharply despite a good level of demand because of significantly higher interest rates. This meant that, in order to strengthen the dealer structure, extended payment terms and higher discounts had to be granted to the dealers. Thanks to its sufficient liquidity reserves, PIERER Mobility AG was able to provide appropriate support to both its dealers and its suppliers in order to stabilize their financial situation and to lessen the significantly increased burdens resulting from increased interest rates. The associated negative impact on free cash flow, which amounted to € -413.0 million in 2023 (previous year: € -2.8 million), was deliberately accepted.\n\nAfter taking the cash flow from financing activities of € 398.7 million into account, liquid funds decreased by € 19.8 million (including foreign currency effects of € -5.4 million) to € 259.0 million compared to December 31, 2022.\n\nThanks to the strong equity base and long-term financing, sufficient liquidity reserves are available on a sustainable basis.\n\n#### INVESTMENTS\n\nIn the current financial year, total investments in the PIERER Mobility Group amounted to € 316.5 million (previous year: € 293.4 million) including IFRS 16 lease additions of € 32.5 million (previous year: € 25.9 million). The investments excluding leasing projects were divided between development projects (incl. tools), property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as follows:\n\nImage /page/12/Figure/7 description: The image shows a stacked bar chart comparing financial data for FY 2023 and FY 2022. For FY 2023, the total is 284.0 Mio. Euro, broken down as follows: intangible assets (32.6), property, plant, and equipment (56.3), and R&D (incl. tools) (195.1). For FY 2022, the total is 267.5 Mio. Euro, broken down as follows: intangible assets (44.0), property, plant, and equipment (62.1), and F&E (incl. tools) (161.4).\n\nAs usual, high investments were made in series development projects (including tools) in the past financial year. The investments in development projects (incl. tools) as a percentage of total investments were 69 %, which was above the previous year's level (previous year: 60 %). The consistently high investments in series product development represent one of the key success factors of the PIERER Mobility Group. At 20 %, investments in infrastructure (property, plant and equipment) were also slightly below the previous year's level of 23 %. Another 11 % (previous year: 17 %) was attributable to intangible assets (IT and licenses).\n\nThe investments made in recent years have safeguarded the production capacities required for the years ahead. The focus of the investments has been and still is, therefore, on other types of projects, in particular on the (further) development of existing and new models, electric mobility and high-tech modernization. These are currently and will continue to be the PIERER Mobility Group's top priority for investments. In line with strategic goals, expenditure on investments in research and development will remain at the already high level of the last few years.\n\nOne of the most significant single investments in the 2022 financial year was the continued construction and completion of the new headquarters of KTM North America in Murrieta, California. The company site has been built over an area of approximately 14,000 m² and houses office and motorsport buildings as well as warehouse space. The opening ceremony took place in Murrieta on March 28, 2023. With a total level of investment of around USD 55 million, this represents one of the largest single investments that the PIERER Mobility Group has ever made.\n\nAs in previous years, major investment projects in 2023 were primarily development projects and the purchase of tools and equipment.\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-13-0\"></span>4.

RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT AND NEW MODELS\n\nFor PIERER Mobility AG, as the leading manufacturer of premium powered two-wheeler (PTW) vehicles in Europe, it is our declared goal to further expand our leading role in the world of motorcycling in terms of technology, sales, and image. We have been particularly focused on the area of research and development for several years. The result of the R&D strategy we have pursued is innovative products that meet our customers' high expectations in technology and performance. At the same time, it makes it possible for us to develop new markets in a manner that ensures lasting success.\n\nParticularly high priority is given to the early recognition of trends in the powered two-wheeler (PTW) segment and the further development of the product range from a technical and functional perspective. At the same time, we have a strong commitment to tracking, recognizing and implementing customer requirements with regard to the PIERER Mobility Group's products and services. This enables us to further build on the pioneering role we have developed in the past and to ensure a market-oriented product development strategy.\n\nThanks to the globally active research and development organization, the PIERER Mobility Group has a network of highly qualified employees – for instance in the construction, computation and simulation sectors. This network is supported by the in-house machinery and equipment that performs the production, construction and validation of newly developed prototypes. This combination allows us to react with a high degree of flexibility to changing requirements and the level of complexity associated with this.\n\nAs of the reporting date of December 31, 2023, the company employed 1,302 people (previous year: 976 employees), representing 21.1 % of the total workforce. In operational terms, excluding the ancillary effect of capitalization and amortization of development expenses, 9.2 % of total revenue was spent on research and development, corresponding in absolute figures to € 244.4 million (previous year: € 213.2 million).\n\nThe research and development division of the PIERER Mobility Group, which is brought together within KTM Forschungs & Entwicklungs GmbH (KTM F&E GmbH), is organized globally with decentralized locations in Europe (especially Austria and Spain) and America. The development programs are centrally managed at the R&D headquarters in Mattighofen and in Munderfing, where the majority of our employees from the research and development department are based. The research and development center at the headquarters in Mattighofen is an innovation site with a floor space of over 20,000 m² where pioneering products for the powersport segment are designed, developed and tested using the latest methods and equipment.\n\nIn organizational terms, KTM Technologies GmbH, with its registered office in Anif near Salzburg, is part of KTM F&E GmbH and is regarded as a specialist in future mobility, particularly in the areas of concept and technology development and lightweight construction. The success factor is the application-oriented development of new solutions and technologies. KTM Technologies GmbH possesses great expertise in vehicle concept development, including the use of multi-material, composite and additive manufacturing technologies. As an innovation hub, it works closely with KTM F&E GmbH and customers from other industrial sectors. Its partners and customers include established OEMs and start-ups from sectors such as automotive and aerospace, mechanical engineering and the sporting goods industry. Thanks to the cross-industry service portfolio, both the group and third-party customers benefit from a broad spectrum of expertise and opportunities for technology transfer.\n\nWhen the KTM Freeride E was launched on the market in 2014, the PIERER Mobility Group was considered a pioneer in the field of electric mobility. In recent years, the range of electric vehicles in various performance categories has been extended to all brands in the group. The development of electric motorcycle models is largely carried out at the in-house center of excellence in Anif near Salzburg.\n\nBecause motorcycles with electric drive systems are still subject to significant practical restrictions due to their low power density, one of the key work packages for research over the past year was to reduce the exhaust and noise emissions of the PIERER Mobility Group's range of internal combustion engines. To continue operating in the premium vehicle segments with high performance and range requirements as dynamically as before, the projects included in-depth examination of future-proof synthetic fuels known as e-fuels and testing of fuels with increased bioethanol content.\n\nThe noise emissions of motorcycles have become an important acceptance criterion for this vehicle category in recent years. As uniform type approval standards have not yet been specified for off-road sports motorcycles, research into the noise sources of these models and solutions derived from this for significantly reducing noise emissions was continued in the 2023 financial year.\n\nWith regard to exhaust emissions, work began to develop a new generation of power packs (performance class 110-170 kW) for the 2029 model year. The aim of the project is to reduce CO2 consumption in the WMTC cycle by 20-35 % compared to the previous model. A top-down strategy is to be devised for series use of the new power packs. The first step will be to equip the premium models with this powertrain starting in 2029. In subsequent model years, the intention will be to use this power pack generation in other segments as well.\n\nKTM F&E GmbH continues its commitment as a founding member of the Swappable Batteries Motorcycle Consortium (SBMC). The aim is to meet customer expectations for range, charging time and\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\ncosts through international standardization of the battery system, thus making an important contribution to the further spread of electrified mobility concepts in urban living areas. Whereas activities in 2022 focused mainly on the definition of uniform technical specifications for the battery system within the member base, activities in 2023 included the development of battery prototypes by selected suppliers. The main objective of the first phase of prototyping is to validate and refine the specifications.\n\nVirtualization of product development is an important building block for reducing development times, costs and quality risks. Ultimately, the physical testing of components and complete vehicles on corresponding test benches is an indispensable part of the testing of new products. For this purpose, a test area covering 300 m² operates at the Anif site in order to ensure quality assurance of the products during development.\n\nThe modular electronics platform initiative, which was launched in 2022, continued in 2023 and was actually marketed in the first few vehicles, such as the 1390 SUPER DUKE R. The aim of this modular platform is to create standardized interfaces in order to guarantee that components can be replaced rapidly.\n\nConnectivity features that enable data exchange between the vehicle and accessories such as smartphones have undergone intense development in recent years and are now regarded as indispensable features, especially in the premium segment. In addition to the development of convenience functions such as telephony and navigation, a key part of the activities over the year under review were the development and testing of systems for communication between the motorcycle and other vehicles, or between the motorcycle and road infrastructure such as traffic lights. In addition, research was also conducted into the use of (vehicle) data, particularly in the context of product development. For example, the procurement, production and maintenance of physical prototypes involves a considerable expenditure of resources. By introducing virtual development methods, the expense involved in testing physical components and assemblies right through to the complete vehicle can be significantly reduced, while also improving the resulting product. These virtual approaches can be applied to digitalization in lamp development, for example.\n\nAnother pillar of the development philosophy that the company pursues is using high-quality materials in all vehicles, resulting in a reduction in vehicle weight and the associated potential for reducing fuel consumption and emissions and improving ridability. For example, intensive efforts in recent years have made it possible to further reduce the weight of our offroad competition models with each generation. Among the many research and development\n\nprojects in the development of materials and surfaces, work was carried out on developing and testing wheels and chassis components made of fiber-reinforced composites, as well as on further developing the manufacturing process for plastic parts with design elements featuring hybrid construction.\n\n#### MOTORCYCLE MODELS\n\nThe 2023 financial year was very much defined by a major model rollout with a total of 72 new and revised models from the three core brands KTM, Husqvarna and GASGAS.\n\nFollowing its success in 2021, the KTM 1290 SUPER DUKE RR returned as a limited-edition special model in the first quarter of 2023. In 2022, the partnership between KTM and BRABUS was sealed with the presentation of the BRABUS 1300 R to enable BRABUS to compete in the world of motorcycle racing. This cooperation continued with the introduction of the BRABUS 1300 R Masterpiece Edition.\n\nThe KTM Enduro range for the 2024 model year bears testament to many years at the pinnacle of Enduro motorsport and is a dynamic blend of racing performance, ergonomics and the leading technology in the industry. The new model generation features a brand-new look and a new chassis concept, revised engines with the new throttle body fuel injection for two-stroke engines and a new generation of WP chassis elements, providing a better riding experience and greater comfort for riders of all ages and skill levels.\n\nKTM celebrated the rebirth of an icon with the KTM 890 SMT 2023. The motorcycle with the overhauled LC8c platform was developed to be the very best in the Supermoto Touring segment in terms of power, torque and weight. This model is positioned between the KTM ADVENTURE and KTM STREET product series.\n\nIn the second half of the year, a new, Euro5+-compliant generation of the DUKE model series featuring new 125, 250, 390, 990 and 1390 models was also unveiled. The new LC4c platform (125 & 390 DUKE) offers a segment-leading power/weight ratio and electronic assistance systems with two-channel ABS and lean-angle-dependent traction control. The new 990 DUKE is based on a new generation of the LC8c engine with 123 hp and 103 Nm of torque as well as a newly developed electronic platform with state-of-the-art assistance systems and an LED projector headlight with daytime running light to provide an unmistakable DUKE signature. The new 1390 SUPER DUKE R is also based on an enhanced LC8 engine with new camshift technology that enabled a further increase in performance to 190 hp & 145 Nm of torque without increasing the bike's weight. In addition,\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\nthe 1390 SUPER DUKE R EVO has been given a revised WP APEX chassis with semi-active technology that enables electronic adjustment of the chassis, enhanced performance while maintaining a high level of comfort while riding, and lots more adjustment options.\n\nIn March 2023, Husqvarna Motorcycles presented the Norden 901 Expedition, a powerful touring motorcycle equipped with an array of convenient functions, designed for use both on the road and off-road. In the last quarter of 2023, the Skutta, an electric scooter for urban conurbations, was also presented and this is just the first step in a major rollout of Husqvarna models for the street segment in 2024.\n\nIn the Enduro model range for the 2024 model year, Husqvarna Motorcycles presented nine completely redesigned machines featuring the latest technology and advanced electronics so it can continue to set new standards in the offroad segment. A variety of technical accessories and apparel added the finishing touch to the market launch of the current two-stroke and four-stroke models. The new TE 300 Pro & FE 350 Pro special models have specifications with additional technical accessories for hard-enduro competitions, making them the perfect choice for competitive customers.\n\nThe last quarter also saw the unveiling of a new generation of the popular 50cc & 65cc sports minicycles featuring a new look, new chassis and redesigned engines for junior offroad competitions.\n\nGASGAS also presented a new generation of its Motocross, Enduro and Cross Country model range for 2024 with 16 dirt bikes based on the current off-road platform and supplemented this with innovative, battery-powered products in the form of the MC-E 1.12, MC-E 1.16 and MC-E 1.20. These electric balance bikes, designed specifically for children from the age of three, enable children to learn how to ride two-wheeled vehicles safely while having fun, and they are equipped with a quick-swap battery system to guarantee almost uninterrupted riding. The three new models are also available for the KTM and Husqvarna Motorcycles brands.\n\nThe transfer to series production of electrically powered motorcycle models was completed across all brands with the KTM SX-E 2, Husqvarna EE 2 and GASGAS MC-E 2 as well as the KTM SX E3, HUSQVARNA EE3 and GASGAS MC E-3 models.\n\n#### BICYCLE MODELS\n\nThe first half of 2023 also saw the release of a series of redesigned products and a number of technical innovations in the bicycle division. Husqvarna E-Bicycles focuses on innovative electric mobility solutions to tap into promising new markets worldwide. The Mountain Cross 6 (MC6), which was unveiled in 2022, is the template for future product innovations and strengthens the position that Husqvarna E-Bicycles occupies in the e-MTB sector. The new Light Cross 6 (LC6) expands the range of models in the off-road segment. Specific PG&A items and several new product lines complete the Urban Range and Allroad model segment. In October 2023, the new MY24 Husqvarna E-MTBs were presented.\n\nGASGAS E-Bicycles is building on the success of the GASGAS brand in the motorcycle segment. With its powerful E-MTBs for off-road routes, the brand was also able to expand its reach worldwide in the first quarter of 2023, following a successful financial year in 2022. The experience gained from off-road motorsport along with the knowledge of technologies and materials will play an even greater role in the development of new electrified New Mobility products. The new GASGAS ECC Race prototype was presented at the Sea Otter Festival in Monterey, California. It is an e-mountain bike that features lots of new specifications and components.\n\nIn June 2023, PIERER New Mobility displayed more new models along with product developments in the bicycle and New Mobility segments at EUROBIKE in Frankfurt. Alongside a new model from the Grand City series for urban and all-road mobility from Husqvarna E-Bicycles, GASGAS Bicycles unveiled the MOTO Urban Cruiser, a beach cruiser designed with a Supermoto look.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-17-0\"></span>6. OPPORTUNITIES AND RISK REPORT\n\nThe business activities of the PIERER Mobility Group are characterized by ongoing changes. Exploiting the opportunities that these changes present is the essential cornerstone of the success of the PIERER Mobility Group. In order to secure the future success of the business and exploit the opportunities that arise, the group must consciously take risks.\n\nThe management of opportunities and risks is the basis for responding appropriately to changes in the underlying political, economic, technical or legal conditions. Where it is likely that the opportunities or risks identified will occur, they have already been incorporated into the statements made in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the group management report. The following statements include possible future developments or events that could lead to a positive (opportunities) or negative (risks) deviation from the company forecast for the PIERER Mobility Group.\n\nAs part of risk management, all individual and cumulative risks that could jeopardize the success of the company are monitored and controlled. Risks that could jeopardize the company as a going concern are generally avoided. The scope of risk consolidation corresponds to the scope of consolidation of the consolidated financial statements of the PIERER Mobility Group.\n\n#### RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe main purpose of the PIERER Mobility Group's risk management system is to safeguard and strengthen the company by correctly and transparently assessing financial, operational and strategic risks. In this context, the Executive Board, together with the management of the main group companies – in particular KTM AG, performs extensive management and controlling tasks within the framework of an internal, integrated control system that covers all major sites. Recognizing, evaluating and responding to strategic and operational risks promptly is an essential part of the management activities of these units and adds significant value to the company. The basis for this is a uniform, group-wide, regular reporting system and ongoing monitoring of operational and strategic plans.\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group has a multi-level risk management system in which group-wide risks are identified by division or geographical area. Operational responsibility and the assessment of group-wide risks is carried out by the risk management of KTM AG and local management and is reported directly to and monitored by the Executive Board and the Group Executive Board.\n\nPreventive analysis of potential events is another aim of risk management. In addition, risk management is also responsible for actively controlling risks and defining and evaluating appropriate measures with the business units concerned.\n\n#### RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group bases its risk management strategy on the COSO® framework. Accordingly, the group has defined the following core areas of the risk management strategy:\n\n| Risk<br>Identification       | • Structured recording of opportunities and individual risks in the sectors<br>• Implementation of risk workshops<br>• Identification takes place, among other things, by means of the standard risk catalog |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Risk<br>Assessment           | • Failure mode and effect analysis<br>• Extend of damage and probability of occurrence                                                                                                                       |\n| Risk<br>Control              | • Control of the overall risk position by influencing opportunities and<br>individual risk<br>• Control of the effectiveness of measures                                                                     |\n| Reporting<br>+<br>Monitoring | • Continuous monitoring<br>• Collection, evaluation, forwarding of information<br>• Reporting                                                                                                                |\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\nRisk management established at the level of KTM AG regularly carries out risk analyses. Only risks that deviate from the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated income statement are presented.\n\n## ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\n\nEnterprise Risk Management in the PIERER Mobility Group is a continuous process that is used to identify and evaluate, analyze and report, define and track measures in relation to the operational and strategic risks and opportunities across the group. This forms the basis for a standard, group-wide reporting system and ensures ongoing monitoring of operational and strategic risks.\n\nThe group has a multi-level risk management process in which group-wide risks are identified by areas. The Risk Management department is responsible for ensuring that the information is implemented and kept up-to-date. The information about the risk situation is provided by the risk owners from each department. The Risk Management department reports directly to the Executive Board of KTM AG. It and the Group Executive Board are provided with a regular report on the overall risk situation for monitoring purposes.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities are considered and taken into account equally in the following process steps:\n\n#### Identification & assessment\n\nThe risks and opportunities are identified as part of the risk assessments, managed at the level of KTM AG. These risk assessments discuss and identify climate-related risks and opportunities in equal measure, as well as financial, operational or strategic risks, with the affected risk owners from each department.\n\nThe aim of the risk assessment is to perform continuous, qualitative and quantitative evaluation of all identified opportunities and risks in order to prioritize risk control measures. Opportunity and risk assessment at the PIERER Mobility Group should meet the following requirements:\n\n- Objectivity: The assessment should be performed according to standards that are as objective as possible.\n- Comparability: To allow the opportunities and risks to be compared with each other, a quantitative assessment is made using uniformly defined values (where reasonable and possible)\n\nIn principle, the risks and opportunities are assessed to identify how likely they are to occur and the level of damage to the group's asset position, financial position and earnings position, using a scenario-based approach consisting of best case (BC), realistic case (RC) and worst case (WC). The quantification can be based on\n\n(a) risks that have actually occurred in the past, (b) benchmark values from the industry, or (c) expert assessments. The choice of the relevant distribution depends on the type of risk, but in most cases this will equate to a PERT distribution. In addition to the quantitative assessment of risks and opportunities, the methodology also envisages making a qualitative assessment, which is particularly useful in relation to climate-related and environment-related risks and opportunities.\n\n#### RISK ASSESSMENT\n\n#### Analysis & reporting\n\nThe structured consolidation of the overall risk inventory is followed by a Monte Carlo simulation, which produces the overall risk situation and the key figures that are needed. In addition, the biggest risks and opportunities for the group are identified to complete the picture. Of course, this also includes the main climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\n#### Definition & tracking of measures\n\nThe main objective of risk mitigation is to ensure an active, continuous, and controlled influence on the risks and opportunities, taking account of the corporate strategy and economic viability, in order to deliberately manage the company's overall risk exposure and thus produce an increase in the value of the company over the long term. Risks are minimized, avoided or even consciously taken in certain cases by adopting appropriate measures; the strategy is defined and evaluated by the respective risk owner. The Risk Management department is regularly informed about the status of the measures. The measures and objectives for climate-related risks and opportunities are defined in cooperation with the ESG department.\n\n#### Ad-hoc reporting\n\nIf there are ad-hoc changes to the risk situation, the Risk Management department must be notified immediately by the risk owners of the specialist departments and be kept informed.\n\nBased on this, the risk and opportunity management strategy is developed.\n\n#### Risk monitoring / control\n\nThe essence of operational risk management is to identify, evaluate and control significant risks arising from operations. This process is carried out in particular by the senior and middle management levels of KTM AG and monitored by the Executive Board of PIERER Mobility AG.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### OPPORTUNITIES AND RISK REPORT\n\nThe following overview provides a general summary of the main risks and opportunities identified and thus shows their significance to the PIERER Mobility Group and the corresponding packages of measures. Overall, the PIERER Mobility Group has not identified any risks that could jeopardize its continued existence as a going concern, neither on the reporting date nor at the time that the financial statements were prepared.\n\n| Risks/opportunities                      | Description

DISCLOSURES PURSUANT TO SECTION 243A (1) OF THE AUSTRIAN COMMERCIAL CODE (UGB)\n\n- 1. The share capital is EUR 33,796,535, and is divided into 33,796,535 bearer shares with voting rights, where every ordinary share has an equal stake in the share capital. The shares grant the customary rights due to stockholders under the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. These include the right to payout of the dividends resolved upon at the Annual General Meeting as well as the right to vote at the Annual General Meeting. All the shares of PIERER Mobility AG have been listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX) in the International Reporting Standard since November 14, 2016 (ISIN AT0000KTMI02). Since March 1, 2022, the shares of PIERER Mobility AG have additionally been listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange (Official Market). There was no change in the company's share capital in the 2023 financial year. Likewise, no treasury shares were acquired or sold, which is why the company did not hold any treasury shares as of the reporting date of December 31, 2023.\n- 2.

The 2021 Syndicate Agreement provides that the rules of procedure for the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of Pierer Bajaj AG require the approval of the Supervisory Board members of Pierer Bajaj AG nominated by Bajaj in the event of a transfer of ownership of shares in PIERER Mobility AG. Pierer Bajaj AG, which is economically attributable to Stefan Pierer, is thus subject to restrictions on disposal in light of the syndicate agreement at the level of Pierer Bajaj AG. The Executive Board is not aware of any other restrictions affecting voting rights or the transfer of shares.\n- 3.

The capital increase may only be carried out to the extent that the creditors of financial instruments make use of their options of conversion and/or pre-emption rights on company shares. The issue amount and the exchange ratio are to be determined in accordance with recognized methods of financial mathematics and the share price in a recognized pricing procedure. The newly issued shares of the conditional capital increase are entitled to dividends to the same extent as the existing shares in the company. The Executive Board is authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to determine the further details of the implementation of the conditional capital increase. The Supervisory Board is authorized to resolve amendments to the articles of association resulting from the issue of shares from the conditional capital.\n\nThe conditional capital increase serves the purpose of servicing any convertible bond issued and may explicitly be implemented only to the extent that the creditors of convertible bonds exercise their conversion and/or subscription rights to shares in the company.\n\nThis conditional capital increase is for issuing new shares to creditors of financial instruments pursuant to Section 174 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, which are issued using the authorization granted in the Annual General Meeting held on April 21, 2023 by the company. This authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting on April 21, 2023 to issue financial instruments pursuant to Section 174 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act has not yet been used.\n\nThe following resolutions were also passed by the Annual General Meeting on April 21, 2023 in relation to the acquisition and sale of treasury shares:\n\n- d) Pursuant to Section 65(1)(8) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Executive Board is authorized for a period of 30 months from the date when the resolution was passed to acquire treasury shares of the company both on and off the stock exchange, also excluding the shareholders' right to offer shares on a quota basis, and, without having to refer the matter to the Annual General Meeting again in advance, to retire these shares if necessary with the approval of the Supervisory Board. Trading in treasury shares is excluded as a purpose of the acquisition. The proportion of shares to be acquired may not exceed 10 % of the share capital. The value received per no-par-value share to be acquired may not be more than 20 % below or above the average unweighted closing price on the SIX Swiss Exchange over the past 10 trading days. The authorization may be exercised in whole or in part or in several installments and in pursuit of one or more purposes by the company, by affiliated companies or by third parties for the account of the company. The Supervisory Board is authorized to adopt amendments to the Articles of Association resulting from the redemption of shares.\n- e) The Executive Board is authorized for a period of five years from the date when the resolution was passed, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to sell or use treasury shares in a way other than via the stock exchange or by means of a public offer for any legally permissible purpose and in so doing also to exclude the shareholders' quota-based purchase right (exclusion of subscription rights) and to determine the terms and conditions of disposal. The authorization may be exercised in whole or in part or in several installments and in pursuit of one or more purposes.\n- 8. Any agreements on the part of the company which would take effect, change or cease to apply in the case of a change in the controlling interest in the company as a result of a public takeover offer, or the effects thereof, will not be disclosed by the company due to the fact that it would considerably harm the company.\n- 9.

MAIN FEATURES OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM PURSUANT TO SECTION 243A (2) OF THE AUSTRIAN COMMERCIAL CODE (UGB)\n\nThe internal control system of the PIERER Mobility Group has the task of ensuring the correctness and reliability of financial reporting, compliance with the legal and internal regulations relevant to the company, as well as the effectiveness and efficiency of operational activities, including the protection of assets from losses due to damages and malversations. Internationally accepted frameworks for internal control systems (e.g. COSO framework) have been considered in designing the elements of the internal control system. The system comprises:\n\n- Group-wide specifications for financial reporting\n- Segregation of duties as an organizational measure\n- System-based and process-dependent controls\n- Process-independent controls\n- Management of risks relating to the preparation of financial statements\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group is committed to the continuous development and improvement of the internal control system. To this end, its functionality is regularly monitored through process and data analyses as well as independent, external audit activities. The main features of the internal control system with regard to the financial reporting process are presented below.\n\n#### CONTROL ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe organizational structure of the PIERER Mobility Group forms the basis for the control environment and the internal control system within the company. In terms of the organizational structure in (group) financial reporting, there are clear areas of competence and responsibility at the various management and hierarchical levels of the group. On the one hand, this relates to the group headquarters in Wels as well as the Austrian and all international subsidiaries. Treasury and Business Process Finance are located in the operating areas of the group, with duties and responsibilities also being clearly divided here.\n\nThe strong international orientation of the PIERER Mobility Group and the associated decentralized structures of the company and different sites are taken into account by centralizing key corporate functions in the area of financial reporting at the Austrian sites (especially in Mattighofen). The performance and management of national business activities is the responsibility of the respective local management and is monitored by the Executive Board of KTM AG and the Group Executive Board.\n\nIn terms of process organization, the PIERER Mobility Group relies on a distinctive and comprehensive set of accounting, valuation and account assignment rules. This provides an appropriate basis for a strong control environment and control system. New accounting standards are assessed with regard to their impact on the financial reporting of the PIERER Mobility Group. The specifications for financial reporting and financial reporting processes are reviewed on an ongoing basis and adjusted at least annually, or more frequently if necessary. Monitoring compliance with the controls and regulations relating to financial reporting is the responsibility of the relevant management.\n\n#### RISK ASSESSMENT\n\nRisks relating to the financial reporting process are identified and monitored by the management and taken into account in the risk management process. The focus here is on those risks that are to be considered material.\n\nMaterial risks in the area of financial reporting include incomplete recording of facts relevant to accounting, errors in document recording, and incorrect calculations. Complex accounting principles could lead to an increased risk of error, incorrect reporting, and late preparation of financial statements. There is also a risk of data being accessed by unauthorized persons or of data being manipulated, IT systems failing, and data being lost.\n\nFor the preparation of the financial statements, estimates have to be made on a regular basis and there is an inherent risk that future developments may deviate from these estimates. This applies in particular to the following matters/items in the consolidated financial statements: Social capital, outcome of legal disputes, recoverability of receivables, investments and stocks. In some cases, external experts are consulted or publicly available sources are used to minimize the risk of incorrect estimates.\n\n#### CONTROL MEASURES\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group has integrated its controls directly into the (group) financial reporting processes. An essential element of this, in addition to process-independent external control\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\nmechanisms, is the principle of segregation of duties. To ensure complete, timely and correct preparation of the financial statements, quality assurance and control measures have been implemented in all areas involved in the accounting process. All control measures are applied in the ongoing business process to ensure that potential errors in financial reporting are prevented or are detected and corrected. Furthermore, the application of internal company guidelines results in consistent handling of business transactions as well as consistent accounting and reporting.\n\nControls are integrated in the key IT systems with a relevance for financial reporting which prevent, among other things, the incorrect recording of business transactions, ensure the complete recording of business transactions or the measurement of business transactions in accordance with the financial reporting requirements, or support the verification of consolidation. In view of the increasing demands on IT systems in financial reporting as well as the constantly growing technical possibilities, the PIERER Mobility Group regularly conducts IT-supported analyses of the effectiveness of the measures taken in order to identify and subsequently eliminate any control weaknesses that may have occurred.\n\nControl measures relating to IT security are a cornerstone of the internal control system. For example, the separation of sensitive activities is supported by restricting the allocation of IT authorizations. Automated checks take place through the ERP software used, such as the automated checks for invoice approval and invoice verification.\n\n### COMMUNICATION AND MONITORING\n\nResponsibility for the effectiveness of the internal control system in the (group) financial reporting process is clearly defined and lies with the responsible managers and process owners. In addition to the results of the internal assessment, the assessment of effectiveness also includes the results of external audits, e.g., as part of the audit of the annual financial statements or external IT security audits, as well as those of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee. Weaknesses in the control system are remedied taking into account their potential impact on the financial reporting processes.\n\nIn addition to the financial statements required by law, which are made available to management levels, the group has also implemented a comprehensive internal reporting system that is prepared and distributed at different levels of aggregation depending on the recipient of the report.\n\nOther central instruments of risk monitoring and control are the company-wide guidelines on dealing with significant risks, the planning and controlling processes, and ongoing reporting. The guidelines include the setting and control of limits and actions to limit financial risks, as well as the strict specification of the dual control principle for invoice and payment approvals.\n\nIn addition, the internal control system is based on precise information about the accounting and financial reporting processes and also includes their upstream business processes, e.g. purchase requisitions or logistics processes. The effectiveness of the internal control system is reviewed by management in that the results, which are submitted to management in condensed reporting form, are analyzed, evaluated and commented on by management.\n\nThe Executive Board and the Audit Committee are informed annually about the assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control system in financial reporting. In the event of significant changes in the effectiveness of the internal control system, a report is submitted immediately to the Executive Board and, if necessary, to the Supervisory Board, and suitable measures are taken to increase its effectiveness.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-27-0\"></span>9. OUTLOOK\n\n#### BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT\n\nFollowing the trend from 2022, the KTM, Husqvarna Motorcycles and GASGAS brands were able to largely expand their market shares in the relevant sales markets in 2023. In addition, the group expects the motorcycle market to continue to grow in the medium to long term and to display a positive trend overall for the high-quality premium products that it sells.\n\nThe challenges that arose in the 2022 financial year in the group's international supply chains eased considerably in 2023 and are not expected to cause any major disruption for the group in the 2024 financial year. The measures that the KTM AG Group has put in place are thus having an effect as the consequences of last year's situation have been largely mitigated with the supplier risk assessment. In addition to other measures and the reasons identified for problems in the supply chain in the past, the procurement strategy has been adapted and the procurement risk has been reduced, particularly by having direct access to the Asian market and continuing to focus on the European market.\n\nFor the 2024 financial year, the PIERER Mobility Group expects that the global economic environment will continue to be difficult, driven not least by ongoing significantly high rates of inflation and wage and salary trends, with far-reaching effects on pricing worldwide. For the group, 2024 will be a year of consolidation, which will be used to strengthen the core business. As part of this, the PIERER Mobility Group expects revenue for the 2024 financial year to be at a similar level as in the previous year and an EBIT margin of 5-7 %.\n\nTo safeguard the group's profitability, management will implement cost-cutting measures amounting to tens of millions in the 2024 financial year. These measures include, in particular, a greater focus on the core business of powered two-wheelers (motorcycles and electrified mobility products) with the premium brands KTM, GASGAS and Husqvarna as well as MV Agusta.\n\nAs another key measure for cutting costs, parts of production for individual mid-range models and certain research and development activities are being relocated to the strategic partner Bajaj Auto, India, and to CFMOTO, China. This applies to products (street motorcycles) in markets that are very price-sensitive and competitive. The range of models produced at Bajaj to date (between 125 and 390 cubic centimeters) will be expanded. Street motorcycles ranging from 790 to 950cc will be assembled at the company's Chinese partner CFMOTO. The group expects that this will not just deliver cost benefits, but also speed up processes of development and industrialization.\n\nThese measures will be accompanied, among other things, by a reduction in the number of employees, with up to 300 jobs going in Mattighofen and Munderfing. This will be achieved in particular by no longer using temporary workers as well as by employees leaving the company due to natural turnover.\n\nAs a result of the strategic changes described above, the reported sub-divisions will be restructured from the 2024 financial year onwards. In the future, the focus will be on the \"Motorcycles\" and \"E-Mobility\" segments. In addition to electrified New Mobility products, the new \"E-Mobility\" segment will include all electrically powered two-wheelers such as electric motorcycles, e-minis and stand-up scooters.\n\n#### INVESTMENTS\n\nThe investments made in recent years have safeguarded the production capacities required for the years ahead. The focus of the investments has been and still is, therefore, on other types of projects, in particular on the (further) development of existing and new models, electric mobility and high-tech modernization. These are currently and will continue to be the group's top priority for investments. In line with strategic goals, expenditure on investments in research and development will remain at the already high level of previous years.\n\nImportant investments planned are also the procurement of tools, in particular for planned research and development projects, investments in digital distribution platforms for dealers and end customers as well as the modernization, expansion, improvement and digitalization of existing production capacities.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n### ADEQUATE FINANCIAL POSITION\n\nThe current liquidity reserves combined with a balanced mix of different financial instruments will enable the group to continue to operate flexibly in a volatile market environment in 2024. In this regard, the available liquidity reserves were increased significantly for the short and long term. For example, in the 2023 financial year, the KTM Group issued a promissory note loan with a volume of EUR 300 million and a registered bond with a volume of EUR 50 million.\n\nThe group is also affected by the consequences of the current trend in interest rates and the interest rate risk is evaluated regularly. Measures were also taken to manage the interest rate risk. The PIERER Mobility Group expects to see interest rates fall from their currently high level in the medium term.\n\nWels, March 14, 2024\n\nThe Executive Board of PIERER Mobility AG\n\nthe\n\nStefan Pierer Hubert Trunkenpolz Viktor Sigl\n\nImage /page/28/Picture/13 description: The image shows a signature in black ink on a white background.

These are the following standards and interpretations:\n\n| NEW OR AMENDED STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS                                                   | IASB DATE OF<br>APPLICATION | PUBLISHED<br>BY THE IASB | EU ENDORSEMENT? |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|\n| Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 – Supplier Finance Arrangements                                 | January 1, 2024             | May 25, 2023             | No              |\n| Amendments to IAS 21 – Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates<br>Lack of Exchangeability | January 1, 2025             | August 15, 2023          | No              |\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group assumes that there will be no material impact on the consolidated financial statements from the standards to be applied in the future.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-43-0\"></span>5. ESTIMATES AND DISCRETIONARY DECISIONS\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements, certain estimates and assumptions must be made that affect the recognized assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the reporting date, and the presentation of income and expenses for the financial year. In making estimates, the Executive Board takes account of empirical values and current forecasts. The amounts actually arising may differ from the estimates if assumed parameters develop contrary to expectations. If new conditions become known, they are duly taken into account and previous assumptions are revised.\n\n- In particular, assumptions are made to assess the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets of indeterminate useful life. Goodwill of EUR 131,735k (previous year: EUR 130,655k) was recognized at the reporting date, along with the \"KTM\" brand, which is valued at EUR 61,103k (previous year: EUR 61,103k), the \"GASGAS\" brand, which is valued at EUR 13,346k (previous year: EUR 13,346k), the \"MV Agusta\" brand, which is valued at EUR 20,165k (previous year: EUR 20,165k), and the \"JOHANSSON\" brand, which is valued at EUR 1,300k (previous year: EUR 0k). The \"FELT\" brand was classified as an asset held for sale and valued at EUR 3,700k. For further information, see the explanations in Note 21 \"Goodwill\", Note 22 \"Intangible assets\" and Note 30 \"Non-current assets held for sale\".\n- Deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards not subject to expiration are recognized based on the assumption that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to allow them to be utilized. Suitable allowances are made in the event of uncertainties in the assumptions. As of December 31, 2023, deferred tax assets on loss carryforwards of EUR 19,968k (previous year: EUR 1,747k) were capitalized. Based on current tax planning, the management expects that the loss carryforwards recognized as of December 31, 2023 will be utilized over the next five years. For further details on deferred taxes, see the explanations in Note 25 \"Deferred tax assets\".\n- In cash flow hedge accounting, assessments are made regarding the occurrence of future cash flows. The planning of future cash flows is derived from sales planning and order volume planning. It is reviewed against actual figures on a monthly basis and checked for plausibility using past experience. In line with the internal guideline on currency hedges, foreign currency hedges are generally entered into on a rolling basis and cover a period of up to 18 months. The hedge ratio of the individual currencies is determined based on uncertainty in the planning for the relevant market, on the volatility of the currency and on the hedging costs. Currencies are aggregated by type based on their significance (volume, relevance to results) and different methods are applied accordingly. A hedge ratio of 80 % of the foreign-currency exposure is targeted for each currency. Details on sensitivities in relation to\n\ncurrency and interest rate risks are provided in Note VII \"Financial risks\".\n\n- Furthermore, there is some uncertainty as to the estimation for the recognition and measurement of liabilities for employee benefits. Assumptions are made concerning the following factors: empirical values, demographic assumptions such as the retirement age of women/men and staff turnover, as well as financial assumptions such as the discount rate and future wage and salary trends. Liabilities for employee benefits of EUR 27,967k (previous year: EUR 26,154k) were recognized at the reporting date. For further information, see the explanations in Note 34 \"Liabilities for employee benefits\".\n- Estimates for provisions mainly relate to provisions relating to guarantees and warranties. To determine the amount of the provisions, a direct correlation was established for each product group between revenues and the guarantee and warranty expenses incurred. The percentage value of guarantee and warranty expenses in terms of revenue is checked several times a year and adjusted if necessary. As of December 31, 2023, provisions relating to guarantees and warranties of EUR 20,523k (previous year: EUR 20,947k) were recognized. For the changes in the provisions relating to guarantees and warranties, see Note 36 \"Provisions\".\n- The determination of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination and the useful lives of these assets is based on assessments by the management.\n- Leases\n- Assessments of the term and interest rates are made. Further details are provided under Note 23 \"Property, plant, and equipment\" and Note 48 \"Leases as lessee\".\n- Inventories are subject to estimates and discretionary decisions in connection with valuation (subsequent consumption methods and analyses of coverage). In addition, allowance requirements are recorded on a case-by-case basis due to long storage periods and limited sales possibilities.\n\nThe following judgments were made in respect of the application of accounting policies in the PIERER Mobility Group:\n\n• Development costs\n\nDevelopment costs are capitalized in accordance with the accounting policy presented. The initial capitalization of costs is based on management assumptions to assess the future economic benefit of the expenses incurred and the technical feasibility of the developed product or process, as well as its\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### marketability.\n\n- Derecognition of receivables in connection with ABS and factoring agreements. Evaluations were made with respect to the conditions for derecognition under IFRS 9. For further details, please refer to Section VIII. \"Financial instruments and capital management\".\n- Supplier finance\n\nAssessments were made regarding the disclosure of liabilities in relation to the supplier finance program. Further details are provided under Note 35 \"Other current and non-current liabilities and trade payables\".\n\n• Consolidation\n\nIn determining whether control exists in accordance with IFRS 10, management exercises judgments in determining the relevant activities of the subsidiaries..\n\n#### Impact of climate-related issues on financial reporting\n\nThe Executive Board takes account of the impact of climate change in preparing the consolidated financial statements. The assumptions to be made by management in the course of preparing the consolidated financial statements are always made in accordance with the long-term corporate planning that has been approved by the Executive Board. The long-term corporate planning also takes account of the climate-related risks and opportunities identified by the company based on the recommendations of the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nClimate-related aspects are significant in the context of preparing the consolidated financial statements – in particular with regard to assumptions, discretionary decisions and estimates regarding future developments that will affect the PIERER Mobility Group – and are taken into account accordingly by the management. This does not produce any fundamental changes to the assumptions or estimates for the consolidated financial statements of the PIERER Mobility Group as at December 31, 2023. The Executive Board estimates the potential impact of climate-related opportunities and risks on the consolidated financial statements under IFRS as follows:\n\n• Useful lives of non-financial assets:\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group has evaluated the extent to which the useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets could be affected by climate-related issues. In particular, an assessment was made to determine whether, on the basis of existing and forthcoming legal and regulatory requirements,\n\nindustrial plants can no longer be used to the extent that was originally envisaged. It was not possible to conclude that useful lives would be affected by external or internal obligations.\n\n• Impairment losses on assets:\n\nThe short-term and medium-term financial plans and thus the impairment tests are based on the business model with a focus on sustainability. The short-term and medium-term financial plans of the individual CGUs take appropriate account of assumptions made regarding climate-related factors in capital expenditure programs (CAPEX), technologies and production processes for achieving the group's internal climate targets, and in the ecologically sustainable product mix based on them, in line with the \"Right Vehicle, Right Place, Right Energy Carrier\" concept.\n\n• Provisions and contingent liabilities: In the 2023 financial year, the PIERER Mobility Group did not incur any new obligations arising from the violation of climate protection laws and/or climate regulations that would have required the recognition of a provision or the disclosure of a contingent liability.\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group is constantly adapting its sustainability goals to reflect evolving requirements and technological changes or to take account of future business plans or strategies. As the potential impact of regulatory requirements, technological changes or future plans and strategies that have not yet been announced and their operationalization, including the reallocation of resources, cannot be estimated, the consolidated financial statements may be affected by these developments in future periods.\n\n#### Impact of the Russian-Ukrainian war:\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group's assessments of the impact of the war that is happening in Ukraine re-main unchanged from the previous year. The PIERER Mobility Group has not identified any significant reason to materially change its estimates and expectations as of December 31, 2023 on the basis of the war that is happening in Ukraine. The group does not have any investments, other assets or other material business relationships in Ukraine, Russia or Belarus, nor does the group have any material business relationships with suppliers or dealers in these countries. With this in mind, the company does not expect any material impact on the expected future cash flows. Equally, PIERER Mobility AG has not suffered, and does not expect to suffer, any loss of control, joint control or the ability to exercise significant influence over any entity as a result of the war or the sanctions that have been imposed.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-45-0\"></span>II. SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION\n\n#### 6. CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES AND METHODS\n\nAll subsidiaries are fully consolidated in the consolidated financial statements of PIERER Mobility AG. Subsidiaries are companies controlled by the group. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the moment control begins and until the moment control ends. Unless otherwise stated, the amount for non-controlling interests is recorded with the pro rata net assets of the acquired company without goodwill.\n\nInvestments in associates are included in the statement of financial position item \"Investments accounted for using the equity method\". The reporting currency of the PIERER Mobility Group is the euro. The subsidiaries and the holdings accounted for using the equity method prepare their annual financial statements in their functional currency. In this context, assets and liabilities included in the financial statements to be consolidated are translated using the average exchange rate on the reporting date and the income statement items are translated using the mean rate of exchange for the financial year. The following significant exchange rates for the PIERER Mobility Group were used for currency translation into the reporting currency:\n\n|                    | CLOSING RATE |            | AVERAGE RATE |          |\n|--------------------|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|\n|                    | 12/31/2023   | 12/31/2022 | 2023         | 2022     |\n| US-dollar          | 1.1050       | 1.0666     | 1.0829       | 1.0500   |\n| Swiss franc        | 0.9260       | 0.9847     | 0.9717       | 1.0017   |\n| Japanese yen       | 156.3300     | 140.6600   | 153.1758     | 138.1392 |\n| South African rand | 20.3477      | 18.0986    | 20.0410      | 17.2127  |\n| Mexican peso       | 18.7231      | 20.8560    | 19.0658      | 21.0536  |\n| Australian dollar  | 1.6263       | 1.5693     | 1.6347       | 1.5154   |\n| Chinese renminbi   | 7.8509       | 7.3582     | 7.6839       | 7.1543   |\n\n#### 7.

SEGMENT REPORTING\n\nThe business activities of PIERER Mobility AG are managed on the basis of the two \"Motorcycles\" and \"Bicycles\" divisions. The individual segments are managed separately and report to PIERER Mobility AG in accordance with IFRS accounting regulations. The main decision-maker for the segment report is the overall Executive Board of PIERER Mobility AG. The segment reporting is made with the segments Motorcycles, Bicycles and Others, according to the internal reporting.\n\n#### MOTORCYCLES:\n\nThe \"Motorcycles\" segment comprises the development, production and distribution of motorcycles under the \"KTM\", \"Husqvarna Motorcycles\" and \"GASGAS\" brands as well as components of the \"WP\" brand. As of December 31, 2023, the Motorcycles segment included 58 subsidiaries, located in Aus-tria, the United States, Japan, South Africa, Mexico, India, Australia and New Zealand and in various other European and Asian countries, which are included within the consolidated financial statements. In addition, interests are also held in assembly companies in the Philippines and China.\n\n#### BICYCLES:\n\nPIERER New Mobility GmbH together with its subsidiaries forms the \"Bicycles\" segment of the PIERER Mobility Group. With the \"Husqvarna E-Bicycles\", \"GASGAS Bicycles\", \"Liteville\" and \"Johansson\" brands, the focus is on developing, manufacturing and trading e-bicycles and bicycles.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT\n\nThe consolidated income statement is prepared according to the cost of sales method.\n\n#### 8. REVENUES\n\nRevenues, minus cash discounts, customer bonuses, and rebates, are generally recorded upon the passing of the risk as per the terms of the transaction (Incoterms) or at the time when performance was rendered.\n\nThe breakdown by geographical area of external revenues is based on the location of the customers. The revenues by geographical regions of the group are made up as follows:\n\n| EURK                     | 2023      | 202       |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Austria                  | 107,545   | 119,446   |\n| Europe (without Austria) | 1,340,260 | 1,013,850 |\n| North America and Mexico | 776,022   | 825,755   |\n| Other                    | 437,383   | 478,149   |\n|                          | 2,661,210 | 2,437,200 |\n\nVariable forms of consideration such as discounts, sales bonuses, and cash discounts are reported as revenue reductions. Variable consideration obligations are reported as contractual obligations within the meaning of IFRS 15. The contractual obligations for variable considerations in respect of price discounts, sales bonuses and cash discounts amounted to € 61.0 million as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: € 63.5 million).\n\nAs warranties are not sold separately, they only provide assurance that the products being sold meet the agreed specifications. As these warranties do not depart from the statutory warranty obligations or those that are typical of the industry in terms of their duration or their content, they are deemed to be assurance-type implied warranties, which do not constitute a separate performance obligation. Accordingly, the warranties continue to be recognized in accordance with IAS 37.\n\n#### 9.

INCOME TAXES\n\nThe group's income tax expense and income are attributable to current taxes and deferred taxes as follows:\n\n| EURK         | 2023    | 2022    |\n|--------------|---------|---------|\n| Current tax  | -12,982 | -34,626 |\n| Deferred tax | -2,738  | -10,654 |\n|              | -15,720 | -45,280 |\n\nIncome taxes comprise taxes on income and earnings payable in each country as well as deferred taxes. The Austrian companies of the PIERER Mobility Group are subject to a corporate income tax rate of 24 %. In Austria, a tax reform law was passed in 2022 and provides for a gradual reduction in the corporate income tax rate. The corporate income tax rate will be reduced to 24 % for 2023 and to 23 % from 2024 onwards. Following this tax rate change, deferred taxes were calculated using the respective future tax rate that will\n\napply at the time of the anticipated reversal of the difference in value. The calculation of foreign income taxes is based on the laws and regulations that are in force or have been adopted in the individual countries. The income tax rates applicable to foreign entities vary from 9.0 % to 37.6 %. A reconciliation between the expected tax expense for the financial year (application of the group tax rate of 24 % to earnings before taxes) and the actual tax expense recognized can be presented as follows:\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-53-0\"></span>\n\n| EURK                                                         | 2023    | 2022    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Profit before income taxes                                   | 92,133  | 215,903 |\n| Expected tax expenses / income                               | -22,112 | -53,976 |\n| Non-temporary differences and other tax additions            | -1,381  | -3,010  |\n| Recognition / allowances / utilization of loss carryforwards | -2,764  | -1,995  |\n| Non-taxable results in consequence of consolidation changes  | 0       | 534     |\n| Taxes in relation to prior periods                           | 750     | -2,608  |\n| Effects of foreign tax rates                                 | -839    | -286    |\n| Earnings from equity holdings                                | 809     | 1,062   |\n| Investment benefits                                          | 8,546   | 5,362   |\n| Tax rate changes                                             | 1,271   | 9,696   |\n| Miscellaneous                                                | 0       | -59     |\n|                                                              | -15,720 | -45,280 |\n\n#### Global minimum taxation\n\nThe group operates in several countries that have enacted new laws to introduce the global minimum tax rate, particularly in Austria, where the group's parent company has its headquarters. The group assumes that it will be subject to the minimum tax rate on its activities in Switzerland and Bulgaria, where the statutory tax rate is below 15 %, and in Singapore, where the tax regime provides for a tax exemption that reduces the effective tax rate of our subsidiary to below 15 %. Since the new tax law in Austria only came into force on January 1, 2024, there are no effects on the actual tax expense for the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe group applied the temporary, mandatory exemption to the accounting for deferred tax resulting from the introduction of the global minimum tax regime and recognized it as an actual tax expense/income at the time it occurred.\n\nIf minimum taxation had already applied in the 2023 financial year, the profits from the group's activities in Switzerland, Bulgaria and Singapore would be subject to the minimum tax, with the tax due representing an insignificant amount for the group.\n\n### 18.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n\n#### 21. GOODWILL\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment once a year. If the requirements of IAS 36.99 are met, the last detailed calculation of the recoverable amount is used for the assessment of recoverability. If there are indications of impairment in accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is always tested for impairment. The group determines the recoverable amount fundamentally on the basis of the value in use, which represents the present value of the expected future cash flows before tax.\n\nThe calculation was made using the following method: The forecast of cash flows is based on financial budgets approved by management and/or forecasting, taking into account the medium-term strategy targets. Estimated cash flows beyond this period are calculated by extrapolation of budget/forecast values, whereby constant further development based on a\n\ngrowth rate of 1 % is assumed from the third year onwards. The discount rate used was a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) before taxes of 11.1 % (2022: 11.6 %) for \"KTM\" and 10.4 % (2022: 11.3 %) for \"PIERER New Mobility\". All other conditions being equal, for the \"KTM\" cash-generating unit any increase in input tax for WACC to 14.1 % (2022: 18.9 %) or decline in budgeted future EBITs by 20.6 % (2022: 36.6 %) would result in the carrying amount of the CGU corresponding to the recoverable amount. All other conditions being equal, for the \"PIERER New Mobility\" cash-generating unit any increase in input tax for WACC to 11.6 % (2022: 34.3 %) or decline in budgeted future EBITs by 13.9 % (2022: 68.4 %) would result in the carrying amount of the CGU corresponding to the recoverable amount.\n\nThe breakdown of goodwill and its development and division between the respective CGUs is as follows:\n\n|                                            | 2023    | 2022    |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| EURK                                       |         |         |\n| Acquisition and production costs:          |         |         |\n| Balance as of 01/01                        | 150,632 | 150,681 |\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation      | 1,567   | 0       |\n| Currency translation                       | -474    | -49     |\n| Balance as of 12/31                        | 151,725 | 150,632 |\n| Accumulated depreciation and amortization: |         |         |\n| Balance as of 01/01                        | 19,977  | 19,970  |\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation      | 0       | 0       |\n| Currency translation                       | 13      | 7       |\n| Balance as of 12/31                        | 19,990  | 19,977  |\n| Balance as of 12/31                        | 131,735 | 130,655 |\n| KTM                                        | 109,766 | 110,253 |\n| PIERER New Mobility                        | 19,457  | 19,457  |\n| Others                                     | 2,512   | 945     |\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-56-0\"></span>22. INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nIntangible assets are capitalized in the same way as property, plant and equipment, at acquisition or production cost and valued less amortization. Amortization is calculated in accordance with the\n\nIntangible assets generated internally\n\nFor intangible assets generated internally, the production period is subdivided into research, development and model update phases. Costs incurred during the research and model update phases are immediately recognized in profit and loss. Capitalized development costs that can be clearly attributed to projects are amortized from the commencement of series production. In the 2023 financial year, development costs of EUR 156,877k (previous year: EUR 136,539k) were capitalized and a total of EUR 68,164k (previous year: EUR 61,024k) were amortized. As of December 31, 2023, development costs with a carrying amount of EUR 506,666k (previous year: EUR 420,572k) are included in intangible assets.\n\nIntangible assets of indeterminate useful life, such as the \"KTM\", \"GASGAS\", \"MV AGUSTA\" and \"JOHANSSON\" brands, which were mostly recognized in the course of the initial purchase price allocation at a value of EUR 61,103k, EUR 13,346k, EUR 20,165k, and EUR 1,300k, respectively, are not amor-tized but are instead subjected to an impairment test in accordance with IAS 36 and\n\nstraight line method and is based on the following expected useful lives:\n\nUSEFUL LIFE IN YEARS Software 3 - 5 Intangible assets generated internally 5\n\n> miscellaneous necessary impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. The Executive Board assumes an indeterminate useful life for the three brands because the rights are not subject to any restrictions in respect of time, in law or by contract in the relevant markets and because the enduring public awareness of the brands indicates that there has been no loss of economic value.\n\nFollowing the strategic decision to sell the \"FELT\" brand on December 5, 2023, it was valued in ac-cordance with the rules of IFRS 5 and the corresponding disposal of EUR 3,700k was posted in the statement of assets below. The \"KTM\", \"GASGAS\" and \"MV Agusta\" brands are allocated to the \"KTM\" cash-generating unit, and the \"JOHANSSON\" brand or, in the previous year, the \"FELT\" brand is allocated to the \"PIERER New Mobility\" cash-generating unit. As the brands do not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets, the impairment test is performed as part of the impairment tests of the respective \"KTM\" and \"PIERER New Mobility\" goodwill (see Note 21. \"Goodwill\").\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe tables below provide a breakdown of intangible assets along

project.\n\nIn the consolidated statement of cash flows, an adjustment of EUR 33,381k (previous year: EUR -17,011k) was made to additions to intangible assets to reflect transactions that had no cash flow effect. Government grants for capitalized development costs, which are mainly subsidies for development services, are recognized over the expected useful life of the development costs in accordance with IAS 20. The net presentation in accordance with IAS 20 is applied, i.e. grants for non-current assets are deducted from the carrying amount of the asset in the consolidated statement of financial position. This relates to carrying amounts of EUR 23,724k in the 2023 financial year (previous year: EUR 17,828k).\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-59-0\"></span>23.

(previous year: EUR 25,877k) as additions from leases, which had no cash flow effect as of the reporting date. For more details, please refer to Note 47, \"Leases as lessee\". In the consolidated statement of cash flows, an adjustment of EUR -4,389k (previous year: EUR -3,996k) was made to additions to other property, plant and equipment to reflect transactions that had no cash flow effect.\n\nAs of the reporting date, property, plant and equipment amounting to EUR 103,500k (previous year: EUR 42,000k) was secured by\n\nregistered and deposited pledge agreements, primarily for liabilities owed to credit institutions. The increase is due to the collateralization of investment loans and operating funds of PIERER & MAXCOM MOBILITY OOD, Plovdiv, Bulgaria.\n\nInvestment grants for property, plant and equipment are recognized over the expected useful life of the assets in accordance with IAS 20. The net presentation in accordance with IAS 20 is applied, i.e. grants for non-current assets are deducted from the carrying amount of the asset in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-61-0\"></span>24.

The changes to companies accounted for using the equity method are detailed in Note 7. \"Changes in the scope of consolidation\".\n\nKiska GmbH is a design business that provides development and design services. The reporting date of Kiska GmbH is March 31, which was determined prior to the acquisition of the investment. A change in the end of the reporting period is not sought on account of materiality considerations. For the purposes of accounting under the equity method, unaudited interim financial statements as of December 31 were used. PIERER Mobility AG holds 50 % of the company.\n\nKTM Asia Motorcycle Manufacturing Inc. was jointly founded in June 2016 in partnership with Ayala Corp. The company began the CKD (completely knocked down) assembly of KTM motorcycles in the Philippines in mid-2017. The KTM group's equity holding was increased from 34 % to 40 % in the 2021 financial year.\n\nThe KTM joint venture in China conducted in partnership with\n\nCFMOTO was established in the 2018 financial year under the name \"Zhejiang CFMOTO-KTMR2R Motorcycles Co., Ltd.\". The company began operation in the 2021 financial year. Mid-class motorcycles are produced in Hangzhou, China. In the 2023 financial year, the KTM Group stepped up its cooperation with CFMOTO and expanded production in a joint venture. The KTM group has an equity holding of 49 % of the company.\n\nIn the 2022 financial year, a cooperation agreement was entered into with the Italian motorcycle manufacturer MV Agusta. Under this agreement, KTM has taken over the global sales, marketing and customer support for the MV Agusta motorcycle range since the 2023 financial year. In addition, KTM AG supports MV Agusta in the supply chain through MV Agusta Services S.r.l. and carries out purchasing on its behalf. As part of this cooperation agreement, KTM AG acquired 25.1 % of the shares in MV Agusta Motor S.p.A., with registered office in Varese, Italy, as of November 15, 2022. Furthermore, the Executive Board of the KTM Group has taken the strategic decision to exercise the call option granted to the KTM Group under the cooperation agreement to acquire a further 25.0 % stake in MV Agusta S.p.A. in spring 2026.\n\nWith effect from April 1, 2023, KTM AG sold its 23 % stake in Vöcklabrucker Metallgiesserei Dambauer GmbH, based in Vöcklabruck, which it acquired in the previous year, to PB Invest GmbH, Wels, at the carrying amount of the shares.\n\nMovements in the carrying amounts of the financial assets accounted for using the equity method were as follows in the financial year:\n\n|  | EURK                                                                  | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|  | Book value of investments on 1/1                                      | 33,341 | 13,562 |\n|  | Acquisition of holdings                                               | 0      | 16,012 |\n|  | Sale of shares                                                        | -946   | 0      |\n|  | Proportionate net income (minus eliminations of intercompany profits) | 2,338  | 4,994  |\n|  | Other eliminations of intercompany profits                            | 1,131  | 0      |\n|  | Other results                                                         | -1,051 | -255   |\n|  | Dividend                                                              | -943   | -972   |\n|  | Book value of investments on 12/31                                    | 33,870 | 33,341 |\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-62-0\"></span>25. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS\n\nDeferred tax relating to tax loss carryforwards are recognized insofar as they can be realized within a reasonable period. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are reported on a net basis if they are subject to the same tax jurisdiction and are of a similar duration. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for differences between the\n\ntax base of fully consolidated investments or investments accounted for using the equity method and the corresponding Group equity, except to the extent that the Group is unable to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nTotal deferred tax assets and liabilities were calculated from the following statement of financial position items:\n\n| EURK                      | 12/31/2023 | 12/31/2022 |\n|---------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Deferred tax assets:      |            |            |\n| Current assets:           |            |            |\n| Inventories               | 11,709     | 9,800      |\n| Non-current assets:       |            |            |\n| Fixed assets              | 61         | 140        |\n| Employee benefits         | 2,888      | 2,544      |\n| Provisions                | 259        | 1,620      |\n| Liabilities               | 15,172     | 8,504      |\n|                           | 30,089     | 22,608     |\n| Offsetting                | -40,123    | -10,573    |\n| Loss carryforwards        | 19,968     | 1,747      |\n|                           | 9,934      | 13,782     |\n| Deferred tax liabilities: |            |            |\n| Currents assets           | -2,034     | -1,854     |\n| Non-current assets        | -158,754   | -133,130   |\n| Other                     | 0          | -17        |\n|                           | -160,788   | -135,001   |\n| Offsetting                | 40,123     | 10,573     |\n|                           | -120,665   | -124,428   |\n\nDeferred tax assets in relation to non-current assets include EUR 396k (previous year: EUR 751k) in relation to the remaining sevenths of write-downs of equity holdings to going concern value pursuant to Section 12 (3) (2) of the Austrian Corporate Tax Act (KStG).\n\nThe temporary differences in deferred tax liabilities in the \"Non-current assets\" item result mainly from development costs that cannot be capitalized for tax purposes and from quasi-permanent differences due to the recognition of the \"KTM\" brand as an asset.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 (and in the previous year), it was to be assumed either that, under current tax regulations, the differences between the value for tax purposes of the carrying amount of investments in consolidated subsidiaries and the proportion of\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\nequity recognized in the consolidated IFRS financial statements (outside-basis differences), which arise largely from retained profits/ uncovered losses, will remain untaxed in the foreseeable future, or that their reversal can be controlled by the group.

INVENTORIES\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value on the reporting date. Net realizable value is the estimated proceeds less estimated selling costs. Raw materials and supplies are measured using cost averaging based on an analysis of coverage, with write-downs in the event of limited usability. The economic value of existing inventories is also reviewed on a case-by-case basis and additional allowances are made as required for slow-moving items or items with limited possibilities of sale.\n\nCosts of acquisition include all costs that were incurred in order to bring the object to its required condition and to the relevant location. Costs of conversion comprise direct material and production costs based on normal capacity usage, plus appropriate portions of materials and production overheads. Administrative overheads and selling costs on the other hand do not form part of the costs of conversion.

LIABILITIES FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n\nLiabilities for employee benefits consist of obligations relating to severance pay and anniversary bonuses:\n\n| EURK                | 12/31/2023 | 12/31/2022 |\n|---------------------|------------|------------|\n| Severance payments  | 20,548     | 19,548     |\n| Anniversary bonuses | 7,419      | 6,606      |\n|                     | 27,967     | 26,154     |\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group is obligated by law to make a severance payment to all employees in Austria whose employment relationship commenced before January 1, 2003 upon termination by the employer or upon retirement. The amount of this defined benefit obligation (DBO) is dependent on the number of years of service and on the relevant salary at the time of termination. For all employees in Austria who joined after December 31, 2002, the company pays 1.53 % of their gross monthly salary each month into a staff severance pay fund that invests the contributions in an account maintained for the employee; at the end of the employment\n\nrelationship, the amount thus accumulated is paid out or the claim thereto is passed on. The company's obligation extends only to the payment of the contributions, which are recognized as expenses in the financial year for which they were paid (defined-contribution obligation). For employees of Austrian group companies whose employment commenced on or after January 1, 2003, contributions amounting to 1.53 % of their wages or salaries, as the case may be, were paid into a statutory staff sev-erance pay fund. Total contributions of EUR 3,595k were paid during the past financial year (previous year: EUR 2,959k).\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\nMovements in the net liability under the defined benefit plans in respect of severance pay were as follows during the financial year:\n\n| EURK                  | 12/31/2023 | 12/31/2022 |\n|-----------------------|------------|------------|\n| Conditional benefit:  |            |            |\n| Balance as of 01/01   | 19,548     | 21,202     |\n| Service cost          | 509        | 636        |\n| Interest expenses     | 793        | 240        |\n| Payments made         | -861       | -922       |\n| Actuarial gain / loss | 485        | -1,606     |\n| Miscellaneous         | 74         | -2         |\n| Balance as of 12/31   | 20,548     | 19,548     |\n\nThe weighted durations of the severance payment obligations as of December 31, 2023 were 10 years (previous year: 11 years).\n\nThe actuarial profit/loss is made up of the following factors:\n\n| EURK                              | 12/31/2023 | 12/31/2022 |\n|-----------------------------------|------------|------------|\n|                                   |            |            |\n| Change in expected values         | 248        | 2,408      |\n| Change in demographic assumptions | 2          | -68        |\n| Change in financial assumptions   | 309        | -3,946     |\n| Actuarial gain / loss             | 559        | -1,606     |\n\nThe measurement of the obligation is based on the following assumptions:\n\n|                                  | 12/31/2023 | 12/31/2023 |\n|----------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Discount rate                    | 3.51%      | 4.17%      |\n| Wage / salary trend              | 3.50%      | 4.00%      |\n| Retirement age (years) women/men | 65 years   | 65 years   |\n\nThe discount rate was determined taking into account the average duration and average remaining life expectancy. The discount rate is the market yield on high quality, fixed-interest corporate bonds at the end of the reporting period. Staff turnover is determined on\n\na company-specific basis and takes account of age and length of service. The actuarial measurements are based on countryspecific mortality tables. The chosen retirement age is the statutory retirement age in each country.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\nA change (+/- 0.5 percentage points) in the \"discount rate\" and \"wage/salary trend\" parameters would have had the following effects on the present value of future payments as of December 31, 2023:\n\n| PARAMETER           | CHANGE<br>-0,50% | CHANGE<br>+0,50% |\n|---------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Discount rate       | 4.9%             | -4.5%            |\n| Wage / salary trend | -4.6%            | 4.9%             |\n\nA change (+/- 0.5 percentage points) in the \"discount rate\" and \"wage/salary trend\" parameters would have had the following effects on the present value of future payments as of December 31, 2022:\n\n| PARAMETER           | CHANGE<br>-0,50% | CHANGE<br>+0,50% |\n|---------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Discount rate       | 5.3%             | -4.9%            |\n| Wage / salary trend | -4.9%            | 5.3%             |\n\nThe companies in the PIERER Mobility Group are obligated under collective-bargaining agreements to pay their employees in Austria anniversary bonuses upon attaining a certain number of years of service (from 25 years of service upward) (defined benefit obligation).

Suppliers can sell their receivables from the PIERER Mobility Group to the credit institution before the due date. The PIERER Mobility Group is not released\n\nfrom its original obligation and, due to a quantitative and qualitative audit, there is no significant change in the contractual terms and conditions. The liabilities continue to be shown under trade payables and are reported in cash flow from operating activities. As of December 31, 2023, trade payables amounting to EUR 349,065k (previous year: EUR 350,236k) are covered by this supplier finance program. This is 51.6 % (previous year: 47.5 %) of total trade payables as of the reporting date amounting to EUR 676,978k (previous year: EUR 737,602k).\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-74-0\"></span>In addition to suppliers outside the group, such a program was also concluded between Austrian companies in the PIERER Mobility Group. From the point of view of the PIERER Mobility Group, no exchange of services took place; it merely made use of external financing, which is reported under current financial liabilities. Cash flows are reported under cash flow from financing activities. As of\n\nDecember 31, 2023, the relationships between group companies of EUR 4,904k (previous year: EUR 3,394k) were presented as current financial liabilities in the consolidated financial statements of PIERER Mobility AG.\n\n#### 36. PROVISIONS\n\nThe group makes provisions relating to guarantees and warranties in relation to known, expected individual cases. The amounts of expected expenses are primarily based on previous experience and are recorded at the time the products are sold as an expense affecting profit and loss.\n\nThe estimation of future expenses is subject to uncertainties, which may lead to an adjustment of the provisions recognized in the future. It cannot be ruled out that the actual expenses for these measures may be higher or lower than the provision made for these purposes in an unforeseeable way.\n\nMovements in provisions in the financial year were as follows:\n\n| EURK                                  | BALANCE AS OF<br>1/1/2023 | ADDITIONS | DISOLUTIONS | UTILIZATION | BALANCE AS OF<br>12/31/2023 |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------|\n| Current provisions                    |                           |           |             |             |                             |\n| Provisions for guarantee and warranty | 20,947                    | 20,523    | 0           | -20,947     | 20,523                      |\n| Provisions for legal actions          | 757                       | 0         | 442         | 0           | 1,199                       |\n| Other provisions                      | 22,333                    | 241       | -1,956      | -20,470     | 149                         |\n|                                       | 44,037                    | 20,764    | -1,514      | -41,417     | 21,871                      |\n\nProvisions relating to guarantees and warranties largely relate to risks arising from statutory and voluntary product liability.

RISK REPORT\n\n#### 37. RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nAs a group of companies conducting business on a global scale, the PIERER Mobility Group faces a multitude of possible risks that are monitored by means of a comprehensive risk management system. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board are periodically informed about risks that may have a major impact on the group's business operations. Management takes timely action to avoid, minimize and hedge risks.\n\nAn internal control system adapted to the company's needs and incorporating basic principles such as segregation of duties and dual control has been integrated into the financial reporting process. Internal and external audits ensure that the processes are continually improved and optimized. Furthermore, a uniform reporting system is in place throughout the group, for the ongoing management and control of the risk management process. Group reporting is subject to a continuous improvement process so that the Executive Board is informed even sooner, and more comprehensively, about the degree to which targets have been achieved and about changes in the market and competition.\n\nContinuous growth depends on a variety of factors, such as demand behavior, product development, changes in foreign exchange rates, the general economic setting in the individual sales markets, prices of goods purchased from others, or talent management. Increased market research activities and a model policy reflecting the resulting findings are the means of responding to a market environment characterized by rapidly changing situations.\n\nIn order to prevent risks associated with fraud, corruption, and bribery, employees are obliged to behave in accordance with the principles defined in the Code of Conduct. The code is binding for all employees, managers, and board members as well as for\n\nconsultants, business partners, and customers of the PIERER Mobility Group. Since the 2021 financial year, the Code of Conduct has been an annex and thus an integral part of existing dealer agreements. Since the beginning of 2020, this has already been the case with new dealer agreements and also with new contractual relationships in the supply sector.\n\nIn order to counteract negative macroeconomic and geopolitical effects, PIERER Mobility promotes global diversification of the sales markets. The greatest relative growth in the coming years is expected in Asia. In order to promote this growth, intensive cooperation with our strategic partner Bajaj is being continuously expanded. In addition, investments have been made in production sites with local partners in China and the Philippines. The Russian-Ukrainian war in particular is having a negative impact on the global economy. In business terms, the PIERER Mobility Group is not directly affected by the military conflict that is taking place in Ukraine. Indirectly, the group, along with the whole industry, is confronted primarily by further increases in energy and raw material costs and negative effects on the capital markets.\n\nThe earnings position of PIERER Mobility AG (as an individual company) is characterized by expenses associated with financing, the acquisition of equity holdings and expenses for projects, and is significantly dependent on the dividend policy of its investees. The investment in the KTM Group is currently the largest and most significant investment of PIERER Mobility AG.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Section 243(c) of the Austrian Commercial Code, a corporate governance report has been drawn up. In this regard, we refer to the publication in the annual report of PIERER Mobility AG or to the website of PIERER Mobility AG.\n\n#### 38. MARKET RISKS\n\n#### CYCLICAL RISK\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group operates in the motorcycle and bicycle industry. Sales opportunities are determined by the general economic situation in the countries and regions in which the PIERER Mobility Group is represented with its products.\n\nAs recent years have shown, the motorcycle sector in particular is cyclical and subject to large fluctuations regarding demand. The\n\nincrease in inflation is affecting the market and therefore demand, and this development will continue over the coming year and could have a negative impact on the market. This risk is counteracted by our experience in this area, together with market research and forecasting, which are taken into account in the planning. With changes in mobility behavior, high rates of inflation and the Russian-Ukrainian war, the global motorcycle market in particular has stabilized at a high level.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-77-0\"></span>COMPETITION AND PRICING PRESSURE\n\nCompetition on the motorcycle market in industrialized countries is particularly intense; the strongest competitors are four Japanese and three European manufacturers and, to a lesser extent, a U.S. manufacturer, some of which have greater financial resources, higher sales figures and market shares. The street motorcycle market is moreover characterized by high pricing pressure, and new competitors are trying to enter the market by relying on a low-price strategy. Thanks to its successful market strategy, the PIERER Mobility Group is Europe's leading manufacturer of powered two-wheelers. The full integration of GASGAS as the third brand and the further development of the network of dealers has also contributed to this. Thanks to the innovative strength which it has demonstrated, the group sees itself as a technology leader in the two-wheeler sector in Europe. The strategic partnership with Bajaj and the increased level of co-operation with CFMOTO strengthens the company's competitiveness in global markets. The development of low-volume PTWs, stand-up scooters, electric motorcycles and motorcycles suitable for e-fuels as well as e-bicycles for use in urban areas is intended to continue to meet specific demand requirements in the future.\n\n#### SALES RISK\n\nThe group's biggest individual sales markets are the European as well as the U.S. market for motorcycles and the DACH region for New Mobility/(E)-Bicycle products. A slump in these markets could have a negative impact on business activities. Entering new markets involves a major cost risk as, in some of these markets, the sales trends as well as the geopolitical conditions are difficult to assess. By collaborating with its strategic partner Bajaj Auto Ltd., Pune, India, the\n\n#### 39. INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC RISKS\n\n#### RESTRICTIONS RELATING TO MOTORCYCLING\n\nAs the group markets its products in a large number of countries, it is exposed to the risk of changes in national regulations, terms of licenses, taxes, trade restrictions, prices, income, and exchange restrictions as well as to the risk of political, social, and economic instability, inflation, and interest rate fluctuations. Among other things, motorcycles registered for road use must comply with relevant provisions concerning noise and exhaust gas emissions in order to be approved for sale in each country. For all new models that are homologated for road use, the group complies with the Euro V European emission standard that is relevant for motorcycles. The\n\ncompany is working steadily toward implementing a global product strategy in the motorcycle sector.\n\nThe global impacts of high rates of inflation could ultimately also be reflected in changes in the consumer behavior of customers, which has been reduced overall. The group constantly monitors such impacts on the consumer behavior of customers. For example, it was established that there is still a high demand for products from the group because it provides high-quality PTWs, but there is higher demand for low-emission and low-noise individual mobility solutions. Expanding the product range to include e-bicycles/stand-up scooters and e-motorcycles in the low-power range, an increased focus on research and development in the field of alternative drive technologies, and developing new product areas such as stand-up scooters, e-bicycles or low-emission/emission-free alternatives to conventional models with combustion engines will boost sales here. The change to new (lower-emission or zero-emission) technologies could turn the structure of the market on its head and increase the opportunity to gain market shares\n\nFor the PIERER Mobility Group, providing support to end customers through the network of dealers represents a key success factor. In order to be able to continuously guarantee a high standard in this area, mandatory dealer training sessions are held on an ongoing basis. In these sessions new technical standards are taught and dealers are trained in dealing with the customer. In addition, the group in particular provides a modern communication platform which the dealers can use to undertake the procurement process and document the sales process. New, digital solutions in products could provide valuable in-formation for climate change-related transport measures and thus constitute a service that offers a new source of revenue.\n\npossible offroad uses of motorcycles are influenced significantly by the national and legal conditions that exist in the countries where the vehicles are sold. To counteract this risk, the respective regulations specific to the given country are analyzed in detail prior to market launch and continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis in order to be able to react in good time to any changes.\n\n#### PROCUREMENT RISK\n\nThe current economic situation creates a procurement and sales risk for the global economy that also affects the PIERER Mobility Group. Essentially, this risk involves the significant increases in the prices of\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\nprocuring raw materials, supplies and components, which have been driven by the global shortage of goods and resources, as well as the production overheads, which have risen to a high level, particularly in respect of energy prices, transport and personnel costs, as a result of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. This primarily affects companies involved in the energy-intensive production of raw materials such as aluminum and steel, which could have an impact on the level of availability in the overall market as a result of macroeconomic trends or climate change-related effects (increased use of renewable energy, higher requirements for steel production, etc.).\n\nIn the current situation, the procurement risk consists largely of failing to receive ordered components or not receiving them on the agreed date. On the other hand, rising energy costs are increasingly becoming established as a significant financial risk for smaller suppliers to the group and could therefore cause further disruption in the supply chain. The group itself can cope with rising energy costs because the in-house production and assembly processes are not very energy-intensive.\n\nA reduction in the persistently high rate of inflation in the first half of 2024 is not expected. This will therefore continue to affect the prices of materials and raw materials, which produces a global economic procurement risk for the PIERER Mobility Group.\n\nThe group has largely stabilized and compensated for the supply chain bottlenecks that have arisen, causing procurement delays, by regularly coordinating with suppliers and approving all procurement and production at an early stage. This means the group will be able to meet the resource requirements of each of its production sites over the longer term. The intense cooperation right along the supply chain means there was only a small impact on the group.\n\nOn the procurement side, the PIERER Mobility Group is countering the risks described above by taking several measures, such as using alternative supply chains and engaging in appropriate activities to reduce the costs that are incurred, implementing efficiency measures at suppliers by providing cost engineering support and agreeing on temporary price increases based on indices. In addition, the group has already implemented further significant measures to secure its supply chain and thus its production at an early stage, as mentioned above, and introduced a market intelligence system for electronic components. The flexibility in the production layout implemented means that, in exceptional cases, the group is also able to adjust its production schedules as needed to cope with global developments that result in increasingly tight supply chains. In addition, more in-depth research into alternative raw materials and materials will help to meet the increasing demand for critical resources required\n\nfor the increased production of batteries needed for e-mobility and to avoid resource bottlenecks. Ultimately, the intention is to adjust the logistical procurement structure in order to minimize transportation distances and associated costs.\n\nThe supply of electricity is essential for maintaining production operations. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine means the electricity supply may also be impaired in the coming year. This may also have a negative impact on the energy price. In order to ensure a stable supply of electricity, the PIERER Mobility Group is increasingly relying on constructing photovoltaic systems, setting up an energy ring to increase the proportion of the electricity produced that the company uses itself, and implementing energy-saving measures.\n\n#### TECHNICAL INNOVATION AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\n\nTechnical innovations and the introduction of new products are largely responsible for the PIERER Mobility Group's competitive position. To this end, new trends must be identified promptly. To counteract the risk, our own products' innovative capacity must be ensured.\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group therefore attaches great importance to identifying trends at an early stage, conducting research and development in technical and functional areas, and researching what customers want in order to develop innovative products that reflect what the market wants. Racing achievements are not only an important marketing instrument for the company but also form the basis for product development and set standards for series development. Among other things, the company will also focus in future on developing emission-free, alternative drive systems and products so it can live up to its role as a technological pioneer.\n\n#### PRODUCT LIABILITY RISK\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group is also exposed in its business activity to claims for damages owing to accidents and injuries. This applies especially to the U.S., where claims asserted in product liability cases involve higher amounts of liability. In addition to existing potential causes of product-related lawsuits, climate change-related regulations could add further grounds for action. In addition to existing safeguards, this risk is minimized by comprehensive quality control in all production areas and high quality standard thanks to suitable supplier selection procedures as well as quality management systems and audits.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-79-0\"></span>40. IT RISKS\n\nWe apply the same high quality standards in the area of data security and data protection as we do for our products.\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group has implemented an IT security and risk management system for the purpose of identifying and managing company-relevant risks in the area of information security. In addition, evidence of compliance and the exercising of due diligence when handling and using information and equipment for the processing of information is provided and documented in respect of customers, the Executive Board and the general managers of each participating company.\n\nThe constantly growing IT and cyber risks are countered by ongoing evolution of IT security measures and using the latest IT security technologies. Cyber attacks are averted with a multi-stage technical concept using the latest security features such as\n\n#### 41. FINANCIAL RISKS\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group is subject to credit, market, currency and liquidity risks regarding its assets, liabilities and planned transactions. Financial risk management is aimed at controlling and limiting those risks. The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board are informed on a regular basis about risks that can have a major impact on the group's business operations.\n\nThe principles of financial risk management are laid down and monitored by the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board. Group Treasury is responsible for their implementation. To protect itself against the financial risks described below, the PIERER Mobility Group uses derivative financial instruments in order to safely hedge cash flows from operating activities against fluctuations in exchange rates and/or interest rates. The hedging horizon generally covers currently open items and any transactions planned for the next 12 to 18 months. In exceptional cases, strategic hedge positions involving longer time periods may be entered into in consultation with the Supervisory Board.\n\n#### CURRENCY RISKS\n\nAs an enterprise doing business on a global scale, the PIERER Mobility Group is influenced by general global economic data such as changes in currency parities or developments in the financial markets. As the US dollar represents the highest individual foreign currency risk, movements in the US dollar exchange rate are of particular importance to the development of revenue and income. Due to the increasing importance of USD in purchasing, the foreign currency risk associated with the USD is significantly reduced (\"natural hedge\"). Approximately 26 % of revenues were earned in\n\nintrusion prevention systems and additional security systems which are operated upstream or internally. Behavior-based security solutions are also used with a view to identifying security-related abuse. Incidents are identified and handled by a malware incident response process. In parallel, regular internal and external vulnerability analyses are performed and any vulnerabilities identified are countered by means of an established patch and update management process. Regular internal and external security audits are documented in risk management, any findings are evaluated and prioritized, and a solution is then applied.\n\nCare is taken to ensure that all users of IT systems possess the requisite knowledge and awareness for the use of IT within the scope of their role via the provision of regular general IT security awareness training. This training is provided in a preventative and traceable manner.\n\nUS dollars in financial year 2023 (previous year: 34 %). Currency hedging measures, in particular hedging strategies, can largely offset these currency shifts over at least one model year.\n\nThe group is exposed to further currency risks where financial assets and liabilities are settled in a currency other than the local currency of the relevant company. The companies of the group predominantly do their invoicing in local currency and largely take out financing in local currency. Financial investments are primarily made in the local currency of the investing group company. For these reasons, most resulting currency positions will be closed out naturally.\n\nThe main causes of ineffectiveness in currency hedges are:\n\n- the impact of the credit risk of the counterparties and the group on the fair value of the forward currency transactions that is not reflected in the change in the fair value of the hedged cash flows attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates;\n- changes in the transaction date of the hedged items.\n\nSensitivity analyses have been performed on currency risks in relation to financial instruments in order to show the effects that hypothetical changes in the exchange rates have on profit or loss (after taxes) and equity. In the scope of the sensitivity analysis, effects of changes in the exchange rate of ± 10% are shown as profit or loss, other comprehensive income, and equity. The relevant balances as of the reporting date and foreign currency purchases and sales budgeted for the 2023 financial year were used as a basis. It was assumed that the risk faced on the reporting date essentially represents the risk present during the financial year. The group tax\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\nrate of 24% was used as the tax rate. Furthermore, it was assumed in the analysis that all other variables, in particular the interest rates, remained constant. Currency risks relating to financial instruments of a monetary nature that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency were included in the analysis.\n\nCurrency risks from euro positions in subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the euro were attributed to the currency risk of the subsidiary's functional currency. Risks from foreign currency positions apart from the euro were aggregated at a group level. Exchange rate related differences arising from the translation of financial statements into the group currency were not taken into account.\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group bases the analysis on the following assumptions:\n\n- For the sensitivity of profit and loss, the group's cash in banks, receivables and payables are considered, as are future receipts and payments in foreign currency that are not accounted for in the functional currency of the group company. Account is also taken of open derivatives on cash flow hedges where the hedged item has already been realized on the reporting date (recognized as income).\n- For the sensitivity of other comprehensive income, account is taken of open derivatives from cash flow hedges where the hedged item has not yet been realized on the reporting date (movements are not recognized in profit and loss). The exposure corresponds to the notional amount of the open derivatives.\n\n| INCREASE (+) / DECREASE (-)                           | 10% INCREASE |            | 10% DEVALUATION |            |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|------------|\n| EURK                                                  | 12/31/2023   | 12/31/2022 | 12/31/2023      | 12/31/2022 |\n| Change in net result                                  | -33,302      | -28,868    | 40,702          | 35,284     |\n| Change in currency-related cash flow hedge provisions | 6,866        | 3,636      | -8,392          | -4,444     |\n| Change in equity                                      | -26,436      | -25,232    | 32,310          | 30,840     |\n\n#### INTEREST RATE RISKS\n\nCertain financial instruments on both the assets side and the liabilities side carry interest at variable rates. The risk therefore comprises rising interest expenses or falling interest income resulting from an adverse change in market interest rates.\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group is thus exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations on the market. Regular monitoring of the money and capital markets and, in some cases, the use of interest rate swaps (fixed interest rate payer swaps) serve to respond to this risk. Under the interest rate swaps entered into, the company receives variable interest payments and, in return, pays fixed interest on the notional amounts of the contracts entered into.\n\nInterest rate risks thus result mainly from primary financial instruments carrying interest at variable rates (cash flow risk). Sensitivity analyses were performed on the interest rate risks of these financial instruments in order to show the effects that hypothetical changes in the market interest rate level have on profit or loss (after\n\ntax) and equity. The relevant balances as of the reporting date were used as a basis. It was assumed that the risk faced on the reporting date essentially represents the risk present during the financial year. The group tax rate of 24% was used as the tax rate. Furthermore, it was assumed in the analysis that all other variables, in particular the exchange rates, remained constant.\n\nThe main causes of ineffectiveness in interest rate hedges are:\n\n- the impact of the credit risk of the counterparties and the group on the fair value of the interest rate derivatives that is not reflected in the change in the fair value of the hedged cash flows attributable to changes in interest rates; and\n- differences in the parameters (e.g., interest rate adjustment dates) between the derivatives and the hedged items\n\nA sensitivity analysis was performed on interest rate risk. This showed the effects of changes in the interest rate of +/- 50 basis points on profit and loss, other comprehensive income, and equity.\n\nINCREASE (+) / DECREASE (-)\n\n| INCREASE (+) / DECREASE (-)                           | INCREASE BY 50 BP |            | DECREASE BY 50 BP |            |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|------------|\n| EURK                                                  | 12/31/2023        | 12/31/2022 | 12/31/2023        | 12/31/2022 |\n|                                                       |                   |            |                   |            |\n| Change in net result                                  | -2,362            | -316       | 2,361             | 318        |\n| Change in currency-related cash flow hedge provisions | 1,113             | 1,752      | -1,120            | -1,757     |\n| Change in equity                                      | -1,249            | 1,436      | 1,241             | -1,439     |\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Group Treasury completed the changes to the reference interest rates in the financial instruments used by the group which were required as a result of the IBOR Reform in the 2023 financial year. Working together closely with business partners, contracts were appropriately amended and contractual transitional arrangements governing the handling of temporarily or permanently unavailable reference interest rates were utilized. The use of the new reference interest rates has been agreed on, without exception, for contracts and financial instruments that were newly concluded in the financial year. The amendments had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### DEFAULT RISKS (CREDIT OR CREDITWORTHINESS RISKS)\n\nThe default risk is the risk of financial losses if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The default risk generally arises from trade receivables.\n\nOn the assets side, the carrying amounts reported also represent the maximum default risk. In addition, there are no general set-off agreements, with the exception of the set-off agreement described under note 44 in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n#### Trade receivables\n\nThe default risk on receivables from customers may be rated as low as ongoing checks of the creditworthiness of new and existing customers are performed and collateral is requested.\n\nRisk management carries out an analysis and assessment of new customers. Initially, these are analyzed individually with regard to their creditworthiness, and standardized group-wide contracts are concluded with customers. The analysis includes external credit ratings, where available, as well as annual financial statements and information from credit agencies and banks. Sales limits are set for each customer and reviewed on an ongoing basis. All sales exceeding these limits require the approval of risk management.\n\nDefault risks are largely hedged by means of credit insurance and bankable security (guarantees, letters of credit). The default risks and related controls are defined in internal guidelines. Most of the business relationships with dealers and importers have been in place for many years. By continuously monitoring the default risk and the creditworthiness of customers, each receivable is individually reviewed to ascertain the need for a value adjustment.\n\nA summary of the default risk on trade receivables as of December 31, 2023 is presented in the following table.\n\n| TRADE RECEIVABLES<br>EURK   | NOT IMPAIRED IN<br>CREDITWORTHINESS | CREDITWORTHINESS<br>IMPAIRED | TOTAL   |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------|\n| Not overdue                 | 297,836                             | 0                            | 297,836 |\n| Overdue 1-30 days           | 18,404                              | 0                            | 18,404  |\n| Overdue 31-60 days          | 11,213                              | 0                            | 11,213  |\n| Overdue 61-90 days          | 3,145                               | 0                            | 3,145   |\n| Overdue > 90 days           | 16,594                              | 10,916                       | 27,510  |\n| Total gross carrying amount | 347,192                             | 10,916                       | 358,108 |\n| Impairment loss             | -301                                | -7,006                       | -7,307  |\n| Total                       | 346,892                             | 3,910                        | 350,801 |\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\nA summary of the default risk on trade receivables as of December 31, 2022 is presented in the following table.\n\n| TRADE RECEIVABLES<br>EURK   | NOT IMPAIRED IN<br>CREDITWORTHINESS | CREDITWORTHINESS<br>IMPAIRED | TOTAL   |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------|\n| Not overdue                 | 242,774                             | 0                            | 242,774 |\n| Overdue 1-30 days           | 16,460                              | 0                            | 16,460  |\n| Overdue 31-60 days          | 4,123                               | 0                            | 4,123   |\n| Overdue 61-90 days          | 2,592                               | 0                            | 2,592   |\n| Overdue > 90 days           | 2,627                               | 6,895                        | 9,522   |\n| Total gross carrying amount | 268,576                             | 6,895                        | 275,471 |\n| Impairment loss             | -190                                | -4,859                       | -5,049  |\n| Total                       | 268,386                             | 2,036                        | 270,422 |\n\nIn order to determine the need for impairment of trade receivables for which no individual value adjustments have been made, the PIERER Mobility Group evaluated the defaults of recent years. The analysis showed that there is only an insignificant risk for receivables with a certain past due status. The estimate of loss rates is based on historical default rates in relation to past due receivables and considering forward-looking information.\n\nAs regards the current portfolio of trade and other receivables that are neither impaired nor past due, there are no indications as of the closing date that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations. There are no concentration risks.\n\n#### Estimation of expected credit losses\n\nBased on the actual defaults observed in the past, an average default rate of 0.07 % (previous year: 0.07 %) of trade receivables was determined. The risk premium for developments in the future has been adjusted to take account of the effects of increased inflation rates as well as the Russian-Ukrainian war. An addition of EUR 111k (previous year: EUR 87k) to the allowance for expected losses on trade receivables was recognized.\n\nThe impairment for expected losses as of December 31, 2023 in the PIERER Mobility Group is EUR 301k (previous year: EUR 190k).\n\n#### Changes in value adjustments\n\nChanges in value adjustments related to trade receivables are described in the notes under Note 28 \"Trade receivables\".\n\n#### Cash and cash equivalents, other assets and derivatives\n\nCredit losses on cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets are determined on the basis of average default rates and the rating of the instrument. A significant change in the credit risk is determined on the basis of ratings and delay in payment. Given the short-term nature of these items and the good rating of the banks, the group assumes that these portfolios are financial instruments with a low default risk and that the expected losses are negligible.\n\nThe default risk on derivative financial instruments with positive market value is limited to their replacement cost; as all the counterparties are banks of good creditworthiness, the default risk can be classified as low. There are no indications of any additional impairment loss requirements for financial assets.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### LIQUIDITY RISKS\n\nThe current liquidity reserves (see below) combined with a balanced mix of different financial instruments will enable the group to continue to operate flexibly in a volatile market environment in 2024. In this context, the available liquidity reserves were increased significantly in the 2023 financial year with both short-term and long-term financing measures. For example, in the 2023 financial year, the KTM Group issued a promissory note loan with a volume of EUR 300,000k and a registered bond with a volume of EUR 50,000k.\n\nIt is a material objective of financial risk management in the PIERER Mobility Group to ensure solvency and financial flexibility at all times. Liquidity risks may arise, among other things, if the proceeds from revenues are below the planning assumptions. For this purpose, the group maintains a liquidity reserve in the form of unused credit lines (cash credits and guarantee credits) and in the form of cash in banks of a high creditworthiness. As of December 31, 2023, the\n\nPierer Mobility Group has a liquidity portfolio of EUR 258,972k and unused credit lines of EUR 560,386k. Top priority is given to ensuring liquidity over the short and medium term. Another major control parameter is the maximization of free cash flow by cost-cutting measures, proactive working capital management and reduced investment expenditure. In the area of working capital management in particular, the group has a wide range of instruments at its disposal to manage liquidity in line with demand. These include utilizing ABS and factoring programs or adjusting stock levels by making use of the flexibility of production volumes.\n\nFrom today's perspective, sufficient commitments have been given by our strategic financing partners for securing current liquidity requirements. Non-current liquidity requirements are met by the issuance of promissory note loans and by taking out bank loans.

are paid on their due date. The associated cash outflows are taken into account in liquidity planning. The supplier finance program results in a concentration of risk. The number of suppliers is replaced by a concentration on a creditor bank. If this creditor bank were to\n\nterminate the supplier finance agreement, an additional liquidity risk would generally be incurred, which is not of great significance due to supplier payment goals that are almost identical. As cited in Note 35, this relates to 51.6 % (previous year: 47.5 %) of trade payables as of the reporting date. The concentration risk is regarded as low.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-85-0\"></span>42. OTHER RISKS\n\n#### PROCESS RISKS\n\nThere is a risk that standardized processes will not be adhered to, particularly in production. To minimize this risk, these processes are documented in work instructions and handbooks. Employees are trained in the use of this documentation and the documents are freely accessible via various systems.\n\n#### RISKS DUE TO THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\nAs the PIERER Mobility Group markets its motorcycles and e-bikes and non-e-bikes in a large number of countries, it is exposed to the risk of changes in national regulations, terms of licenses, taxes, trade re-strictions, prices, income, and exchange restrictions as well as to the risk of political, social, and economic instability, inflation, and interest rate fluctuations.\n\nMotorcycles registered for road use must comply with relevant provisions concerning noise and exhaust gas emissions in order to be approved for sale in each country. For all new models that are homologated for road use, the group complies with the Euro V European emission standard that is relevant for motorcycles. The possible offroad uses of motorcycles are influenced significantly by the national and legal conditions that exist in the countries where the vehicles are sold. To counteract this risk, the respective regulations specific to the given country are analyzed in detail prior to market launch and continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis in order to be able to react in good time to any changes.\n\nThe strong focus on research and development ensures that all products of the PIERER Mobility Group will continue to meet regulatory requirements in the future. Fully electric motorcycles already complement the product range today. At the same time, research and development is also focusing on other alternative drive technologies.\n\n#### BUSINESS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK\n\nEnvironmental risks may relate to products, production, procurement and non-operating factors. More detailed examinations of environmental risks can also be found in the sustainability report published annually by PIERER Mobility AG and/or the reporting in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) on climate-related opportunities and risks.\n\nWith regard to the products, risks arise from possible emissions, such as the emission of greenhouse gases. Measures being promoted to minimize these risks include in particular technological developments to boost fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. In addition, research projects aimed at reducing noise and pollutant emissions are supported. Another risk is the trend in the level of acceptance for vehicles with internal combustion engines, which could be reduced due to restrictions and social trends and lead to increased demand for alternatives. This is one of the reasons why the company is increasingly focusing on the development of emission-free alternative drive systems and products.\n\nIn production, there are environmental risks from the generation of waste and material residues as well as the disposal of waste. Numerous measures are undertaken to minimize these risks. These include waste management concepts and low-waste packaging solutions that conserve resources. In the 2023 financial year, for example, a machine for shredding cardboard waste and reusing it as filler material for shipping products started operating.\n\nEnvironmental risks in procurement may result from the environment-related shortage and rising prices of resources, cooperation with suppliers that do not operate with sufficient environmental measures, and emissions from delivery routes. In order to minimize these risks, measures are taken that include auditing suppliers,\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\noptimizing procurement channels, and prioritizing regional procurement.\n\nIn addition, environmental risks arise from weather-related and climate-related phenomena, such as floods and changes in temperature.\n\nAlthough it is not possible to completely rule out the risk of natural disasters, the PIERER Mobility Group makes efforts to minimize the risk of production processes being impaired by having suitable corrective measures in place. Due to the geographical location of the main plants in Mattighofen and Munderfing, the risk of climaterelated, physical natural disasters occurring is considered to be low.\n\n#### PERSONNEL-RELATED RISKS\n\nEspecially with regard to the growth course, risks may arise if key staff leave the company. Efficient personnel management as well as the constant pursuit of personnel development programs are designed to counteract the risk of managerial staff leaving the company. The risk of a shortage of skilled staff is minimized by a comprehensive apprentice training program in our own apprentice workshop. The aim is to recruit employees from the region and to retain them in the long term.\n\nInternal and external measures to increase employer attractiveness are an essential element in conveying the predominant spirit of the PIERER Mobility Group to potential new employees. With various cross-media employee campaigns, the company was able to largely meet its personnel requirements in the reporting year. In the area of apprenticeships, attention was not only paid to addressing the target group appropriately, but a dedicated section was also created for the parents of future apprentices. The purpose of this is to provide information about opportunities and options at an early stage, and to prevent any uncertainties.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-87-0\"></span>VIII. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n#### 43. BASIC PRINCIPLES\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group holds primary and derivative financial instruments. Primary financial instruments mainly include trade receivables, credit balances with credit institutions, liabilities owed to credit institutions, trade payables, and financial liabilities. The portfolio of primary financial instruments is shown in the consolidated statement of financial position and described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Derivative financial instruments are generally used to hedge existing interest rate fluctuation and foreign currency risks. The use of derivative financial instruments is subject to appropriate authorization and control procedures in the group. The link to a hedged item is mandatory; trading transactions are not permitted. Purchases and sales of all financial instruments are recognized as of the settlement date. Purchases and sales of all financial instruments are recognized as of the settlement date.\n\n#### ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nCategorization will take place in accordance with the contractual cash flows and the business models on which they are based. In this regard, the following measurement categories are provided by IFRS 9:\n\n- AC category: At amortized cost using the effective interest method\n- FVOCI category: At fair value, changes to the fair value are recorded under other comprehensive income\n- FVPL category: At fair value, changes to the fair value are recorded in the income statement\n\nIn the case of equity instruments (such as shares in companies not listed on the stock exchange), the FVOCI option can be exercised. This will lead to changes in the fair value being recorded under other comprehensive income, meaning that it will no longer be possible to regroup the changes to fair value accumulated under other comprehensive income in the income statement. Insofar as this option is not exercised, these will be assigned to the FVPL category, under which all changes to the fair value will be recorded in the income statement.\n\nReceivables and other assets upon initial recognition are measured at fair value and in subsequent periods are measured at amortized cost of acquisition. Foreign currency receivables are translated at the closing exchange rate on the reporting date. Financial receivables are classified as \"at amortized cost\" and are measured at amortized cost.\n\nThat portion of trade receivables that is part of the ABS or factoring program is allocated to the category \"Fair Value through Profit and Loss\" (FVPL).\n\nFinancial liabilities are measured at amortized cost of acquisition. Financial liabilities are assigned to the \"at amortized cost\" category. Any difference between the amount received and the amount repayable is apportioned over the term to maturity using the effective interest method and recognized in financial income and expenses. The fundraising costs incurred in connection with borrowings were amortized to profit or loss using the effective interest method. Liabilities are measured at amortized cost. Liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate.\n\nAll financial instruments in the FVPL category are measured at fair value through profit or loss on the basis of the criteria in IFRS 9 (business model or SPPI test). The fair value option was not exercised.\n\n#### Impairment losses\n\nTrade receivables do not exhibit any material financing components. For that reason, the simplified method for determining the expected credit loss is used; this involves accounting for all instruments with a risk provision, which is independent of their credit quality, in the amount of the expected losses over the term to maturity. This amounts to less than twelve months for trade receivables and therefore corresponds to the 12-month loss. For details of the amounts involved, please refer to Note 41 \"Financial risks\".\n\nIn order to determine the expected credit loss, historic default data for receivables were collected over the last eight to ten years and split according to geographic regions. Current economic factors and forecasts are also taken into account.\n\nIndividual valuation adjustments are made to financial assets if they are deemed to be uncollectible or partially uncollectible. Signs that an individual allowance is required are financial difficulties, insolvency, breach of contract or considerable delay in payment on the part of the customer. Individual value adjustments consist of numerous individual items, none of which is material when considered in isolation. Financial assets are only derecognized directly if the contractual rights to receive payment cease to exist (in particular in the case of insolvency). If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance account.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-88-0\"></span>Hedge accounting\n\nThe regulations on hedge accounting are applied in accordance with IFRS 9. According to IFRS 9, the fair value of an option, the forward element of a forward contract and any foreign currency basis spreads can be excluded from the designation of a financial instrument as\n\n#### 44. CLASSIFICATION AND FAIR VALUE\n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is determined by means of quoted market prices for identical instruments in active markets (Level 1). If no quoted market prices in active markets are available for the instrument, the fair value is determined by means of valuation techniques for which the material inputs are based exclusively on observable market data (Level 2). In all other cases, the fair value is determined on the basis of valuation techniques for which at least one material input is not based on observable market data (Level 3).\n\na hedging instrument and accounted for as the cost of hedging. In this regard, fluctuations in the value of these components that have optionally not been designated are recorded as hedging costs under other comprehensive income and reclassified in the income statement in the event that the hedged item is recognized in profit or loss.\n\nReclassifications from one level to another are taken into account at the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers between levels in the financial year.\n\nThe table below shows the valuation techniques used to determine fair value as well as the significant unobservable inputs used.\n\n| Financial instruments measured at fair value             |                                                                                                                                                                           |                                     |                                                                                        |  |  |  |  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|--|--|\n| Type                                                     | Measurement technique                                                                                                                                                     | Significant,<br>unobservable inputs | Connection between<br>significant unobservable inputs<br>and measurement at fair value |  |  |  |  |\n| Forward currency transactions<br>and interest rate swaps | Fair values are based on the<br>market values determined using<br>recognized valuation models<br>(discounted cash flows).

SET-OFF OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nThe group enters into set-off agreements with banks in connection with derivatives. Generally, the amounts owed under such agreements by each counterparty on a given day for all outstanding transactions in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount payable by one party to the other. In certain cases – e.g. when a credit event such as a default occurs – all outstanding\n\ntransactions under the agreement are terminated, their value as of termination is determined, and only a single net amount is payable for settling all transactions. These items are not set off in the balance sheet, as such, as the net set-off of multiple transactions under the same framework agreements does not generally occur.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe tables below show financial assets and liabilities that have actually been offset along with amounts that are subject to a set-off agreement but which have not been offset as they do not fulfill the criteria for set-off prescribed under IFRS.\n\n| EURK                                                                                                                      | FINANCIAL<br>ASSETS (GROSS) | OFFSET BALANCE<br>ITEMS (GROSS) | ACCOUNTED<br>FINANCIAL<br>ASSETS (NET) | EFFECT OF<br>GENERAL<br>OFFSETTING<br>AGREEMENTS | NET AMOUNTS |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Financial assets 2023                                                                                                     |                             |                                 |                                        |                                                  |             |\n| Other financial assets -

HEDGES\n\nThe group enters into derivative financial instruments (forward currency transactions and interest rate swaps) to hedge foreign currency and interest rate risk. The aim of using derivative financial instruments is to offset fluctuations in cash flows from future transactions. Expected revenues in foreign currencies serve as the basis for planning future cash flows.\n\nThe group only recognizes changes in the spot rate component of forward currency transactions as a hedging instrument in cash flow hedges. The change in the forward component is accounted for separately as a cost of hedging and transferred to a reserve for hedging costs in equity or reclassified in the income statement if the hedged item affects profit or loss (as part of the financial result).\n\nDerivatives are generally measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9. The group applies the rules for cash flow hedge accounting defined by IFRS 9 to these derivative financial instruments.\n\nHowever, the main contractual criteria of the hedged item and the hedging instrument are identical but oppositely structured (\"critical terms match\"), ensuring an economic context for the hedging relationship. As of December 31, 2023 (as well as during the previous year), there were no derivative financial instruments for which no hedging relationships were able to be established.\n\nA cash flow hedge is present if variable cash flows from recognized assets and/or liabilities or forecast business transactions that are subject to a market price risk are being hedged. If the requirements for a cash flow hedge are met, the effective portion of the change in the market value of hedging instruments must be recognized directly in consolidated equity. However, it is not recognized in profit or loss until the hedged item transaction occurs.\n\nWhere foreign currency hedges are used, the change in the market value of the derivatives is recognized in profit or loss. From that date, the change in the market value can be compared to the end-of-period closing rate of the foreign currency trade payables or foreign currency trade receivables. Any changes in earnings that are caused by the ineffectiveness of derivative financial instruments are recognized in profit or loss in the consolidated income statement.\n\nTo measure the effectiveness of a currency hedge, the hedged items and the hedging transactions are grouped together in so-called maturity bands according to the hedged risk. The maturity bands should not cover more than one quarter-year. The prospective effectiveness is assessed at the inception of the hedging relationship and reviewed at each measurement date as well as in the event of a significant change in the circumstances that affect the criteria for assessing effectiveness. In the case of interest rate hedges, prospective effectiveness is measured using a sensitivity analysis and retrospective effectiveness testing is performed using the dollar offset approach.\n\nDerivatives are measured at fair value. The fair value is the market value and is determined using accepted methods of financial mathematics. The basis for measuring the derivatives is the market data (interest rate, exchange rates, etc.) prevailing on the reporting date. The forward rate applicable on the reporting date is used for measuring forward currency transactions. In the case of positive market values, the creditworthiness of the counterparty is included in the measurement by means of a credit value adjustment (CVA). In the case of negative market values, a debit value adjustment (DVA) is deducted in order to account for the group's own risk of default. Special models are used to estimate the measurement. They are checked for plausibility by means of bank valuations.\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\n| 12/31/2023                       | CURRENCY | NOTIONAL<br>AMOUNT<br>IN 1000

Cash flow from financing activities included repayments of lease liabilities amounting to EUR 25,139k (previous year: EUR 23,414k). The remaining EUR 26,537k (previous year: EUR 20,531k) relate to short-term and low-value leases as well as interest expenses and income from subleases of right-of-use assets and are presented in cash flow from operating activities.\n\n#### Options for prolongation\n\nSome rental and lease agreements contain options for prolongation, which can be exercised by the group up to one year before the end of the fixed term. Wherever possible, the group seeks to include options for prolongation when concluding new rental contracts and leases in order to ensure operational flexibility. On the date of provision, the group assesses whether the right to exercise options for prolongation is sufficiently certain. The group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain that an option for prolongation will be exercised if a material event or change in circumstances occurs that is within its control.\n\n#### 49. LEASES AS A LESSOR (IFRS 16)\n\nFrom the lessor's perspective, all leases are classified as operating leases, as they are structured in such a way that the PIERER Mobility Group essentially retains all the risks and opportunities associated with ownership.\n\nThis does not apply to one sublease which the group classifies as a finance lease. This relates to the sublease of a building which was reported as a right of use under property, plant and equipment. No\n\nnew sublease was concluded and recognized in the 2023 financial year. In addition, the group recognized interest income on leasing receivables in 2023 in the amount of EUR 10k (previous year: EUR 10k). As of December 31, 2023, the leasing receivables from subleases amounted to EUR 767k (previous year: EUR 763k). Of this, EUR 253k (previous year: EUR 251k) are due in less than one year, and EUR 514k (previous year: EUR 511k) are due in 1-5 years.\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-104-0\"></span>X .

APPROVAL OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Executive Board on March 20, 2024 (previous year: March 21, 2023) for review by the Supervisory Board, for submission to the Annual General Meeting and for subsequent publication. Within the scope of the review it is required to perform, the Supervisory Board may require changes to be made to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWels, March 14, 2024\n\nThe Executive Board of PIERER Mobility AG\n\nttu\n\nStefan Pierer (CEO) Hubert Trunkenpolz Viktor Sigl (CFO)\n\nFlorian Kecht Alex Pierer Rudolf Wiesbeck\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Auditor's Report\n\n## REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## AUDIT OPINION\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of\n\n#### PIERER Mobility AG, Wels, Austria,\n\nand its subsidiaries (\"the Group\"), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023, and the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements comply with the legal requirements and present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and its consolidated financial performance and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements pursuant to Section 245a UGB (Austrian Commercial Code).\n\n## BASIS FOR OUR OPINION\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the EU Regulation 537/2014 (\"AP Regulation\") and Austrian Standards on Auditing. These standards require the audit to be conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities\" section of our report. We are independent of the audited Group in accordance with Austrian company law and professional regulations, and we have fulfilled our other responsibilities under those relevant ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained up to the date of the auditor's report is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on this date.\n\n## KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements. These matters were addressed in the con- text of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, however, we do not provide a separate opinion thereon.\n\nRecognition of Development Costs Refer to note 22\n\n#### Risk for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements of PIERER Mobility AG, development costs of EUR 506.7 million are reported under the balance sheet item \"Intangible assets\" and therefore represent a significant portion of the group's assets. According to IAS 38, the Group recognizes research costs are as expenses, while development costs for future serial products are capitalized if the capitalization requirements according to IAS 38.57ff. are fulfilled.\n\nThe main requirments for recognizing development costs as assets are the feasibility of the development projects (including the possibility of technical realization, the intention to complete and the ability to use) and the expected achievement of future economic benefits. The complexity of research and development projects is increasing due to the group's technology leadership as the leading powered two-wheeler manufacturer in Europe and the associated new development projects (including investments in electromobility and a range of zero-emission products). The assessment of project feasibility plays an important role in this context and is subject to discretionary decicions by management.\n\nIn addition to meeting the recognition requirements in accordance with IAS 38.57ff. the recording of time and cost for development projects also plays an important role in accuratley calculating development costs.\n\n## Our Response\n\nWe assessed the recognition of development costs as follows:\n\n- We obtained an understanding of managements process for the distinction between research and development costs and the evaluation of the recognition requirements of development costs according to IAS 38.57ff.\n- We evaluated the design, establishment and effectiveness of management's process-related controls over the capitalization of development costs, including review of management's project feasibility documentation.\n- We assessed, on the basis of random samples, whether a proper distinction has been made between research and development costs capitalized as intangible assets.\n- We evaluated, on a sample basis, the adequacy of capitalized expenses by reconciling material costs, overheads and accumulated engineering hours to external invoices and internal time- sheets and payslips.\n\nImpairment of goodwill \"Pierer New Mobility\"\n\nRefer to note 22\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Risk for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements of PIERER Mobility AG, goodwill is recognized for the cash-generating unit \"PIERER New Mobility\" of EUR 19.5 million. PIERER Mobility AG therefore tests the \"PIERER New Mobility\" cash-generating unit for impairment at least once a year and whenever there are indications of impairment.\n\nFor this purpose, PIERER Mobility AG determines the recoverable amount of the \"PIERER New Mobility\" cash-generating unit using a discounted cash flow method. The recoverable amount determined (impairment test) resulted in sufficient coverage of the carrying amounts.\n\nThe measurement of the recoverable amount of cash-generating units requires assumptions and estimates, such as the estimate of future cash flows and the determination of the discount rate to be used.\n\nThere is therefore a risk for the consolidated financial statements that inappropriate estimates could have a material impact on the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit \"PIERER New Mobility\" and thus the carrying amount of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet and the operating result in the consolidated income statement.\n\n#### Our Response\n\nWe assessed the recoverability of the cash-generating unit \"PIERER New Mobility\" with the involvement of our valuation specialists as follows:\n\n- We obtained an understanding of the planning process, we discussed the assumptions regarding growth rates and operating results with the responsible managers in the company and compared the planning data on which the valuation is based with the current budget figures approved by the Supervisory Board and the medium-term planning approved by the Management Board.\n- We evaluated the methodology of the impairment test performed and assessed whether it complies with the relevant standards. We compared the assumptions used to determine the cost of capital rates with market and industry-specific benchmarks and verified the mathematical accuracy of the calculation scheme.\n- In addition, we assessed whether the disclosures on goodwill and the trademark in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate.\n\n#### OTHER INFORMATION\n\nManagement is responsible for other information. Other information is all information provided in the annual report, other than the consolidated financial statements, the group management report and the auditor's report.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover other information and we do not provide any kind of assurance thereon.\n\nIn conjunction with our audit, it is our responsibility to read this other information and to assess whether, based on knowledge gained during our audit, it contains any material inconsistencies with the consolidated financial statements or any apparent material misstatement of fact.\n\nIf, on the basis of our work on the other information obtained before the date of the auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of fact in other information, we must report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n#### RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, the additional requirements pursuant to Section 245a UGB (Austrian Commercial Code) and for such internal controls as management determines are necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nManagement is also responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless management either intents to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe audit committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\n## AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinion. Reasonable assurance represents a high level of assurance, but provides no guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the AP Regulation and Austrian Standards on Auditing (and therefore ISAs), will always detect a material misstatement, if any. Misstatements may result from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the AP Regulation and Austrian Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.\n\n#### Moreover:\n\n- We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, we design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to serve as a basis for our audit opinion. The risk of not detecting material misstatements resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or override of internal control.\n- We obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- We evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- We conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our audit report to the respective note in the consolidated financial statements. If such disclosures are not appropriate, we will modify our audit opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. How- ever, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the notes, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- We obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n- We communicate with the audit committee regarding, amongst other matters, the planned scope and timing of our audit as well as significant findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n- We communicate to the audit committee that we have complied with the relevant professional requirements in respect of our independence, that we will report any relationships and other events that could reasonably affect our independence and, where appropriate, the related safeguards.\n- From the matters communicated with the audit committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit i.e. key audit matters. We describe these key audit matters in our auditor's report unless laws or other legal regulations preclude public disclosure about the matter or when in very rare cases, we determine that a matter should not be included in our audit report because the negative consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public benefits of such communication.\n\n## REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n#### Group Management Report\n\nIn accordance with Austrian company law, the group management report is to be audited as to whether it is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and prepared in accordance with legal requirements.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the group management report in accordance with Austrian company law and other legal or regulatory requirements.\n\nWe have conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted standards on the audit of group management reports.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, the group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with legal requirements. The disclosures pursuant to Section 243a UGB (Austrian Commercial Code) are appropriate.\n\n#### Statement\n\nBased on our knowledge gained in the course of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and our understanding of the Group and its environment, we did not note any material misstatements in the group management report.\n\n#### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 10 AP REGULATION\n\nWe were elected as auditors at the Annual General Meeting on 21 April 2023 and were appointed by the supervisory board on 25 Juli 2023 to audit the financial statements of Company for the financial year ending on 31 December 2023.\n\nWe have been auditors of the Company, without interruption, since the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December, 2014.\n\nWe declare that our opinion expressed in the \"Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements\" section of our report is consistent with our additional report to the Audit Committee, in accor- dance with Article 11 AP Regulation.\n\nWe declare that we have not provided any prohibited non-audit services (Article 5 Paragraph 1 AP Regulation) and that we have ensured our independence throughout the course of the audit, from the audited Group.\n\n#### ENGAGEMENT PARTNER\n\nThe engagement partner is Mr Mag. Alexander Gall.\n\nLinz, 14 March 2024\n\nKPMG Austria GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft\n\nMag.

Holdinggesellschaft ist, beinhaltet der Lagebericht neben den Informationen des Einzelabschlusses auf Basis UGB (Teil 1) auch die Informationen des Konzernabschlusses auf Basis IFRS (Teil 2).\n\n## *I) Einzelabschluss der PIERER Mobility AG (nach UGB):*\n\n## **A. Geschäftsverlauf und Lage des Unternehmens**\n\nDas Geschäftsjahr für den Einzelabschluss der PIERER Mobility AG umfasst den Zeitraum vom 1.1.2023 bis 31.12.2023.\n\nDie PIERER Mobility AG ist Alleinaktionärin der KTM AG und hält 10.678.706 Stk. Aktien (100% Anteile). Zum Stichtag 31.12.2023 hält die PIERER Mobility AG unverändert 100% Anteile an der PIERER Innovation GmbH, 100% der Anteile an der PIERER E-Commerce GmbH (vorm. HDC GmbH) und 100% Anteile an der Avocodo GmbH. Seit Juli 2023 hält die Pierer Mobility AG direkt 100% Anteile an der KTM Forschungs- und Entwicklungs GmbH sowie KTM Racing GmbH, die von der KTM AG eingebracht wurden. Im Oktober hat die PIERER Mobility AG 74 % Anteile an der LX media GmbH direkt erworben. An der Kiska GmbH hält die Gesellschaft unverändert 50% sowie an der AC styria Mobilitätscluster GmbH 12,33%.\n\nDa die PIERER Mobility AG im Wesentlichen die Aufgaben einer geschäftsleitenden Holdinggesellschaft erfüllt, wird im Lagebericht auch auf die Entwicklungen des Geschäftsjahres 2023 ihrer Tochtergesellschaften sowie des Konzerns insgesamt eingegangen.\n\n## **B. Ertrags- und Vermögenslage**\n\n## **Ergebnisanalyse**\n\nDie PIERER Mobility AG hat im abgelaufenen Geschäftsjahr einen Jahresüberschuss von € 42,9 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 78,7 Mio.) erzielt. Positiv wirkten sich im Wesentlichen Dividendenerträge aus den Beteiligungsunternehmen in Höhe von € 12,6 Mio. sowie Zinserträge in Höhe von € 1,5 Mio. aus. Negativ wirkten sich vor allem die sonstigen betrieblichen Aufwendungen aus. Diese betreffen im Wesentlichen Aufwendungen für konzerninterne Dienstleistungen und Umlagen, Aufwendungen für Vorstandstätigkeiten, Steuerberatungsaufwand sowie Rechts- und Beratungsaufwand.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Bilanzanalyse**\n\n.\n\nDie Bilanzsumme zum 31.12.2023 in Höhe von € 1.335 Mio (Vorjahr: € 1.363,1 Mio) hat sich um € 28,2 Mio. reduziert, was im Wesentlichen auf die Reduktion der Forderungen gegenüber verbundene Unternehmen zurückzuführen ist.\n\nDas Anlagevermögen hat sich im Geschäftsjahr 2023 auf € 1.292,6 Mio. erhöht (Vorjahr: € 1.251,7 Mio.) und ist im Wesentlichen auf die Erhöhung der Anteile an der KTM Forschungs- und Entwicklungs GmbH sowie KTM Racing GmbH zurückzuführen.\n\nDas Umlaufvermögen hat sich im Geschäftsjahr 2023 auf € 42,3 Mio. vermindert (Vorjahr: € 110,0 Mio. erhöht) und ist im Wesentlichen auf die Reduktion der Forderungen gegenüber verbundenen Unternehmen zurückzuführen. Die Forderungen gegenüber verbundenen Unternehmen betragen zum Stichtag € 13,6 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 90,3 Mio.) und betreffen im Wesentlichen Forderungen aus Dividendenanspruch, Finanzierungsforderungen sowie Forderungen aus laufenden Verrechnungen und sonstigen Forderungen. Die liquiden Mittel haben sich gegenüber dem Vorjahr um € 9,2 Mio. erhöht.\n\nDas Eigenkapital hat sich vermindert und beträgt zum Stichtag € 1.301,5 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 1.326,2 Mio.). Die Eigenkapitalquote beträgt 97,5% und liegt somit auf einem sehr hohen Niveau.\n\nDie Verbindlichkeiten haben sich im abgelaufenen Geschäftsjahr reduziert und lagen zum 31.12.2023 bei € 33,1 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 34,4 Mio.). Die Reduktion der Verbindlichkeiten resultiert im Wesentlichen aus dem Rückgang der Verbindlichkeiten gegenüber verbundenen Unternehmen. Von den kurz- und langfristigen Verbindlichkeiten betreffen € 30,0 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 30,0 Mio.) Namensschuldverschreibungen, € 1,9 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 1,6 Mio.) Verbindlichkeiten aus Lieferungen und Leistungen, € 0,6 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 2,2 Mio.) Verbindlichkeiten gegenüber verbundenen Unternehmen sowie € 0,6 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 0,6 Mio.) sonstige Verbindlichkeiten.\n\n## **C. Mitarbeiter**\n\nIm Jahresdurchschnitt beschäftigte die Gesellschaft keine (Vorjahr: 0) MitarbeiterInnen.\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **LAGEBERICHT ZUM KONZERNABSCHLUSS PER 31.12.2023 DER PIERER MOBILITY AG, WELS**\n\n## **1. ENTWICKLUNG DER PIERER MOBILITY-GRUPPE**\n\n## **DAS UNTERNEHMEN**\n\nDie PIERER Mobility AG ist die Dachgesellschaft für Europas führenden Hersteller motorisierter Zweiräder und produziert eine vollständige Premium-Markenpalette von KTM, GASGAS, Husqvarna und MV Agusta Motorcycles. Mit ihrer Innovationskraft ist PIERER Mobility durch ihre Motorradmarken ein wegweisender Technologieführer für zweirädrige E-Mobilität. Mit Husqvarna und GASGAS E-Bicycles wird das Zweiradsortiment komplementiert. Das Premium-Markenangebot bietet weiters Hochleistungskomponenten der Marke WP sowie spezielle KTM X-BOW Hochleistungssportwagen.\n\nInfolge der strategischen Partnerschaft mit Bajaj in Indien konnte das Unternehmen die Produktionskapazitäten in den letzten Jahren diversifizieren und die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit auf dem globalen Markt erhöhen. Die Kooperation mit CFMOTO in China und das Joint Venture mit Maxcom in Bulgarien stärken sowohl die Fahrradals auch die Motorradproduktion nachhaltig. Mit führender Technologie im Bereich der Niedervolt-Elektromobilität will PIERER Mobility weltweit Marktführer bei elektrischen Zweirädern im Leistungsbereich von 250W bis 15 kW werden.\n\nDie Aktien der PIERER Mobility AG sind im \"Swiss Performance Index (SPI)\" der SIX Swiss Exchange in Zürich primärkotiert und zusätzlich im Prime Market der Wiener Börse gelistet.\n\n### **ABSATZ- UND UMSATZENTWICKLUNG IM GESCHÄFTSJAHR 2023**\n\nDie PIERER Mobility-Gruppe steigerte im Geschäftsjahr 2023 trotz schwieriger wirtschaftlicher Rahmenbedingungen und einem Umbruch in der Fahrradindustrie den Konzernumsatz um 9,2 % auf einen neuen Rekordwert von € 2.661,2 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 2.437,2 Mio.). Mit 381.555 verkauften Motorrädern (Vorjahr: 375.492) im Geschäftsjahr 2023 erreichte der Motorradbereich ein Absatzplus von rund 2 %. Aufgrund der weltweiten Überbestände im Fahrradbereich war auch die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe mit stark gefallenen Marktpreisen konfrontiert. Das Absatzwachstum in der Fahrrad-Division von mehr als 30 % war geprägt von Lagerbestandsbereinigungen und der Abgabe der Marke R Raymon. Im Geschäftsjahr 2023 wurden 157.358 Fahrräder (Vorjahr: 118.465) verkauft.\n\nIn den Vertriebsregionen von Europa lag der Absatz bei rund 140.000 Motorrädern (+15 %) und rund zwei Drittel der Motorräder (rund 240.000) wurden in den Märkten außerhalb Europas abgesetzt. Trotz eines leichten Absatzrückgangs in Nordamerika schaffte es die dortige Niederlassung dennoch zum zweiten Mal in Folge mehr als 100.000 Motorräder abzusetzen. Während sich der Absatz in Südamerika (-26 %) und Asien (-27 %) im abgelaufenen Geschäftsjahr rückläufig zeigte, konnte der Absatz in Australien mit rund 19.700 abgesetzten Motorrädern leicht (+1 %) über das Vorjahresniveau gehoben werden.\n\nEntgegen den globalen wirtschaftlichen schwierigen Rahmenbedingungen ist die Nachfrage in den Kernmärkten Europa mit +11 % (~ 820.000 neu zugelassene Motorräder) sehr stark und in Nordamerika (USA & Kanada) mit +4 % (485.000 Motorräder) ebenfalls auch deutlich positiv gestiegen. Der Marktanteil aller drei Marken (KTM, Husqvarna, GASGAS) liegt somit im Jahr 2023 in Europa bei rund 10,6 % bzw. bei 12,6 % in Nordamerika. Leicht rückgängig ist der australische (inklusive Neuseeland) Motorradmarkt mit einem 3%-igen Rückgang auf 67.000 neu registrierte Motorräder. Dennoch gelang in diesem Markt ein Anstieg des Marktanteiles der drei Marken gesamt auf 21 %. Der relevante indische Motorradmarkt befindet sich hingegen wie im Vorjahr deutlich im Aufschwung (+22 %). Bajaj setzte in Indien knapp 66.000 KTM und Husqvarna Motorräder ab, resultierend in einem Marktanteil von 5,3 %.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **STRATEGISCHE PROJEKTE**\n\nIm Geschäftsjahr 2023 wurde die Zusammenarbeit mit CFMOTO weiter intensiviert und ausgebaut. Einerseits wurden im Februar 2023 die Aktivitäten in der im Geschäftsjahr 2022 gegründeten Tochtergesellschaft CFMOTO Motorcycles Distribution GmbH, Munderfing, aufgenommen und somit der Vertrieb von CFMOTO-Motorrädern in Europa, insbesondere in Deutschland, Österreich, der Schweiz, Spanien und Großbritannien übernommen. Andererseits wurde die seit vielen Jahren bestehende Zusammenarbeit bei Industrialisierungsprojekten im etablierten Joint Venture Zhejiang CFMOTO-KTMR2R Motorcycles Co., Ltd., Zhejian, China, intensiviert und die Serienproduktion von KTM-Modellen der Mittelklasse weiter ausgebaut. Die Intensivierung des Joint Ventures und die Zusammenarbeit in den Bereichen Produktstrategie, Produktentwicklung, Industrialisierung und Vertrieb ist ein weiterer Schritt, um die steigende Marktnachfrage in China und dem asiatischen Raum, sowie auch weltweit bedienen zu können. Darüber hinaus wird die Produktionskapazität von 50.000 auf 100.000 Fahrzeuge erhöht. Als Zeichen der intensivierten Zusammenarbeit erhöhte CFMOTO zudem seine Beteiligung an der PIERER Mobility AG auf 2,0 %.\n\nEin wichtiger Meilenstein für das Unternehmen war der Abschluss einer strategischen Kooperation mit dem italienischen Premium-Motoradhersteller MV Agusta S.p.A., mit Sitz in Varese, an dem die KTM AG bereits im November einen Anteil von 25,1 % übernommen hat. Die KTM-Gruppe verantwortet seit dem Geschäftsjahr 2023 den Einkauf sowie den Vertrieb in den wichtigsten europäischen Ländern, das Marketing und die Kundenbetreuung für MV Agusta-Motorräder. Ferner hat der Vorstand den strategischen Beschluss gefasst, die im Zuge des Kooperationsvertrags eingeräumte Call-Option zum Erwerb eines weiteren Anteils von 25,0 an der MV Agusta S.p.A. im Frühjahr 2026 auszuüben.\n\nWeiters hat der Vorstand hat den strategischen Beschluss gefasst, den Fokus noch stärker auf das Kerngeschäft Powered-Two-Wheelers (Motorräder und E-Bicycles) zu legen und sich auf die Premiummarken KTM, GASGAS und Husqvarna sowie MV Agusta zu konzentrieren. Aufgrund dieser Entscheidung wurde der Verkauf der Marken R Raymon und FELT sowie die Abgabe des Non-E-Fahrradbereiches vom Vorstand eingeleitet. In diesem Zusammenhang wurde im September 2023 die Marke \"R Raymon\" an die R RAYMON Bicycles GmbH (vormals: Johansson GmbH), Schweinfurt, Deutschland, veräußert. Weiters wurde der Verkaufsprozess der Fahrradmarke FELT an ein Konsortium rund um Florian Burguet ebenfalls eingeleitet, welcher in der ersten Jahreshälfte 2024 abgeschlossen werden soll. Florian Burguet ist als Vorstand mit Ende Dezember ausgeschieden.\n\n### **AKTIVITÄTEN UND ERFOLGE IM RENNSPORT**\n\n### **Motorsport**\n\nIm Mai 2023 wurde in der KTM Motohall die Ausstellung \"Legends of Dakar\" eröffnet. So konnte das Siegermotorrad, mit dem Kevin Benavides im Januar die Rally Dakar 2023 gewonnen hatte, noch einen stolzen Platz in der Ausstellung einnehmen. Sein Erfolg war der bereits 19. KTM-Sieg bei der Rally Dakar in den letzten 22 Jahren. Auch im Motocross ist PIERER Mobility mit allen Marken erfolgreich. Jeffrey Herlings von KTM Red Bull Factory Racing brach beim Grand Prix von Spanien zur Saisonmitte den Allzeitrekord von 101 Siegen und erhöhte seine persönliche Erfolgsbilanz auf 103 Siege. Andrea Adamo sicherte sich den MX2 WM Titel. Der Deutsche Manuel Lettenbichler holte seine zweite FIM Hard Enduro Weltmeisterschaft in Folge – eine phänomenale Quote von sechs Siegen in sechs Rennen. Jospe Garcia triumphierte nicht nur bei den International Six Days Enduro, sondern krönte sich auch in der EnduroGP E1 Klasse zum Weltmeister. Seit der Einführung des globalen Husqvarna Factory Racing Teams im Jahr 2015 hat Husqvarna Motorcycles seine Position als dominierende Kraft im Offroad-Rennsport konsequent ausgebaut. 2023 wurde diese Erfolgsbilanz mit dem FIM SuperEnduro-Titel von Billy Bolt auf insgesamt 116 Weltmeistertitel verbessert. Als dritte Marke ist GASGAS im Motorsport erfolgreich unterwegs. Jorge Prado schrieb mit seinem MXGP WM Titel Geschichte – es war der erste Titel für GASGAS in der Motocross Königsklasse überhaupt. In der FIM EnduroGP-Weltmeisterschaft konnte GASGAS in den letzten Jahren seine größten Triumphe feiern. Nachdem Andrea Verona 2022 sowohl den EnduroGP- als auch den Enduro1-Titel gewonnen hatte, wechselte er die Klasse und stieg 2023 in die Enduro2 ein.\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\nDer hochspezialisierte Trial-Sport ist für GASGAS nach wie vor äußerst wichtig, da die Marke sowohl drinnen als auch draußen weiterhin auf höchstem Niveau konkurriert. Für 2023 verpflichtete GASGAS die TrialGP-Nummer zwei Jaime Busto, um zusammen mit Sondre Haga, dem Trial2-Weltmeister von 2022, in der Königsklasse anzutreten.\n\nIm Jahr 2023 setzte allein KTM 28 Fahrer in der MotoGP™ sowie bei Nachwuchsveranstaltungen wie dem Red Bull MotoGP™ Rookies Cup und dem Northern Talent Cup eine ganze Reihe von jungen Talenten ein. Red Bull KTM Factory Racing feierte mit Brad Binder zwei Siege im neuen MotoGP™-Sprintformat und errang durch ihn und seinen neuen Teamkollegen Jack Miller insgesamt zehn Podestplätze. KTM sicherte sich dadurch Platz zwei der Herstellerwertung in der MotoGP™. In der Moto2™ ließ Pedro Acosta die Konkurrenz hinter sich und holte bei seiner erst dritten WM-Teilnahme seinen zweiten Titel, nachdem er 2021 die Moto3™ dominiert hatte. Mit ihm wird das GASGAS MotoGP™-Projekt für 2024 um ein weiteres Talent erweitert. Als zweifacher Weltmeister ist Pedro Acosta zweifellos einer der talentiertesten Nachwuchsfahrer im Straßenrennsport. Er wird 2024 von Augusto Fernandez in der Startaufstellung unterstützt, der seine zweite Saison bei Red Bull GASGAS Tech3 antritt. In der Moto3™ feierte GASGAS Aspar Fahrer David Alonso vier Rennsiege und acht Podiumsplatzierungen in seiner Premierensaison. Der Spanier gilt als Favorit für die Moto3™-Krone in der Saison 2024. Bei Husqvarna Factory Racing ging Ayumu Sasaki nach dem vierten Platz in der 2022er Moto3™- Weltmeisterschaft als Titelanwärter in die Saison 2023. Erneut erwies er sich während der gesamten Saison als regelmäßiger Podiumskandidat und beendete die Saison als Vize-Moto3™-Weltmeister. Teamkollege Collin Veijer lieferte ebenfalls beeindruckende Ergebnisse ab und feierte einen Sieg in seiner Debutsaison.\n\n### **Radsport**\n\nSeit 2023 bestreitet die Marke GASGAS E-Bicycles die UCI Mountain Bike World Series, insbesondere den E-Enduro Pro World Cup. Gemeinsam mit Industriepartnern traten Johannes Fischbach und Alex Marin von GASGAS SRAM Racing sowie Simon Carlsson und Alexandre Fayolle von GASGAS MOTOREX Racing an. Nach allen fünf Runden belegte Alex Marin den 4. Platz und hielt das Podium bereits in der allerersten Saison für GASGAS E-Bicycles in greifbarer Nähe.\n\n### **AUSWIRKUNGEN DES RUSSISCH-UKRAINISCHEN KRIEGES**\n\nDie Einschätzungen der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe zu den Auswirkungen des Kriegsgeschehens in der Ukraine sind im Vergleich zum Vorjahr unverändert. Die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe hat keinen wesentlichen Grund identifiziert, ihre Schätzungen und Erwartungen zum 31. Dezember 2023 aufgrund des Kriegsgeschehens in der Ukraine wesentlich zu ändern. Die Gruppe verfügt weder über Investitionen, sonstige Vermögenswerte oder sonstige wesentliche Geschäftsbeziehungen in der Ukraine, Russland oder Weißrussland noch hat die Gruppe wesentliche Geschäftsbeziehungen zu Lieferanten oder Händlern in diesen Ländern. Vor diesem Hintergrund erwartet die Gruppe keine wesentlichen Auswirkungen auf die erwarteten zukünftigen Cashflows. Gleichermaßen hat die Gruppe durch den Krieg und die verhängten Sanktionen keinen Verlust der Beherrschung, der gemeinschaftlichen Führung oder der Fähigkeit zur Ausübung eines maßgeblichen Einflusses auf Unternehmen erlitten und erwartet auch dergleichen nicht.\n\n## **2. WIRTSCHAFTLICHES UMFELD UND MARKTENTWICKLUNG**\n\nDie weltwirtschaftlichen Aussichten sind unverändert eingetrübt. Die Auswirkungen des seit 2022 andauernden Russisch-Ukrainischen Krieges, sowie die unter anderem daraus resultierenden signifikant erhöhten Inflationsraten, haben zu einer deutlichen Verlangsamung der Weltwirtschaft geführt. Zwar haben sich die Prognosen im Laufe des Geschäftsjahres 2023 grundlegend verbessert, allerdings bleiben sie hierdurch weiterhin gehemmt.\n\nIm Zuge dessen lässt sich eine weitgehend positive Normalisierung der Geschäfts- und Verbraucherstimmung erkennen, die Rohstoffpreise sinken und die im vergangenen Geschäftsjahr beobachteten Störungen in der\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nLieferkette erscheinen weitgehend überwunden, da die Logistikkosten und die Lieferzeiten für notwendige Ressourcen im Allgemeinen wieder das Niveau vor der COVID-Pandemie erreichen. Wesentliche finanz- und gesamtwirtschaftliche Risiken bestehen zum einen in der schwelenden Immobilienkrise in China, zum anderen in der weiteren Entwicklung der Inflationsraten. Während sowohl die Gesamtinflation als auch die Kerninflation, die die volatilen Energie- und Nahrungsmittelkomponenten ausschließt, rückläufig sind, wird erwartet, dass beide zumindest kurz- und mittelfristig erhöht bleiben. In einer Gesamtbetrachtung sind die wirtschaftlichen Risiken im Allgemeinen besser ausbalanciert als im vergangenen Geschäftsjahr, aber das Risiko einer Abwärtsbewegung ist immer noch Gegenwertig. Dies verdeutlicht die weiterhin bestehende Unsicherheit insbesondere über den Verlauf des Krieges in der Ukraine, seine weiteren Folgen sowie die jüngsten Unsicherheiten über den Ausgang des aufgeflammten Krieges im Nahen Osten.\n\nLetztlich führt die beschriebene Situation immer noch dazu, dass die globalen Wachstumsprognosen der führenden Organisationen auf diesem Gebiet, wie dem Internationalen Währungsfonds (IWF), der Organisation für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (OECD) und die Weltbank, unsicherer sind als üblich und ständig angepasst werden. Die jüngsten Schätzungen des IWF deuten auf eine im Wesentlichen unveränderte globale Wirtschaftswachstumsprognose von 3,1 % für 2024 und 3,2 % für 2025 im Vergleich zu früheren Schätzungen. Die im Wesentlichen unveränderten Prognosen zeigen, dass die größten Risiken für die globale Wirtschaftsentwicklung inzwischen ausgeglichen und stabilisiert sind, wenngleich angesichts der oben beschriebenen Probleme immer noch Abwärtsrisiken bestehen. Die veröffentlichten Schätzungen basieren auf zahlreichen Annahmen zu einer Vielzahl makroökonomischer Faktoren, insbesondere zur Preisentwicklung fossiler Brennstoffe und anderer Ressourcen sowie zum allgemeinen Zinsniveau.\n\nFür Industrieländer rechnet der IWF für das Jahr 2024 mit einem Wachstum von 1,5 % und für das nächste Jahr 2025 von 1,8 %. Für die Euro-Zone wird für 2024 ein Wachstum von 0,9 % prognostiziert. Für das Jahr 2025 rechnet der IWF mit einem Wachstum von 1,7 % für die Euro-Zone, während das Wachstum insbesondere in Deutschland mit 0,5 % für 2024 und 1,6 % für 2025 unterdurchschnittlich prognostiziert wird.\n\nFür die Schwellen- und Entwicklungsländer prognostiziert der IWF für das Jahr 2024 ein Wachstum der Wirtschaftsleistung von 4,1 %, für 2025 von 4,2 %. Für China wird eine Wachstumsrate von 4,6 % für das Jahr 2024 und 4,1 % für das Jahr 2025 prognostiziert. Für Indien wird ein Anstieg der Wirtschaftsleistung von 5,7 % für 2024 und von 6,8 % für 2025 prognostiziert.\n\nDer IWF prognostiziert Inflationsraten in Höhe von 5,8 % für 2024 und in Höhe von 4,4 % für 2025. Die künftige Entwicklung der Weltwirtschaft hängt insbesondere von der erfolgreichen Kalibrierung der Geldpolitik ab. Dabei muss eine Bilanz der kumulierten Auswirkungen vergangener Zinserhöhungen gezogen werden, die andernfalls zu erheblichen negativen Nebenwirkungen für den Finanzsektor führen können. Darüber hinaus stellen der Verlauf des Krieges in der Ukraine sowie neuerdings auch im Nahen Osten und nicht zuletzt die wirtschaftliche Erholung und Nachfrage aus China wesentliche Faktoren für die zukünftige Entwicklung der Weltwirtschaft dar. Diese Einschätzung wird weitgehend von der OECD und der Weltbank geteilt. Insbesondere der IWF erklärt auch, dass sich zunehmende Divergenzen im Wirtschaftswachstum abzeichnen, da eine Verlangsamung des Wachstums in fortgeschrittenen Volkswirtschaften offenbar ausgeprägter zu sein scheint als in Schwellen- und Entwicklungsländern. Bei einer im Wesentlichen unveränderten globalen Wachstumsprognose des IWF ist kein größerer globaler Wirtschaftsabschwung zu erwarten, wenngleich alle Prognosen zur globalen Wirtschaftsentwicklung weiterhin mit erheblichen Unsicherheiten behaftet sind.\n\nIm abgelaufenen Geschäftsjahr 2023 entwickelte sich der globale1 **Motorradmarkt** positiv (+2,7 %, entsprechend einem Plus von 90.000 Motorrädern). In **Europa**2 stieg der Markt, gemessen an Neuzulassungen, nach einem kleinen Einbruch im Jahr 2022 wieder auf mehr als 800.000 Motorräder an (+11 %). Speziell die Kernmärkte Deutschland (+12 %), Frankreich (+14 %), Italien (+15) und Spanien (+13 %) profitieren von einer gestiegenen Nachfrage. Dadurch stieg der Marktanteil von 10,0 % auf 10,5 % (gemessen an den drei Kernmarken KTM, Husqvarna und GASGAS).\n\n<sup>1</sup> Bezogen auf die wesentlichen Absatzmärkte der KTM Gruppe: DE, FR, IT, UK, ES, SE, BE, NL, AT, CH, FL, DK, NO, GR, PL, SL, HU, BALTIC, USA, CAN, AUS, NZ, JP, SA, TH, CN, AR, BR, CO.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Motorräder = ϣϤϢccm ohne Motocross, Scooters und ATV's, inkl. Elektromotorräder in den Märkten DE, FR, IT, UK, ES, SE, BE, NL, AT, CH, FI, NO, BALTIC.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn **Nordamerika** stieg der Absatz (im Gegensatz zu Europa inklusive Motocrossmodelle) ebenfalls und schließt bei knapp 490.000 verkauften Einheiten (+4 %). Der Marktanteil steigt durch ein erreichtes Wachstum der drei Kernmarken von 11 % auf 12,6 % (Vorjahr: 11,8 %).\n\nLeicht rückläufig zeigt sich die Entwicklung des **australischen** und **neuseeländischen** Marktes mit einem Rückgang von 3,2 %. Da sich die Zulassungen von KTM, Husqvarna und GASGAS aber um 3,4 % erhöhten, konnte der Marktanteil auf 21,0 % gesteigert werden (Vorjahr: 19,7 %). Das Gesamtvolumen beläuft sich auf knapp 67.000 Motorrädern.\n\nDer relevante indische Motorradmarkt (S2/S3-Segment) befindet sich abermals deutlich im Aufschwung (+22 %) und weist ein Volumen von 1,2 Millionen verkauften Motorrädern auf. Dabei setzte der strategische Partner Bajaj in **Indien** über 65.000 Motorräder der Marken KTM und Husqvarna ab, resultierend in einem leicht gestiegenen Marktanteil von 5,3 % (Vorjahr: 5,0 %). Der asiatische Raum ist 2023 von Verlusten geprägt, wobei die Märkte in **Thailand** (-10,4 %) und **China** (Premium-Importeursmarkt; -17 %) in besonderem Maße betroffen sind. In **Japan** (Motorräder >250cc) beläuft sich der Rückgang auf -6 % und fällt damit etwas geringer aus. Der Rückgang (inklusive Hongkong, bei einem Volumen von ca. 2.000 Motorrädern) beträgt knapp -12 % und hält sich bei einem Volumen von nun knapp 200.000 Motorrädern. Der Marktanteil der KTM-Kernmarken ist in dieser wichtigen Wachstumsregion dennoch auf 5,2 % (Vorjahr 4,9 %) gestiegen.\n\nDer Markt für **New Mobility** sieht sich großen Herausforderungen gegenüber. Während die vergangenen Jahre und Erwartungen von den Nachwirkungen des durch die Corona-Pandemie erhöhten Nachfrageniveaus geprägt waren, deutet sich schon in der vom Zweirad-Industrie-Verbandes (ZIV) veröffentlichten Prognose für das Geschäftsjahr 2023 und zumindest im Folgejahr eine wesentliche Abkühlung an. Für das gesamte Jahr 2023 prognostiziert der ZIV einen Absatz von rund 2 Millionen elektrifizierten New Mobility-Produkten. Dies entspricht einem Rückgang von ca. 10 % verglichen mit dem Rekordjahr 2022, in dem ein Absatzvolumen von 2,2 Mio. Stück erzielt wurde. Darüber hinaus ist anzumerken, dass aktuelle makroökonomische Unsicherheiten, wie einleitend dargelegt, sowie Einflüsse auf Verbraucherpreise nicht zuletzt aufgrund von hohen Inflationsraten die Marktentwicklung negativ beeinflussen. Die Prognosen deuten darauf hin, dass sich der gesamte New Mobility-Markt einem Trend der Konsolidierung gegenübersieht.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **3.

(Vorjahr: € 2.437,2 Mio.). Rund 97 % der Umsatzerlöse wurden außerhalb von Österreich erzielt. Regional betrachtet entfielen 54,4 % der Umsatzerlöse auf Europa (+7,9 Prozentpunkte zum Vorjahr), 29,2 % auf Nordamerika inkl. Mexiko (-4,7 Prozentpunkte zum Vorjahr) und 16,4 % auf den Rest der Welt (-3,2 Prozentpunkte zum Vorjahr).\n\nDas operative Betriebsergebnis (EBIT) verringerte sich um rund 32 % auf € 160,0 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 235,3 Mio.), was einer EBIT-Marge von 6,0 % entspricht. Im Motorradsegment beläuft sich die EBIT-Marge bei rund 9 %, welches innerhalb der ursprünglich geplanten Bandbreite von 8-10 % liegt. Demgegenüber hat die eingeleitete Neuausrichtung des Fahrradbereiches das Ergebnis deutlich belastet. Das operative Ergebnis vor Abschreibungen (EBITDA) liegt mit € 323,5 Mio. um rund 15 % unter dem Vorjahreswert was einer EBITDA-Marge von 12,2 % entspricht. Das Ergebnis nach Steuern beträgt € 76,4 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 170,6 Mio.).\n\nDie Gesamtabsatzzahlen der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe sowie der Absatz von PTWs (Motorräder und E-Bicycles) stellen sich wie folgt dar:\n\nImage /page/140/Figure/5 description: The image is a bar graph comparing the number of PTWs (Powered Two-Wheelers) and bicycles in 2022 and 2023. In 2023, there were 482,195 PTWs and 538,913 bicycles. In 2022, there were 449,971 PTWs and 493,957 bicycles.\n\nDie beiden Segmente \"Motorcycles\" und \"Bicycles\" stellen die operativen Hauptbereiche der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe dar, auf deren Entwicklung im Folgenden eingegangen wird.\n\n## **MOTORCYCLES**\n\nIm Geschäftsjahr 2023 konnte in der Motorrad-Division ein Umsatz von € 2.416,4 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 2.262,5 Mio.) erzielt werden (+6,8 % gegenüber Vorjahr). Im Motoradbereich sind die Kosten für die Lagerbestände der Händler trotz guter Nachfrage durch deutlich erhöhte Zinsen stark angestiegen. Dies führte dazu, dass zur Stärkung der Händlerstruktur verlängerte Zahlungsziele und höhere Rabatte an die Händler gewährt werden mussten. Das EBITDA beträgt im Geschäftsjahr 2023 € 371,0 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 381,2 Mio.) und das EBIT liegt bei € 214,4 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 241,0 Mio.). Dies entspricht einer EBITDA-Marge von 15,4 % (Vorjahr: 16,8 %) und einer EBIT-Marge von 8,9 % (Vorjahr: 10,7 %).\n\nIn Europa stieg der Umsatz im Vergleich zum Vorjahresniveau deutlich auf € 1.229,0 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 977,4 Mio.) an, was einem Umsatzanteil von 50,9 % entspricht (Vorjahr: 43,2 %). In Nordamerika verzeichnete der Motorradbereich einen Umsatz von € 754,4 Mio. (Vorjahr: 811,3 Mio.). Damit wurden 31,2 % des Umsatzes in Nordamerika erzielt (Vorjahr: 35,9 %). In den übrigen Ländern sank der Umsatz leicht gegenüber dem Vorjahr um 8,6 % auf € 432,9 Mio. Der Umsatzanteil in den übrigen Ländern beträgt 17,9 % (Vorjahr: 20,9 %).\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\nMit 280.206 verkauften KTM Motorrädern, 67.462 verkauften Husqvarna Motorrädern und 29.532 verkauften GASGAS Motorrädern im Geschäftsjahr 2023 zusätzlich der abgesetzten Motorräder von MV Agusta (1.852) und CFMOTO (2.503) konnte ein Absatz von 381.555 Motorrädern (2022: 375.492 Stück) erzielt werden (dies unter Berücksichtigung der in Indien und Indonesien von Partner Bajaj verkauften Motorräder). Die Motorrad-Division erreichte somit ein Absatzplus von 1,6 % und festigte damit mit ihren drei Motorradmarken ihre Präsenz in den wichtigen Motorradabsatzmärkten.\n\nImage /page/141/Figure/2 description: The image shows two bar charts comparing sales figures for motorcycles in 2022 and 2023. The left chart represents \"Absatz 2022 Motorräder (Stück)\" with a total of 375,492 units. The bars indicate sales for KTM (268,575), Husqvarna Motorcycles (75,266), and GASGAS (31,651). The right chart represents \"Absatz 2023 Motorräder (Stück)\" with a total of 381,555 units. The bars indicate sales for KTM (280,206), Husqvarna Motorcycles (67,462), GASGAS (29,532), CFM (2,503), and MVA (1,852). A note indicates that the 2023 figures include 8,975 E-Balance Bikes and 69 Skutta units.\n\nIn den Vertriebsregionen von Europa lag der Absatz bei 140.214 Motorrädern (+14,9 %). Rund zwei Drittel der produzierten Motorräder (241.341) wurden in Märkten außerhalb Europas abgesetzt. Besonders stark war das Wachstum in Indien/Nepal, wo 66.426 Motorräder abgesetzt wurden, was einem Plus von 29,0 % im Vergleich zum Vorjahr entspricht. Trotz eines leichten Absatzrückgangs in Nordamerika (-7,7 %) schaffte es die dortige Niederlassung zum zweiten Mal in Folge mit 101.277 Stück mehr als 100.000 Motorräder abzusetzen. Während sich der Absatz in Südamerika mit 27.671 (-26,4 %) und in Asien mit 23.129 (-27,3 %) abgesetzten Motorrädern rückläufig zeigte, konnte der Absatz in Australien mit 19.648 abgesetzten Motorrädern leicht über das Vorjahresniveau (Vorjahr: 19.478 Stück) gehoben werden (+1 %).\n\nImage /page/141/Figure/4 description: The image contains two donut charts, each representing regional data for the year 2023. The chart on the left, titled \"ABSATZ NACH REGIONEN GJ 2023\", shows the distribution of sales across different regions. Europe accounts for 36.7%, North America (including Mexico) for 26.5%, India/Indonesia (via Bajaj) for 17.4%, and the rest of the world for 19.3%. The chart on the right, titled \"UMSATZ NACH REGIONEN GJ 2023\", displays the revenue distribution. Europe contributes 50.9%, North America (including Mexico) 31.2%, and the rest of the world 17.9%.\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\nIm Geschäftsjahr 2023 wurden am Produktionsstandort Mattighofen 217.160 und damit abermals mehr als 200.000 Motorräder produziert. Im Vergleich zum Vorjahr entspricht dies einem leichten Rückgang von -4.881 Stück bzw. -2,2 %. Unter Berücksichtigung der von unserem Partner Bajaj Auto Ltd. in Indien produzierten kleinmotorigen KTM- und Husqvarna-Modelle, der in Spanien produzierten GASGAS-Trials sowie der in China mit unserem Partner CFMOTO produzierten Modelle wurden weltweit 385.330 Motorräder (Vorjahr: 381.823) produziert.\n\n## **BICYCLES**\n\nAufgrund der weltweiten Überbestände im Fahrradbereich war auch die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe mit stark gefallenen Marktpreisen konfrontiert. Das Absatzwachstum in diesem Segment mit den Marken Husqvarna, R Raymon, GASGAS und FELT von rund 33 % war geprägt von Lagerbestandsbereinigungen und der Abgabe der Marke R Raymon. Im Geschäftsjahr 2023 wurden 157.358 Fahrräder (Vorjahr: 118.465) verkauft, davon 100.640 E-Bicycles (Vorjahr: 74.479). Im Fahrradbereich stellt die DACH-Region nach wie vor den größten Absatzmarkt mit rund 60% dar. Der Absatzanteil in der Fahrrad-Division in Nordamerika lag in 2023 bei 10 %.\n\nIm Geschäftsjahr 2023 konnte in der Fahrrad-Division ein Umsatz in Höhe von € 240,7 Mio. erzielt werden (Vorjahr: € 171,2 Mio.). Dies bedeutet ein Umsatzplus von 40,6 % im Jahresvergleich. Das EBITDA lag in 2023 bei € -41,8 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 6,5 Mio.) und das EBIT bei € -47,1 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 2,5 Mio.).\n\nVon den im Geschäftsjahr 2023 abgesetzten E-Bicycles wurden 69,9 % unter der Marke R Raymon, 20,7 % unter der Marke Husqvarna E-Bicycles sowie 7,6 % unter der Marke GASGAS verkauft. Die Absätze der Fahrräder ohne Elektroantrieb verteilen sich auf die beiden Marken R Raymon mit 60,0 % und FELT mit 37,8 % (im Vorjahr annähernd gleich).\n\nImage /page/142/Figure/6 description: The image shows a bar chart comparing the sales of E-Bicycles and Bicycles in 2022 and 2023. In 2022, E-Bicycles sales were 74.479, and Bicycles sales were 43.986, with a total of 118.465 (E-)Bicycles (Stück). In 2023, E-Bicycles sales were 100.640, and Bicycles sales were 56.718, with a total of 157.358 (E-)Bicycles (Stück).\n\nRund 87 % des Absatzes entfallen auf Europa und hier insbesondere auf die DACH-Region. Weitere 10 % betreffen die nordamerikanische Vertriebsregion und der restliche Absatz (rund 3 %) betrifft Asien, Südamerika und Australien.\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/143/Figure/1 description: The image contains two donut charts, each representing regional data for the year 2023. The chart on the left, titled \"ABSATZ NACH REGIONEN GJ 2023\", shows the distribution of sales across different regions. 60.1% of sales are attributed to the DACH region, 26.6% to the rest of Europe, and 13.4% to the rest of the world. The chart on the right, titled \"UMSATZ NACH REGIONEN GJ 2023\", displays the revenue distribution across regions. 71.8% of revenue comes from the DACH region, 17.4% from the rest of Europe, and 10.8% from the rest of the world.\n\n## **BILANZANALYSE**\n\nDie Bilanzstruktur der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe setzt sich wie folgt zusammen:\n\n|                             | 2022    |        | 2023    |        |  |\n|-----------------------------|---------|--------|---------|--------|--|\n|                             | Mio. €  | in %   | Mio. €  | in %   |  |\n| Langfristige Vermögenswerte | 1.195,8 | 46,9%  | 1.333,8 | 45,2%  |  |\n| Kurzfristige Vermögenswerte | 1.354,8 | 53,1%  | 1.619,1 | 54,8%  |  |\n| Vermögenswerte              | 2.550,6 | 100,0% | 2.952,9 | 100,0% |  |\n| Eigenkapital                | 914,4   | 35,8%  | 909,3   | 30,8%  |  |\n| Langfristige Schulden       | 625,6   | 24,5%  | 1.130,0 | 38,3%  |  |\n| Kurzfristige Schulden       | 1.010,6 | 39,6%  | 913,6   | 30,9%  |  |\n| Eigenkapital und Schulden   | 2.550,6 | 100,0% | 2.952,9 | 100,0% |  |\n\nDie Bilanzsumme der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe erhöhte sich gegenüber dem Konzernabschluss zum 31. Dezember 2022 von € 2.550,6 Mio. auf € 2.952,9 Mio. um 15,8 %.\n\nDie Erhöhung der langfristigen Vermögenswerte von € 1.195,8 Mio. auf € 1.333,8 Mio. liegt insbesondere analog zu den Vorjahren im Bereich von Entwicklungsprojekten, welche über den Abschreibungen liegen und zu einer Steigerung der immateriellen Vermögenswerte führten. Zudem stieg auch das Sachanlagevermögen insbesondere aufgrund von Investitionen in den Produktionsstandort von PIERER MAXCOM Mobility OOD in Bulgarien.\n\nInnerhalb der kurzfristigen Vermögenswerte erhöhten sich insbesondere die Vorräte um € 203,3 Mio. Die weiteren wesentlichen Veränderungen betreffen einerseits den Anstieg der Forderungen aus Lieferungen und Leistungen in Höhe von € 80,4 Mio. und andererseits die Reduktion der Zahlungsmittel in Höhe von € 19,8 Mio. Dies führte insgesamt zu einer Erhöhung der kurzfristigen Vermögenswerte um 19,5 % auf € 1.619,1 Mio.\n\nDie kurzfristigen Schulden reduzierten sich gegenüber dem 31. Dezember 2022 um € 97,0 Mio. (-9,6 %). Die Reduzierung ist größtenteils auf das Sinken der Verbindlichkeiten aus Lieferungen und Leistungen in Höhe von € -60,6 Mio. sowie Rückstellungen in Höhe von € -22,2 Mio. zurückzuführen. Die im Vorjahr eingestellte Rückstellung in Höhe von € 20,2 Mio., welche im Rahmen der Kooperationsvereinbarung mit MV Agusta gebildet wurde, wurde in 2023 vollständig verbraucht.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\nDie langfristigen Schulden erhöhten sich um 80,6 % auf € 1.130,0 Mio. Der Anstieg ist größtenteils auf die Erhöhung der Finanzverbindlichkeiten und hier insbesondere aus der Aufnahme eines Schuldscheindarlehens mit einem Volumen von € 300,0 Mio., einem Forschungsdarlehen der Europäischen Investitionsbank in Höhe von € 100,0 Mio. sowie einer Namensschuldverschreibung in Höhe von € 50 Mio. zurückzuführen.\n\nDas Eigenkapital verringerte sich im Geschäftsjahr 2023 um € 5,1 Mio. von € 914,4 Mio. auf € 909,3 Mio. Einerseits wurde durch das Ergebnis nach Steuern in Höhe von € 76,4 Mio. das Eigenkapital gestärkt. Andererseits führten Dividendenzahlungen in Höhe von € 68,1 Mio. zu einer Verringerung des Eigenkapitals. Die sonstigen Effekte in Höhe von € -13,4 Mio. betreffen im Wesentlichen die ergebnisneutrale Erfassung von Fremdwährungsdifferenzen, die Bewertung von Finanzinstrumenten sowie die Neubewertung der Nettoschuld aus leistungsorientierten Versorgungsplänen. Die Eigenkapitalquote liegt mit 30,8 % aufgrund der beschriebenen Bilanzerhöhung unter dem Wert per 31. Dezember 2023 von 35,8 %.\n\n## **LIQUIDITÄTSANALYSE**\n\nDer Cash-Flow aus dem operativen Bereich lag im Geschäftsjahr 2023 bei € -110,9 Mio. und damit deutlich unter dem Vorjahreswert von € 280,3 Mio., wofür insbesondere der Anstieg im Working Capital hauptverantwortlich war. Der Zahlungsmittelabfluss aus Investitionen betrug € -302,1 Mio. und liegt insgesamt über dem Vorjahreswert von € -283,1 Mio. Dieser Anstieg resultiert im Wesentlichen aufgrund der höheren Auszahlungen für den Erwerb von immateriellen Vermögenswerten und Sachanlagen (Effekt € -66,4 Mio.).\n\nWie schon erläutert, sind die Kosten für die Lagerbestände der Händler im Motorradbereich trotz guter Nachfrage durch deutlich erhöhte Zinsen stark angestiegen. Dies führte dazu, dass zur Stärkung der Händlerstruktur verlängerte Zahlungsziele und höhere Rabatte an die Händler gewährt werden mussten. Auf Grund der ausreichend vorhandenen Liquiditätsreserven konnte die PIERER Mobility AG neben ihren Händlern auch die Lieferanten entsprechend unterstützen, um auch deren finanzielle Situation zu stabilisieren und die durch das gestiegene Zinsniveau deutlich erhöhten Belastungen zu dämpfen. Die damit einhergehende negative Auswirkung auf den Free Cash-Flow, der sich im Jahr 2023 auf € -413,0 Mio. beläuft (Vorjahr: € -2,8 Mio.), wurde dadurch bewusst in Kauf genommen.\n\nNach Berücksichtigung des Cash-Flows aus Finanzierungsaktivitäten in Höhe von € 398,7 Mio. verringerten sich die liquiden Mittel im Vergleich zum 31. Dezember 2022 um € 19,8 Mio. (inklusive Fremdwährungseffekte von € -5,4 Mio.) auf € 259,0 Mio.\n\nDurch die starke Eigenkapitalbasis und die langfristigen Finanzierungen stehen ausreichende Liquiditätsreserven nachhaltig zur Verfügung.\n\n## **INVESTITIONEN**\n\nIm laufenden Geschäftsjahr wurden in der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe Gesamtinvestitionen in Höhe von € 316,5 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 293,4 Mio.) inklusive IFRS 16 Leasingzugänge in Höhe von € 32,5 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 25,9 Mio.) getätigt. Die Investitionen ohne Leasingprojekte verteilen sich auf Entwicklungsprojekte (inkl. Werkzeuge), Sachanlagen und immaterielle Vermögensgegenstände wie folgt:\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/145/Figure/1 description: The image shows a bar chart comparing investments in GJ 2022 and GJ 2023. In GJ 2022, the total investment is 267.5, broken down into 44.0, 62.1, and 161.4. In GJ 2023, the total investment is 284.0, broken down into 32.6, 56.3, and 195.1.\n\nIm abgelaufenen Geschäftsjahr wurden wie gewohnt hohe Investitionen in Serienentwicklungsprojekte (inkl. Werkzeuge) vorgenommen. Der Anteil an den Investitionen in Entwicklungsprojekte (inkl. Werkzeuge) zu den Gesamtinvestitionen betragen 69 % und liegen somit über dem Vorjahresniveau (Vorjahr: 60 %). Die nachhaltig hohen Investitionen in die Serienproduktentwicklung stellen einen der wesentlichen Erfolgsfaktoren der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe dar. Auch die Investitionen in die Infrastruktur (Sachanlagen) lagen mit 20 % leicht unter dem Vorjahresniveau von 23 %. Weitere 11 % (Vorjahr: 17 %) entfielen auf immaterielle Vermögensgegenstände (IT, Lizenzen).\n\nDie Investitionen der vergangenen Jahre haben die notwendigen Produktionskapazitäten für die kommenden Jahre gesichert. Der Fokus der Investitionen lag und liegt daher auf anderen Projektthemen, insbesondere auf der (Weiter-)Entwicklung bestehender und neuer Modelle, der Elektromobilität und der High-Tech-Modernisierung. Diese markieren für die PIERER Mobility Gruppe derzeit und auch in Zukunft die oberste Priorität der Investitionen. Im Einklang mit den strategischen Zielen werden die Ausgaben für Investitionen in Forschung und Entwicklung auf dem bereits hohen Niveau der vergangenen Jahre bleiben.\n\nEine der bedeutendsten Einzelinvestitionen im Geschäftsjahr 2022 war der Weiterbau und die Fertigstellung des neuen Headquarters von KTM North America in Murrieta, Kalifornien. Das Firmengelände wurde auf einer Fläche von ca. 14.000 m² errichtet und umfasst Büro- und Motorsportgebäude sowie Lagerflächen. Am 28. März 2023 fand die Eröffnungsfeier in Murrieta statt. Mit einem Gesamtinvestitionsvolumen von rund 55 Mio. USD stellt dies eine der größten Einzelinvestitionen in der Geschichte der PIERER Mobility Gruppe dar.\n\nWesentliche Investitionsprojekte in 2023 sind wie in den Vorjahren vor allem Entwicklungsprojekte und der Kauf von Werkzeugen und Anlagen.\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **4. VERWEIS AUF DEN NICHTFINANZIELLEN BERICHT**\n\nDie Gesellschaft erstellte für die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe einen konsolidierten nichtfinanziellen Bericht gemäß § 267a UGB für das Geschäftsjahr 2023, welcher Angaben zu Konzepten, nichtfinanziellen Risiken, Due Diligence Prozessen sowie Ergebnissen und Leistungsindikatoren hinsichtlich Umwelt-, Sozial- und Arbeitnehmerbelangen, der Achtung von Menschenrechten, sowie der Bekämpfung von Korruption und Bestechung, enthält. Dieser Bericht wurde vom Aufsichtsrat gemäß § 96 AktG geprüft und ist online verfügbar unter https://www.pierermobility.com/nachhaltigkeit/publikationen.\n\nDer Corporate Governance Bericht ist auf der Webseite der Gesellschaft verfügbar unter https://www.pierermobility.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance.\n\n## **5. FORSCHUNG & ENTWICKLUNG UND NEUE MODELLE**\n\nFür die PIERER Mobility AG als führender Hersteller von Premium Powered-Two-Wheelers (PTW)-Fahrzeugen in Europa ist es erklärtes Ziel, durch kontinuierliches Wachstum die Vorreiterrolle in Bezug auf Technologie, Vertrieb und Image in der Motorradwelt weiter auszubauen. Der Bereich Forschung- und Entwicklung steht daher seit Jahren besonders im Fokus. Als Resultat der verfolgten F&E-Strategie entstehen innovative Produkte, die den hohen Kundenerwartungen hinsichtlich Technologie und Performance gerecht werden. Gleichzeitig ermöglicht dies, nachhaltig neue Märkte zu erschließen.\n\nBesonders hohe Priorität wird dabei der frühzeitigen Erkennung von Trends im Powered Two-Wheeler (PTW)- Segment und der Weiterentwicklung des Produktportfolios in technischer und funktioneller Sicht beigemessen. Gleichzeitig wird hohes Engagement zur Verfolgung, Erkennung und Umsetzung der Kundenanforderungen an die Produkte und Dienstleistungen der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe aufgebracht, um die in der Vergangenheit erarbeitete Vorreiterrolle weiter auszubauen und eine marktnahe Produktentwicklungsstrategie gewährleisten zu können.\n\nDank der global agierenden Forschungs- und Entwicklungsorganisation verfügt die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe über ein Netzwerk an hoch qualifizierten Mitarbeitern etwa im Bereich Konstruktion, Berechnung und Simulation. Dieses Netzwerk wird durch den betriebsinternen Maschinen- und Anlagenpark, der für Produktion, Aufbau und Validierung neu entwickelter Prototypen verantwortlich ist, unterstützt. Diese Kombination ermöglicht es, mit hoher Flexibilität auf sich ändernde Anforderungen und die damit einhergehende Komplexität zu reagieren.\n\nZum Stichtag 31.12.2023 beschäftigte das Unternehmen 1.302 Mitarbeiter (Vorjahr: 976), das entspricht 21,1 % der gesamten Belegschaft. Operativ, ohne Nebeneffekt aus der Aktivierung und Abschreibung von Entwicklungsaufwendungen, wurden 9,2 % des Gesamtumsatzes für den Bereich Forschung und Entwicklung aufgewendet, dies entspricht in absoluten Werten € 244,4 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 213,2 Mio.).\n\nDer Forschungs- und Entwicklungsbereich der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe, gebündelt in der **KTM Forschungsund Entwicklungs GmbH** (KTM F&E GmbH), ist mit dezentralen Standorten in Europa (insbesondere Österreich und Spanien) sowie Amerika global organisiert. Die zentrale Steuerung der Entwicklungsprogramme erfolgt im F&E-Hauptquartier in Mattighofen sowie in Munderfing, wo ein Großteil der Mitarbeiter aus dem Forschungs- und Entwicklungsbereich angesiedelt ist. Das Forschungs- und Entwicklungszentrum am Hauptsitz in Mattighofen ist ein Innovationsstandort mit einer Nutzfläche von über 20.000 m². Hier werden richtungsweisende Produkte für das Powersport-Segment konzipiert, entwickelt und mit modernsten Mitteln erprobt.\n\nDie **KTM Technologies** GmbH mit Sitz in Anif bei Salzburg, ist organisatorisch Teil der KTM F&E GmbH und gilt als Spezialist für die Mobilität der Zukunft, insbesondere in den Bereichen Konzept-, Technologieentwicklung und \n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\nLeichtbau. Erfolgsfaktor ist die anwendungsorientierte Entwicklung neuer Lösungen und Technologien. Sehr hohe Expertise besteht im Bereich der Entwicklung von Fahrzeugkonzepten, unter anderem durch den Einsatz von Multimaterial, Composite und additiven Fertigungstechnologien. Die KTM Technologies GmbH arbeitet als Innovations-Hub eng mit der KTM F&E GmbH und Kunden aus anderen Industriezweigen zusammen. Zum Kreis von Partnern und Kunden gehören etablierte OEMs und Start-Ups aus Branchen wie Automobil und Luftfahrt, Maschinenbau und der Sportartikelindustrie. Durch das branchenübergreifende Leistungsportfolio profitieren sowohl die Unternehmensgruppe als auch Drittkunden von einem breiten Know-how-Spektrum und den Möglichkeiten des Technologietransfers.\n\nMit der Markteinführung der KTM Freeride E im Jahr 2014 gilt die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe als Pionier auf dem Gebiet der Elektromobilität. In den letzten Jahren wurde das Spektrum an elektrifizierten Fahrzeugen verschiedener Leistungskategorien auf alle Konzernmarken ausgedehnt. Die Entwicklung elektrifizierter Motorradmodelle erfolgt zum überwiegenden Teil in dem hauseigenen Kompetenzzentrum in Anif bei Salzburg.\n\nDa elektrifizierte Antriebssysteme zum gegenwärtigen Zeitpunkt aufgrund ihrer geringen Leistungsdichte mit weitreichenden Einschränkungen hinsichtlich der Nutzbarkeit eines Motorrads einhergehen, zählt insbesondere die Reduktion der Abgas- und Lärmemissionen im Bereich des Verbrennungsmotorenportfolios der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe zu den wesentlichen Arbeitspaketen des abgelaufenen Forschungsjahres. Um die oberen Fahrzeugsegmente mit höheren Leistungs- und Reichweitenanforderungen weiterhin dynamisch betreiben zu können, wurde beispielsweise die Untersuchung zukunftsfähiger synthetischer Kraftstoffe, sogenannter E-Fuels, und die Erprobung von Kraftstoffen mit erhöhtem Bioethanol-Anteil intensiv vorangetrieben.\n\nDas Lärmemissionsverhalten von Motorrädern hat sich in den vergangenen Jahren zu einem bedeutenden Akzeptanzkriterium für diese Fahrzeugkategorie entwickelt. Da es für Offroad-Sportmotorräder noch keine einheitlichen Homologationsstandards vorgegeben sind, wurde im Geschäftsjahr 2023 die Erforschung der Geräuschquellen dieser Modelle und davon abgeleiteten Lösungsansätzen zur signifikanten Reduktion von Lärmemissionen fortgesetzt.\n\nHinsichtlich der Abgasemission wurde mit der Entwicklung einer neuen Powerpackgeneration (Leistungsklasse 110-170 kW) für das Modelljahr 2029 gestartet. Projektziel ist es, den CO2-Verbrauch im WMTC-Zyklus im Vergleich zum Vorgängermodell um 20-35 % zu reduzieren. Für den Serieneinsatz der neuen Power-Packs soll eine Top-Down-Strategie erarbeitet werden. Im ersten Schritt ist es geplant, ab dem Jahr 2029 die Premiummodelle mit diesem Antriebsstrang auszustatten. In späteren Modelljahren soll diese Powerpackgeneration auch in weiteren Segmenten zum Einsatz kommen.\n\nDie **KTM F&E GmbH** engagiert sich weiterhin als Gründungsmitglied des Swappable Batteries Motorcycle Consortium (SBMC). Ziel ist es, durch internationale Standardisierung des Batteriesystems die Kundenerwartungen hinsichtlich Reichweite, Ladezeit und Kosten zu erfüllen und so einen wichtigen Beitrag zur weiteren Verbreitung elektrifizierter Mobilitätskonzepte in urbanen Lebensbereichen zu leisten. Während sich die Aktivitäten im Jahr 2022 hauptsächlich auf die Definition einheitlicher technischer Spezifikationen für das Batteriesystem innerhalb der Mitgliederbasis konzentrierten, umfassten die Aktivitäten im Jahr 2023 die Entwicklung von Batterieprototypen durch ausgewählte Lieferanten. Das Hauptziel der ersten Phase des Prototyping ist die Validierung und Verfeinerung der Spezifikationen.\n\nDie Virtualisierung der Produktentwicklung ist ein wichtiger Baustein zur Reduktion von Entwicklungszeiten, kosten und Qualitätsrisiken. Letztlich ist die physische Freiprüfung von Komponenten und Gesamtfahrzeugen auf entsprechenden Prüfständen ein unerlässlicher Baustein in der Erprobung von Neuprodukten. Hierzu wird am Standort Anif eine Prüffläche im Ausmaß von 300 m² betrieben, um entwicklungsbegleitend die Qualitätssicherung der Produkte gewährleisten zu können.\n\nDie 2022 gestartet Initiative zur modularen Elektronikplattform wurde 2023 fortgesetzt und konnte bereits in erste Fahrzeuge wie beispielsweise die 1390 SUPER DUKE R für den Markt eingeführt werden. Ziel dieser modularen Plattform sind standardisierte Schnittstellen, um so einen schnellen Austausch von Komponenten gewährleisten zu können.\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\nKonnektivität-Funktionen, die einen Datenaustausch zwischen Fahrzeug und Zubehör wie etwa Smartphones ermöglichen, wurden in den letzten Jahren intensiv weiterentwickelt und zählen insbesondere im Premiumsegment zu unverzichtbaren Ausstattungsmerkmalen. Neben der Entwicklung von Komfortfunktionen wie Telefonie und Navigation stellen insbesondere die Entwicklung und Erprobung von Kommunikationssystemen zwischen dem Motorrad und anderen Fahrzeugen bzw. zwischen dem Motorrad und (Verkehrs-)Infrastruktur, wie etwa Ampelanlagen, einen zentralen Bestandteil der Aktivitäten des Berichtsjahres dar. Darüber hinaus wurde auch an der Nutzung von (Fahrzeug-)Daten geforscht – vor allem im Kontext der Produktentwicklung. So ist unter anderem mit der Beschaffung, Herstellung und Instandhaltung von physischen Prototypen ein erheblicher Ressourcenaufwand verbunden. Durch Einführung virtueller Entwicklungsmethoden kann der Aufwand für die Erprobung physischer Bauteile und Baugruppen bis hin zum Gesamtfahrzeug erheblich reduziert und gleichzeitig eine Verbesserung des späteren Produktes erzielt werden. Diese virtuellen Ansätze können etwa bei der Digitalisierung in der Leuchtkörperentwicklung angewandt werden.\n\nDer Einsatz hochwertiger Materialien in allen Fahrzeugen, die darin begründete Reduktion des Fahrzeuggewichts und das damit einhergehende Potential zur **Verbrauchs- und Emissionsreduktion** sowie Verbesserung der Fahrbarkeit sind eine weitere Säule der verfolgten Entwicklungsphilosophie. Durch die intensiven Bemühungen der letzten Jahre konnte etwa das Gewicht unserer Offroad-Competition-Modelle mit jeder Generation weiter reduziert werden. Stellvertretend für eine Vielzahl an Forschungs- und Entwicklungsprojekten im Bereich der Material- und Oberflächenentwicklung wurde an der Entwicklung und Erprobung von Rädern und Fahrwerkskomponenten aus Faserverbundwerkstoffen sowie an der Weiterentwicklung des Fertigungsprozesses von Kunststoffteilen mit Designelementen in Hybridbauweise gearbeitet.\n\n#### **MODELLE MOTORRÄDER**\n\nDas Geschäftsjahr 2023 stand ganz im Zeichen einer großen Modelloffensive mit insgesamt 72 neuen und überarbeiteten Modellen der drei Kernmarken KTM, Husqvarna und GASGAS.\n\nNach dem Erfolg im Jahr 2021 kehrte die **KTM 1290 SUPER DUKE RR** im ersten Quartal 2023 als limitiertes Sondermodell zurück. Bereits im Jahr 2022 wurde die Partnerschaft zwischen KTM und BRABUS mit der Präsentation der BRABUS 1300 R besiegelt, um BRABUS den Einstieg in die Welt des Motorradsports zu ermöglichen. Diese Kooperation wurde mit der Einführung der **BRABUS 1300 R Masterpiece Edition** fortgeführt.\n\nDie **KTM-Enduro-Palette** des Modelljahres 2024 ist der Beweis vieler Jahre an der Spitze des Enduro-Motorsports und bildet eine dynamische Kombination aus Rennsportleistung, Ergonomie sowie führender Technologie in der Branche. Die neue Modellgeneration präsentiert sich in einem brandneuen Look und mit einem neuen Rahmenkonzept, überarbeiteten Motoren mit der neuen Drosselklappenkörper Einspritzung bei Zwei-Takt-Motoren und einer neuen Generation WP Fahrwerkselementen ermöglicht es ein besseres Fahrgefühl sowie höheren Komfort für Fahrer jeden Alters und aller Fähigkeitsstufen.\n\nMit der **890 SMT** 2023 feierte KTM die Wiedergeburt einer Ikone. Das Motorrad mit der überarbeiteten LC8c Plattform wurde entwickelt, um in Sachen Leistung, Drehmoment und Gewicht die Spitzenposition im Supermoto-Touring-Segment zu erreichen. Dieses Modell ist zwischen den KTM ADVENTURE- und KTM Street-Produktreihen platziert.\n\nIm zweiten Halbjahr wurde weiters eine neue, Euro5+ konforme Generation der **DUKE-Modellreihe** präsentiert mit neuen **125, 250, 390, 990 und 1390** Modellen. Die neue LC4c Plattform (125 & 390 DUKE) bietet ein segmentführendes Leistungs-/Gewichtsverhältnis und elektronische Assistenzsysteme mit zwei-Kanal ABS sowie schräglagenabhängige Traktionskontrolle. Die neue 990 DUKE basiert auf einer neuen Generation des LC8c Motors mit 123 PS und 103 Nm Drehmoment sowie einer neu entwickelten Elektronikplattform mit modernsten Assistenzsystemen und einem LED Projektor Scheinwerfer mit Daytime Running Light für eine unverkennbare DUKE-Signatur. Auch die neue 1390 SUPER DUKE R basiert auf einem weiterentwickelten LC8 Motor mit neuer Camshift Technologie, welcher eine weitere Leistungssteigerung auf 190 PS & 145 Nm Drehmoment bei gleichbleibendem Fahrzeuggewicht ermöglichte. Darüber hinaus erhielt die **1390 SUPER DUKE R EVO** ein überarbeitetes WP APEX Fahrwerk mit semiaktiver Technologie, welches die elektronische Einstellung des\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\nFahrwerks, eine verbesserte Performance bei gleichbleibend hohem Fahrkomfort und mehr Einstellungsmöglichkeiten ermöglicht.\n\n**Husqvarna Motorcycles** präsentierte im März 2023 die **Norden 901 Expedition**, ein mit zahlreichen Komfortfunktionen ausgestattetes und leistungsstarkes Reisemotorrad, ausgerichtet für den Einsatz sowohl auf der Straße als auch im Gelände. Im letzten Quartal 2023 wurde zudem der Skutta, ein E-Scooter für urbane Ballungsräume, vorgestellt und ist nur der erste Schritt einer großen Husqvarna Modelloffensive im Street Segment für 2024.\n\nIn der Enduro Modellreihe für das Modelljahr 2024 präsentierte Husqvarna Motorcycles neun komplett neugestaltete Maschinen mit neuester Technologie und weiterentwickelter Elektronik, um auch weiterhin im Offroad-Bereich neue Standards zu setzen. Ein vielfältiges Angebot an technischem Zubehör und Bekleidung vervollständigte die Markteinführung der aktuellen Zwei- und Vier-Takt-Modelle. Die neuen **TE 300 Pro & FE 350 Pro Sondermodelle** sind mit zusätzlichem technischem Zubehör für Hard Enduro Competitions spezifiziert und bilden damit die perfekte Basis für wettbewerbsorientierte Kunden.\n\nIm letzten Quartal folgten darüber hinaus eine neue Generation der beliebten **50cc & 65cc Sportminicycles** mit neuem Look, neuen Rahmen und überarbeiteten Motoren für Offroad Wettbewerbe im Jugendbereich.\n\n**GASGAS** präsentierte ebenfalls eine neue Generation der Motocross, Enduro und Cross Country Modellpalette 2024 mit gleich 16 Dirtbikes auf Basis der aktuellen Offroadplattform und ergänzte dies durch innovative und batterieelektrisch betriebene Produkte in Form der **MC-E 1.12, MC-E 1.16 und MC-E 1.20**. Diese, speziell für Kinder ab drei Jahren konzipierten Electric-Balance-Bikes, ermöglichen das spielerische Erlernen im sicheren Umgang mit Zweiradfahrzeugen und sind mit einem Akku-Schnellwechselsystem ausgestattet, um ein beinahe unterbrechungsloses Fahren zu gewährleisten. Die drei neuen Modelle sind auch für die Marken KTM und Husqvarna Motorcycles erhältlich.\n\nDie Serienüberleitung im Bereich **elektrisch angetriebener Motorradmodelle** wird durch die markenübergreifend angebotenen KTM SX-E 2, Husqvarna EE 2- und GASGAS MC-E 2 ModelleKTM SX E3-, HUSQVARNA EE3- und GASGAS MC E-3-Modelle abgerundet.\n\n### **MODELLE FAHRRÄDER**\n\nIn der ersten Jahreshälfte 2023 gab es auch in der Fahrradsparte eine Reihe an neu gestalteten Produkten und eine Vielzahl an technischen Erneuerungen. **Husqvarna E-Bicycles** setzt auf innovative Elektromobilitätslösungen und öffnet sich dadurch vielversprechende neue Märkte weltweit. Das im Jahr 2022 präsentierte Mountain Cross 6 (MC6) dient als Vorlage für zukünftige Produktinnovationen und stärkt die Position von Husqvarna E-Bicycles im **e-MTB-Sektor**. Das neue **Light Cross 6 (LC6)** erweitert die Modellpalette im Offroad-Segment. Spezifische PG&A-Artikel und mehrere neue Produktlinien runden das Urban Range- und Allroad-Modellsegment ab. Im Oktober 2023 wurden die neuen MY24 Husqvarna E-MTBs präsentiert.\n\n**GASGAS E-Bicycles** baut auf dem Erfolg der Marke GASGAS im Motorradsegment auf. Mit den leistungsstarken E-MTBs für Offroad-Strecken konnte die Marke nach einem erfolgreichen Geschäftsjahr 2022 ihre Reichweite auch im ersten Quartal 2023 weltweit ausbauen. Die Erfahrungen aus dem Offroad-Motorsport sowie das Wissen über Technologien und Materialien werden bei der Entwicklung neuer elektrifizierter New Mobility Produkte eine noch größere Rolle spielen. Der neue GASGAS **ECC Race-Prototyp** wurde auf dem Sea Otter Festival in Monterey, Kalifornien gezeigt. Ein E-Mountainbike, das weitere neue Spezifikationen und Komponenten verbirgt.\n\nIm Juni 2023 stellte PIERER New Mobility auf der EUROBIKE in Frankfurt weitere neue Modelle sowie Produktentwicklungen im Bereich Fahrrad und New Mobility aus. Neben einem neuen Modell der **Grand City-Reihe** für die Stadt- und Allroad-Mobilität von Husqvarna E-Bicycles enthüllte GASGAS Bicycles den **MOTO Urban Cruiser**, einen in Supermoto-Ästhetik designten Beach-Cruiser.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **6. CHANCEN- UND RISIKOBERICHT**\n\nDie Geschäftstätigkeit der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe ist von laufenden Veränderungen geprägt. Die Nutzung der sich durch diese Veränderungen ergebenden Chancen ist der wesentliche Grundstein des Erfolges der PIERER Mobility- Gruppe. Zur Sicherung des zukünftigen unternehmerischen Erfolgs und Nutzung der sich ergebenden Chancen muss die Gruppe bewusst Risiken eingehen.\n\nDas Management von Chancen und Risiken ist die Basis, um auf Änderungen politischer, wirtschaftlicher, technischer oder rechtlicher Rahmenbedingungen adäquat zu reagieren. Sofern es wahrscheinlich ist, dass die identifizierten Chancen beziehungsweise Risiken eintreten, sind sie bereits in den Aussagen im Konzernanhang und -lagebericht verarbeitet. Die nachfolgenden Ausführungen beinhalten mögliche künftige Entwicklungen oder Ereignisse, die zu einer für die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe positiven (Chancen) beziehungsweise negativen (Risiken) Abweichung von der Unternehmensprognose führen können.\n\nIm Rahmen des Risikomanagements werden alle Einzel- und kumulierten Risiken, die den Erfolg des Unternehmens gefährden könnten, überwacht und gesteuert. Bestandsgefährdende Risiken werden grundsätzlich vermieden. Der Risikokonsolidierungskreis entspricht dem Konsolidierungskreis des Konzernabschlusses der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe.\n\n## **RISIKOMANAGEMENTSYSTEM**\n\nDer Hauptzweck des Risikomanagements der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe besteht in der Sicherung und Stärkung des Unternehmens durch eine richtige und transparente Einschätzung der finanziellen, operativen und strategischen Risiken. Der Vorstand übernimmt dabei gemeinsam mit dem Management der wesentlichen Konzerngesellschaften, insbesondere der KTM AG, umfangreiche Steuerungs- und Controlling-Aufgaben im Rahmen eines internen, alle wesentlichen Standorte umfassenden, integrierten Kontrollsystems. Das rechtzeitige Erkennen, Evaluieren und Reagieren auf strategische und operative Risiken ist ein wesentlicher Bestandteil der Führungstätigkeit dieser Einheiten und leistet einen wesentlichen Wertbeitrag für das Unternehmen. Grundlagen dafür sind ein einheitliches und konzernweites, regelmäßiges Berichtswesen und eine laufende Überwachung der operativen und strategischen Pläne.\n\nDie PIERER Mobility-Gruppe verfügt über ein mehrstufiges Risikomanagementsystem, bei dem die konzernweiten Risiken nach Fachbereichen bzw., geografischen Bereichen erhoben werden. Die operative Verantwortung und die Bewertung der konzernweiten Risiken erfolgt durch das Risikomanagement der KTM AG und dem lokalen Management und wird direkt an den Vorstand berichtet und von diesem sowie vom Konzernvorstand überwacht.\n\nEine präventive Analyse von potenziellen Ereignissen ist ebenso Ziel des Risikomanagements. Zusätzlich ist es auch Aufgabe des Risikomanagements, Risiken aktiv zu steuern und entsprechende Maßnahmen mit den betroffenen Unternehmensbereichen zu definieren und evaluieren.\n\n### **RISIKOMANAGEMENTSTRATEGIE**\n\nDie PIERER Mobility-Gruppe orientiert sich im Rahmen Ihrer Risikomanagementstrategie am COSO® Framework. Demgemäß hat der Konzern folgende Kernbereiche der Risikomanagementstrategie definiert:\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/151/Figure/1 description: The image shows a diagram of a risk management process. The diagram is divided into four sections, each representing a stage in the process. The first section is titled \"Risiko Identifikation\" and includes the following bullet points: \"Strukturierte Erfassung von Chancen und Einzelrisiken in den Bereichen\", \"Durchführung von Risikoworkshops\", and \"Identifikation erfolgt u. a. durch den Standard-Risikokatalog\". The second section is titled \"Risiko Bewertung\" and includes the following bullet points: \"Failure Mode und Effekt Analyse\" and \"Schadensausmaß und Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeit\". The third section is titled \"Risiko Steuerung\" and includes the following bullet points: \"Steuerung der Gesamtrisikoposition durch Beeinflussung von Chancen und Einzelrisiken\" and \"Kontrolle der Wirksamkeit von Maßnahmen\". The fourth section is titled \"Berichtswesen + Überwachung\" and includes the following bullet points: \"Kontinuierliche Überwachung\", \"Erfassung, Auswertung, Weiterleitung von Informationen\", and \"Berichterstattung\".\n\nDas auf Ebene der KTM AG eingerichtete Risikomanagement führt regelmäßig Risikoanalysen durch. Es werden nur Risiken abweichend von der Konzern-Bilanz und der Konzern-GuV dargestellt.\n\n### **ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT PROZESS**\n\nDas Enterprise Risikomanagement der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe umfasst einen kontinuierlichen Prozess, welcher die Identifikation und Bewertung, Analyse und Reporting, Maßnahmendefinition sowie -nachverfolgung der gruppenweiten sowohl operativen als auch strategischen Risiken und Chancen sicherstellt. Dieser bildet die Basis für ein einheitliches und konzernweites Berichtswesen und stellt eine laufende Überwachung der operativen und strategischen Risiken sicher.\n\nDie Unternehmensgruppe verfügt über einen mehrstufigen Risikomanagementprozess, bei dem die konzernweiten Risiken nach Bereichen erhoben werden. Die Sicherstellung der Durchführung und der Aktualität der Informationen obliegt der Risikomanagement-Abteilung. Die Informationen über die Risikolage werden durch die Risk Owner der Fachbereiche zur Verfügung gestellt. Die Risikomanagement-Abteilung berichtet direkt an den Vorstand der KTM AG, diesem sowie dem Konzernvorstand wird zur Überwachung ein regelmäßiger Report über die Gesamtrisikolage zur Verfügung gestellt.\n\nKlimabezogene Risiken und Chancen werden in den folgenden Prozessschritten gleichermaßen betrachtet und berücksichtigt:\n\n### **Identifikation & Bewertung**\n\nDie Identifikation der Risiken und Chancen findet im Zuge der Risiko Assessments, gesteuert auf Ebene der KTM AG, statt. In diesen werden klimabezogene Risiken und Chancen gleichermaßen wie auch finanzielle, operative oder strategische Risiken mit den betroffenen Risk Ownern der Fachbereiche diskutiert und identifiziert.\n\nZiel der Risikobewertung ist die kontinuierliche, qualitative und quantitative Bewertung aller identifizierten Chancen und Risiken zur Priorisierung von Risikosteuerungsmaßnahmen. Die Chancen- und Risikobewertung bei der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe soll folgenden Anforderungen entsprechen:\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Objektivität: Die Bewertung soll nach möglichst objektiven Maßstäben erfolgen.\n- Vergleichbarkeit: Damit die Chancen und Risiken miteinander verglichen werden können, erfolgt eine quantitative Bewertung anhand einheitlich definierter Werte (sofern sinnvoll und möglich)\n\nGrundsätzlich erfolgt die Bewertung der Risiken und Chancen hinsichtlich Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeit und Schadensausmaß, für die Vermögens-, Finanz- und Ertragslage des Konzerns, in einem szenariobasierten Ansatz bestehend aus Best Case (BC), Realistic Case (RC) und Worst Case (WC). Die Quantifizierung kann dabei auf (a) tatsächlich in der Vergangenheit eingetretenen Risiken, (b) Benchmark-Werten aus der Branche oder (c) Expertenschätzungen basieren. Die Wahl der jeweiligen Verteilung ist abhängig von der Art des Risikos, in den meisten Fällen entspricht diese aber einer Pert-Verteilung. Neben der quantitativen Bewertung der Risiken und Chancen kann gemäß Methodik zusätzlich auch eine qualitative Bewertung stattfinden, welche gerade im Bereich klima- und umweltbezogener Risiken und Chancen nützlich ist.\n\n### **RISIKOBEWERTUNG**\n\n### **Analyse & Reporting**\n\nNach strukturierter Konsolidierung des Gesamt-Risiko-Inventars erfolgt eine Monte Carlo Simulation, daraus ergibt sich die Gesamtrisikolage sowie die benötigten Kennzahlen. Darüber hinaus werden die größten Risiken und Chancen der Gruppe identifiziert und vervollständigen das Lagebild. Darin sind selbstverständlich auch die wesentlichen klimabezogenen Risiken und Chancen enthalten.\n\n#### **Maßnahmendefinition & -nachverfolgung**\n\n Hauptziel der Risikomitigation ist die aktive, kontinuierliche und kontrollierte Beeinflussung der Risiken und Chancen unter Berücksichtigung der Unternehmensstrategie und der Wirtschaftlichkeit, um den Gesamtrisikoumfang des Unternehmens bewusst zu lenken, und somit langfristig eine Steigerung des Unternehmenswertes zu erreichen. Risiken werden durch entsprechende Maßnahmen minimiert, vermieden oder auch in bestimmten Fällen bewusst eingegangen, die Strategie wird vom jeweiligen Risk Owner festgelegt und evaluiert. Dabei wird die Risikomanagement- Abteilung regelmäßig über den Status der Maßnahmen informiert. In Zusammenarbeit mit der ESG-Abteilung erfolgt die Maßnahmen- sowie Zieldefinition der klimabezogenen Risiken und Chancen.\n\n### **Ad-hoc Berichterstattung**\n\nBei Ad-hoc Änderungen der Risikolage ist die Risikomanagement- Abteilung unverzüglich von den Risk Ownern der Fachabteilungen zu unterrichten und informiert zu halten.\n\nDarauf aufbauend wird die Risiko- und Chancenmanagement Strategie erarbeitet.\n\n#### **Risikoüberwachung /-kontrolle**\n\nKernpunkt des operativen Risikomanagements ist die Identifizierung, Evaluierung und Beherrschung von wesentlichen Risiken aus dem operativen Geschäft. Dieser Prozess wird insbesondere von den oberen und mittleren Managementebenen der KTM AG durchgeführt und vom Vorstand der PIERER Mobility AG überwacht.\n\n## **CHANCEN- UND RISIKOBERICHT**\n\nDie folgende Übersicht dient dem Gesamtüberblick über die wesentlichen identifizierten Risiken und Chancen und zeigt damit deren Bedeutung für die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe auf sowie die zugehörigen Maßnahmenpakete. Gesamthaft hat die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe weder zum Bilanzstichtag noch zum Zeitpunkt der Aufstellung des Abschlusses bestandsgefährdende Risiken identifiziert.\n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Risiken/ Chancen                              | Beschreibung

**7. ANGABEN GEMÄß § 243A (ABS 1) UGB**\n\n- 1. Das Grundkapital beträgt EUR 33.796.535. Es ist zerlegt in 33.796.535 Stück auf Inhaber lautende, Stückaktien mit Stimmrecht, wobei jede Stammaktie am Grundkapital in gleichem Umfang beteiligt ist. Die Aktien gewähren die gewöhnlichen nach dem österreichischen Aktiengesetz den Aktionären zustehenden Rechte. Dazu zählt das Recht auf die Auszahlung der in der Hauptversammlung beschlossenen Dividende sowie das Recht auf Ausübung des Stimmrechtes in der Hauptversammlung. Sämtliche Aktien der PIERER Mobility AG sind seit dem 14. November 2016 an der SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX) im International Reporting Standard hauptkotiert (ISIN AT0000KTMI02). Seit dem 1. März 2022 sind die Aktien der PIERER Mobility AG zusätzlich an der Wiener Börse (Amtlicher Handel) gelistet. Im Geschäftsjahr 2023 kam es zu keiner Änderung im Grundkapital der Gesellschaft. Ebenso wenig wurden eigene Aktien erworben oder veräußert, weshalb die Gesellschaft zum Stichtag 31. Dezember 2023 keine eigenen Aktien hielt.\n- 2. Zwischen der Pierer Konzerngesellschaft mbH, der Pierer Industrie AG und der Pierer Bajaj AG einerseits (die \"Pierer- Gruppe\") und der Bajaj Auto Ltd. und Bajaj Auto International Holdings B.V. andererseits (die \"Bajaj-Gruppe\") besteht seit 29. September 2021 ein Syndikatsvertrag (der \"Syndikatsvertrag 2021\"), der die Rechte und Pflichten der beiden Unternehmensgruppen in Bezug auf die Beteiligung der Pierer Industrie AG und der Bajaj Auto International Holdings B.V. an der Pierer Bajaj AG als Mehrheitsaktionärin der PIERER Mobility AG regelt. Der Syndikatsvertrag 2021 sieht vor, dass die Geschäftsordnung für den Vorstand und den Aufsichtsrat der Pierer Bajaj AG im Falle einer Übertragung des Eigentums von Aktien der PIERER Mobility AG der Zustimmung der von Bajaj nominierten Aufsichtsratsmitglieder der Pierer Bajaj AG bedarf. Die Pierer Bajaj AG, die wirtschaftlich Herrn DI Stefan Pierer zuzurechnen ist, unterliegt angesichts des Syndikatsvertrags auf der Ebene der Pierer Bajaj AG somit Veräußerungsbeschränkungen. Dem Vorstand sind keine weiteren Beschränkungen bekannt, die Stimmrechte oder die Übertragung von Aktien betreffen.\n- 3. Nach Kenntnis der Gesellschaft bestand per 31. Dezember 2023 folgende direkte oder indirekte Beteiligung am Kapital der PIERER Mobility AG, die zumindest 10 von Hundert betragen:\n\t- Pierer Bajaj AG: 74,18 % (direkte Beteiligung);\n\t- Pierer Konzerngesellschaft mbH (direkte und indirekte Beteiligung): 0,09 % (direkte Beteiligung) und 74,18 % (indirekte Beteiligung).\n- 4. Es gibt keine Aktien mit besonderen Kontrollrechten.\n\n- 5. Es bestehen derzeit keine Mitarbeiterbeteiligungsmodelle.\n- 6. Es bestehen keine über das Gesetz hinausgehenden Bestimmungen hinsichtlich der Ernennung und Abberufung der Mitglieder des Vorstandes und des Aufsichtsrates und über die Änderung der Satzung.\n- 7. Möglichkeiten, Aktien auszugeben oder zurückzukaufen:\n\n Berücksichtigt werden nur Möglichkeiten Aktien auszugeben oder zurückzukaufen, die zum Stichtag 31. Dezember 2023 noch aufrecht waren:\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\n Aufgrund der von der Hauptversammlung vom 29. April 2022 erteilten Ermächtigung und gleichzeitig beschlossenen Satzungsänderung enthält die Satzung der Gesellschaft als § 5 \"Genehmigtes Kapital\" folgende Bestimmung:\n\n- a) Der Vorstand ist gemäß § 169 AktG ermächtigt, bis 29.04.2027 mit Zustimmung des Aufsichtsrates das Grundkapital der Gesellschaft von EUR 33.796.535,00, allenfalls in mehreren Tranchen, gegen Barund/oder Sacheinlagen um bis zu EUR 16.898.267,00 durch Ausgabe von bis zu 16.898.267 Stück auf Inhaber lautende nennbetragslose Stückaktien auf bis zu EUR 50.694.802,00 zu erhöhen und den Ausgabebetrag sowie die Ausgabebedingungen und die weiteren Einzelheiten der Durchführung der Kapitalerhöhung im Einvernehmen mit dem Aufsichtsrat festzusetzen sowie allenfalls die neuen Aktien im Wege des mittelbaren Bezugsrechts gemäß § 153 Abs 6 AktG den Aktionären zum Bezug anzubieten.\n- b) Der Vorstand wird ermächtigt, mit Zustimmung des Aufsichtsrates das Bezugsrecht der Aktionäre ganz oder teilweise auszuschließen,\n\t- (i) wenn die Kapitalerhöhung gegen Bareinlagen erfolgt und in Summe der rechnerisch auf die gegen Bareinlagen unter Ausschluss des Bezugsrechts ausgegebenen Aktien entfallende Anteil am Grundkapital der Gesellschaft die Grenze von 10 % des Grundkapitals der Gesellschaft zum Zeitpunkt der Einräumung nicht übersteigt,\n\t- (ii) wenn die Kapitalerhöhung gegen Sacheinlagen erfolgt,\n\t- (iii) zur Bedienung einer Mehrzuteilungsoption (Greenshoe), und / oder\n\t- (iv) für den Ausgleich von Spitzenbeträgen.\n- c) Der Aufsichtsrat ist ermächtigt, Änderungen der Satzung, die sich durch die Ausgabe von Aktien aus dem genehmigten Kapital ergeben, zu beschließen.\n\nAufgrund des von der Hauptversammlung vom 21. April 2023 geschaffenen bedingten Kapitals und der dazu beschlossenen Satzungsänderung enthält die Satzung der Gesellschaft als § 5a \"Bedingtes Kapital\" folgende Bestimmung:\n\nDas Grundkapital der Gesellschaft wird gemäß § 159 Abs 2 Z 1 AktG um bis zu EUR 4.375.000.000,00 durch Ausgabe von bis zu 4.375.000 auf Inhaber lautende Stammaktien ohne Nennwert (Stückaktien) zur Ausgabe an Gläubiger von Finanzinstrumenten gemäß § 174 AktG im Sinne des Hauptversammlungsbeschlusses vom 21.04.2023, die unter Ausnutzung der in dieser Hauptversammlung eingeräumten Ermächtigung von der Gesellschaft ausgegeben werden, erhöht. Die Kapitalerhöhung darf nur soweit durchgeführt werden, als die Gläubiger der Finanzinstrumente von ihrem Umtausch und/ oder Bezugsrecht auf Aktien der Gesellschaft Gebrauch machen. Der Ausgabebetrag und das Umtauschverhältnis sind nach Maßgabe anerkannter finanzmathematischer Methoden sowie des Aktienkurses in einem anerkannten Preisfindungs- verfahren zu ermitteln. Die neu ausgegebenen Aktien der bedingten Kapitalerhöhung sind im gleichen Maße wie die bereits bestehenden Aktien der Gesellschaft dividendenberechtigt. Der Vorstand ist ermächtigt mit Zustimmung des Aufsichtsrates die weiteren Einzelheiten der Durchführung der bedingten Kapitalerhöhung festzusetzen. Der Aufsichtsrat ist ermächtigt, Änderungen der Satzung, die sich durch die Ausgabe von Aktien aus dem bedingten Kapital ergeben, zu beschließen.\n\nDie bedingte Kapitalerhöhung dient der Bedienung einer eventuell begebenen Wandelschuldverschreibung und darf ausdrücklich nur so weit durchgeführt werden, als Gläubiger von Wandelschuldverschreibungen von ihrem Umtausch- und /oder Bezugsrecht auf Aktien der Gesellschaft Gebrauch machen.\n\nDiese bedingte Kapitalerhöhung dient zur Ausgabe von neuen Aktien an Gläubiger von Finanzinstrumenten gemäß § 174 AktG, die unter Ausnutzung der in der Hauptversammlung vom 21. April 2023 eingeräumten Ermächtigung von der Gesellschaft ausgegeben werden. Diese von der Hauptversammlung vom 21. April 2023 eingeräumte Ermächtigung Finanzinstrumente gemäß § 174 AktG auszugeben, wurde bisher nicht ausgenutzt.\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\nVon Hauptversammlung vom 21. April 2023 wurden im Hinblick auf den Erwerb und die Veräußerung eigener Aktien zudem folgende Beschlüsse gefasst:\n\n- d) Der Vorstand ist gemäß § 65 Abs 1 Z 8 AktG für die Dauer von 30 Monaten ab dem Datum der Beschlussfassung ermächtigt, eigene Aktien der Gesellschaft sowohl über die Börse als auch außerbörslich auch unter Ausschluss des quotenmäßigen Andienungsrechtes der Aktionäre zu erwerben und, ohne dass die Hauptversammlung vorher nochmals befasst werden muss, gegebenenfalls diese Aktien mit Zustimmung des Aufsichtsrates einzuziehen. Der Handel mit eigenen Aktien ist als Zweck des Erwerbs ausgeschlossen. Der Anteil der zu erwerbenden Aktien darf 10% des Grundkapitals nicht übersteigen. Der Gegenwert pro zu erwerbender Stückaktie darf jeweils den durchschnittlichen ungewichteten Börseschlusskurs an der SIX Swiss Exchange der vergangenen 10 Handelstage um nicht mehr als 20% unterschreiten oder übersteigen. Die Ermächtigung kann ganz oder teilweise oder auch in mehreren Teilbeträgen und in Verfolgung eines oder mehrerer Zwecke durch die Gesellschaft, mit ihr verbundenen Unternehmen oder für deren Rechnung durch Dritte ausgeübt werden. Der Aufsichtsrat ist ermächtigt, Änderungen der Satzung, die sich durch die Einziehung von Aktien ergeben, zu beschließen.\n- e) Der Vorstand ist für die Dauer von fünf Jahren ab dem Datum der Beschlussfassung ermächtigt, mit Zustimmung des Aufsichtsrates eigene Aktien auch auf andere Art als über die Börse oder durch ein öffentliches Angebot zu jedem gesetzlich zulässigen Zweck zu veräußern oder zu verwenden und hierbei auch das quotenmäßige Kaufrecht der Aktionäre auszuschließen (Ausschluss des Bezugsrechtes) und die Veräußerungsbedingungen festzusetzen. Die Ermächtigung kann ganz oder teilweise oder auch in mehreren Teilbeträgen und in Verfolgung eines oder mehrerer Zwecke ausgeübt werden.\n- 8. Vereinbarungen der Gesellschaft, die bei einem Kontrollwechsel infolge eines Übernahmeangebotes wirksam werden, sich ändern oder enden sowie deren Wirkungen werden seitens der Gesellschaft nicht bekannt gegeben, da dies der Gesellschaft erheblich schaden würde.\n- 9. Es existieren keine Entschädigungsvereinbarungen zwischen der Gesellschaft und ihren Vorstands- und Aufsichtsratsmitgliedern oder Arbeitnehmern für den Fall eines öffentlichen Übernahmeangebotes.\n\n## **8. WESENTLICHE MERKMALE DES INTERNEN KONTROLLSYSTEMS § 243A (ABS2) UGB**\n\nDas interne Kontrollsystem der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe hat die Aufgabe, die Ordnungsmäßigkeit und Zuverlässigkeit der Finanzberichterstattung, die Einhaltung der für das Unternehmen maßgeblichen gesetzlichen und unternehmensinternen Vorschriften sowie die Wirksamkeit und Wirtschaftlichkeit der betrieblichen Tätigkeit einschließlich des Schutzes des Vermögens vor Verlusten durch Schäden und Malversationen sicherzustellen. In der Gestaltung der Elemente des internen Kontrollsystems wurden international anerkannte Rahmenwerke für Interne Kontrollsysteme (z.B. COSO-Framework) berücksichtigt. Das System umfasst:\n\n- x Konzernweite Vorgaben für die Rechnungslegung\n- x Funktionstrennung als organisatorische Maßnahme\n- x Systemgestützte und prozessabhängige Kontrollen\n- x Prozessunabhängige Kontrollen\n- x Management von Risiken der Bilanzerstellung\n\nDie PIERER Mobility-Gruppe setzt auf eine kontinuierliche Weiterentwicklung und Verbesserung des internen Kontrollsystems. Dazu erfolgt regelmäßig eine Überwachung seiner Funktionsfähigkeit durch Prozess- und Datenanalysen sowie unabhängige, externe Prüfungstätigkeiten. Im Folgenden werden die wesentlichen Merkmale des internen Kontrollsystems im Hinblick auf den Rechnungslegungsprozess dargestellt.\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **KONTROLLUMFELD**\n\nDie Organisationsstruktur der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe bildet die Basis für das Kontrollumfeld und das interne Kontrollsystem im Unternehmen. Im Bereich der Aufbauorganisation im (Konzern-)Rechnungswesen bestehen eindeutige Kompetenz- und Verantwortungsbereiche auf den unterschiedlichen Führungs- und Hierarchieebenen des Konzerns. Dies betrifft einerseits die Konzernzentrale in Wels sowie die österreichischen und alle internationalen Tochtergesellschaften. Die Bereiche Treasury und Business Process Finance sind in den operativen Bereichen der Gruppe angesiedelt, wobei auch hier die Aufgaben und Verantwortungen klar aufgeteilt sind.\n\nDer starken internationalen Ausrichtung der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe und der damit zusammenhängenden dezentralen Gesellschafts- und Standortstrukturen wird durch die Zentralisierung von wesentlichen Unternehmensfunktionen im Bereich der Finanzberichterstattung in den österreichischen Standorten (insbesondere in Mattighofen) Rechnung getragen. Die Wahrnehmung und Steuerung der nationalen Geschäftstätigkeiten obliegt dem jeweiligen lokalen Management und wird vom Vorstand der KTM AG sowie vom Konzernvorstand überwacht.\n\nIn der Ablauforganisation setzt die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe auf ein ausgeprägtes und umfangreiches Regelwerk an Bilanzierungs-, Bewertungs- und Kontierungsvorgaben. Dies stellt eine angemessene Basis für ein starkes Kontrollumfeld und Kontrollsystem dar. Neue Bilanzierungsstandards werden hinsichtlich ihrer Auswirkung auf die Rechnungslegung der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe beurteilt. Die Vorgaben an die Rechnungslegung und die Rechnungslegungsprozesse werden laufend überprüft und mindestens jährlich, bei Bedarf häufiger angepasst. Die Überwachung der Einhaltung der rechnungslegungsbezogenen Regelungen und Kontrollen liegt in der Verantwortung des jeweils zuständigen Managements.\n\n#### **RISIKOBEURTEILUNG**\n\nRisiken in Bezug auf den Rechnungslegungsprozess werden durch das Management erhoben und überwacht sowie im Risikomanagementprozess berücksichtigt. Der Fokus wird dabei auf jene Risiken gelegt, die als wesentlich zu betrachten sind.\n\nDie wesentlichen Risiken im Bereich der Rechnungslegung umfassen die nicht vollständige Erfassung von bilanzierungsrelevanten Sachverhalten, Fehler in der Belegerfassung sowie fehlerhafte Berechnungen. Komplexe Bilanzierungsgrundsätze könnten zu einem erhöhten Fehlerrisiko, unrichtigen Ausweis sowie verspätete Bilanzerstellung führen. Zudem besteht das Risiko eines Datenzugriffes von unberechtigten Personen bzw. Datenmanipulation, Ausfall von IT-Systemen und Datenverlust.\n\nFür die Erstellung des Abschlusses müssen regelmäßig Schätzungen vorgenommen werden, bei denen das immanente Risiko besteht, dass die zukünftige Entwicklung von diesen Schätzungen abweicht. Dies trifft insbesondere auf die folgenden Sachverhalte/Posten des Konzernabschlusses zu: Sozialkapital, Ausgang von Rechtsstreitigkeiten, Werthaltigkeit von Forderungen, Beteiligungen und Vorräten. Teilweise werden externe Experten zugezogen bzw. wird auf öffentlich zugängliche Quellen abgestellt, um das Risiko einer Fehleinschätzung zu minimieren.\n\n#### **KONTROLLMAßNAHMEN**\n\nDie PIERER Mobility-Gruppe hat ihre Kontrollen direkt in die (Konzern-)Rechnungslegungsprozesse integriert. Wesentliches Element ist dabei, neben prozessunabhängigen externen Kontrollmechanismen, das Prinzip der Funktionstrennung. Zur Gewährleistung einer vollständigen, zeitgerechten und richtigen Bilanzerstellung wurden in allen am Buchungsprozess beteiligten Bereichen Qualitätssicherungs- und Kontrollmaßnahmen implementiert. Sämtliche Kontrollmaßnahmen werden im laufenden Geschäftsprozess angewandt, um sicherzustellen, dass potenzielle Fehler in der Finanzberichterstattung vorgebeugt bzw. diese entdeckt und korrigiert werden. Des Weiteren führt die Anwendung von unternehmensinternen Richtlinien zu einer einheitlichen Behandlung der Geschäftsfälle sowie zu einer einheitlichen Bilanzierung und Berichterstattung.\n\nIn den wichtigen IT-Systemen mit Rechnungslegungsrelevanz sind Kontrollen integriert, die unter anderem die falsche Erfassung von Geschäftsvorfällen verhindern, die vollständige Erfassung von Geschäftsvorfällen \n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\nbeziehungsweise Bewertung der Geschäftsvorfälle entsprechend den Rechnungslegungsvorschriften sicherstellen oder die Überprüfung der Konsolidierung unterstützen sollen. Im Hinblick auf die steigenden Anforderungen an IT-Systeme in der Rechnungslegung sowie den ständig steigenden technischen Möglichkeiten führt die PIERER Mobility Gruppe regelmäßig IT-gestützte Analysen der Wirksamkeit der gesetzten Maßnahmen durch, um etwaige aufgetretene Kontrollschwächen zu erkennen und anschließend zu beseitigen.\n\nKontrollmaßnahmen in Bezug auf die IT-Sicherheit stellen einen Eckpfeiler des internen Kontrollsystems dar. So wird die Trennung von sensiblen Tätigkeiten durch eine restriktive Vergabe von IT-Berechtigungen unterstützt. Durch die eingesetzte ERP Software finden automatisierte Prüfungen statt, wie z.B. die automatisierten Kontrollen bei Rechnungsfreigabe und Rechnungsprüfung.\n\n#### **KOMMUNIKATION UND ÜBERWACHUNG**\n\nDie Verantwortung für die Wirksamkeit des internen Kontrollsystems im (Konzern-)Rechnungslegungsprozess ist klar geregelt und liegt bei den verantwortlichen Führungskräften und Prozessverantwortlichen. In die Beurteilung der Wirksamkeit fließen neben den Ergebnissen aus der unternehmensinternen Einschätzung auch jene von externen Prüfungen, z. B. im Rahmen der Jahresabschlussprüfung oder von externen IT-Security Audits, sowie des Aufsichtsrats und des Prüfungsausschusses ein. Schwächen im Kontrollsystem werden unter Berücksichtigung ihrer möglichen Auswirkung auf die Rechnungslegungsprozesse behoben.\n\nNeben den gesetzlich vorgeschriebenen Abschlüssen, welche den Führungsebenen zur Verfügung gestellt werden, wurde im Konzern auch ein umfangreiches Internes Berichtswesen implementiert, das je nach Berichtsempfänger in unterschiedlichen Aggregationstiefen erstellt und verteilt wird.\n\nWeitere zentrale Instrumente der Risikoüberwachung und -kontrolle sind die unternehmensweiten Richtlinien über den Umgang mit wesentlichen Risiken, der Planungs- und der Controlling-Prozesse, sowie die laufende Berichterstattung. Die Richtlinien umfassen die Festsetzung und Kontrolle von Limits und Handlungsabläufen zur Begrenzung finanzieller Risiken sowie die strikte Vorgabe des Vier-Augen-Prinzips bei Rechnungs- und Zahlungsfreigaben.\n\nDarüber hinaus basiert das interne Kontrollsystem auf genauen Informationen über die Prozesse für die Rechnungslegung und Finanzberichtserstattung und schließt auch deren vorgelagerte Unternehmensprozesse, z. B. Bestellanforderungen oder Logistikprozesse, mit ein. Die Wirksamkeit des internen Kontrollsystems wird vom Management dahingehend überprüft, dass die Ergebnisse, die in komprimierter Berichtsform an das Management übermittelt werden von ihm analysiert, bewertet und kommentiert werden.\n\nVorstand und Prüfungsausschuss werden jährlich über die Einschätzung zur Wirksamkeit des internen Kontrollsystems in der Rechnungslegung unterrichtet. Bei wesentlichen Veränderungen der Wirksamkeit des internen Kontrollsystems erfolgt eine unverzügliche Berichterstattung an den Vorstand und gegebenenfalls an den Aufsichtsrat sowie eine Ergreifung adäquater Maßnahmen zur Erhöhung der Wirksamkeit.\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **9. AUSBLICK**\n\n### **Geschäftsentwicklung**\n\nAnknüpfend an den Trend aus dem Jahr 2022 konnten die Marken KTM, Husqvarna Motorcycles und GASGAS im Jahr 2023 ihre Marktanteile in den relevanten Absatzmärkten weitgehend ausbauen. Darüber hinaus erwartet die Gruppe mittel- bis langfristig ein weiteres Wachstum des Motorradmarktes und eine insgesamt positive Entwicklung des Motorradmarktes für die von ihr vertriebenen hochwertigen Premiumprodukte.\n\nDie noch im Geschäftsjahr 2022 aufgetretenen Herausforderungen in den internationalen Lieferketten der Unternehmensgruppe haben sich in 2023 deutlich entspannt und werden voraussichtlich auch im Geschäftsjahr 2024 keine größeren Störungen verursachen. Die in der KTM AG Gruppe etablierten Maßnahmen zeigen somit Wirkung, da die Folgen aus der letztjährigen Situation durch die Lieferantenrisikobewertung weitgehend abgemildert wurden. Neben anderen Maßnahmen und den identifizierten Gründen für Lieferkettenprobleme in der Vergangenheit wurde die Beschaffungsstrategie angepasst und das Beschaffungsrisiko insbesondere durch den direkten Zugang zum asiatischen und den weiteren Fokus auf den europäischen Markt reduziert.\n\nFür das Geschäftsjahr 2024 rechnet die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe weiterhin mit einem global schwierigen wirtschaftlichen Umfeld, nicht zuletzt getrieben von den unverändert signifikant hohen Inflationsraten und Lohnund Gehaltsentwicklungen mit weitreichenden Einflüssen auf die Preisentwicklung weltweit. Für die Gruppe wird das Jahr 2024 ein Konsolidierungsjahr, welches zur Stärkung des Kerngeschäfts genutzt wird. Im Zuge dessen erwartet die PIERER Mobility Gruppe für das Geschäftsjahr 2024 einen Umsatz auf ähnlichem Niveau wie im Vorjahr und eine EBIT-Marge von 5-7 %.\n\nUm die Rentabilität der Gruppe zu sichern, wird das Management Kostenreduktionsmaßnahmen im Geschäftsjahr 2024 im zweistelligen Millionenbereich durchführen. Diese Maßnahmen umfassen insbesondere die **stärkere Fokussierung auf das Kerngeschäft Powered-Two-Wheelers** (Motorräder und elektrifizierte Mobility-Produkte) mit den Premiummarken KTM, GASGAS und Husqvarna sowie MV Agusta.\n\nAls weitere wesentliche Maßnahme zur Kostenreduktion werden Teile der Produktion für einzelne Modelle der Mittelklasse und bestimmte Forschungs- und Entwicklungsaktivitäten zum strategischen Partner Bajaj Auto, Indien, sowie zu CFMOTO, China, verlagert. Das betrifft Produkte (Straßenmotorräder) in sehr preis- und wettbewerbsintensiven Märkten. Die bisher bei Bajaj produzierte Modellpalette (zwischen 125 und 390 Kubikzentimeter) wird erweitert. Beim chinesischen Partner CFMOTO werden Straßenmotorräder zwischen 790 und 950 Kubikzentimeter assembliert. Die Unternehmensgruppe erwartet sich daraus nicht nur Kostenvorteile, sondern auch eine Beschleunigung von Entwicklungs- und Industrialisierungsprozessen.\n\nBegleitet werden diese Maßnahmen unter anderem durch die Reduktion der Mitarbeiteranzahl um bis zu 300 Arbeitsplätze in Mattighofen und Munderfing, insbesondere durch die Herausnahme von Leiharbeitern sowie durch Mitarbeiter, die über natürliche Fluktuation das Unternehmen verlassen.\n\nAufgrund oben beschriebener strategischer Anpassungen werden ab dem Geschäftsjahr 2024 die berichteten Teilbereiche neu strukturiert. Künftig erfolgt die Ausrichtung an den Segmenten \"Motorcycles\" sowie \"E-Mobility\". Das neue Segment \"E-Mobility\" umfasst künftig neben elektrifizierten New Mobility-Produkten sämtliche elektrobetriebenen Powered-Two-Wheelers wie E-Motorräder, E-Minis sowie Stand-up Scooters.\n\n### **Investitionen**\n\nDie Investitionen der vergangenen Jahre haben die notwendigen Produktionskapazitäten für die kommenden Jahre gesichert. Der Fokus der Investitionen lag und liegt daher auf anderen Projektthemen, insbesondere auf der (Weiter-)Entwicklung bestehender und neuer Modelle, der Elektromobilität und der High-Tech-Modernisierung. Diese markieren für die Gruppe derzeit und auch in Zukunft die oberste Priorität der Investitionen. Im Einklang mit den strategischen Zielen werden die Ausgaben für Investitionen in Forschung und Entwicklung auf dem bereits hohen Niveau der Vorjahre bleiben.\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\nWichtige geplante Investitionen sind auch die Beschaffung von Werkzeugen, insbesondere für geplante\nForschungs- und Entwicklungsprojekte, Investitionen in digitale Vertriebsplattformen für Händler und Endkunden\nsowie Modernisierungen, Erweiterungen, Verbesserungen und Digitalisierung bestehender\nProduktionskapazitäten.\n\nDie aktuellen Liquiditätsreserven gepaart mit einem ausgewogenen Mix an verschiedenen\nFinanzierungsinstrumenten ermöglichen es der Unternehmensgruppe auch im Jahr 2024 in einem volatilen\nMarktumfeld flexibel zu agieren. In diesem Zusammenhang wurden die verfügbaren Liquiditätsreserven kurz- und\nlangfristig deutlich erhöht. So hat die KTM Gruppe im Geschäftsjahr 2023 etwa ein Schuldscheindarlehen mit\neinem Volumen von EUR 300 Millionen sowie eine Namensschuldverschreibung im Umfang von EUR 50\nMillionen emittiert.\n\nDie Unternehmensgruppe ist auch von den Folgen der aktuellen Zinsentwicklung betroffen und das\nZinsänderungsrisiko wird regelmäßig evaluiert. Weiters wurden Maßnahmen zur Steuerung des\nZinsänderungsrisikos ergriffen. Die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe erwartet mittelfristig eine Reduktion des derzeit\nhohen Zinsniveaus.\n\nWels, am 14.

Dezember 2023 14. März 2024*\n\n## **Bestätigungsvermerk**\n\n## **Bericht zum Jahresabschluss**\n\n## **Prüfungsurteil**\n\nWir haben den Jahresabschluss der\n\n### PIERER Mobility AG, Wels,\n\nbestehend aus der Bilanz zum 31. Dezember 2023, der Gewinn- und Verlustrechnung für das an diesem Stichtag endende Geschäftsjahr und dem Anhang, geprüft.\n\nNach unserer Beurteilung entspricht der Jahresabschluss den gesetzlichen Vorschriften und vermittelt ein möglichst getreues Bild der Vermögens- und Finanzlage zum 31. Dezember 2023 sowie der Ertragslage der Gesellschaft für das an diesem Stichtag endende Geschäftsjahr in Übereinstimmung mit den österreichischen unternehmensrechtlichen Vorschriften.\n\n## **Grundlage für das Prüfungsurteil**\n\nWir haben unsere Abschlussprüfung in Übereinstimmung mit der EU-Verordnung Nr 537/2014 (im Folgenden AP-VO) und mit den österreichischen Grundsätzen ordnungsgemäßer Abschlussprüfung durchgeführt. Diese Grundsätze erfordern die Anwendung der International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Unsere Verantwortlichkeiten nach diesen Vorschriften und Standards sind im Abschnitt \"Verantwortlichkeiten des Abschlussprüfers für die Prüfung des Jahresabschlusses\" unseres Bestätigungsvermerks weitergehend beschrieben. Wir sind von der Gesellschaft unabhängig in Übereinstimmung mit den österreichischen unternehmens- und berufsrechtlichen Vorschriften und wir haben unsere sonstigen beruflichen Pflichten in Übereinstimmung mit diesen Anforderungen erfüllt. Wir sind der Auffassung, dass die von uns erlangten Prüfungsnachweise bis zum Datum dieses Bestätigungsvermerkes ausreichend und geeignet sind, um als Grundlage für unser Prüfungsurteil zu diesem Datum zu dienen.\n\n## **Besonders wichtige Prüfungssachverhalte**\n\nBesonders wichtige Prüfungssachverhalte sind solche Sachverhalte, die nach unserem pflichtgemäßen Ermessen am bedeutsamsten für unsere Prüfung des Jahresabschlusses des Geschäftsjahres waren. Diese Sachverhalte wurden im Zusammenhang mit unserer Prüfung des Jahresabschlusses als Ganzes und bei der Bildung unseres Prüfungsurteils hierzu berücksichtigt und wir geben kein gesondertes Prüfungsurteil zu diesen Sachverhalten ab.\n\nWir haben bestimmt, dass es keine besonders wichtigen Prüfungssachverhalte gibt, die in unserem Vermerk mitzuteilen sind.\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/165/Picture/0 description: The image shows the KPMG logo. The logo consists of the letters \"KPMG\" in a stylized, sans-serif font, with four squares above the letters.\n\n## **Verantwortlichkeiten der gesetzlichen Vertreter und des Prüfungsausschusses für den Jahresabschluss**\n\nDie gesetzlichen Vertreter sind verantwortlich für die Aufstellung des Jahresabschlusses und dafür, dass dieser in Übereinstimmung mit den österreichischen unternehmensrechtlichen Vorschriften ein möglichst getreues Bild der Vermögens-, Finanz- und Ertragslage der Gesellschaft vermittelt. Ferner sind die gesetzlichen Vertreter verantwortlich für die internen Kontrollen, die sie als notwendig erachten, um die Aufstellung eines Jahresabschlusses zu ermöglichen, der frei von wesentlichen falschen Darstellungen aufgrund von dolosen Handlungen oder Irrtümern ist.\n\nBei der Aufstellung des Jahresabschlusses sind die gesetzlichen Vertreter dafür verantwortlich, die Fähigkeit der Gesellschaft zur Fortführung der Unternehmenstätigkeit zu beurteilen, Sachverhalte im Zusammenhang mit der Fortführung der Unternehmenstätigkeit – sofern einschlägig – anzugeben, sowie dafür, den Rechnungslegungsgrundsatz der Fortführung der Unternehmenstätigkeit anzuwenden, es sei denn, die gesetzlichen Vertreter beabsichtigen, entweder die Gesellschaft zu liquidieren oder die Unternehmenstätigkeit einzustellen oder haben keine realistische Alternative dazu.\n\nDer Prüfungsausschuss ist verantwortlich für die Überwachung des Rechnungslegungsprozesses der Gesellschaft.\n\n## **Verantwortlichkeiten des Abschlussprüfers für die Prüfung des Jahresabschlusses**\n\nUnsere Ziele sind hinreichende Sicherheit darüber zu erlangen, ob der Jahresabschluss als Ganzes frei von wesentlichen falschen Darstellungen aufgrund von dolosen Handlungen oder Irrtümern ist und einen Bestätigungsvermerk zu erteilen, der unser Prüfungsurteil beinhaltet. Hinreichende Sicherheit ist ein hohes Maß an Sicherheit, aber keine Garantie dafür, dass eine in Übereinstimmung mit der AP-VO und mit den österreichischen Grundsätzen ordnungsgemäßer Abschlussprüfung, die die Anwendung der ISA erfordern, durchgeführte Abschlussprüfung eine wesentliche falsche Darstellung, falls eine solche vorliegt, stets aufdeckt. Falsche Darstellungen können aus dolosen Handlungen oder Irrtümern resultieren und werden als wesentlich angesehen, wenn von ihnen einzeln oder insgesamt vernünftigerweise erwartet werden könnte, dass sie die auf der Grundlage dieses Jahresabschlusses getroffenen wirtschaftlichen Entscheidungen von Nutzern beeinflussen.\n\nAls Teil einer Abschlussprüfung in Übereinstimmung mit der AP-VO und mit den österreichischen Grundsätzen ordnungsgemäßer Abschlussprüfung, die die Anwendung der ISA erfordern, üben wir während der gesamten Abschlussprüfung pflichtgemäßes Ermessen aus und bewahren eine kritische Grundhaltung.\n\nDarüber hinaus gilt:\n\n— Wir identifizieren und beurteilen die Risiken wesentlicher falscher Darstellungen aufgrund von dolosen Handlungen oder Irrtümern im Abschluss, planen Prüfungshandlungen als Reaktion auf diese Risiken, führen sie durch und erlangen Prüfungsnachweise, die ausreichend und geeignet sind, um als Grundlage für unser Prüfungsurteil zu dienen. Das Risiko, dass aus dolosen Handlungen resultierende wesentliche falsche Darstellungen nicht aufgedeckt werden, ist höher als ein aus Irrtümern resultierendes, da dolose Handlungen kollusives Zusammenwirken, Fälschungen, beabsichtigte Unvollständigkeiten, irreführende Darstellungen oder das Außerkraftsetzen interner Kontrollen beinhalten können.\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/166/Picture/0 description: The image shows the KPMG logo. The letters \"KPMG\" are in bold, blue font. Above the letters are four white squares.\n\n- Wir gewinnen ein Verständnis von dem für die Abschlussprüfung relevanten internen Kontrollsystem, um Prüfungshandlungen zu planen, die unter den gegebenen Umständen angemessen sind, jedoch nicht mit dem Ziel, ein Prüfungsurteil zur Wirksamkeit des internen Kontrollsystems der Gesellschaft abzugeben.\n- Wir beurteilen die Angemessenheit der von den gesetzlichen Vertretern angewandten Rechnungslegungsmethoden sowie die Vertretbarkeit der von den gesetzlichen Vertretern dargestellten geschätzten Werte in der Rechnungslegung und damit zusammenhängende Angaben.\n- Wir ziehen Schlussfolgerungen über die Angemessenheit der Anwendung des Rechnungslegungsgrundsatzes der Fortführung der Unternehmenstätigkeit durch die gesetzlichen Vertreter sowie, auf der Grundlage der erlangten Prüfungsnachweise, ob eine wesentliche Unsicherheit im Zusammenhang mit Ereignissen oder Gegebenheiten besteht, die erhebliche Zweifel an der Fähigkeit der Gesellschaft zur Fortführung der Unternehmenstätigkeit aufwerfen können. Falls wir die Schlussfolgerung ziehen, dass eine wesentliche Unsicherheit besteht, sind wir verpflichtet, in unserem Bestätigungsvermerk auf die dazugehörigen Angaben im Jahresabschluss aufmerksam zu machen oder, falls diese Angaben unangemessen sind, unser Prüfungsurteil zu modifizieren. Wir ziehen unsere Schlussfolgerungen auf der Grundlage der bis zum Datum unseres Bestätigungsvermerks erlangten Prüfungsnachweise. Zukünftige Ereignisse oder Gegebenheiten können jedoch die Abkehr der Gesellschaft von der Fortführung der Unternehmenstätigkeit zur Folge haben.\n- Wir beurteilen die Gesamtdarstellung, den Aufbau und den Inhalt des Jahresabschlusses einschließlich der Angaben sowie ob der Jahresabschluss die zugrunde liegenden Geschäftsvorfälle und Ereignisse in einer Weise wiedergibt, dass ein möglichst getreues Bild erreicht wird.\n- Wir tauschen uns mit dem Prüfungsausschuss unter anderem über den geplanten Umfang und die geplante zeitliche Einteilung der Abschlussprüfung sowie über bedeutsame Prüfungsfeststellungen, einschließlich etwaiger bedeutsamer Mängel im internen Kontrollsystem, die wir während unserer Abschlussprüfung erkennen, aus.\n- Wir geben dem Prüfungsausschuss auch eine Erklärung ab, dass wir die relevanten beruflichen Verhaltensanforderungen zur Unabhängigkeit eingehalten haben und uns mit ihm über alle Beziehungen und sonstigen Sachverhalte austauschen, von denen vernünftigerweise angenommen werden kann, dass sie sich auf unsere Unabhängigkeit und – sofern einschlägig – damit zusammenhängende Schutzmaßnahmen auswirken.\n- Wir bestimmen von den Sachverhalten, über die wir uns mit dem Prüfungsausschuss ausgetauscht haben, diejenigen Sachverhalte, die am bedeutsamsten für die Prüfung des Jahresabschlusses des Geschäftsjahres waren und daher die besonders wichtigen Prüfungssachverhalte sind. Wir beschreiben diese Sachverhalte in unserem Bestätigungsvermerk, es sei denn, Gesetze oder andere Rechtsvorschriften schließen die öffentliche Angabe des Sachverhalts aus oder wir bestimmen in äußerst seltenen Fällen, dass ein Sachverhalt nicht in unserem Bestätigungsvermerk mitgeteilt werden sollte, weil vernünftigerweise erwartet wird, dass die negativen Folgen einer solchen Mitteilung deren Vorteile für das öffentliche Interesse übersteigen würden.\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/167/Picture/0 description: The image shows the KPMG logo.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE PIERER MOBILITY GROUP\n\n### THE COMPANY\n\nPIERER Mobility AG is the umbrella company for Europe's leading manufacturer of powered two-wheelers, and manufactures a full range of premium products under the KTM, GASGAS, Husqvarna and MV Agusta Motorcycles brands. PIERER Mobility's innovative strength makes it a pioneering leader in technology for two-wheeled electric mobility through its motorcycle brands. Husqvarna and GASGAS E-Bicycles complement the two-wheeler range. The premium brand range also includes high-performance components from the WP brand and special KTM X-BOW high-performance sports cars.\n\nFollowing the strategic partnership with Bajaj in India, the company has been able to diversify its production capacities in recent years and increase its competitiveness in the global market. The cooperation with CFMOTO in China and the joint venture with Maxcom in Bulgaria will boost both bicycle and motorcycle production over the long term. With its leading technology in the field of low-voltage electric mobility, PIERER Mobility aims to become the global market leader for electric two-wheelers in the power range from 250 W to 15 kW.\n\nThe shares of PIERER Mobility AG have their primary listing in the Swiss Performance Index (SPI) of the SIX Swiss Exchange in Zurich and are also listed on the Prime Market of the Vienna Stock Exchange.\n\n### DEVELOPMENT OF SALES AND REVENUE IN THE 2023 FINANCIAL YEAR\n\nDespite difficult economic conditions and upheaval in the bicycle industry, in the 2023 financial year the PIERER Mobility Group increased group revenue by 9.2 % to a new record level of € 2,661.2 million (previous year: € 2,437.2 million). With 381,555 motorcycles sold (previous year: 375,492) in the 2023 financial year, the Motorcycles segment achieved an increase in sales of around 2 %. Surplus stocks in the bicycle sector globally meant that the PIERER Mobility Group also faced a sharp drop in market prices. The growth in sales in the Bicycle Division of more than 30 % was driven by inventory adjustments and the sale of the R Raymon brand. In the 2023 financial year, 157,358 bicycles were sold (previous year: 118,465).\n\nThe European sales regions accounted for sales of around 140,000 motorcycles (+15 %), and around two-thirds of motorcycles (around 240,000) were sold in markets outside Europe. Despite a slight\n\ndecline in sales in North America, the group's subsidiary there nevertheless managed to sell more than 100,000 motorcycles for the second time in a row. While sales in South America (-26 %) and Asia (-27 %) declined in the past financial year, sales of around 19,700 motorcycles in Australia were slightly higher (+1 %) than the level recorded in the previous year.\n\nDespite the difficult global economic conditions, demand in the core markets of Europe rose very strongly at a rate of +11 % (~ 820,000 newly registered motorcycles) and also displayed a significantly positive trend in North America (USA & Canada) at +4 % (485,000 motorcycles). The market share of all three brands (KTM, Husqvarna, GASGAS) in 2023 was therefore around 10.6 % in Europe and 12.6 % in North America. The Australian (including New Zealand) motorcycle market declined slightly, with a 3 % drop to 67,000 newly registered motorcycles. Nevertheless, the three brands as a whole managed to increase their share of this market to 21 %. By contrast, just like last year, the relevant Indian motorcycle market is seeing a significant upswing (+22 %). Bajaj sold around 66,000 KTM and Husqvarna motorcycles in India, resulting in a market share of 5.3 %.\n\n### STRATEGIC PROJECTS\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the company stepped up and expanded its cooperation with CFMOTO. On the one hand, February 2023 saw the start of activities in the subsidiary, CFMOTO Motorcycles Distribution GmbH, Munderfing, which was established in the 2022 financial year, and this company distributes CFMOTO motorcycles in Europe, in particular in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Spain and the United Kingdom. On the other, the long-standing cooperation in relation to industrialization projects in the established joint venture Zhejiang CFMOTO-KTMR2R Motorcycles Co., Ltd., Zhejian, China was stepped up even more and the series production of mid-range KTM models was expanded further. The stepping up of the joint venture and the cooperation in the areas of product strategy, product development, industrialization and sales is a further step toward being able to meet the increasing market demand in China and the Asian region, as well as worldwide. In addition, production capacity will be increased from 50,000 to 100,000 vehicles. As a sign of closer cooperation, CFMOTO also increased its equity holding inter alia in PIERER Mobility AG to 2.0 %.\n\nAn important milestone for the company was the conclusion of a strategic cooperation with the Italian premium motorcycle manufacturer MV Agusta S.p.A., based in Varese, in which KTM AG acquired a 25.1 % stake back in November. Since the 2023 financial year, the KTM Group has been responsible for purchasing and sales \n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\nin the most important European countries, marketing and customer support for MV Agusta motorcycles. Furthermore, the Executive Board has made the strategic decision to exercise the call option granted under the cooperation agreement to acquire a further 25.0 % stake in MV Agusta S.p.A. in spring 2026.\n\nThe Executive Board has also made the strategic decision to focus even more on the core business of powered two-wheelers (motorcycles and electrified mobility products) and to concentrate on the premium brands KTM, GASGAS and Husqvarna as well as MV Agusta. As a result of this decision, the Executive Board instigated the sale of the R Raymon and FELT brands and the sale of the non-ebicycle division. In this context, in September 2023 the \"R Raymon\" brand was sold to R RAYMON Bicycles GmbH (formerly: Johansson GmbH), Schweinfurt, Germany. Furthermore, the process of selling the FELT bicycle brand to a consortium led by Florian Burguet was also initiated and is set to be completed in the first half of 2024. Florian Burguet left the Executive Board at the end of December.\n\n#### ACTIVITIES AND SUCCESSES IN RACING\n\n#### Motorsport\n\nThe \"Legends of Dakar\" exhibition was opened in the KTM Motohall in May 2023. The victorious motorcycle on which Kevin Benavides won the Dakar Rally in January 2023 was able to take pride of place in the exhibition. His triumph was KTM's 19th victory in the Dakar Rally in the last 22 years. PIERER Mobility is also successful with all its brands in motocross. Jeffrey Herlings from Red Bull KTM Factory Racing broke the all-time record of 101 wins at the Spanish Grand Prix in the middle of the season, increasing his personal track record to 103 wins. Andrea Adamo secured the MX2 World Championship title. The German Manuel Lettenbichler won his second FIM Hard Enduro World Championship in a row – a phenomenal record of six victories in six races. Jospe Garcia not only triumphed at the International Six Days Enduro, but also claimed the title of world champion in the EnduroGP E1 class. Since the launch of the global Husqvarna Factory Racing Team in 2015, Husqvarna Motorcycles has consistently strengthened its position as a dominant force in off-road racing. In 2023, Billy Bolt's FIM SuperEnduro title improved its track record to a total of 116 world championship titles. GASGAS is the third brand with a successful record in motorsport. Jorge Prado made history with his MXGP World Championship title – it was the very first title for GASGAS in the premier class of motocross. In the last few years, GASGAS has been able to celebrate its greatest triumphs in the FIM EnduroGP World Championship. After winning both the EnduroGP\n\nand Enduro 1 titles in 2022, Andrea Verona switched class and entered the Enduro 2 series in 2023.\n\nHighly specialist trial sport is still extremely important for GASGAS as the brand continues to compete at the highest level both indoors and outdoors. For 2023, GASGAS signed TrialGP number two Jaime Busto so he could team up with Sondre Haga, the 2022 Trial2 world champion, to compete in the premier class.\n\nIn 2023, KTM alone entered 28 riders in MotoGP™ and a whole series of talented young riders at junior events such as the Red Bull MotoGP™ Rookies Cup and the Northern Talent Cup. Red Bull KTM Factory Racing celebrated two wins with Brad Binder in the new MotoGP™ sprint format and claimed a total of ten podium finishes between him and his new teammate Jack Miller. This enabled KTM to come second in the MotoGP™ manufacturers' standings. In Moto2™, Pedro Acosta outperformed the opposition for his second title in just three years of world championship competition after dominating Moto3™ in 2021. He is another talented rider to enhance the GASGAS MotoGP™ project for 2024. As a two-time world champion, Pedro Acosta is undoubtedly one of the most talented young riders in road racing. He will be accompanied on the starting grid in 2024 by Augusto Fernandez, who will be embarking upon his second season at Red Bull GASGAS Tech3. In Moto3™, GASGAS Aspar rider David Alonso celebrated four race victories and eight podium finishes in his debut season. The Spaniard is the favorite to win the Moto3™ crown in the 2024 season. After finishing fourth in the 2022 Moto3™ World Championship, Ayumu Sasaki went into the 2023 season as a title contender for Husqvarna Factory Racing. He once again appeared regularly on the podium throughout the season and finished the season as runner-up in the Moto3™ World Championship. His teammate Collin Veijer also delivered impressive results and celebrated a victory in his debut season.\n\n#### Cycling\n\nSince 2023, the GASGAS E-Bicycles brand has been entering the UCI Mountain Bike World Series, in particular the E-Enduro Pro World Cup. Together with partners from industry, Johannes Fischbach and Alex Marin from GASGAS SRAM Racing and Simon Carlsson and Alexandre Fayolle from GASGAS MOTOREX Racing have been competing in races. After all five rounds, Alex Marin finished fourth and got within reach of the podium for GASGAS E-Bicycles in the team's very first season.\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### IMPACT OF THE RUSSIAN-UKRAINIAN WAR\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group's assessments of the impact of the war that is happening in Ukraine remain unchanged compared to the previous year. The PIERER Mobility Group has not identified any significant reason to materially change its estimates and expectations as of December 31, 2023 on the basis of the war that is happening in Ukraine. The group does not have any investments, other assets or other material business relationships in Ukraine, Russia or Belarus, nor does the group have any material business relationships with suppliers or dealers in these countries. With this in mind, the group does not expect any material impact on the expected future cash flows. Equally, the group has not suffered, and does not expect to suffer, any loss of control, joint control or the ability to exercise significant influence over any entity as a result of the war or the sanctions that have been imposed.\n\nImage /page/5/Picture/3 description: A person is riding a CFMOTO motorcycle on a dirt road.

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND MARKET DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe prospects for the global economy remain gloomy. The impact of the Russian-Ukrainian war, which has been going on since 2022, as well as significantly higher rates of inflation caused by this war, among other factors, have led to a significant slowdown in the global economy. Although the forecasts improved substantially over the course of the 2023 financial year, they are still restrained as a result of this.\n\nAs part of this, there is evidence of a largely positive normalization of business and consumer sentiment, raw material prices are dropping and the disruption to the supply chain seen in the last financial year appears to have largely been overcome as logistics costs and delivery times for the resources the company needs are generally returning to the level they were at before the COVID pandemic. Significant financial and macroeconomic risks exist, on the one hand as a result of the simmering real estate crisis in China, and on the other from the continued development in rates of inflation. While both overall inflation and core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food components, are declining, both are expected to remain high at least in the short and medium term. Looking at the overall picture, economic risks are generally more balanced than they were in the last financial year, but there is still a risk of a downward trend. This illustrates the continuing level of uncertainty, particularly regarding the course of the war in Ukraine, its wider consequences and the recent uncertainties about the outcome of the war that has erupted in the Middle East.\n\nUltimately, the situation that has been outlined means that the global growth forecasts from the leading organizations in this field, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the World Bank, are more uncertain than usual and are constantly being adjusted. The IMF's latest estimates suggest that the forecast for global economic growth remains broadly unchanged at 3.1 % for 2024 and 3.2 % for 2025, compared to previous estimates. These broadly unchanged forecasts indicate that the biggest risks to global economic development are now balanced and stabilized, but there are still downside risks given the issues described above. The estimates published are based on numerous assumptions about a wide range of macroeconomic factors, in particular the trend in the prices of fossil fuels and other resources and the general level of interest rates.\n\nFor industrialized countries, the IMF expects growth of 1.5 % in 2024 and 1.8 % in 2025. For the euro zone, growth of 0.9 % is forecast for 2024. For 2025, the IMF expects growth of 1.7 % for the euro zone, while growth in Germany in particular is forecast to be below average at 0.5 % for 2024 and 1.6 % for 2025.\n\nFor emerging markets and developing countries, the IMF forecasts economic growth of 4.1 % for 2024 and 4.2 % for 2025. A growth rate of 4.6 % is forecast for China in 2024 and 4.1 % in 2025. For India, economic output is forecast to increase by 5.7 % in 2024 and by 6.8 % in 2025.\n\nThe IMF forecasts rates of inflation of 5.8 % for 2024 and 4.4 % for 2025. The future development of the global economy will depend in particular on the successful calibration of monetary policy, taking stock of the cumulative effects of previous interest rate hikes, which could otherwise have serious detrimental effects for the financial sector. Moreover, the course of the war in Ukraine and, more recently, also in the Middle East, and not least the level of economic recovery and demand from China represent key factors that will affect how the global economy develops going forward. This assessment is largely shared by the OECD and the World Bank. The IMF, in particular, also declares that there is increasing divergence in economic growth, as a slowdown in growth appears to be more pronounced in advanced economies than it does in emerging markets and developing countries. With the IMF's forecast for global economic growth broadly unchanged, a major global economic downturn is not expected, although all forecasts in relation to the trend in the global economy remain subject to significant uncertainties.\n\nIn the past 2023 financial year, the global1 motorcycle market displayed a positive trend (+2.7 %, equating to an increase of 90,000 motorcycles). In Europe<sup>2</sup> the market, as measured by new registrations, increased again to more than 800,000 motorcycles (+11 %) following a small decline in 2022. The core markets of Germany (+12 %), France (+14 %), Italy (+15 %) and Spain (+13 %) in particular are benefiting from increased demand. This meant the market share rose from 10.0 % to 10.5 % (measured by the three core brands KTM, Husqvarna and GASGAS).\n\nIn North America, sales (in contrast to Europe including motocross models) also rose and culminated in around 490,000 units sold (+4 %). The growth achieved by the three core brands saw the market share increase from 11 % to 12.6 % (previous year: 11.8 %).\n\nThe trend in the Australian and New Zealand markets showed a slight decline of 3.2 %. However, as the registrations of KTM, Husqvarna and GASGAS rose by 3.4 %, the market share increased to 21.0 % (previous year: 19.7 %). The total volume is almost 67,000 motorcycles.\n\n1 Related to the key sales markets of the KTM Group: DE, FR, IT, UK, ES, SE, BE, NL, AT, CH, FL, DK, NO, GR, PL, SL, HU, BALTIC, USA, CAN, AUS, NZ, JP, SA, TH, CN, AR, BR, CO.\n\n2 Motorcycles = 120 cc excluding motocross, scooters, and ATVs, including electric motorcycles in the markets DE, FR, IT, UK, ES, SE, BE, NL, AT, CH, FI, NO, BALTIC.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe relevant Indian motorcycle market (S2/S3 segment) is once again experiencing a significant upturn (+22 %), with a volume of 1.2 million motorcycles sold. In this context, the strategic partner Bajaj sold more than 65,000 motorcycles of the KTM and Husqvarna brands in India, resulting in a slight increase in market share of 5.3 % (previous year: 5.0 %). The Asian region suffered losses in 2023, with the markets in Thailand (-10.4 %) and China (premium importer market; -17 %) being particularly affected. In Japan (motorcycles >250cc), the decline is -6 %, which is slightly lower. The decline (including Hong Kong, with a volume of approx. 2,000 motorcycles) is almost -12 % and the volume of motorcycles sold is now nearly 200,000 units. Nevertheless, the market share of the KTM core brands in this important growth region rose to 5.2 % (previous year: 4.9 %).\n\nThe New Mobility market is facing major challenges. Whereas recent years and expectations have been very much defined by the after-effects of the increased level of demand produced by the coronavirus pandemic, the forecast published by the German Two-Wheeler Industry Association (ZIV) for the 2023 financial year and at least the year after that suggests a significant slowdown in the market. For 2023 as a whole, the ZIV forecasts sales of around two million electrified New Mobility products. This equates to a decline of approx. 10 % compared to the record-breaking year in 2022 when 2.2 million units were sold. In addition, it should be noted that current macroeconomic uncertainties, as outlined in the introduction, along with impacts on consumer prices, caused not least by high rates of inflation, are having a negative effect on market development. Forecasts indicate that the entire New Mobility market is facing a trend of consolidation.\n\nImage /page/7/Picture/3 description: A person is riding a motorcycle on a paved road.

Approximately 97 % of revenues were earned outside of Austria. Looking at different regions, 54.4 % of revenues were generated in Europe (+7.9 percentage points year-on-year), 29.2 % in North America including Mexico (-4.7 percentage points year-on-year), and 16.4 % in the rest of the world (-3.2 percentage points year-on-year).\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) fell by around 32 % to € 160.0 million (previous year: € 235.3 million), which equates to an EBIT margin of 6.0 %. In the motorcycle segment, the EBIT margin is around 9 %, which is within the range of 8-10 % that was originally envisaged. By contrast, the restructuring of the bicycle sector that was initiated had a significant impact on the result. The earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of € 323.5 million is around 15 % below the previous year's figure, which equates to an EBITDA margin of 12.2 %. The net result after tax amounts to € 76.4 million (previous year: € 170.6 million).\n\nThe overall sales figures of the PIERER Mobility Group as well as the sales of PTWs (motorcycles and e-bicycles) are as follows:\n\nUnit sales total (Number of units)\n\nImage /page/9/Figure/6 description: This image shows a horizontal bar chart comparing the number of PTWs and Bicycles in 2022 and 2023. In 2023, the number of PTWs is 482,195, the number of Bicycles is not explicitly stated on the bar but the total number of PTWs and Bicycles is 538,913. In 2022, the number of PTWs is 449,971, the number of Bicycles is not explicitly stated on the bar but the total number of PTWs and Bicycles is 493,957.\n\nThe two segments \"Motorcycles\" and \"Bicycles\" represent the main operating areas of the PIERER Mobility Group, the development of which is discussed below.\n\n#### MOTORCYCLES\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, the Motorcycle Division achieved revenue of € 2,416.4 million (previous year: € 2,262.5 million) (+6.8 % compared to the previous year). In the motorcycle sector, the costs of inventories for dealers rose sharply despite a good level of demand because of significantly higher interest rates. This meant that, in order to strengthen the dealer structure, extended payment terms and higher discounts had to be granted to the dealers. In the 2023 financial year, EBITDA amounted to € 371.0 million (previous year: € 381.2 million) and EBIT was € 214.4 million (previous year: € 241.0 million). This\n\ncorresponds to an EBITDA margin of 15.4 % (previous year: 16.8 %) and an EBIT margin of 8.9 % (previous year: 10.7 %).\n\nIn Europe, revenue rose significantly compared to the previous year's level to € 1,229.0 million (previous year: € 977.4 million), corresponding to a revenue share of 50.9 % (previous year: 43.2 %). In North America, the motorcycle sector recorded revenue of € 754.4 million (previous year: 811.3 million). This meant that 31.2 % of revenue was generated in North America (previous year: 35.9 %). Revenue in the other countries fell slightly compared to the previous year by 8.6 % to € 432.9 million. The share of revenue in the other countries is 17.9 % (previous year: 20.9 %).\n\nWith 280,206 KTM motorcycles sold, 67,462 Husqvarna motorcycles sold and 29,532 GASGAS motorcycles sold in the 2023 financial year, plus the motorcycles sold by MV Agusta (1,852) and CFMOTO (2,503), sales of 381,555 motorcycles (2022: 375,492 units) were achieved (including the motorcycles sold in India and Indonesia by partner Bajaj). The Motorcycle Division thus achieved a 1.6 % increase in unit sales, consolidating its presence in the important motorcycle sales markets with its three motorcycle brands\n\n#### Unit sales 2023 Motorcycles (Number of units)\\* 381,555\n\nImage /page/9/Figure/14 description: This image is a bar chart for the year 2023.

Around two thirds of the motorcycles produced (241,341) were sold in markets outside Europe. Growth was particularly strong in India/Nepal, where 66,426 motorcycles were sold.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nThis represented an increase of 29.0 % compared to the previous year. Despite a slight decline in sales in North America (-7.7 %), the group's subsidiary there nevertheless managed to sell more than 100,000 motorcycles for the second time in a row, with 101,277 units sold. While sales fell in South America with 27,671 motorcycles sold (-26.4 %) and in Asia with 23,129 motorcycles sold (-27.3 %), sales of 19,648 motorcycles in Australia were slightly above the previous year's level (previous year: 19,478 units) (+1 %).\n\n#### Unit sales by region 2023\n\n- 36.7% Europe\n- 26.5% North America (incl. Mexico)\n- 17.4% India / Indonesia (by Bajaj)\n- 19.3% remaning global region\n\nImage /page/10/Picture/6 description: The image is a donut chart divided into four sections. The sections are shaded in different tones of gray, ranging from light gray to dark gray. The sections appear to be of roughly equal size.\n\n#### Revenue by region 2023\n\n- 50.9% Europe\n- 31.2% North America (incl. Mexico)\n- 17.9% remaning global region\n\nImage /page/10/Picture/11 description: The image is a donut chart divided into four sections. The sections are shaded in different tones of gray, with the lightest gray occupying the largest portion, followed by a medium gray, a darker gray, and the darkest gray.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, 217,160 motorcycles were produced at the Mattighofen production site, thus exceeding 200,000 motorcycles once again. Compared to the previous year, this constitutes a slight decline of -4,881 units or -2.2 %. Taking into account the small-engine KTM and Husqvarna models produced by our partner Bajaj Auto Ltd. in India, the GASGAS trial bikes produced in Spain, and the models produced with our partner CFMOTO in China, 385,330 motorcycles were manufactured worldwide (previous year: 381,823).\n\n#### BICYCLES\n\nSurplus stocks in the bicycle sector globally meant that the PIERER Mobility Group also faced a sharp drop in market prices. The growth of sales in this segment with the Husqvarna, R Raymon, GASGAS and FELT brands of around 33 % was driven by inventory adjustments and the sale of the R Raymon brand. In the 2023 financial year, 157,358 bicycles were sold (previous year: 118,465), of which 100,640 were e-bicycles (previous year: 74,479). In the bicycle segment, the DACH region still represents the largest sales market at around 60 %. In the Bicycle Division, the share of sales in North America in 2023 was 10 %.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, revenue of € 240.7 million was generated in the Bicycle Division (previous year: € 171.2 million). This represents a year-on-year increase in revenue of 40.6 %. EBITDA in 2023 was € -41.8 million (previous year: € 6.5 million) and EBIT was € -47.1 million (previous year: € 2.5 million).\n\nOf the e-bicycles sold in the 2023 financial year, 69.9 % were sold under the R Raymon brand, 20.7 % under the Husqvarna E-Bicycles brand, and 7.6 % under the GASGAS brand. Sales of non-e bicycles were spread between the two brands R Raymon at 60.0 % and FELT at 37.8 % (there was an almost even split in the previous year).\n\nUnit sales 2023 (E-)Bicycles (Number of units) 157,358\n\nImage /page/10/Figure/18 description: This image is a bar chart comparing the unit sales of (E-)Bicycles and Bicycles in 2022 and 2023. In 2023, (E-)Bicycles had unit sales of 100,640, while Bicycles had unit sales of 56,718. In 2022, (E-)Bicycles had unit sales of 74,479, while Bicycles had unit sales of 43,986. The unit sales of (E-)Bicycles in 2022 is 118,465.\n\nAround 87 % of sales were in Europe and here in particular in the DACH region. A further 10 % were in the North American sales region and the remaining sales (around 3 %) were in Asia, South America and Australia.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Unit sales by region 2023\n\n- 60.1% DACH region\n- 26.6% remaining Europe 13.4% remaining global region\n\nImage /page/11/Picture/4 description: The image is a donut chart with three sections. The largest section is white, the second largest is light gray, and the smallest section is dark gray.\n\n#### Revenue by region 2023\n\n71.8% DACH region 17.4% remaining Europe 10.8% remaining global region\n\nImage /page/11/Picture/7 description: The image is a donut chart. The largest segment of the chart is white, followed by a light gray segment, and then a dark gray segment.\n\n#### BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\n\nThe balance sheet structure of the PIERER Mobility Group is as follows:\n\n|                         | 2022      |        |  | 2023      |        |\n|-------------------------|-----------|--------|--|-----------|--------|\n|                         | € million | in %   |  | € million | in %   |\n| Non-current assets      | 1,195.8   | 46.9%  |  | 1,333.8   | 45.2%  |\n| Current assets          | 1,354.8   | 53.1%  |  | 1,619.1   | 54.8%  |\n| Assets                  | 2,550.6   | 100.0% |  | 2,952.9   | 100.0% |\n| Equity                  | 914.4     | 35.8%  |  | 909.3     | 30.8%  |\n| Non-current liabilities | 625.6     | 24.5%  |  | 1,130.0   | 38.3%  |\n| Current liabilities     | 1,010.6   | 39.6%  |  | 913.6     | 30.9%  |\n| Equity and liabilities  | 2,550.6   | 100.0% |  | 2,952.9   | 100.0% |\n\nThe statement of financial position total of the PIERER Mobility Group increased by 15.8 % from € 2,550.6 million to € 2,952.9 million compared to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022.\n\nSimilar to previous years, the increase in non-current assets from € 1,195.8 million to € 1,333.8 million was in particular in the area of development projects, which was above the level of amortization and resulted in an increase in intangible assets. In addition, property, plant and equipment also increased, mainly as a result of investments in the PIERER MAXCOM Mobility OOD production site in Bulgaria.\n\nWithin current assets, inventories in particular increased by € 203.3 million. The other material changes involved firstly the increase in trade receivables of € 80.4 million and secondly the reduction in cash of € 19.8 million. Overall, this resulted in an increase in current assets of 19.5 % to € 1,619.1 million.\n\nCurrent liabilities decreased by € 97.0 million (-9.6 %) compared to December 31, 2022. This decrease was largely due to the fall in trade payables of € -60.6 million and provisions of € -22.2 million.\n\nThe provision of € 20.2 million that was set up in the previous year and formed as part of the cooperation agreement with MV Agusta was fully used up in 2023.\n\nNon-current liabilities increased by 80.6 % to € 1,130.0 million. The increase was largely due to the increase in financial liabilities, in particular from the taking up of a promissory note loan with a volume of € 300.0 million, a research loan from the European Investment Bank amounting to € 100.0 million, and a registered bond amounting to € 50 million.\n\nEquity decreased by € 5.1 million from € 914.4 million to € 909.3 million in the 2023 financial year. On the one hand, equity was strengthened by a net result after tax of € 76.4 million. On the other hand, dividend payments of € 68.1 million led to a reduction in equity. The other effects of € -13.4 million essentially concern the recognition of foreign currency differences with no effect on profit or loss, the measurement of financial instruments and the revaluation of net debt from defined benefit plans. At 30.8 %, the equity ratio is below the value as of December 31, 2023 of 35.8 % due to the balance sheet increase described above.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS\n\nThe cash flow from operating activities was € -110.9 million in the 2023 financial year, and was therefore significantly below the previous year's value of € 280.3 million, which was primarily attributable to the increase in working capital. The cash outflow from investments amounted to € -302.1 million and was higher overall than the previous year's figure of € -283.1 million. This increase was mainly due to the higher payments for the acquisition of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (effect € -66.4 million).\n\nAs has already been explained, in the motorcycle sector the costs of inventories for dealers rose sharply despite a good level of demand because of significantly higher interest rates. This meant that, in order to strengthen the dealer structure, extended payment terms and higher discounts had to be granted to the dealers. Thanks to its sufficient liquidity reserves, PIERER Mobility AG was able to provide appropriate support to both its dealers and its suppliers in order to stabilize their financial situation and to lessen the significantly increased burdens resulting from increased interest rates. The associated negative impact on free cash flow, which amounted to € -413.0 million in 2023 (previous year: € -2.8 million), was deliberately accepted.\n\nAfter taking the cash flow from financing activities of € 398.7 million into account, liquid funds decreased by € 19.8 million (including foreign currency effects of € -5.4 million) to € 259.0 million compared to December 31, 2022.\n\nThanks to the strong equity base and long-term financing, sufficient liquidity reserves are available on a sustainable basis.\n\n#### INVESTMENTS\n\nIn the current financial year, total investments in the PIERER Mobility Group amounted to € 316.5 million (previous year: € 293.4 million) including IFRS 16 lease additions of € 32.5 million (previous year: € 25.9 million). The investments excluding leasing projects were divided between development projects (incl. tools), property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as follows:\n\nImage /page/12/Figure/7 description: The image shows a stacked bar chart comparing financial data for FY 2023 and FY 2022. For FY 2023, the total is 284.0 Mio. Euro, broken down as follows: intangible assets (32.6), property, plant, and equipment (56.3), and R&D (incl. tools) (195.1). For FY 2022, the total is 267.5 Mio. Euro, broken down as follows: intangible assets (44.0), property, plant, and equipment (62.1), and F&E (incl. tools) (161.4).\n\nAs usual, high investments were made in series development projects (including tools) in the past financial year. The investments in development projects (incl. tools) as a percentage of total investments were 69 %, which was above the previous year's level (previous year: 60 %). The consistently high investments in series product development represent one of the key success factors of the PIERER Mobility Group. At 20 %, investments in infrastructure (property, plant and equipment) were also slightly below the previous year's level of 23 %. Another 11 % (previous year: 17 %) was attributable to intangible assets (IT and licenses).\n\nThe investments made in recent years have safeguarded the production capacities required for the years ahead. The focus of the investments has been and still is, therefore, on other types of projects, in particular on the (further) development of existing and new models, electric mobility and high-tech modernization. These are currently and will continue to be the PIERER Mobility Group's top priority for investments. In line with strategic goals, expenditure on investments in research and development will remain at the already high level of the last few years.\n\nOne of the most significant single investments in the 2022 financial year was the continued construction and completion of the new headquarters of KTM North America in Murrieta, California. The company site has been built over an area of approximately 14,000 m² and houses office and motorsport buildings as well as warehouse space. The opening ceremony took place in Murrieta on March 28, 2023. With a total level of investment of around USD 55 million, this represents one of the largest single investments that the PIERER Mobility Group has ever made.\n\nAs in previous years, major investment projects in 2023 were primarily development projects and the purchase of tools and equipment.\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-13-0\"></span>4.

RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT AND NEW MODELS\n\nFor PIERER Mobility AG, as the leading manufacturer of premium powered two-wheeler (PTW) vehicles in Europe, it is our declared goal to further expand our leading role in the world of motorcycling in terms of technology, sales, and image. We have been particularly focused on the area of research and development for several years. The result of the R&D strategy we have pursued is innovative products that meet our customers' high expectations in technology and performance. At the same time, it makes it possible for us to develop new markets in a manner that ensures lasting success.\n\nParticularly high priority is given to the early recognition of trends in the powered two-wheeler (PTW) segment and the further development of the product range from a technical and functional perspective. At the same time, we have a strong commitment to tracking, recognizing and implementing customer requirements with regard to the PIERER Mobility Group's products and services. This enables us to further build on the pioneering role we have developed in the past and to ensure a market-oriented product development strategy.\n\nThanks to the globally active research and development organization, the PIERER Mobility Group has a network of highly qualified employees – for instance in the construction, computation and simulation sectors. This network is supported by the in-house machinery and equipment that performs the production, construction and validation of newly developed prototypes. This combination allows us to react with a high degree of flexibility to changing requirements and the level of complexity associated with this.\n\nAs of the reporting date of December 31, 2023, the company employed 1,302 people (previous year: 976 employees), representing 21.1 % of the total workforce. In operational terms, excluding the ancillary effect of capitalization and amortization of development expenses, 9.2 % of total revenue was spent on research and development, corresponding in absolute figures to € 244.4 million (previous year: € 213.2 million).\n\nThe research and development division of the PIERER Mobility Group, which is brought together within KTM Forschungs & Entwicklungs GmbH (KTM F&E GmbH), is organized globally with decentralized locations in Europe (especially Austria and Spain) and America. The development programs are centrally managed at the R&D headquarters in Mattighofen and in Munderfing, where the majority of our employees from the research and development department are based. The research and development center at the headquarters in Mattighofen is an innovation site with a floor space of over 20,000 m² where pioneering products for the powersport segment are designed, developed and tested using the latest methods and equipment.\n\nIn organizational terms, KTM Technologies GmbH, with its registered office in Anif near Salzburg, is part of KTM F&E GmbH and is regarded as a specialist in future mobility, particularly in the areas of concept and technology development and lightweight construction. The success factor is the application-oriented development of new solutions and technologies. KTM Technologies GmbH possesses great expertise in vehicle concept development, including the use of multi-material, composite and additive manufacturing technologies. As an innovation hub, it works closely with KTM F&E GmbH and customers from other industrial sectors. Its partners and customers include established OEMs and start-ups from sectors such as automotive and aerospace, mechanical engineering and the sporting goods industry. Thanks to the cross-industry service portfolio, both the group and third-party customers benefit from a broad spectrum of expertise and opportunities for technology transfer.\n\nWhen the KTM Freeride E was launched on the market in 2014, the PIERER Mobility Group was considered a pioneer in the field of electric mobility. In recent years, the range of electric vehicles in various performance categories has been extended to all brands in the group. The development of electric motorcycle models is largely carried out at the in-house center of excellence in Anif near Salzburg.\n\nBecause motorcycles with electric drive systems are still subject to significant practical restrictions due to their low power density, one of the key work packages for research over the past year was to reduce the exhaust and noise emissions of the PIERER Mobility Group's range of internal combustion engines. To continue operating in the premium vehicle segments with high performance and range requirements as dynamically as before, the projects included in-depth examination of future-proof synthetic fuels known as e-fuels and testing of fuels with increased bioethanol content.\n\nThe noise emissions of motorcycles have become an important acceptance criterion for this vehicle category in recent years. As uniform type approval standards have not yet been specified for off-road sports motorcycles, research into the noise sources of these models and solutions derived from this for significantly reducing noise emissions was continued in the 2023 financial year.\n\nWith regard to exhaust emissions, work began to develop a new generation of power packs (performance class 110-170 kW) for the 2029 model year. The aim of the project is to reduce CO2 consumption in the WMTC cycle by 20-35 % compared to the previous model. A top-down strategy is to be devised for series use of the new power packs. The first step will be to equip the premium models with this powertrain starting in 2029. In subsequent model years, the intention will be to use this power pack generation in other segments as well.\n\nKTM F&E GmbH continues its commitment as a founding member of the Swappable Batteries Motorcycle Consortium (SBMC). The aim is to meet customer expectations for range, charging time and\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\ncosts through international standardization of the battery system, thus making an important contribution to the further spread of electrified mobility concepts in urban living areas. Whereas activities in 2022 focused mainly on the definition of uniform technical specifications for the battery system within the member base, activities in 2023 included the development of battery prototypes by selected suppliers. The main objective of the first phase of prototyping is to validate and refine the specifications.\n\nVirtualization of product development is an important building block for reducing development times, costs and quality risks. Ultimately, the physical testing of components and complete vehicles on corresponding test benches is an indispensable part of the testing of new products. For this purpose, a test area covering 300 m² operates at the Anif site in order to ensure quality assurance of the products during development.\n\nThe modular electronics platform initiative, which was launched in 2022, continued in 2023 and was actually marketed in the first few vehicles, such as the 1390 SUPER DUKE R. The aim of this modular platform is to create standardized interfaces in order to guarantee that components can be replaced rapidly.\n\nConnectivity features that enable data exchange between the vehicle and accessories such as smartphones have undergone intense development in recent years and are now regarded as indispensable features, especially in the premium segment. In addition to the development of convenience functions such as telephony and navigation, a key part of the activities over the year under review were the development and testing of systems for communication between the motorcycle and other vehicles, or between the motorcycle and road infrastructure such as traffic lights. In addition, research was also conducted into the use of (vehicle) data, particularly in the context of product development. For example, the procurement, production and maintenance of physical prototypes involves a considerable expenditure of resources. By introducing virtual development methods, the expense involved in testing physical components and assemblies right through to the complete vehicle can be significantly reduced, while also improving the resulting product. These virtual approaches can be applied to digitalization in lamp development, for example.\n\nAnother pillar of the development philosophy that the company pursues is using high-quality materials in all vehicles, resulting in a reduction in vehicle weight and the associated potential for reducing fuel consumption and emissions and improving ridability. For example, intensive efforts in recent years have made it possible to further reduce the weight of our offroad competition models with each generation. Among the many research and development\n\nprojects in the development of materials and surfaces, work was carried out on developing and testing wheels and chassis components made of fiber-reinforced composites, as well as on further developing the manufacturing process for plastic parts with design elements featuring hybrid construction.\n\n#### MOTORCYCLE MODELS\n\nThe 2023 financial year was very much defined by a major model rollout with a total of 72 new and revised models from the three core brands KTM, Husqvarna and GASGAS.\n\nFollowing its success in 2021, the KTM 1290 SUPER DUKE RR returned as a limited-edition special model in the first quarter of 2023. In 2022, the partnership between KTM and BRABUS was sealed with the presentation of the BRABUS 1300 R to enable BRABUS to compete in the world of motorcycle racing. This cooperation continued with the introduction of the BRABUS 1300 R Masterpiece Edition.\n\nThe KTM Enduro range for the 2024 model year bears testament to many years at the pinnacle of Enduro motorsport and is a dynamic blend of racing performance, ergonomics and the leading technology in the industry. The new model generation features a brand-new look and a new chassis concept, revised engines with the new throttle body fuel injection for two-stroke engines and a new generation of WP chassis elements, providing a better riding experience and greater comfort for riders of all ages and skill levels.\n\nKTM celebrated the rebirth of an icon with the KTM 890 SMT 2023. The motorcycle with the overhauled LC8c platform was developed to be the very best in the Supermoto Touring segment in terms of power, torque and weight. This model is positioned between the KTM ADVENTURE and KTM STREET product series.\n\nIn the second half of the year, a new, Euro5+-compliant generation of the DUKE model series featuring new 125, 250, 390, 990 and 1390 models was also unveiled. The new LC4c platform (125 & 390 DUKE) offers a segment-leading power/weight ratio and electronic assistance systems with two-channel ABS and lean-angle-dependent traction control. The new 990 DUKE is based on a new generation of the LC8c engine with 123 hp and 103 Nm of torque as well as a newly developed electronic platform with state-of-the-art assistance systems and an LED projector headlight with daytime running light to provide an unmistakable DUKE signature. The new 1390 SUPER DUKE R is also based on an enhanced LC8 engine with new camshift technology that enabled a further increase in performance to 190 hp & 145 Nm of torque without increasing the bike's weight. In addition,\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\nthe 1390 SUPER DUKE R EVO has been given a revised WP APEX chassis with semi-active technology that enables electronic adjustment of the chassis, enhanced performance while maintaining a high level of comfort while riding, and lots more adjustment options.\n\nIn March 2023, Husqvarna Motorcycles presented the Norden 901 Expedition, a powerful touring motorcycle equipped with an array of convenient functions, designed for use both on the road and off-road. In the last quarter of 2023, the Skutta, an electric scooter for urban conurbations, was also presented and this is just the first step in a major rollout of Husqvarna models for the street segment in 2024.\n\nIn the Enduro model range for the 2024 model year, Husqvarna Motorcycles presented nine completely redesigned machines featuring the latest technology and advanced electronics so it can continue to set new standards in the offroad segment. A variety of technical accessories and apparel added the finishing touch to the market launch of the current two-stroke and four-stroke models. The new TE 300 Pro & FE 350 Pro special models have specifications with additional technical accessories for hard-enduro competitions, making them the perfect choice for competitive customers.\n\nThe last quarter also saw the unveiling of a new generation of the popular 50cc & 65cc sports minicycles featuring a new look, new chassis and redesigned engines for junior offroad competitions.\n\nGASGAS also presented a new generation of its Motocross, Enduro and Cross Country model range for 2024 with 16 dirt bikes based on the current off-road platform and supplemented this with innovative, battery-powered products in the form of the MC-E 1.12, MC-E 1.16 and MC-E 1.20. These electric balance bikes, designed specifically for children from the age of three, enable children to learn how to ride two-wheeled vehicles safely while having fun, and they are equipped with a quick-swap battery system to guarantee almost uninterrupted riding. The three new models are also available for the KTM and Husqvarna Motorcycles brands.\n\nThe transfer to series production of electrically powered motorcycle models was completed across all brands with the KTM SX-E 2, Husqvarna EE 2 and GASGAS MC-E 2 as well as the KTM SX E3, HUSQVARNA EE3 and GASGAS MC E-3 models.\n\n#### BICYCLE MODELS\n\nThe first half of 2023 also saw the release of a series of redesigned products and a number of technical innovations in the bicycle division. Husqvarna E-Bicycles focuses on innovative electric mobility solutions to tap into promising new markets worldwide. The Mountain Cross 6 (MC6), which was unveiled in 2022, is the template for future product innovations and strengthens the position that Husqvarna E-Bicycles occupies in the e-MTB sector. The new Light Cross 6 (LC6) expands the range of models in the off-road segment. Specific PG&A items and several new product lines complete the Urban Range and Allroad model segment. In October 2023, the new MY24 Husqvarna E-MTBs were presented.\n\nGASGAS E-Bicycles is building on the success of the GASGAS brand in the motorcycle segment. With its powerful E-MTBs for off-road routes, the brand was also able to expand its reach worldwide in the first quarter of 2023, following a successful financial year in 2022. The experience gained from off-road motorsport along with the knowledge of technologies and materials will play an even greater role in the development of new electrified New Mobility products. The new GASGAS ECC Race prototype was presented at the Sea Otter Festival in Monterey, California. It is an e-mountain bike that features lots of new specifications and components.\n\nIn June 2023, PIERER New Mobility displayed more new models along with product developments in the bicycle and New Mobility segments at EUROBIKE in Frankfurt. Alongside a new model from the Grand City series for urban and all-road mobility from Husqvarna E-Bicycles, GASGAS Bicycles unveiled the MOTO Urban Cruiser, a beach cruiser designed with a Supermoto look.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-17-0\"></span>6. OPPORTUNITIES AND RISK REPORT\n\nThe business activities of the PIERER Mobility Group are characterized by ongoing changes. Exploiting the opportunities that these changes present is the essential cornerstone of the success of the PIERER Mobility Group. In order to secure the future success of the business and exploit the opportunities that arise, the group must consciously take risks.\n\nThe management of opportunities and risks is the basis for responding appropriately to changes in the underlying political, economic, technical or legal conditions. Where it is likely that the opportunities or risks identified will occur, they have already been incorporated into the statements made in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the group management report. The following statements include possible future developments or events that could lead to a positive (opportunities) or negative (risks) deviation from the company forecast for the PIERER Mobility Group.\n\nAs part of risk management, all individual and cumulative risks that could jeopardize the success of the company are monitored and controlled. Risks that could jeopardize the company as a going concern are generally avoided. The scope of risk consolidation corresponds to the scope of consolidation of the consolidated financial statements of the PIERER Mobility Group.\n\n#### RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe main purpose of the PIERER Mobility Group's risk management system is to safeguard and strengthen the company by correctly and transparently assessing financial, operational and strategic risks. In this context, the Executive Board, together with the management of the main group companies – in particular KTM AG, performs extensive management and controlling tasks within the framework of an internal, integrated control system that covers all major sites. Recognizing, evaluating and responding to strategic and operational risks promptly is an essential part of the management activities of these units and adds significant value to the company. The basis for this is a uniform, group-wide, regular reporting system and ongoing monitoring of operational and strategic plans.\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group has a multi-level risk management system in which group-wide risks are identified by division or geographical area. Operational responsibility and the assessment of group-wide risks is carried out by the risk management of KTM AG and local management and is reported directly to and monitored by the Executive Board and the Group Executive Board.\n\nPreventive analysis of potential events is another aim of risk management. In addition, risk management is also responsible for actively controlling risks and defining and evaluating appropriate measures with the business units concerned.\n\n#### RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group bases its risk management strategy on the COSO® framework. Accordingly, the group has defined the following core areas of the risk management strategy:\n\n| Risk<br>Identification       | • Structured recording of opportunities and individual risks in the sectors<br>• Implementation of risk workshops<br>• Identification takes place, among other things, by means of the standard risk catalog |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Risk<br>Assessment           | • Failure mode and effect analysis<br>• Extend of damage and probability of occurrence                                                                                                                       |\n| Risk<br>Control              | • Control of the overall risk position by influencing opportunities and<br>individual risk<br>• Control of the effectiveness of measures                                                                     |\n| Reporting<br>+<br>Monitoring | • Continuous monitoring<br>• Collection, evaluation, forwarding of information<br>• Reporting                                                                                                                |\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\nRisk management established at the level of KTM AG regularly carries out risk analyses. Only risks that deviate from the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated income statement are presented.\n\n## ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\n\nEnterprise Risk Management in the PIERER Mobility Group is a continuous process that is used to identify and evaluate, analyze and report, define and track measures in relation to the operational and strategic risks and opportunities across the group. This forms the basis for a standard, group-wide reporting system and ensures ongoing monitoring of operational and strategic risks.\n\nThe group has a multi-level risk management process in which group-wide risks are identified by areas. The Risk Management department is responsible for ensuring that the information is implemented and kept up-to-date. The information about the risk situation is provided by the risk owners from each department. The Risk Management department reports directly to the Executive Board of KTM AG. It and the Group Executive Board are provided with a regular report on the overall risk situation for monitoring purposes.\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities are considered and taken into account equally in the following process steps:\n\n#### Identification & assessment\n\nThe risks and opportunities are identified as part of the risk assessments, managed at the level of KTM AG. These risk assessments discuss and identify climate-related risks and opportunities in equal measure, as well as financial, operational or strategic risks, with the affected risk owners from each department.\n\nThe aim of the risk assessment is to perform continuous, qualitative and quantitative evaluation of all identified opportunities and risks in order to prioritize risk control measures. Opportunity and risk assessment at the PIERER Mobility Group should meet the following requirements:\n\n- Objectivity: The assessment should be performed according to standards that are as objective as possible.\n- Comparability: To allow the opportunities and risks to be compared with each other, a quantitative assessment is made using uniformly defined values (where reasonable and possible)\n\nIn principle, the risks and opportunities are assessed to identify how likely they are to occur and the level of damage to the group's asset position, financial position and earnings position, using a scenario-based approach consisting of best case (BC), realistic case (RC) and worst case (WC). The quantification can be based on\n\n(a) risks that have actually occurred in the past, (b) benchmark values from the industry, or (c) expert assessments. The choice of the relevant distribution depends on the type of risk, but in most cases this will equate to a PERT distribution. In addition to the quantitative assessment of risks and opportunities, the methodology also envisages making a qualitative assessment, which is particularly useful in relation to climate-related and environment-related risks and opportunities.\n\n#### RISK ASSESSMENT\n\n#### Analysis & reporting\n\nThe structured consolidation of the overall risk inventory is followed by a Monte Carlo simulation, which produces the overall risk situation and the key figures that are needed. In addition, the biggest risks and opportunities for the group are identified to complete the picture. Of course, this also includes the main climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\n#### Definition & tracking of measures\n\nThe main objective of risk mitigation is to ensure an active, continuous, and controlled influence on the risks and opportunities, taking account of the corporate strategy and economic viability, in order to deliberately manage the company's overall risk exposure and thus produce an increase in the value of the company over the long term. Risks are minimized, avoided or even consciously taken in certain cases by adopting appropriate measures; the strategy is defined and evaluated by the respective risk owner. The Risk Management department is regularly informed about the status of the measures. The measures and objectives for climate-related risks and opportunities are defined in cooperation with the ESG department.\n\n#### Ad-hoc reporting\n\nIf there are ad-hoc changes to the risk situation, the Risk Management department must be notified immediately by the risk owners of the specialist departments and be kept informed.\n\nBased on this, the risk and opportunity management strategy is developed.\n\n#### Risk monitoring / control\n\nThe essence of operational risk management is to identify, evaluate and control significant risks arising from operations. This process is carried out in particular by the senior and middle management levels of KTM AG and monitored by the Executive Board of PIERER Mobility AG.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### OPPORTUNITIES AND RISK REPORT\n\nThe following overview provides a general summary of the main risks and opportunities identified and thus shows their significance to the PIERER Mobility Group and the corresponding packages of measures. Overall, the PIERER Mobility Group has not identified any risks that could jeopardize its continued existence as a going concern, neither on the reporting date nor at the time that the financial statements were prepared.\n\n| Risks/opportunities                      | Description

DISCLOSURES PURSUANT TO SECTION 243A (1) OF THE AUSTRIAN COMMERCIAL CODE (UGB)\n\n- 1. The share capital is EUR 33,796,535, and is divided into 33,796,535 bearer shares with voting rights, where every ordinary share has an equal stake in the share capital. The shares grant the customary rights due to stockholders under the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. These include the right to payout of the dividends resolved upon at the Annual General Meeting as well as the right to vote at the Annual General Meeting. All the shares of PIERER Mobility AG have been listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX) in the International Reporting Standard since November 14, 2016 (ISIN AT0000KTMI02). Since March 1, 2022, the shares of PIERER Mobility AG have additionally been listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange (Official Market). There was no change in the company's share capital in the 2023 financial year. Likewise, no treasury shares were acquired or sold, which is why the company did not hold any treasury shares as of the reporting date of December 31, 2023.\n- 2.

The 2021 Syndicate Agreement provides that the rules of procedure for the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of Pierer Bajaj AG require the approval of the Supervisory Board members of Pierer Bajaj AG nominated by Bajaj in the event of a transfer of ownership of shares in PIERER Mobility AG. Pierer Bajaj AG, which is economically attributable to Stefan Pierer, is thus subject to restrictions on disposal in light of the syndicate agreement at the level of Pierer Bajaj AG. The Executive Board is not aware of any other restrictions affecting voting rights or the transfer of shares.\n- 3.

The capital increase may only be carried out to the extent that the creditors of financial instruments make use of their options of conversion and/or pre-emption rights on company shares. The issue amount and the exchange ratio are to be determined in accordance with recognized methods of financial mathematics and the share price in a recognized pricing procedure. The newly issued shares of the conditional capital increase are entitled to dividends to the same extent as the existing shares in the company. The Executive Board is authorized, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to determine the further details of the implementation of the conditional capital increase. The Supervisory Board is authorized to resolve amendments to the articles of association resulting from the issue of shares from the conditional capital.\n\nThe conditional capital increase serves the purpose of servicing any convertible bond issued and may explicitly be implemented only to the extent that the creditors of convertible bonds exercise their conversion and/or subscription rights to shares in the company.\n\nThis conditional capital increase is for issuing new shares to creditors of financial instruments pursuant to Section 174 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, which are issued using the authorization granted in the Annual General Meeting held on April 21, 2023 by the company. This authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting on April 21, 2023 to issue financial instruments pursuant to Section 174 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act has not yet been used.\n\nThe following resolutions were also passed by the Annual General Meeting on April 21, 2023 in relation to the acquisition and sale of treasury shares:\n\n- d) Pursuant to Section 65(1)(8) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Executive Board is authorized for a period of 30 months from the date when the resolution was passed to acquire treasury shares of the company both on and off the stock exchange, also excluding the shareholders' right to offer shares on a quota basis, and, without having to refer the matter to the Annual General Meeting again in advance, to retire these shares if necessary with the approval of the Supervisory Board. Trading in treasury shares is excluded as a purpose of the acquisition. The proportion of shares to be acquired may not exceed 10 % of the share capital. The value received per no-par-value share to be acquired may not be more than 20 % below or above the average unweighted closing price on the SIX Swiss Exchange over the past 10 trading days. The authorization may be exercised in whole or in part or in several installments and in pursuit of one or more purposes by the company, by affiliated companies or by third parties for the account of the company. The Supervisory Board is authorized to adopt amendments to the Articles of Association resulting from the redemption of shares.\n- e) The Executive Board is authorized for a period of five years from the date when the resolution was passed, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to sell or use treasury shares in a way other than via the stock exchange or by means of a public offer for any legally permissible purpose and in so doing also to exclude the shareholders' quota-based purchase right (exclusion of subscription rights) and to determine the terms and conditions of disposal. The authorization may be exercised in whole or in part or in several installments and in pursuit of one or more purposes.\n- 8. Any agreements on the part of the company which would take effect, change or cease to apply in the case of a change in the controlling interest in the company as a result of a public takeover offer, or the effects thereof, will not be disclosed by the company due to the fact that it would considerably harm the company.\n- 9.

MAIN FEATURES OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM PURSUANT TO SECTION 243A (2) OF THE AUSTRIAN COMMERCIAL CODE (UGB)\n\nThe internal control system of the PIERER Mobility Group has the task of ensuring the correctness and reliability of financial reporting, compliance with the legal and internal regulations relevant to the company, as well as the effectiveness and efficiency of operational activities, including the protection of assets from losses due to damages and malversations. Internationally accepted frameworks for internal control systems (e.g. COSO framework) have been considered in designing the elements of the internal control system. The system comprises:\n\n- Group-wide specifications for financial reporting\n- Segregation of duties as an organizational measure\n- System-based and process-dependent controls\n- Process-independent controls\n- Management of risks relating to the preparation of financial statements\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group is committed to the continuous development and improvement of the internal control system. To this end, its functionality is regularly monitored through process and data analyses as well as independent, external audit activities. The main features of the internal control system with regard to the financial reporting process are presented below.\n\n#### CONTROL ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe organizational structure of the PIERER Mobility Group forms the basis for the control environment and the internal control system within the company. In terms of the organizational structure in (group) financial reporting, there are clear areas of competence and responsibility at the various management and hierarchical levels of the group. On the one hand, this relates to the group headquarters in Wels as well as the Austrian and all international subsidiaries. Treasury and Business Process Finance are located in the operating areas of the group, with duties and responsibilities also being clearly divided here.\n\nThe strong international orientation of the PIERER Mobility Group and the associated decentralized structures of the company and different sites are taken into account by centralizing key corporate functions in the area of financial reporting at the Austrian sites (especially in Mattighofen). The performance and management of national business activities is the responsibility of the respective local management and is monitored by the Executive Board of KTM AG and the Group Executive Board.\n\nIn terms of process organization, the PIERER Mobility Group relies on a distinctive and comprehensive set of accounting, valuation and account assignment rules. This provides an appropriate basis for a strong control environment and control system. New accounting standards are assessed with regard to their impact on the financial reporting of the PIERER Mobility Group. The specifications for financial reporting and financial reporting processes are reviewed on an ongoing basis and adjusted at least annually, or more frequently if necessary. Monitoring compliance with the controls and regulations relating to financial reporting is the responsibility of the relevant management.\n\n#### RISK ASSESSMENT\n\nRisks relating to the financial reporting process are identified and monitored by the management and taken into account in the risk management process. The focus here is on those risks that are to be considered material.\n\nMaterial risks in the area of financial reporting include incomplete recording of facts relevant to accounting, errors in document recording, and incorrect calculations. Complex accounting principles could lead to an increased risk of error, incorrect reporting, and late preparation of financial statements. There is also a risk of data being accessed by unauthorized persons or of data being manipulated, IT systems failing, and data being lost.\n\nFor the preparation of the financial statements, estimates have to be made on a regular basis and there is an inherent risk that future developments may deviate from these estimates. This applies in particular to the following matters/items in the consolidated financial statements: Social capital, outcome of legal disputes, recoverability of receivables, investments and stocks. In some cases, external experts are consulted or publicly available sources are used to minimize the risk of incorrect estimates.\n\n#### CONTROL MEASURES\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group has integrated its controls directly into the (group) financial reporting processes. An essential element of this, in addition to process-independent external control\n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\nmechanisms, is the principle of segregation of duties. To ensure complete, timely and correct preparation of the financial statements, quality assurance and control measures have been implemented in all areas involved in the accounting process. All control measures are applied in the ongoing business process to ensure that potential errors in financial reporting are prevented or are detected and corrected. Furthermore, the application of internal company guidelines results in consistent handling of business transactions as well as consistent accounting and reporting.\n\nControls are integrated in the key IT systems with a relevance for financial reporting which prevent, among other things, the incorrect recording of business transactions, ensure the complete recording of business transactions or the measurement of business transactions in accordance with the financial reporting requirements, or support the verification of consolidation. In view of the increasing demands on IT systems in financial reporting as well as the constantly growing technical possibilities, the PIERER Mobility Group regularly conducts IT-supported analyses of the effectiveness of the measures taken in order to identify and subsequently eliminate any control weaknesses that may have occurred.\n\nControl measures relating to IT security are a cornerstone of the internal control system. For example, the separation of sensitive activities is supported by restricting the allocation of IT authorizations. Automated checks take place through the ERP software used, such as the automated checks for invoice approval and invoice verification.\n\n### COMMUNICATION AND MONITORING\n\nResponsibility for the effectiveness of the internal control system in the (group) financial reporting process is clearly defined and lies with the responsible managers and process owners. In addition to the results of the internal assessment, the assessment of effectiveness also includes the results of external audits, e.g., as part of the audit of the annual financial statements or external IT security audits, as well as those of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee. Weaknesses in the control system are remedied taking into account their potential impact on the financial reporting processes.\n\nIn addition to the financial statements required by law, which are made available to management levels, the group has also implemented a comprehensive internal reporting system that is prepared and distributed at different levels of aggregation depending on the recipient of the report.\n\nOther central instruments of risk monitoring and control are the company-wide guidelines on dealing with significant risks, the planning and controlling processes, and ongoing reporting. The guidelines include the setting and control of limits and actions to limit financial risks, as well as the strict specification of the dual control principle for invoice and payment approvals.\n\nIn addition, the internal control system is based on precise information about the accounting and financial reporting processes and also includes their upstream business processes, e.g. purchase requisitions or logistics processes. The effectiveness of the internal control system is reviewed by management in that the results, which are submitted to management in condensed reporting form, are analyzed, evaluated and commented on by management.\n\nThe Executive Board and the Audit Committee are informed annually about the assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control system in financial reporting. In the event of significant changes in the effectiveness of the internal control system, a report is submitted immediately to the Executive Board and, if necessary, to the Supervisory Board, and suitable measures are taken to increase its effectiveness.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-27-0\"></span>9. OUTLOOK\n\n#### BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT\n\nFollowing the trend from 2022, the KTM, Husqvarna Motorcycles and GASGAS brands were able to largely expand their market shares in the relevant sales markets in 2023. In addition, the group expects the motorcycle market to continue to grow in the medium to long term and to display a positive trend overall for the high-quality premium products that it sells.\n\nThe challenges that arose in the 2022 financial year in the group's international supply chains eased considerably in 2023 and are not expected to cause any major disruption for the group in the 2024 financial year. The measures that the KTM AG Group has put in place are thus having an effect as the consequences of last year's situation have been largely mitigated with the supplier risk assessment. In addition to other measures and the reasons identified for problems in the supply chain in the past, the procurement strategy has been adapted and the procurement risk has been reduced, particularly by having direct access to the Asian market and continuing to focus on the European market.\n\nFor the 2024 financial year, the PIERER Mobility Group expects that the global economic environment will continue to be difficult, driven not least by ongoing significantly high rates of inflation and wage and salary trends, with far-reaching effects on pricing worldwide. For the group, 2024 will be a year of consolidation, which will be used to strengthen the core business. As part of this, the PIERER Mobility Group expects revenue for the 2024 financial year to be at a similar level as in the previous year and an EBIT margin of 5-7 %.\n\nTo safeguard the group's profitability, management will implement cost-cutting measures amounting to tens of millions in the 2024 financial year. These measures include, in particular, a greater focus on the core business of powered two-wheelers (motorcycles and electrified mobility products) with the premium brands KTM, GASGAS and Husqvarna as well as MV Agusta.\n\nAs another key measure for cutting costs, parts of production for individual mid-range models and certain research and development activities are being relocated to the strategic partner Bajaj Auto, India, and to CFMOTO, China. This applies to products (street motorcycles) in markets that are very price-sensitive and competitive. The range of models produced at Bajaj to date (between 125 and 390 cubic centimeters) will be expanded. Street motorcycles ranging from 790 to 950cc will be assembled at the company's Chinese partner CFMOTO. The group expects that this will not just deliver cost benefits, but also speed up processes of development and industrialization.\n\nThese measures will be accompanied, among other things, by a reduction in the number of employees, with up to 300 jobs going in Mattighofen and Munderfing. This will be achieved in particular by no longer using temporary workers as well as by employees leaving the company due to natural turnover.\n\nAs a result of the strategic changes described above, the reported sub-divisions will be restructured from the 2024 financial year onwards. In the future, the focus will be on the \"Motorcycles\" and \"E-Mobility\" segments. In addition to electrified New Mobility products, the new \"E-Mobility\" segment will include all electrically powered two-wheelers such as electric motorcycles, e-minis and stand-up scooters.\n\n#### INVESTMENTS\n\nThe investments made in recent years have safeguarded the production capacities required for the years ahead. The focus of the investments has been and still is, therefore, on other types of projects, in particular on the (further) development of existing and new models, electric mobility and high-tech modernization. These are currently and will continue to be the group's top priority for investments. In line with strategic goals, expenditure on investments in research and development will remain at the already high level of previous years.\n\nImportant investments planned are also the procurement of tools, in particular for planned research and development projects, investments in digital distribution platforms for dealers and end customers as well as the modernization, expansion, improvement and digitalization of existing production capacities.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n### ADEQUATE FINANCIAL POSITION\n\nThe current liquidity reserves combined with a balanced mix of different financial instruments will enable the group to continue to operate flexibly in a volatile market environment in 2024. In this regard, the available liquidity reserves were increased significantly for the short and long term. For example, in the 2023 financial year, the KTM Group issued a promissory note loan with a volume of EUR 300 million and a registered bond with a volume of EUR 50 million.\n\nThe group is also affected by the consequences of the current trend in interest rates and the interest rate risk is evaluated regularly. Measures were also taken to manage the interest rate risk. The PIERER Mobility Group expects to see interest rates fall from their currently high level in the medium term.\n\nWels, March 14, 2024\n\nThe Executive Board of PIERER Mobility AG\n\nthe\n\nStefan Pierer Hubert Trunkenpolz Viktor Sigl\n\nImage /page/28/Picture/13 description: The image shows a signature in black ink on a white background.

These are the following standards and interpretations:\n\n| NEW OR AMENDED STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS                                                   | IASB DATE OF<br>APPLICATION | PUBLISHED<br>BY THE IASB | EU ENDORSEMENT? |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|\n| Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 – Supplier Finance Arrangements                                 | January 1, 2024             | May 25, 2023             | No              |\n| Amendments to IAS 21 – Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates<br>Lack of Exchangeability | January 1, 2025             | August 15, 2023          | No              |\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group assumes that there will be no material impact on the consolidated financial statements from the standards to be applied in the future.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-43-0\"></span>5. ESTIMATES AND DISCRETIONARY DECISIONS\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements, certain estimates and assumptions must be made that affect the recognized assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as at the reporting date, and the presentation of income and expenses for the financial year. In making estimates, the Executive Board takes account of empirical values and current forecasts. The amounts actually arising may differ from the estimates if assumed parameters develop contrary to expectations. If new conditions become known, they are duly taken into account and previous assumptions are revised.\n\n- In particular, assumptions are made to assess the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets of indeterminate useful life. Goodwill of EUR 131,735k (previous year: EUR 130,655k) was recognized at the reporting date, along with the \"KTM\" brand, which is valued at EUR 61,103k (previous year: EUR 61,103k), the \"GASGAS\" brand, which is valued at EUR 13,346k (previous year: EUR 13,346k), the \"MV Agusta\" brand, which is valued at EUR 20,165k (previous year: EUR 20,165k), and the \"JOHANSSON\" brand, which is valued at EUR 1,300k (previous year: EUR 0k). The \"FELT\" brand was classified as an asset held for sale and valued at EUR 3,700k. For further information, see the explanations in Note 21 \"Goodwill\", Note 22 \"Intangible assets\" and Note 30 \"Non-current assets held for sale\".\n- Deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards not subject to expiration are recognized based on the assumption that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the future to allow them to be utilized. Suitable allowances are made in the event of uncertainties in the assumptions. As of December 31, 2023, deferred tax assets on loss carryforwards of EUR 19,968k (previous year: EUR 1,747k) were capitalized. Based on current tax planning, the management expects that the loss carryforwards recognized as of December 31, 2023 will be utilized over the next five years. For further details on deferred taxes, see the explanations in Note 25 \"Deferred tax assets\".\n- In cash flow hedge accounting, assessments are made regarding the occurrence of future cash flows. The planning of future cash flows is derived from sales planning and order volume planning. It is reviewed against actual figures on a monthly basis and checked for plausibility using past experience. In line with the internal guideline on currency hedges, foreign currency hedges are generally entered into on a rolling basis and cover a period of up to 18 months. The hedge ratio of the individual currencies is determined based on uncertainty in the planning for the relevant market, on the volatility of the currency and on the hedging costs. Currencies are aggregated by type based on their significance (volume, relevance to results) and different methods are applied accordingly. A hedge ratio of 80 % of the foreign-currency exposure is targeted for each currency. Details on sensitivities in relation to\n\ncurrency and interest rate risks are provided in Note VII \"Financial risks\".\n\n- Furthermore, there is some uncertainty as to the estimation for the recognition and measurement of liabilities for employee benefits. Assumptions are made concerning the following factors: empirical values, demographic assumptions such as the retirement age of women/men and staff turnover, as well as financial assumptions such as the discount rate and future wage and salary trends. Liabilities for employee benefits of EUR 27,967k (previous year: EUR 26,154k) were recognized at the reporting date. For further information, see the explanations in Note 34 \"Liabilities for employee benefits\".\n- Estimates for provisions mainly relate to provisions relating to guarantees and warranties. To determine the amount of the provisions, a direct correlation was established for each product group between revenues and the guarantee and warranty expenses incurred. The percentage value of guarantee and warranty expenses in terms of revenue is checked several times a year and adjusted if necessary. As of December 31, 2023, provisions relating to guarantees and warranties of EUR 20,523k (previous year: EUR 20,947k) were recognized. For the changes in the provisions relating to guarantees and warranties, see Note 36 \"Provisions\".\n- The determination of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination and the useful lives of these assets is based on assessments by the management.\n- Leases\n- Assessments of the term and interest rates are made. Further details are provided under Note 23 \"Property, plant, and equipment\" and Note 48 \"Leases as lessee\".\n- Inventories are subject to estimates and discretionary decisions in connection with valuation (subsequent consumption methods and analyses of coverage). In addition, allowance requirements are recorded on a case-by-case basis due to long storage periods and limited sales possibilities.\n\nThe following judgments were made in respect of the application of accounting policies in the PIERER Mobility Group:\n\n• Development costs\n\nDevelopment costs are capitalized in accordance with the accounting policy presented. The initial capitalization of costs is based on management assumptions to assess the future economic benefit of the expenses incurred and the technical feasibility of the developed product or process, as well as its\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### marketability.\n\n- Derecognition of receivables in connection with ABS and factoring agreements. Evaluations were made with respect to the conditions for derecognition under IFRS 9. For further details, please refer to Section VIII. \"Financial instruments and capital management\".\n- Supplier finance\n\nAssessments were made regarding the disclosure of liabilities in relation to the supplier finance program. Further details are provided under Note 35 \"Other current and non-current liabilities and trade payables\".\n\n• Consolidation\n\nIn determining whether control exists in accordance with IFRS 10, management exercises judgments in determining the relevant activities of the subsidiaries..\n\n#### Impact of climate-related issues on financial reporting\n\nThe Executive Board takes account of the impact of climate change in preparing the consolidated financial statements. The assumptions to be made by management in the course of preparing the consolidated financial statements are always made in accordance with the long-term corporate planning that has been approved by the Executive Board. The long-term corporate planning also takes account of the climate-related risks and opportunities identified by the company based on the recommendations of the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nClimate-related aspects are significant in the context of preparing the consolidated financial statements – in particular with regard to assumptions, discretionary decisions and estimates regarding future developments that will affect the PIERER Mobility Group – and are taken into account accordingly by the management. This does not produce any fundamental changes to the assumptions or estimates for the consolidated financial statements of the PIERER Mobility Group as at December 31, 2023. The Executive Board estimates the potential impact of climate-related opportunities and risks on the consolidated financial statements under IFRS as follows:\n\n• Useful lives of non-financial assets:\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group has evaluated the extent to which the useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets could be affected by climate-related issues. In particular, an assessment was made to determine whether, on the basis of existing and forthcoming legal and regulatory requirements,\n\nindustrial plants can no longer be used to the extent that was originally envisaged. It was not possible to conclude that useful lives would be affected by external or internal obligations.\n\n• Impairment losses on assets:\n\nThe short-term and medium-term financial plans and thus the impairment tests are based on the business model with a focus on sustainability. The short-term and medium-term financial plans of the individual CGUs take appropriate account of assumptions made regarding climate-related factors in capital expenditure programs (CAPEX), technologies and production processes for achieving the group's internal climate targets, and in the ecologically sustainable product mix based on them, in line with the \"Right Vehicle, Right Place, Right Energy Carrier\" concept.\n\n• Provisions and contingent liabilities: In the 2023 financial year, the PIERER Mobility Group did not incur any new obligations arising from the violation of climate protection laws and/or climate regulations that would have required the recognition of a provision or the disclosure of a contingent liability.\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group is constantly adapting its sustainability goals to reflect evolving requirements and technological changes or to take account of future business plans or strategies. As the potential impact of regulatory requirements, technological changes or future plans and strategies that have not yet been announced and their operationalization, including the reallocation of resources, cannot be estimated, the consolidated financial statements may be affected by these developments in future periods.\n\n#### Impact of the Russian-Ukrainian war:\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group's assessments of the impact of the war that is happening in Ukraine re-main unchanged from the previous year. The PIERER Mobility Group has not identified any significant reason to materially change its estimates and expectations as of December 31, 2023 on the basis of the war that is happening in Ukraine. The group does not have any investments, other assets or other material business relationships in Ukraine, Russia or Belarus, nor does the group have any material business relationships with suppliers or dealers in these countries. With this in mind, the company does not expect any material impact on the expected future cash flows. Equally, PIERER Mobility AG has not suffered, and does not expect to suffer, any loss of control, joint control or the ability to exercise significant influence over any entity as a result of the war or the sanctions that have been imposed.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-45-0\"></span>II. SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION\n\n#### 6. CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES AND METHODS\n\nAll subsidiaries are fully consolidated in the consolidated financial statements of PIERER Mobility AG. Subsidiaries are companies controlled by the group. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the moment control begins and until the moment control ends. Unless otherwise stated, the amount for non-controlling interests is recorded with the pro rata net assets of the acquired company without goodwill.\n\nInvestments in associates are included in the statement of financial position item \"Investments accounted for using the equity method\". The reporting currency of the PIERER Mobility Group is the euro. The subsidiaries and the holdings accounted for using the equity method prepare their annual financial statements in their functional currency. In this context, assets and liabilities included in the financial statements to be consolidated are translated using the average exchange rate on the reporting date and the income statement items are translated using the mean rate of exchange for the financial year. The following significant exchange rates for the PIERER Mobility Group were used for currency translation into the reporting currency:\n\n|                    | CLOSING RATE |            | AVERAGE RATE |          |\n|--------------------|--------------|------------|--------------|----------|\n|                    | 12/31/2023   | 12/31/2022 | 2023         | 2022     |\n| US-dollar          | 1.1050       | 1.0666     | 1.0829       | 1.0500   |\n| Swiss franc        | 0.9260       | 0.9847     | 0.9717       | 1.0017   |\n| Japanese yen       | 156.3300     | 140.6600   | 153.1758     | 138.1392 |\n| South African rand | 20.3477      | 18.0986    | 20.0410      | 17.2127  |\n| Mexican peso       | 18.7231      | 20.8560    | 19.0658      | 21.0536  |\n| Australian dollar  | 1.6263       | 1.5693     | 1.6347       | 1.5154   |\n| Chinese renminbi   | 7.8509       | 7.3582     | 7.6839       | 7.1543   |\n\n#### 7.

SEGMENT REPORTING\n\nThe business activities of PIERER Mobility AG are managed on the basis of the two \"Motorcycles\" and \"Bicycles\" divisions. The individual segments are managed separately and report to PIERER Mobility AG in accordance with IFRS accounting regulations. The main decision-maker for the segment report is the overall Executive Board of PIERER Mobility AG. The segment reporting is made with the segments Motorcycles, Bicycles and Others, according to the internal reporting.\n\n#### MOTORCYCLES:\n\nThe \"Motorcycles\" segment comprises the development, production and distribution of motorcycles under the \"KTM\", \"Husqvarna Motorcycles\" and \"GASGAS\" brands as well as components of the \"WP\" brand. As of December 31, 2023, the Motorcycles segment included 58 subsidiaries, located in Aus-tria, the United States, Japan, South Africa, Mexico, India, Australia and New Zealand and in various other European and Asian countries, which are included within the consolidated financial statements. In addition, interests are also held in assembly companies in the Philippines and China.\n\n#### BICYCLES:\n\nPIERER New Mobility GmbH together with its subsidiaries forms the \"Bicycles\" segment of the PIERER Mobility Group. With the \"Husqvarna E-Bicycles\", \"GASGAS Bicycles\", \"Liteville\" and \"Johansson\" brands, the focus is on developing, manufacturing and trading e-bicycles and bicycles.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT\n\nThe consolidated income statement is prepared according to the cost of sales method.\n\n#### 8. REVENUES\n\nRevenues, minus cash discounts, customer bonuses, and rebates, are generally recorded upon the passing of the risk as per the terms of the transaction (Incoterms) or at the time when performance was rendered.\n\nThe breakdown by geographical area of external revenues is based on the location of the customers. The revenues by geographical regions of the group are made up as follows:\n\n| EURK                     | 2023      | 202       |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Austria                  | 107,545   | 119,446   |\n| Europe (without Austria) | 1,340,260 | 1,013,850 |\n| North America and Mexico | 776,022   | 825,755   |\n| Other                    | 437,383   | 478,149   |\n|                          | 2,661,210 | 2,437,200 |\n\nVariable forms of consideration such as discounts, sales bonuses, and cash discounts are reported as revenue reductions. Variable consideration obligations are reported as contractual obligations within the meaning of IFRS 15. The contractual obligations for variable considerations in respect of price discounts, sales bonuses and cash discounts amounted to € 61.0 million as of December 31, 2023 (December 31, 2022: € 63.5 million).\n\nAs warranties are not sold separately, they only provide assurance that the products being sold meet the agreed specifications. As these warranties do not depart from the statutory warranty obligations or those that are typical of the industry in terms of their duration or their content, they are deemed to be assurance-type implied warranties, which do not constitute a separate performance obligation. Accordingly, the warranties continue to be recognized in accordance with IAS 37.\n\n#### 9.

INCOME TAXES\n\nThe group's income tax expense and income are attributable to current taxes and deferred taxes as follows:\n\n| EURK         | 2023    | 2022    |\n|--------------|---------|---------|\n| Current tax  | -12,982 | -34,626 |\n| Deferred tax | -2,738  | -10,654 |\n|              | -15,720 | -45,280 |\n\nIncome taxes comprise taxes on income and earnings payable in each country as well as deferred taxes. The Austrian companies of the PIERER Mobility Group are subject to a corporate income tax rate of 24 %. In Austria, a tax reform law was passed in 2022 and provides for a gradual reduction in the corporate income tax rate. The corporate income tax rate will be reduced to 24 % for 2023 and to 23 % from 2024 onwards. Following this tax rate change, deferred taxes were calculated using the respective future tax rate that will\n\napply at the time of the anticipated reversal of the difference in value. The calculation of foreign income taxes is based on the laws and regulations that are in force or have been adopted in the individual countries. The income tax rates applicable to foreign entities vary from 9.0 % to 37.6 %. A reconciliation between the expected tax expense for the financial year (application of the group tax rate of 24 % to earnings before taxes) and the actual tax expense recognized can be presented as follows:\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-53-0\"></span>\n\n| EURK                                                         | 2023    | 2022    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Profit before income taxes                                   | 92,133  | 215,903 |\n| Expected tax expenses / income                               | -22,112 | -53,976 |\n| Non-temporary differences and other tax additions            | -1,381  | -3,010  |\n| Recognition / allowances / utilization of loss carryforwards | -2,764  | -1,995  |\n| Non-taxable results in consequence of consolidation changes  | 0       | 534     |\n| Taxes in relation to prior periods                           | 750     | -2,608  |\n| Effects of foreign tax rates                                 | -839    | -286    |\n| Earnings from equity holdings                                | 809     | 1,062   |\n| Investment benefits                                          | 8,546   | 5,362   |\n| Tax rate changes                                             | 1,271   | 9,696   |\n| Miscellaneous                                                | 0       | -59     |\n|                                                              | -15,720 | -45,280 |\n\n#### Global minimum taxation\n\nThe group operates in several countries that have enacted new laws to introduce the global minimum tax rate, particularly in Austria, where the group's parent company has its headquarters. The group assumes that it will be subject to the minimum tax rate on its activities in Switzerland and Bulgaria, where the statutory tax rate is below 15 %, and in Singapore, where the tax regime provides for a tax exemption that reduces the effective tax rate of our subsidiary to below 15 %. Since the new tax law in Austria only came into force on January 1, 2024, there are no effects on the actual tax expense for the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe group applied the temporary, mandatory exemption to the accounting for deferred tax resulting from the introduction of the global minimum tax regime and recognized it as an actual tax expense/income at the time it occurred.\n\nIf minimum taxation had already applied in the 2023 financial year, the profits from the group's activities in Switzerland, Bulgaria and Singapore would be subject to the minimum tax, with the tax due representing an insignificant amount for the group.\n\n### 18.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n\n#### 21. GOODWILL\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment once a year. If the requirements of IAS 36.99 are met, the last detailed calculation of the recoverable amount is used for the assessment of recoverability. If there are indications of impairment in accordance with IAS 36, goodwill is always tested for impairment. The group determines the recoverable amount fundamentally on the basis of the value in use, which represents the present value of the expected future cash flows before tax.\n\nThe calculation was made using the following method: The forecast of cash flows is based on financial budgets approved by management and/or forecasting, taking into account the medium-term strategy targets. Estimated cash flows beyond this period are calculated by extrapolation of budget/forecast values, whereby constant further development based on a\n\ngrowth rate of 1 % is assumed from the third year onwards. The discount rate used was a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) before taxes of 11.1 % (2022: 11.6 %) for \"KTM\" and 10.4 % (2022: 11.3 %) for \"PIERER New Mobility\". All other conditions being equal, for the \"KTM\" cash-generating unit any increase in input tax for WACC to 14.1 % (2022: 18.9 %) or decline in budgeted future EBITs by 20.6 % (2022: 36.6 %) would result in the carrying amount of the CGU corresponding to the recoverable amount. All other conditions being equal, for the \"PIERER New Mobility\" cash-generating unit any increase in input tax for WACC to 11.6 % (2022: 34.3 %) or decline in budgeted future EBITs by 13.9 % (2022: 68.4 %) would result in the carrying amount of the CGU corresponding to the recoverable amount.\n\nThe breakdown of goodwill and its development and division between the respective CGUs is as follows:\n\n|                                            | 2023    | 2022    |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| EURK                                       |         |         |\n| Acquisition and production costs:          |         |         |\n| Balance as of 01/01                        | 150,632 | 150,681 |\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation      | 1,567   | 0       |\n| Currency translation                       | -474    | -49     |\n| Balance as of 12/31                        | 151,725 | 150,632 |\n| Accumulated depreciation and amortization: |         |         |\n| Balance as of 01/01                        | 19,977  | 19,970  |\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation      | 0       | 0       |\n| Currency translation                       | 13      | 7       |\n| Balance as of 12/31                        | 19,990  | 19,977  |\n| Balance as of 12/31                        | 131,735 | 130,655 |\n| KTM                                        | 109,766 | 110,253 |\n| PIERER New Mobility                        | 19,457  | 19,457  |\n| Others                                     | 2,512   | 945     |\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-56-0\"></span>22. INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\nIntangible assets are capitalized in the same way as property, plant and equipment, at acquisition or production cost and valued less amortization. Amortization is calculated in accordance with the\n\nIntangible assets generated internally\n\nFor intangible assets generated internally, the production period is subdivided into research, development and model update phases. Costs incurred during the research and model update phases are immediately recognized in profit and loss. Capitalized development costs that can be clearly attributed to projects are amortized from the commencement of series production. In the 2023 financial year, development costs of EUR 156,877k (previous year: EUR 136,539k) were capitalized and a total of EUR 68,164k (previous year: EUR 61,024k) were amortized. As of December 31, 2023, development costs with a carrying amount of EUR 506,666k (previous year: EUR 420,572k) are included in intangible assets.\n\nIntangible assets of indeterminate useful life, such as the \"KTM\", \"GASGAS\", \"MV AGUSTA\" and \"JOHANSSON\" brands, which were mostly recognized in the course of the initial purchase price allocation at a value of EUR 61,103k, EUR 13,346k, EUR 20,165k, and EUR 1,300k, respectively, are not amor-tized but are instead subjected to an impairment test in accordance with IAS 36 and\n\nstraight line method and is based on the following expected useful lives:\n\nUSEFUL LIFE IN YEARS Software 3 - 5 Intangible assets generated internally 5\n\n> miscellaneous necessary impairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. The Executive Board assumes an indeterminate useful life for the three brands because the rights are not subject to any restrictions in respect of time, in law or by contract in the relevant markets and because the enduring public awareness of the brands indicates that there has been no loss of economic value.\n\nFollowing the strategic decision to sell the \"FELT\" brand on December 5, 2023, it was valued in ac-cordance with the rules of IFRS 5 and the corresponding disposal of EUR 3,700k was posted in the statement of assets below. The \"KTM\", \"GASGAS\" and \"MV Agusta\" brands are allocated to the \"KTM\" cash-generating unit, and the \"JOHANSSON\" brand or, in the previous year, the \"FELT\" brand is allocated to the \"PIERER New Mobility\" cash-generating unit. As the brands do not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets, the impairment test is performed as part of the impairment tests of the respective \"KTM\" and \"PIERER New Mobility\" goodwill (see Note 21. \"Goodwill\").\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe tables below provide a breakdown of intangible assets along

project.\n\nIn the consolidated statement of cash flows, an adjustment of EUR 33,381k (previous year: EUR -17,011k) was made to additions to intangible assets to reflect transactions that had no cash flow effect. Government grants for capitalized development costs, which are mainly subsidies for development services, are recognized over the expected useful life of the development costs in accordance with IAS 20. The net presentation in accordance with IAS 20 is applied, i.e. grants for non-current assets are deducted from the carrying amount of the asset in the consolidated statement of financial position. This relates to carrying amounts of EUR 23,724k in the 2023 financial year (previous year: EUR 17,828k).\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-59-0\"></span>23.

(previous year: EUR 25,877k) as additions from leases, which had no cash flow effect as of the reporting date. For more details, please refer to Note 47, \"Leases as lessee\". In the consolidated statement of cash flows, an adjustment of EUR -4,389k (previous year: EUR -3,996k) was made to additions to other property, plant and equipment to reflect transactions that had no cash flow effect.\n\nAs of the reporting date, property, plant and equipment amounting to EUR 103,500k (previous year: EUR 42,000k) was secured by\n\nregistered and deposited pledge agreements, primarily for liabilities owed to credit institutions. The increase is due to the collateralization of investment loans and operating funds of PIERER & MAXCOM MOBILITY OOD, Plovdiv, Bulgaria.\n\nInvestment grants for property, plant and equipment are recognized over the expected useful life of the assets in accordance with IAS 20. The net presentation in accordance with IAS 20 is applied, i.e. grants for non-current assets are deducted from the carrying amount of the asset in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-61-0\"></span>24.

The changes to companies accounted for using the equity method are detailed in Note 7. \"Changes in the scope of consolidation\".\n\nKiska GmbH is a design business that provides development and design services. The reporting date of Kiska GmbH is March 31, which was determined prior to the acquisition of the investment. A change in the end of the reporting period is not sought on account of materiality considerations. For the purposes of accounting under the equity method, unaudited interim financial statements as of December 31 were used. PIERER Mobility AG holds 50 % of the company.\n\nKTM Asia Motorcycle Manufacturing Inc. was jointly founded in June 2016 in partnership with Ayala Corp. The company began the CKD (completely knocked down) assembly of KTM motorcycles in the Philippines in mid-2017. The KTM group's equity holding was increased from 34 % to 40 % in the 2021 financial year.\n\nThe KTM joint venture in China conducted in partnership with\n\nCFMOTO was established in the 2018 financial year under the name \"Zhejiang CFMOTO-KTMR2R Motorcycles Co., Ltd.\". The company began operation in the 2021 financial year. Mid-class motorcycles are produced in Hangzhou, China. In the 2023 financial year, the KTM Group stepped up its cooperation with CFMOTO and expanded production in a joint venture. The KTM group has an equity holding of 49 % of the company.\n\nIn the 2022 financial year, a cooperation agreement was entered into with the Italian motorcycle manufacturer MV Agusta. Under this agreement, KTM has taken over the global sales, marketing and customer support for the MV Agusta motorcycle range since the 2023 financial year. In addition, KTM AG supports MV Agusta in the supply chain through MV Agusta Services S.r.l. and carries out purchasing on its behalf. As part of this cooperation agreement, KTM AG acquired 25.1 % of the shares in MV Agusta Motor S.p.A., with registered office in Varese, Italy, as of November 15, 2022. Furthermore, the Executive Board of the KTM Group has taken the strategic decision to exercise the call option granted to the KTM Group under the cooperation agreement to acquire a further 25.0 % stake in MV Agusta S.p.A. in spring 2026.\n\nWith effect from April 1, 2023, KTM AG sold its 23 % stake in Vöcklabrucker Metallgiesserei Dambauer GmbH, based in Vöcklabruck, which it acquired in the previous year, to PB Invest GmbH, Wels, at the carrying amount of the shares.\n\nMovements in the carrying amounts of the financial assets accounted for using the equity method were as follows in the financial year:\n\n|  | EURK                                                                  | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|  | Book value of investments on 1/1                                      | 33,341 | 13,562 |\n|  | Acquisition of holdings                                               | 0      | 16,012 |\n|  | Sale of shares                                                        | -946   | 0      |\n|  | Proportionate net income (minus eliminations of intercompany profits) | 2,338  | 4,994  |\n|  | Other eliminations of intercompany profits                            | 1,131  | 0      |\n|  | Other results                                                         | -1,051 | -255   |\n|  | Dividend                                                              | -943   | -972   |\n|  | Book value of investments on 12/31                                    | 33,870 | 33,341 |\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-62-0\"></span>25. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS\n\nDeferred tax relating to tax loss carryforwards are recognized insofar as they can be realized within a reasonable period. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are reported on a net basis if they are subject to the same tax jurisdiction and are of a similar duration. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for differences between the\n\ntax base of fully consolidated investments or investments accounted for using the equity method and the corresponding Group equity, except to the extent that the Group is unable to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nTotal deferred tax assets and liabilities were calculated from the following statement of financial position items:\n\n| EURK                      | 12/31/2023 | 12/31/2022 |\n|---------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Deferred tax assets:      |            |            |\n| Current assets:           |            |            |\n| Inventories               | 11,709     | 9,800      |\n| Non-current assets:       |            |            |\n| Fixed assets              | 61         | 140        |\n| Employee benefits         | 2,888      | 2,544      |\n| Provisions                | 259        | 1,620      |\n| Liabilities               | 15,172     | 8,504      |\n|                           | 30,089     | 22,608     |\n| Offsetting                | -40,123    | -10,573    |\n| Loss carryforwards        | 19,968     | 1,747      |\n|                           | 9,934      | 13,782     |\n| Deferred tax liabilities: |            |            |\n| Currents assets           | -2,034     | -1,854     |\n| Non-current assets        | -158,754   | -133,130   |\n| Other                     | 0          | -17        |\n|                           | -160,788   | -135,001   |\n| Offsetting                | 40,123     | 10,573     |\n|                           | -120,665   | -124,428   |\n\nDeferred tax assets in relation to non-current assets include EUR 396k (previous year: EUR 751k) in relation to the remaining sevenths of write-downs of equity holdings to going concern value pursuant to Section 12 (3) (2) of the Austrian Corporate Tax Act (KStG).\n\nThe temporary differences in deferred tax liabilities in the \"Non-current assets\" item result mainly from development costs that cannot be capitalized for tax purposes and from quasi-permanent differences due to the recognition of the \"KTM\" brand as an asset.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 (and in the previous year), it was to be assumed either that, under current tax regulations, the differences between the value for tax purposes of the carrying amount of investments in consolidated subsidiaries and the proportion of\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\nequity recognized in the consolidated IFRS financial statements (outside-basis differences), which arise largely from retained profits/ uncovered losses, will remain untaxed in the foreseeable future, or that their reversal can be controlled by the group.

INVENTORIES\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value on the reporting date. Net realizable value is the estimated proceeds less estimated selling costs. Raw materials and supplies are measured using cost averaging based on an analysis of coverage, with write-downs in the event of limited usability. The economic value of existing inventories is also reviewed on a case-by-case basis and additional allowances are made as required for slow-moving items or items with limited possibilities of sale.\n\nCosts of acquisition include all costs that were incurred in order to bring the object to its required condition and to the relevant location. Costs of conversion comprise direct material and production costs based on normal capacity usage, plus appropriate portions of materials and production overheads. Administrative overheads and selling costs on the other hand do not form part of the costs of conversion.

LIABILITIES FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n\nLiabilities for employee benefits consist of obligations relating to severance pay and anniversary bonuses:\n\n| EURK                | 12/31/2023 | 12/31/2022 |\n|---------------------|------------|------------|\n| Severance payments  | 20,548     | 19,548     |\n| Anniversary bonuses | 7,419      | 6,606      |\n|                     | 27,967     | 26,154     |\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group is obligated by law to make a severance payment to all employees in Austria whose employment relationship commenced before January 1, 2003 upon termination by the employer or upon retirement. The amount of this defined benefit obligation (DBO) is dependent on the number of years of service and on the relevant salary at the time of termination. For all employees in Austria who joined after December 31, 2002, the company pays 1.53 % of their gross monthly salary each month into a staff severance pay fund that invests the contributions in an account maintained for the employee; at the end of the employment\n\nrelationship, the amount thus accumulated is paid out or the claim thereto is passed on. The company's obligation extends only to the payment of the contributions, which are recognized as expenses in the financial year for which they were paid (defined-contribution obligation). For employees of Austrian group companies whose employment commenced on or after January 1, 2003, contributions amounting to 1.53 % of their wages or salaries, as the case may be, were paid into a statutory staff sev-erance pay fund. Total contributions of EUR 3,595k were paid during the past financial year (previous year: EUR 2,959k).\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\nMovements in the net liability under the defined benefit plans in respect of severance pay were as follows during the financial year:\n\n| EURK                  | 12/31/2023 | 12/31/2022 |\n|-----------------------|------------|------------|\n| Conditional benefit:  |            |            |\n| Balance as of 01/01   | 19,548     | 21,202     |\n| Service cost          | 509        | 636        |\n| Interest expenses     | 793        | 240        |\n| Payments made         | -861       | -922       |\n| Actuarial gain / loss | 485        | -1,606     |\n| Miscellaneous         | 74         | -2         |\n| Balance as of 12/31   | 20,548     | 19,548     |\n\nThe weighted durations of the severance payment obligations as of December 31, 2023 were 10 years (previous year: 11 years).\n\nThe actuarial profit/loss is made up of the following factors:\n\n| EURK                              | 12/31/2023 | 12/31/2022 |\n|-----------------------------------|------------|------------|\n|                                   |            |            |\n| Change in expected values         | 248        | 2,408      |\n| Change in demographic assumptions | 2          | -68        |\n| Change in financial assumptions   | 309        | -3,946     |\n| Actuarial gain / loss             | 559        | -1,606     |\n\nThe measurement of the obligation is based on the following assumptions:\n\n|                                  | 12/31/2023 | 12/31/2023 |\n|----------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Discount rate                    | 3.51%      | 4.17%      |\n| Wage / salary trend              | 3.50%      | 4.00%      |\n| Retirement age (years) women/men | 65 years   | 65 years   |\n\nThe discount rate was determined taking into account the average duration and average remaining life expectancy. The discount rate is the market yield on high quality, fixed-interest corporate bonds at the end of the reporting period. Staff turnover is determined on\n\na company-specific basis and takes account of age and length of service. The actuarial measurements are based on countryspecific mortality tables. The chosen retirement age is the statutory retirement age in each country.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\nA change (+/- 0.5 percentage points) in the \"discount rate\" and \"wage/salary trend\" parameters would have had the following effects on the present value of future payments as of December 31, 2023:\n\n| PARAMETER           | CHANGE<br>-0,50% | CHANGE<br>+0,50% |\n|---------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Discount rate       | 4.9%             | -4.5%            |\n| Wage / salary trend | -4.6%            | 4.9%             |\n\nA change (+/- 0.5 percentage points) in the \"discount rate\" and \"wage/salary trend\" parameters would have had the following effects on the present value of future payments as of December 31, 2022:\n\n| PARAMETER           | CHANGE<br>-0,50% | CHANGE<br>+0,50% |\n|---------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Discount rate       | 5.3%             | -4.9%            |\n| Wage / salary trend | -4.9%            | 5.3%             |\n\nThe companies in the PIERER Mobility Group are obligated under collective-bargaining agreements to pay their employees in Austria anniversary bonuses upon attaining a certain number of years of service (from 25 years of service upward) (defined benefit obligation).

Suppliers can sell their receivables from the PIERER Mobility Group to the credit institution before the due date. The PIERER Mobility Group is not released\n\nfrom its original obligation and, due to a quantitative and qualitative audit, there is no significant change in the contractual terms and conditions. The liabilities continue to be shown under trade payables and are reported in cash flow from operating activities. As of December 31, 2023, trade payables amounting to EUR 349,065k (previous year: EUR 350,236k) are covered by this supplier finance program. This is 51.6 % (previous year: 47.5 %) of total trade payables as of the reporting date amounting to EUR 676,978k (previous year: EUR 737,602k).\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-74-0\"></span>In addition to suppliers outside the group, such a program was also concluded between Austrian companies in the PIERER Mobility Group. From the point of view of the PIERER Mobility Group, no exchange of services took place; it merely made use of external financing, which is reported under current financial liabilities. Cash flows are reported under cash flow from financing activities. As of\n\nDecember 31, 2023, the relationships between group companies of EUR 4,904k (previous year: EUR 3,394k) were presented as current financial liabilities in the consolidated financial statements of PIERER Mobility AG.\n\n#### 36. PROVISIONS\n\nThe group makes provisions relating to guarantees and warranties in relation to known, expected individual cases. The amounts of expected expenses are primarily based on previous experience and are recorded at the time the products are sold as an expense affecting profit and loss.\n\nThe estimation of future expenses is subject to uncertainties, which may lead to an adjustment of the provisions recognized in the future. It cannot be ruled out that the actual expenses for these measures may be higher or lower than the provision made for these purposes in an unforeseeable way.\n\nMovements in provisions in the financial year were as follows:\n\n| EURK                                  | BALANCE AS OF<br>1/1/2023 | ADDITIONS | DISOLUTIONS | UTILIZATION | BALANCE AS OF<br>12/31/2023 |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------|\n| Current provisions                    |                           |           |             |             |                             |\n| Provisions for guarantee and warranty | 20,947                    | 20,523    | 0           | -20,947     | 20,523                      |\n| Provisions for legal actions          | 757                       | 0         | 442         | 0           | 1,199                       |\n| Other provisions                      | 22,333                    | 241       | -1,956      | -20,470     | 149                         |\n|                                       | 44,037                    | 20,764    | -1,514      | -41,417     | 21,871                      |\n\nProvisions relating to guarantees and warranties largely relate to risks arising from statutory and voluntary product liability.

RISK REPORT\n\n#### 37. RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nAs a group of companies conducting business on a global scale, the PIERER Mobility Group faces a multitude of possible risks that are monitored by means of a comprehensive risk management system. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board are periodically informed about risks that may have a major impact on the group's business operations. Management takes timely action to avoid, minimize and hedge risks.\n\nAn internal control system adapted to the company's needs and incorporating basic principles such as segregation of duties and dual control has been integrated into the financial reporting process. Internal and external audits ensure that the processes are continually improved and optimized. Furthermore, a uniform reporting system is in place throughout the group, for the ongoing management and control of the risk management process. Group reporting is subject to a continuous improvement process so that the Executive Board is informed even sooner, and more comprehensively, about the degree to which targets have been achieved and about changes in the market and competition.\n\nContinuous growth depends on a variety of factors, such as demand behavior, product development, changes in foreign exchange rates, the general economic setting in the individual sales markets, prices of goods purchased from others, or talent management. Increased market research activities and a model policy reflecting the resulting findings are the means of responding to a market environment characterized by rapidly changing situations.\n\nIn order to prevent risks associated with fraud, corruption, and bribery, employees are obliged to behave in accordance with the principles defined in the Code of Conduct. The code is binding for all employees, managers, and board members as well as for\n\nconsultants, business partners, and customers of the PIERER Mobility Group. Since the 2021 financial year, the Code of Conduct has been an annex and thus an integral part of existing dealer agreements. Since the beginning of 2020, this has already been the case with new dealer agreements and also with new contractual relationships in the supply sector.\n\nIn order to counteract negative macroeconomic and geopolitical effects, PIERER Mobility promotes global diversification of the sales markets. The greatest relative growth in the coming years is expected in Asia. In order to promote this growth, intensive cooperation with our strategic partner Bajaj is being continuously expanded. In addition, investments have been made in production sites with local partners in China and the Philippines. The Russian-Ukrainian war in particular is having a negative impact on the global economy. In business terms, the PIERER Mobility Group is not directly affected by the military conflict that is taking place in Ukraine. Indirectly, the group, along with the whole industry, is confronted primarily by further increases in energy and raw material costs and negative effects on the capital markets.\n\nThe earnings position of PIERER Mobility AG (as an individual company) is characterized by expenses associated with financing, the acquisition of equity holdings and expenses for projects, and is significantly dependent on the dividend policy of its investees. The investment in the KTM Group is currently the largest and most significant investment of PIERER Mobility AG.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Section 243(c) of the Austrian Commercial Code, a corporate governance report has been drawn up. In this regard, we refer to the publication in the annual report of PIERER Mobility AG or to the website of PIERER Mobility AG.\n\n#### 38. MARKET RISKS\n\n#### CYCLICAL RISK\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group operates in the motorcycle and bicycle industry. Sales opportunities are determined by the general economic situation in the countries and regions in which the PIERER Mobility Group is represented with its products.\n\nAs recent years have shown, the motorcycle sector in particular is cyclical and subject to large fluctuations regarding demand. The\n\nincrease in inflation is affecting the market and therefore demand, and this development will continue over the coming year and could have a negative impact on the market. This risk is counteracted by our experience in this area, together with market research and forecasting, which are taken into account in the planning. With changes in mobility behavior, high rates of inflation and the Russian-Ukrainian war, the global motorcycle market in particular has stabilized at a high level.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-77-0\"></span>COMPETITION AND PRICING PRESSURE\n\nCompetition on the motorcycle market in industrialized countries is particularly intense; the strongest competitors are four Japanese and three European manufacturers and, to a lesser extent, a U.S. manufacturer, some of which have greater financial resources, higher sales figures and market shares. The street motorcycle market is moreover characterized by high pricing pressure, and new competitors are trying to enter the market by relying on a low-price strategy. Thanks to its successful market strategy, the PIERER Mobility Group is Europe's leading manufacturer of powered two-wheelers. The full integration of GASGAS as the third brand and the further development of the network of dealers has also contributed to this. Thanks to the innovative strength which it has demonstrated, the group sees itself as a technology leader in the two-wheeler sector in Europe. The strategic partnership with Bajaj and the increased level of co-operation with CFMOTO strengthens the company's competitiveness in global markets. The development of low-volume PTWs, stand-up scooters, electric motorcycles and motorcycles suitable for e-fuels as well as e-bicycles for use in urban areas is intended to continue to meet specific demand requirements in the future.\n\n#### SALES RISK\n\nThe group's biggest individual sales markets are the European as well as the U.S. market for motorcycles and the DACH region for New Mobility/(E)-Bicycle products. A slump in these markets could have a negative impact on business activities. Entering new markets involves a major cost risk as, in some of these markets, the sales trends as well as the geopolitical conditions are difficult to assess. By collaborating with its strategic partner Bajaj Auto Ltd., Pune, India, the\n\n#### 39. INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC RISKS\n\n#### RESTRICTIONS RELATING TO MOTORCYCLING\n\nAs the group markets its products in a large number of countries, it is exposed to the risk of changes in national regulations, terms of licenses, taxes, trade restrictions, prices, income, and exchange restrictions as well as to the risk of political, social, and economic instability, inflation, and interest rate fluctuations. Among other things, motorcycles registered for road use must comply with relevant provisions concerning noise and exhaust gas emissions in order to be approved for sale in each country. For all new models that are homologated for road use, the group complies with the Euro V European emission standard that is relevant for motorcycles. The\n\ncompany is working steadily toward implementing a global product strategy in the motorcycle sector.\n\nThe global impacts of high rates of inflation could ultimately also be reflected in changes in the consumer behavior of customers, which has been reduced overall. The group constantly monitors such impacts on the consumer behavior of customers. For example, it was established that there is still a high demand for products from the group because it provides high-quality PTWs, but there is higher demand for low-emission and low-noise individual mobility solutions. Expanding the product range to include e-bicycles/stand-up scooters and e-motorcycles in the low-power range, an increased focus on research and development in the field of alternative drive technologies, and developing new product areas such as stand-up scooters, e-bicycles or low-emission/emission-free alternatives to conventional models with combustion engines will boost sales here. The change to new (lower-emission or zero-emission) technologies could turn the structure of the market on its head and increase the opportunity to gain market shares\n\nFor the PIERER Mobility Group, providing support to end customers through the network of dealers represents a key success factor. In order to be able to continuously guarantee a high standard in this area, mandatory dealer training sessions are held on an ongoing basis. In these sessions new technical standards are taught and dealers are trained in dealing with the customer. In addition, the group in particular provides a modern communication platform which the dealers can use to undertake the procurement process and document the sales process. New, digital solutions in products could provide valuable in-formation for climate change-related transport measures and thus constitute a service that offers a new source of revenue.\n\npossible offroad uses of motorcycles are influenced significantly by the national and legal conditions that exist in the countries where the vehicles are sold. To counteract this risk, the respective regulations specific to the given country are analyzed in detail prior to market launch and continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis in order to be able to react in good time to any changes.\n\n#### PROCUREMENT RISK\n\nThe current economic situation creates a procurement and sales risk for the global economy that also affects the PIERER Mobility Group. Essentially, this risk involves the significant increases in the prices of\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\nprocuring raw materials, supplies and components, which have been driven by the global shortage of goods and resources, as well as the production overheads, which have risen to a high level, particularly in respect of energy prices, transport and personnel costs, as a result of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. This primarily affects companies involved in the energy-intensive production of raw materials such as aluminum and steel, which could have an impact on the level of availability in the overall market as a result of macroeconomic trends or climate change-related effects (increased use of renewable energy, higher requirements for steel production, etc.).\n\nIn the current situation, the procurement risk consists largely of failing to receive ordered components or not receiving them on the agreed date. On the other hand, rising energy costs are increasingly becoming established as a significant financial risk for smaller suppliers to the group and could therefore cause further disruption in the supply chain. The group itself can cope with rising energy costs because the in-house production and assembly processes are not very energy-intensive.\n\nA reduction in the persistently high rate of inflation in the first half of 2024 is not expected. This will therefore continue to affect the prices of materials and raw materials, which produces a global economic procurement risk for the PIERER Mobility Group.\n\nThe group has largely stabilized and compensated for the supply chain bottlenecks that have arisen, causing procurement delays, by regularly coordinating with suppliers and approving all procurement and production at an early stage. This means the group will be able to meet the resource requirements of each of its production sites over the longer term. The intense cooperation right along the supply chain means there was only a small impact on the group.\n\nOn the procurement side, the PIERER Mobility Group is countering the risks described above by taking several measures, such as using alternative supply chains and engaging in appropriate activities to reduce the costs that are incurred, implementing efficiency measures at suppliers by providing cost engineering support and agreeing on temporary price increases based on indices. In addition, the group has already implemented further significant measures to secure its supply chain and thus its production at an early stage, as mentioned above, and introduced a market intelligence system for electronic components. The flexibility in the production layout implemented means that, in exceptional cases, the group is also able to adjust its production schedules as needed to cope with global developments that result in increasingly tight supply chains. In addition, more in-depth research into alternative raw materials and materials will help to meet the increasing demand for critical resources required\n\nfor the increased production of batteries needed for e-mobility and to avoid resource bottlenecks. Ultimately, the intention is to adjust the logistical procurement structure in order to minimize transportation distances and associated costs.\n\nThe supply of electricity is essential for maintaining production operations. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine means the electricity supply may also be impaired in the coming year. This may also have a negative impact on the energy price. In order to ensure a stable supply of electricity, the PIERER Mobility Group is increasingly relying on constructing photovoltaic systems, setting up an energy ring to increase the proportion of the electricity produced that the company uses itself, and implementing energy-saving measures.\n\n#### TECHNICAL INNOVATION AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\n\nTechnical innovations and the introduction of new products are largely responsible for the PIERER Mobility Group's competitive position. To this end, new trends must be identified promptly. To counteract the risk, our own products' innovative capacity must be ensured.\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group therefore attaches great importance to identifying trends at an early stage, conducting research and development in technical and functional areas, and researching what customers want in order to develop innovative products that reflect what the market wants. Racing achievements are not only an important marketing instrument for the company but also form the basis for product development and set standards for series development. Among other things, the company will also focus in future on developing emission-free, alternative drive systems and products so it can live up to its role as a technological pioneer.\n\n#### PRODUCT LIABILITY RISK\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group is also exposed in its business activity to claims for damages owing to accidents and injuries. This applies especially to the U.S., where claims asserted in product liability cases involve higher amounts of liability. In addition to existing potential causes of product-related lawsuits, climate change-related regulations could add further grounds for action. In addition to existing safeguards, this risk is minimized by comprehensive quality control in all production areas and high quality standard thanks to suitable supplier selection procedures as well as quality management systems and audits.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-79-0\"></span>40. IT RISKS\n\nWe apply the same high quality standards in the area of data security and data protection as we do for our products.\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group has implemented an IT security and risk management system for the purpose of identifying and managing company-relevant risks in the area of information security. In addition, evidence of compliance and the exercising of due diligence when handling and using information and equipment for the processing of information is provided and documented in respect of customers, the Executive Board and the general managers of each participating company.\n\nThe constantly growing IT and cyber risks are countered by ongoing evolution of IT security measures and using the latest IT security technologies. Cyber attacks are averted with a multi-stage technical concept using the latest security features such as\n\n#### 41. FINANCIAL RISKS\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group is subject to credit, market, currency and liquidity risks regarding its assets, liabilities and planned transactions. Financial risk management is aimed at controlling and limiting those risks. The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board are informed on a regular basis about risks that can have a major impact on the group's business operations.\n\nThe principles of financial risk management are laid down and monitored by the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board. Group Treasury is responsible for their implementation. To protect itself against the financial risks described below, the PIERER Mobility Group uses derivative financial instruments in order to safely hedge cash flows from operating activities against fluctuations in exchange rates and/or interest rates. The hedging horizon generally covers currently open items and any transactions planned for the next 12 to 18 months. In exceptional cases, strategic hedge positions involving longer time periods may be entered into in consultation with the Supervisory Board.\n\n#### CURRENCY RISKS\n\nAs an enterprise doing business on a global scale, the PIERER Mobility Group is influenced by general global economic data such as changes in currency parities or developments in the financial markets. As the US dollar represents the highest individual foreign currency risk, movements in the US dollar exchange rate are of particular importance to the development of revenue and income. Due to the increasing importance of USD in purchasing, the foreign currency risk associated with the USD is significantly reduced (\"natural hedge\"). Approximately 26 % of revenues were earned in\n\nintrusion prevention systems and additional security systems which are operated upstream or internally. Behavior-based security solutions are also used with a view to identifying security-related abuse. Incidents are identified and handled by a malware incident response process. In parallel, regular internal and external vulnerability analyses are performed and any vulnerabilities identified are countered by means of an established patch and update management process. Regular internal and external security audits are documented in risk management, any findings are evaluated and prioritized, and a solution is then applied.\n\nCare is taken to ensure that all users of IT systems possess the requisite knowledge and awareness for the use of IT within the scope of their role via the provision of regular general IT security awareness training. This training is provided in a preventative and traceable manner.\n\nUS dollars in financial year 2023 (previous year: 34 %). Currency hedging measures, in particular hedging strategies, can largely offset these currency shifts over at least one model year.\n\nThe group is exposed to further currency risks where financial assets and liabilities are settled in a currency other than the local currency of the relevant company. The companies of the group predominantly do their invoicing in local currency and largely take out financing in local currency. Financial investments are primarily made in the local currency of the investing group company. For these reasons, most resulting currency positions will be closed out naturally.\n\nThe main causes of ineffectiveness in currency hedges are:\n\n- the impact of the credit risk of the counterparties and the group on the fair value of the forward currency transactions that is not reflected in the change in the fair value of the hedged cash flows attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates;\n- changes in the transaction date of the hedged items.\n\nSensitivity analyses have been performed on currency risks in relation to financial instruments in order to show the effects that hypothetical changes in the exchange rates have on profit or loss (after taxes) and equity. In the scope of the sensitivity analysis, effects of changes in the exchange rate of ± 10% are shown as profit or loss, other comprehensive income, and equity. The relevant balances as of the reporting date and foreign currency purchases and sales budgeted for the 2023 financial year were used as a basis. It was assumed that the risk faced on the reporting date essentially represents the risk present during the financial year. The group tax\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\nrate of 24% was used as the tax rate. Furthermore, it was assumed in the analysis that all other variables, in particular the interest rates, remained constant. Currency risks relating to financial instruments of a monetary nature that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency were included in the analysis.\n\nCurrency risks from euro positions in subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the euro were attributed to the currency risk of the subsidiary's functional currency. Risks from foreign currency positions apart from the euro were aggregated at a group level. Exchange rate related differences arising from the translation of financial statements into the group currency were not taken into account.\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group bases the analysis on the following assumptions:\n\n- For the sensitivity of profit and loss, the group's cash in banks, receivables and payables are considered, as are future receipts and payments in foreign currency that are not accounted for in the functional currency of the group company. Account is also taken of open derivatives on cash flow hedges where the hedged item has already been realized on the reporting date (recognized as income).\n- For the sensitivity of other comprehensive income, account is taken of open derivatives from cash flow hedges where the hedged item has not yet been realized on the reporting date (movements are not recognized in profit and loss). The exposure corresponds to the notional amount of the open derivatives.\n\n| INCREASE (+) / DECREASE (-)                           | 10% INCREASE |            | 10% DEVALUATION |            |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|------------|\n| EURK                                                  | 12/31/2023   | 12/31/2022 | 12/31/2023      | 12/31/2022 |\n| Change in net result                                  | -33,302      | -28,868    | 40,702          | 35,284     |\n| Change in currency-related cash flow hedge provisions | 6,866        | 3,636      | -8,392          | -4,444     |\n| Change in equity                                      | -26,436      | -25,232    | 32,310          | 30,840     |\n\n#### INTEREST RATE RISKS\n\nCertain financial instruments on both the assets side and the liabilities side carry interest at variable rates. The risk therefore comprises rising interest expenses or falling interest income resulting from an adverse change in market interest rates.\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group is thus exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations on the market. Regular monitoring of the money and capital markets and, in some cases, the use of interest rate swaps (fixed interest rate payer swaps) serve to respond to this risk. Under the interest rate swaps entered into, the company receives variable interest payments and, in return, pays fixed interest on the notional amounts of the contracts entered into.\n\nInterest rate risks thus result mainly from primary financial instruments carrying interest at variable rates (cash flow risk). Sensitivity analyses were performed on the interest rate risks of these financial instruments in order to show the effects that hypothetical changes in the market interest rate level have on profit or loss (after\n\ntax) and equity. The relevant balances as of the reporting date were used as a basis. It was assumed that the risk faced on the reporting date essentially represents the risk present during the financial year. The group tax rate of 24% was used as the tax rate. Furthermore, it was assumed in the analysis that all other variables, in particular the exchange rates, remained constant.\n\nThe main causes of ineffectiveness in interest rate hedges are:\n\n- the impact of the credit risk of the counterparties and the group on the fair value of the interest rate derivatives that is not reflected in the change in the fair value of the hedged cash flows attributable to changes in interest rates; and\n- differences in the parameters (e.g., interest rate adjustment dates) between the derivatives and the hedged items\n\nA sensitivity analysis was performed on interest rate risk. This showed the effects of changes in the interest rate of +/- 50 basis points on profit and loss, other comprehensive income, and equity.\n\nINCREASE (+) / DECREASE (-)\n\n| INCREASE (+) / DECREASE (-)                           | INCREASE BY 50 BP |            | DECREASE BY 50 BP |            |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|------------|\n| EURK                                                  | 12/31/2023        | 12/31/2022 | 12/31/2023        | 12/31/2022 |\n|                                                       |                   |            |                   |            |\n| Change in net result                                  | -2,362            | -316       | 2,361             | 318        |\n| Change in currency-related cash flow hedge provisions | 1,113             | 1,752      | -1,120            | -1,757     |\n| Change in equity                                      | -1,249            | 1,436      | 1,241             | -1,439     |\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Group Treasury completed the changes to the reference interest rates in the financial instruments used by the group which were required as a result of the IBOR Reform in the 2023 financial year. Working together closely with business partners, contracts were appropriately amended and contractual transitional arrangements governing the handling of temporarily or permanently unavailable reference interest rates were utilized. The use of the new reference interest rates has been agreed on, without exception, for contracts and financial instruments that were newly concluded in the financial year. The amendments had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### DEFAULT RISKS (CREDIT OR CREDITWORTHINESS RISKS)\n\nThe default risk is the risk of financial losses if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The default risk generally arises from trade receivables.\n\nOn the assets side, the carrying amounts reported also represent the maximum default risk. In addition, there are no general set-off agreements, with the exception of the set-off agreement described under note 44 in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n#### Trade receivables\n\nThe default risk on receivables from customers may be rated as low as ongoing checks of the creditworthiness of new and existing customers are performed and collateral is requested.\n\nRisk management carries out an analysis and assessment of new customers. Initially, these are analyzed individually with regard to their creditworthiness, and standardized group-wide contracts are concluded with customers. The analysis includes external credit ratings, where available, as well as annual financial statements and information from credit agencies and banks. Sales limits are set for each customer and reviewed on an ongoing basis. All sales exceeding these limits require the approval of risk management.\n\nDefault risks are largely hedged by means of credit insurance and bankable security (guarantees, letters of credit). The default risks and related controls are defined in internal guidelines. Most of the business relationships with dealers and importers have been in place for many years. By continuously monitoring the default risk and the creditworthiness of customers, each receivable is individually reviewed to ascertain the need for a value adjustment.\n\nA summary of the default risk on trade receivables as of December 31, 2023 is presented in the following table.\n\n| TRADE RECEIVABLES<br>EURK   | NOT IMPAIRED IN<br>CREDITWORTHINESS | CREDITWORTHINESS<br>IMPAIRED | TOTAL   |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------|\n| Not overdue                 | 297,836                             | 0                            | 297,836 |\n| Overdue 1-30 days           | 18,404                              | 0                            | 18,404  |\n| Overdue 31-60 days          | 11,213                              | 0                            | 11,213  |\n| Overdue 61-90 days          | 3,145                               | 0                            | 3,145   |\n| Overdue > 90 days           | 16,594                              | 10,916                       | 27,510  |\n| Total gross carrying amount | 347,192                             | 10,916                       | 358,108 |\n| Impairment loss             | -301                                | -7,006                       | -7,307  |\n| Total                       | 346,892                             | 3,910                        | 350,801 |\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\nA summary of the default risk on trade receivables as of December 31, 2022 is presented in the following table.\n\n| TRADE RECEIVABLES<br>EURK   | NOT IMPAIRED IN<br>CREDITWORTHINESS | CREDITWORTHINESS<br>IMPAIRED | TOTAL   |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------|\n| Not overdue                 | 242,774                             | 0                            | 242,774 |\n| Overdue 1-30 days           | 16,460                              | 0                            | 16,460  |\n| Overdue 31-60 days          | 4,123                               | 0                            | 4,123   |\n| Overdue 61-90 days          | 2,592                               | 0                            | 2,592   |\n| Overdue > 90 days           | 2,627                               | 6,895                        | 9,522   |\n| Total gross carrying amount | 268,576                             | 6,895                        | 275,471 |\n| Impairment loss             | -190                                | -4,859                       | -5,049  |\n| Total                       | 268,386                             | 2,036                        | 270,422 |\n\nIn order to determine the need for impairment of trade receivables for which no individual value adjustments have been made, the PIERER Mobility Group evaluated the defaults of recent years. The analysis showed that there is only an insignificant risk for receivables with a certain past due status. The estimate of loss rates is based on historical default rates in relation to past due receivables and considering forward-looking information.\n\nAs regards the current portfolio of trade and other receivables that are neither impaired nor past due, there are no indications as of the closing date that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations. There are no concentration risks.\n\n#### Estimation of expected credit losses\n\nBased on the actual defaults observed in the past, an average default rate of 0.07 % (previous year: 0.07 %) of trade receivables was determined. The risk premium for developments in the future has been adjusted to take account of the effects of increased inflation rates as well as the Russian-Ukrainian war. An addition of EUR 111k (previous year: EUR 87k) to the allowance for expected losses on trade receivables was recognized.\n\nThe impairment for expected losses as of December 31, 2023 in the PIERER Mobility Group is EUR 301k (previous year: EUR 190k).\n\n#### Changes in value adjustments\n\nChanges in value adjustments related to trade receivables are described in the notes under Note 28 \"Trade receivables\".\n\n#### Cash and cash equivalents, other assets and derivatives\n\nCredit losses on cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets are determined on the basis of average default rates and the rating of the instrument. A significant change in the credit risk is determined on the basis of ratings and delay in payment. Given the short-term nature of these items and the good rating of the banks, the group assumes that these portfolios are financial instruments with a low default risk and that the expected losses are negligible.\n\nThe default risk on derivative financial instruments with positive market value is limited to their replacement cost; as all the counterparties are banks of good creditworthiness, the default risk can be classified as low. There are no indications of any additional impairment loss requirements for financial assets.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### LIQUIDITY RISKS\n\nThe current liquidity reserves (see below) combined with a balanced mix of different financial instruments will enable the group to continue to operate flexibly in a volatile market environment in 2024. In this context, the available liquidity reserves were increased significantly in the 2023 financial year with both short-term and long-term financing measures. For example, in the 2023 financial year, the KTM Group issued a promissory note loan with a volume of EUR 300,000k and a registered bond with a volume of EUR 50,000k.\n\nIt is a material objective of financial risk management in the PIERER Mobility Group to ensure solvency and financial flexibility at all times. Liquidity risks may arise, among other things, if the proceeds from revenues are below the planning assumptions. For this purpose, the group maintains a liquidity reserve in the form of unused credit lines (cash credits and guarantee credits) and in the form of cash in banks of a high creditworthiness. As of December 31, 2023, the\n\nPierer Mobility Group has a liquidity portfolio of EUR 258,972k and unused credit lines of EUR 560,386k. Top priority is given to ensuring liquidity over the short and medium term. Another major control parameter is the maximization of free cash flow by cost-cutting measures, proactive working capital management and reduced investment expenditure. In the area of working capital management in particular, the group has a wide range of instruments at its disposal to manage liquidity in line with demand. These include utilizing ABS and factoring programs or adjusting stock levels by making use of the flexibility of production volumes.\n\nFrom today's perspective, sufficient commitments have been given by our strategic financing partners for securing current liquidity requirements. Non-current liquidity requirements are met by the issuance of promissory note loans and by taking out bank loans.

are paid on their due date. The associated cash outflows are taken into account in liquidity planning. The supplier finance program results in a concentration of risk. The number of suppliers is replaced by a concentration on a creditor bank. If this creditor bank were to\n\nterminate the supplier finance agreement, an additional liquidity risk would generally be incurred, which is not of great significance due to supplier payment goals that are almost identical. As cited in Note 35, this relates to 51.6 % (previous year: 47.5 %) of trade payables as of the reporting date. The concentration risk is regarded as low.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-85-0\"></span>42. OTHER RISKS\n\n#### PROCESS RISKS\n\nThere is a risk that standardized processes will not be adhered to, particularly in production. To minimize this risk, these processes are documented in work instructions and handbooks. Employees are trained in the use of this documentation and the documents are freely accessible via various systems.\n\n#### RISKS DUE TO THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK\n\nAs the PIERER Mobility Group markets its motorcycles and e-bikes and non-e-bikes in a large number of countries, it is exposed to the risk of changes in national regulations, terms of licenses, taxes, trade re-strictions, prices, income, and exchange restrictions as well as to the risk of political, social, and economic instability, inflation, and interest rate fluctuations.\n\nMotorcycles registered for road use must comply with relevant provisions concerning noise and exhaust gas emissions in order to be approved for sale in each country. For all new models that are homologated for road use, the group complies with the Euro V European emission standard that is relevant for motorcycles. The possible offroad uses of motorcycles are influenced significantly by the national and legal conditions that exist in the countries where the vehicles are sold. To counteract this risk, the respective regulations specific to the given country are analyzed in detail prior to market launch and continue to be monitored on an ongoing basis in order to be able to react in good time to any changes.\n\nThe strong focus on research and development ensures that all products of the PIERER Mobility Group will continue to meet regulatory requirements in the future. Fully electric motorcycles already complement the product range today. At the same time, research and development is also focusing on other alternative drive technologies.\n\n#### BUSINESS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK\n\nEnvironmental risks may relate to products, production, procurement and non-operating factors. More detailed examinations of environmental risks can also be found in the sustainability report published annually by PIERER Mobility AG and/or the reporting in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) on climate-related opportunities and risks.\n\nWith regard to the products, risks arise from possible emissions, such as the emission of greenhouse gases. Measures being promoted to minimize these risks include in particular technological developments to boost fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. In addition, research projects aimed at reducing noise and pollutant emissions are supported. Another risk is the trend in the level of acceptance for vehicles with internal combustion engines, which could be reduced due to restrictions and social trends and lead to increased demand for alternatives. This is one of the reasons why the company is increasingly focusing on the development of emission-free alternative drive systems and products.\n\nIn production, there are environmental risks from the generation of waste and material residues as well as the disposal of waste. Numerous measures are undertaken to minimize these risks. These include waste management concepts and low-waste packaging solutions that conserve resources. In the 2023 financial year, for example, a machine for shredding cardboard waste and reusing it as filler material for shipping products started operating.\n\nEnvironmental risks in procurement may result from the environment-related shortage and rising prices of resources, cooperation with suppliers that do not operate with sufficient environmental measures, and emissions from delivery routes. In order to minimize these risks, measures are taken that include auditing suppliers,\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\noptimizing procurement channels, and prioritizing regional procurement.\n\nIn addition, environmental risks arise from weather-related and climate-related phenomena, such as floods and changes in temperature.\n\nAlthough it is not possible to completely rule out the risk of natural disasters, the PIERER Mobility Group makes efforts to minimize the risk of production processes being impaired by having suitable corrective measures in place. Due to the geographical location of the main plants in Mattighofen and Munderfing, the risk of climaterelated, physical natural disasters occurring is considered to be low.\n\n#### PERSONNEL-RELATED RISKS\n\nEspecially with regard to the growth course, risks may arise if key staff leave the company. Efficient personnel management as well as the constant pursuit of personnel development programs are designed to counteract the risk of managerial staff leaving the company. The risk of a shortage of skilled staff is minimized by a comprehensive apprentice training program in our own apprentice workshop. The aim is to recruit employees from the region and to retain them in the long term.\n\nInternal and external measures to increase employer attractiveness are an essential element in conveying the predominant spirit of the PIERER Mobility Group to potential new employees. With various cross-media employee campaigns, the company was able to largely meet its personnel requirements in the reporting year. In the area of apprenticeships, attention was not only paid to addressing the target group appropriately, but a dedicated section was also created for the parents of future apprentices. The purpose of this is to provide information about opportunities and options at an early stage, and to prevent any uncertainties.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-87-0\"></span>VIII. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n#### 43. BASIC PRINCIPLES\n\nThe PIERER Mobility Group holds primary and derivative financial instruments. Primary financial instruments mainly include trade receivables, credit balances with credit institutions, liabilities owed to credit institutions, trade payables, and financial liabilities. The portfolio of primary financial instruments is shown in the consolidated statement of financial position and described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Derivative financial instruments are generally used to hedge existing interest rate fluctuation and foreign currency risks. The use of derivative financial instruments is subject to appropriate authorization and control procedures in the group. The link to a hedged item is mandatory; trading transactions are not permitted. Purchases and sales of all financial instruments are recognized as of the settlement date. Purchases and sales of all financial instruments are recognized as of the settlement date.\n\n#### ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nCategorization will take place in accordance with the contractual cash flows and the business models on which they are based. In this regard, the following measurement categories are provided by IFRS 9:\n\n- AC category: At amortized cost using the effective interest method\n- FVOCI category: At fair value, changes to the fair value are recorded under other comprehensive income\n- FVPL category: At fair value, changes to the fair value are recorded in the income statement\n\nIn the case of equity instruments (such as shares in companies not listed on the stock exchange), the FVOCI option can be exercised. This will lead to changes in the fair value being recorded under other comprehensive income, meaning that it will no longer be possible to regroup the changes to fair value accumulated under other comprehensive income in the income statement. Insofar as this option is not exercised, these will be assigned to the FVPL category, under which all changes to the fair value will be recorded in the income statement.\n\nReceivables and other assets upon initial recognition are measured at fair value and in subsequent periods are measured at amortized cost of acquisition. Foreign currency receivables are translated at the closing exchange rate on the reporting date. Financial receivables are classified as \"at amortized cost\" and are measured at amortized cost.\n\nThat portion of trade receivables that is part of the ABS or factoring program is allocated to the category \"Fair Value through Profit and Loss\" (FVPL).\n\nFinancial liabilities are measured at amortized cost of acquisition. Financial liabilities are assigned to the \"at amortized cost\" category. Any difference between the amount received and the amount repayable is apportioned over the term to maturity using the effective interest method and recognized in financial income and expenses. The fundraising costs incurred in connection with borrowings were amortized to profit or loss using the effective interest method. Liabilities are measured at amortized cost. Liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate.\n\nAll financial instruments in the FVPL category are measured at fair value through profit or loss on the basis of the criteria in IFRS 9 (business model or SPPI test). The fair value option was not exercised.\n\n#### Impairment losses\n\nTrade receivables do not exhibit any material financing components. For that reason, the simplified method for determining the expected credit loss is used; this involves accounting for all instruments with a risk provision, which is independent of their credit quality, in the amount of the expected losses over the term to maturity. This amounts to less than twelve months for trade receivables and therefore corresponds to the 12-month loss. For details of the amounts involved, please refer to Note 41 \"Financial risks\".\n\nIn order to determine the expected credit loss, historic default data for receivables were collected over the last eight to ten years and split according to geographic regions. Current economic factors and forecasts are also taken into account.\n\nIndividual valuation adjustments are made to financial assets if they are deemed to be uncollectible or partially uncollectible. Signs that an individual allowance is required are financial difficulties, insolvency, breach of contract or considerable delay in payment on the part of the customer. Individual value adjustments consist of numerous individual items, none of which is material when considered in isolation. Financial assets are only derecognized directly if the contractual rights to receive payment cease to exist (in particular in the case of insolvency). If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance account.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-88-0\"></span>Hedge accounting\n\nThe regulations on hedge accounting are applied in accordance with IFRS 9. According to IFRS 9, the fair value of an option, the forward element of a forward contract and any foreign currency basis spreads can be excluded from the designation of a financial instrument as\n\n#### 44. CLASSIFICATION AND FAIR VALUE\n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is determined by means of quoted market prices for identical instruments in active markets (Level 1). If no quoted market prices in active markets are available for the instrument, the fair value is determined by means of valuation techniques for which the material inputs are based exclusively on observable market data (Level 2). In all other cases, the fair value is determined on the basis of valuation techniques for which at least one material input is not based on observable market data (Level 3).\n\na hedging instrument and accounted for as the cost of hedging. In this regard, fluctuations in the value of these components that have optionally not been designated are recorded as hedging costs under other comprehensive income and reclassified in the income statement in the event that the hedged item is recognized in profit or loss.\n\nReclassifications from one level to another are taken into account at the end of the reporting period. There were no transfers between levels in the financial year.\n\nThe table below shows the valuation techniques used to determine fair value as well as the significant unobservable inputs used.\n\n| Financial instruments measured at fair value             |                                                                                                                                                                           |                                     |                                                                                        |  |  |  |  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|--|--|\n| Type                                                     | Measurement technique                                                                                                                                                     | Significant,<br>unobservable inputs | Connection between<br>significant unobservable inputs<br>and measurement at fair value |  |  |  |  |\n| Forward currency transactions<br>and interest rate swaps | Fair values are based on the<br>market values determined using<br>recognized valuation models<br>(discounted cash flows).

SET-OFF OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nThe group enters into set-off agreements with banks in connection with derivatives. Generally, the amounts owed under such agreements by each counterparty on a given day for all outstanding transactions in the same currency are aggregated into a single net amount payable by one party to the other. In certain cases – e.g. when a credit event such as a default occurs – all outstanding\n\ntransactions under the agreement are terminated, their value as of termination is determined, and only a single net amount is payable for settling all transactions. These items are not set off in the balance sheet, as such, as the net set-off of multiple transactions under the same framework agreements does not generally occur.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe tables below show financial assets and liabilities that have actually been offset along with amounts that are subject to a set-off agreement but which have not been offset as they do not fulfill the criteria for set-off prescribed under IFRS.\n\n| EURK                                                                                                                      | FINANCIAL<br>ASSETS (GROSS) | OFFSET BALANCE<br>ITEMS (GROSS) | ACCOUNTED<br>FINANCIAL<br>ASSETS (NET) | EFFECT OF<br>GENERAL<br>OFFSETTING<br>AGREEMENTS | NET AMOUNTS |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Financial assets 2023                                                                                                     |                             |                                 |                                        |                                                  |             |\n| Other financial assets -

HEDGES\n\nThe group enters into derivative financial instruments (forward currency transactions and interest rate swaps) to hedge foreign currency and interest rate risk. The aim of using derivative financial instruments is to offset fluctuations in cash flows from future transactions. Expected revenues in foreign currencies serve as the basis for planning future cash flows.\n\nThe group only recognizes changes in the spot rate component of forward currency transactions as a hedging instrument in cash flow hedges. The change in the forward component is accounted for separately as a cost of hedging and transferred to a reserve for hedging costs in equity or reclassified in the income statement if the hedged item affects profit or loss (as part of the financial result).\n\nDerivatives are generally measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9. The group applies the rules for cash flow hedge accounting defined by IFRS 9 to these derivative financial instruments.\n\nHowever, the main contractual criteria of the hedged item and the hedging instrument are identical but oppositely structured (\"critical terms match\"), ensuring an economic context for the hedging relationship. As of December 31, 2023 (as well as during the previous year), there were no derivative financial instruments for which no hedging relationships were able to be established.\n\nA cash flow hedge is present if variable cash flows from recognized assets and/or liabilities or forecast business transactions that are subject to a market price risk are being hedged. If the requirements for a cash flow hedge are met, the effective portion of the change in the market value of hedging instruments must be recognized directly in consolidated equity. However, it is not recognized in profit or loss until the hedged item transaction occurs.\n\nWhere foreign currency hedges are used, the change in the market value of the derivatives is recognized in profit or loss. From that date, the change in the market value can be compared to the end-of-period closing rate of the foreign currency trade payables or foreign currency trade receivables. Any changes in earnings that are caused by the ineffectiveness of derivative financial instruments are recognized in profit or loss in the consolidated income statement.\n\nTo measure the effectiveness of a currency hedge, the hedged items and the hedging transactions are grouped together in so-called maturity bands according to the hedged risk. The maturity bands should not cover more than one quarter-year. The prospective effectiveness is assessed at the inception of the hedging relationship and reviewed at each measurement date as well as in the event of a significant change in the circumstances that affect the criteria for assessing effectiveness. In the case of interest rate hedges, prospective effectiveness is measured using a sensitivity analysis and retrospective effectiveness testing is performed using the dollar offset approach.\n\nDerivatives are measured at fair value. The fair value is the market value and is determined using accepted methods of financial mathematics. The basis for measuring the derivatives is the market data (interest rate, exchange rates, etc.) prevailing on the reporting date. The forward rate applicable on the reporting date is used for measuring forward currency transactions. In the case of positive market values, the creditworthiness of the counterparty is included in the measurement by means of a credit value adjustment (CVA). In the case of negative market values, a debit value adjustment (DVA) is deducted in order to account for the group's own risk of default. Special models are used to estimate the measurement. They are checked for plausibility by means of bank valuations.\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\n| 12/31/2023                       | CURRENCY | NOTIONAL<br>AMOUNT<br>IN 1000

Cash flow from financing activities included repayments of lease liabilities amounting to EUR 25,139k (previous year: EUR 23,414k). The remaining EUR 26,537k (previous year: EUR 20,531k) relate to short-term and low-value leases as well as interest expenses and income from subleases of right-of-use assets and are presented in cash flow from operating activities.\n\n#### Options for prolongation\n\nSome rental and lease agreements contain options for prolongation, which can be exercised by the group up to one year before the end of the fixed term. Wherever possible, the group seeks to include options for prolongation when concluding new rental contracts and leases in order to ensure operational flexibility. On the date of provision, the group assesses whether the right to exercise options for prolongation is sufficiently certain. The group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain that an option for prolongation will be exercised if a material event or change in circumstances occurs that is within its control.\n\n#### 49. LEASES AS A LESSOR (IFRS 16)\n\nFrom the lessor's perspective, all leases are classified as operating leases, as they are structured in such a way that the PIERER Mobility Group essentially retains all the risks and opportunities associated with ownership.\n\nThis does not apply to one sublease which the group classifies as a finance lease. This relates to the sublease of a building which was reported as a right of use under property, plant and equipment. No\n\nnew sublease was concluded and recognized in the 2023 financial year. In addition, the group recognized interest income on leasing receivables in 2023 in the amount of EUR 10k (previous year: EUR 10k). As of December 31, 2023, the leasing receivables from subleases amounted to EUR 767k (previous year: EUR 763k). Of this, EUR 253k (previous year: EUR 251k) are due in less than one year, and EUR 514k (previous year: EUR 511k) are due in 1-5 years.\n\n{104}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-104-0\"></span>X .

APPROVAL OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Executive Board on March 20, 2024 (previous year: March 21, 2023) for review by the Supervisory Board, for submission to the Annual General Meeting and for subsequent publication. Within the scope of the review it is required to perform, the Supervisory Board may require changes to be made to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWels, March 14, 2024\n\nThe Executive Board of PIERER Mobility AG\n\nttu\n\nStefan Pierer (CEO) Hubert Trunkenpolz Viktor Sigl (CFO)\n\nFlorian Kecht Alex Pierer Rudolf Wiesbeck\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\n# Auditor's Report\n\n## REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## AUDIT OPINION\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of\n\n#### PIERER Mobility AG, Wels, Austria,\n\nand its subsidiaries (\"the Group\"), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023, and the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements comply with the legal requirements and present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and its consolidated financial performance and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements pursuant to Section 245a UGB (Austrian Commercial Code).\n\n## BASIS FOR OUR OPINION\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the EU Regulation 537/2014 (\"AP Regulation\") and Austrian Standards on Auditing. These standards require the audit to be conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities\" section of our report. We are independent of the audited Group in accordance with Austrian company law and professional regulations, and we have fulfilled our other responsibilities under those relevant ethical requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained up to the date of the auditor's report is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on this date.\n\n## KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements. These matters were addressed in the con- text of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, however, we do not provide a separate opinion thereon.\n\nRecognition of Development Costs Refer to note 22\n\n#### Risk for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements of PIERER Mobility AG, development costs of EUR 506.7 million are reported under the balance sheet item \"Intangible assets\" and therefore represent a significant portion of the group's assets. According to IAS 38, the Group recognizes research costs are as expenses, while development costs for future serial products are capitalized if the capitalization requirements according to IAS 38.57ff. are fulfilled.\n\nThe main requirments for recognizing development costs as assets are the feasibility of the development projects (including the possibility of technical realization, the intention to complete and the ability to use) and the expected achievement of future economic benefits. The complexity of research and development projects is increasing due to the group's technology leadership as the leading powered two-wheeler manufacturer in Europe and the associated new development projects (including investments in electromobility and a range of zero-emission products). The assessment of project feasibility plays an important role in this context and is subject to discretionary decicions by management.\n\nIn addition to meeting the recognition requirements in accordance with IAS 38.57ff. the recording of time and cost for development projects also plays an important role in accuratley calculating development costs.\n\n## Our Response\n\nWe assessed the recognition of development costs as follows:\n\n- We obtained an understanding of managements process for the distinction between research and development costs and the evaluation of the recognition requirements of development costs according to IAS 38.57ff.\n- We evaluated the design, establishment and effectiveness of management's process-related controls over the capitalization of development costs, including review of management's project feasibility documentation.\n- We assessed, on the basis of random samples, whether a proper distinction has been made between research and development costs capitalized as intangible assets.\n- We evaluated, on a sample basis, the adequacy of capitalized expenses by reconciling material costs, overheads and accumulated engineering hours to external invoices and internal time- sheets and payslips.\n\nImpairment of goodwill \"Pierer New Mobility\"\n\nRefer to note 22\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Risk for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements of PIERER Mobility AG, goodwill is recognized for the cash-generating unit \"PIERER New Mobility\" of EUR 19.5 million. PIERER Mobility AG therefore tests the \"PIERER New Mobility\" cash-generating unit for impairment at least once a year and whenever there are indications of impairment.\n\nFor this purpose, PIERER Mobility AG determines the recoverable amount of the \"PIERER New Mobility\" cash-generating unit using a discounted cash flow method. The recoverable amount determined (impairment test) resulted in sufficient coverage of the carrying amounts.\n\nThe measurement of the recoverable amount of cash-generating units requires assumptions and estimates, such as the estimate of future cash flows and the determination of the discount rate to be used.\n\nThere is therefore a risk for the consolidated financial statements that inappropriate estimates could have a material impact on the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit \"PIERER New Mobility\" and thus the carrying amount of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet and the operating result in the consolidated income statement.\n\n#### Our Response\n\nWe assessed the recoverability of the cash-generating unit \"PIERER New Mobility\" with the involvement of our valuation specialists as follows:\n\n- We obtained an understanding of the planning process, we discussed the assumptions regarding growth rates and operating results with the responsible managers in the company and compared the planning data on which the valuation is based with the current budget figures approved by the Supervisory Board and the medium-term planning approved by the Management Board.\n- We evaluated the methodology of the impairment test performed and assessed whether it complies with the relevant standards. We compared the assumptions used to determine the cost of capital rates with market and industry-specific benchmarks and verified the mathematical accuracy of the calculation scheme.\n- In addition, we assessed whether the disclosures on goodwill and the trademark in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate.\n\n#### OTHER INFORMATION\n\nManagement is responsible for other information. Other information is all information provided in the annual report, other than the consolidated financial statements, the group management report and the auditor's report.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover other information and we do not provide any kind of assurance thereon.\n\nIn conjunction with our audit, it is our responsibility to read this other information and to assess whether, based on knowledge gained during our audit, it contains any material inconsistencies with the consolidated financial statements or any apparent material misstatement of fact.\n\nIf, on the basis of our work on the other information obtained before the date of the auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of fact in other information, we must report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n#### RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU, the additional requirements pursuant to Section 245a UGB (Austrian Commercial Code) and for such internal controls as management determines are necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nManagement is also responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless management either intents to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe audit committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\n## AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinion. Reasonable assurance represents a high level of assurance, but provides no guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the AP Regulation and Austrian Standards on Auditing (and therefore ISAs), will always detect a material misstatement, if any. Misstatements may result from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the AP Regulation and Austrian Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.\n\n#### Moreover:\n\n- We identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, we design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to serve as a basis for our audit opinion. The risk of not detecting material misstatements resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or override of internal control.\n- We obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- We evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- We conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our audit report to the respective note in the consolidated financial statements. If such disclosures are not appropriate, we will modify our audit opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. How- ever, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the notes, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- We obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n- We communicate with the audit committee regarding, amongst other matters, the planned scope and timing of our audit as well as significant findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n- We communicate to the audit committee that we have complied with the relevant professional requirements in respect of our independence, that we will report any relationships and other events that could reasonably affect our independence and, where appropriate, the related safeguards.\n- From the matters communicated with the audit committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit i.e. key audit matters. We describe these key audit matters in our auditor's report unless laws or other legal regulations preclude public disclosure about the matter or when in very rare cases, we determine that a matter should not be included in our audit report because the negative consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public benefits of such communication.\n\n## REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n#### Group Management Report\n\nIn accordance with Austrian company law, the group management report is to be audited as to whether it is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and prepared in accordance with legal requirements.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the group management report in accordance with Austrian company law and other legal or regulatory requirements.\n\nWe have conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted standards on the audit of group management reports.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, the group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with legal requirements. The disclosures pursuant to Section 243a UGB (Austrian Commercial Code) are appropriate.\n\n#### Statement\n\nBased on our knowledge gained in the course of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and our understanding of the Group and its environment, we did not note any material misstatements in the group management report.\n\n#### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 10 AP REGULATION\n\nWe were elected as auditors at the Annual General Meeting on 21 April 2023 and were appointed by the supervisory board on 25 Juli 2023 to audit the financial statements of Company for the financial year ending on 31 December 2023.\n\nWe have been auditors of the Company, without interruption, since the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December, 2014.\n\nWe declare that our opinion expressed in the \"Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements\" section of our report is consistent with our additional report to the Audit Committee, in accor- dance with Article 11 AP Regulation.\n\nWe declare that we have not provided any prohibited non-audit services (Article 5 Paragraph 1 AP Regulation) and that we have ensured our independence throughout the course of the audit, from the audited Group.\n\n#### ENGAGEMENT PARTNER\n\nThe engagement partner is Mr Mag. Alexander Gall.\n\nLinz, 14 March 2024\n\nKPMG Austria GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungs- und Steuerberatungsgesellschaft\n\nMag.

Holdinggesellschaft ist, beinhaltet der Lagebericht neben den Informationen des Einzelabschlusses auf Basis UGB (Teil 1) auch die Informationen des Konzernabschlusses auf Basis IFRS (Teil 2).\n\n## *I) Einzelabschluss der PIERER Mobility AG (nach UGB):*\n\n## **A. Geschäftsverlauf und Lage des Unternehmens**\n\nDas Geschäftsjahr für den Einzelabschluss der PIERER Mobility AG umfasst den Zeitraum vom 1.1.2023 bis 31.12.2023.\n\nDie PIERER Mobility AG ist Alleinaktionärin der KTM AG und hält 10.678.706 Stk. Aktien (100% Anteile). Zum Stichtag 31.12.2023 hält die PIERER Mobility AG unverändert 100% Anteile an der PIERER Innovation GmbH, 100% der Anteile an der PIERER E-Commerce GmbH (vorm. HDC GmbH) und 100% Anteile an der Avocodo GmbH. Seit Juli 2023 hält die Pierer Mobility AG direkt 100% Anteile an der KTM Forschungs- und Entwicklungs GmbH sowie KTM Racing GmbH, die von der KTM AG eingebracht wurden. Im Oktober hat die PIERER Mobility AG 74 % Anteile an der LX media GmbH direkt erworben. An der Kiska GmbH hält die Gesellschaft unverändert 50% sowie an der AC styria Mobilitätscluster GmbH 12,33%.\n\nDa die PIERER Mobility AG im Wesentlichen die Aufgaben einer geschäftsleitenden Holdinggesellschaft erfüllt, wird im Lagebericht auch auf die Entwicklungen des Geschäftsjahres 2023 ihrer Tochtergesellschaften sowie des Konzerns insgesamt eingegangen.\n\n## **B. Ertrags- und Vermögenslage**\n\n## **Ergebnisanalyse**\n\nDie PIERER Mobility AG hat im abgelaufenen Geschäftsjahr einen Jahresüberschuss von € 42,9 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 78,7 Mio.) erzielt. Positiv wirkten sich im Wesentlichen Dividendenerträge aus den Beteiligungsunternehmen in Höhe von € 12,6 Mio. sowie Zinserträge in Höhe von € 1,5 Mio. aus. Negativ wirkten sich vor allem die sonstigen betrieblichen Aufwendungen aus. Diese betreffen im Wesentlichen Aufwendungen für konzerninterne Dienstleistungen und Umlagen, Aufwendungen für Vorstandstätigkeiten, Steuerberatungsaufwand sowie Rechts- und Beratungsaufwand.\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Bilanzanalyse**\n\n.\n\nDie Bilanzsumme zum 31.12.2023 in Höhe von € 1.335 Mio (Vorjahr: € 1.363,1 Mio) hat sich um € 28,2 Mio. reduziert, was im Wesentlichen auf die Reduktion der Forderungen gegenüber verbundene Unternehmen zurückzuführen ist.\n\nDas Anlagevermögen hat sich im Geschäftsjahr 2023 auf € 1.292,6 Mio. erhöht (Vorjahr: € 1.251,7 Mio.) und ist im Wesentlichen auf die Erhöhung der Anteile an der KTM Forschungs- und Entwicklungs GmbH sowie KTM Racing GmbH zurückzuführen.\n\nDas Umlaufvermögen hat sich im Geschäftsjahr 2023 auf € 42,3 Mio. vermindert (Vorjahr: € 110,0 Mio. erhöht) und ist im Wesentlichen auf die Reduktion der Forderungen gegenüber verbundenen Unternehmen zurückzuführen. Die Forderungen gegenüber verbundenen Unternehmen betragen zum Stichtag € 13,6 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 90,3 Mio.) und betreffen im Wesentlichen Forderungen aus Dividendenanspruch, Finanzierungsforderungen sowie Forderungen aus laufenden Verrechnungen und sonstigen Forderungen. Die liquiden Mittel haben sich gegenüber dem Vorjahr um € 9,2 Mio. erhöht.\n\nDas Eigenkapital hat sich vermindert und beträgt zum Stichtag € 1.301,5 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 1.326,2 Mio.). Die Eigenkapitalquote beträgt 97,5% und liegt somit auf einem sehr hohen Niveau.\n\nDie Verbindlichkeiten haben sich im abgelaufenen Geschäftsjahr reduziert und lagen zum 31.12.2023 bei € 33,1 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 34,4 Mio.). Die Reduktion der Verbindlichkeiten resultiert im Wesentlichen aus dem Rückgang der Verbindlichkeiten gegenüber verbundenen Unternehmen. Von den kurz- und langfristigen Verbindlichkeiten betreffen € 30,0 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 30,0 Mio.) Namensschuldverschreibungen, € 1,9 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 1,6 Mio.) Verbindlichkeiten aus Lieferungen und Leistungen, € 0,6 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 2,2 Mio.) Verbindlichkeiten gegenüber verbundenen Unternehmen sowie € 0,6 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 0,6 Mio.) sonstige Verbindlichkeiten.\n\n## **C. Mitarbeiter**\n\nIm Jahresdurchschnitt beschäftigte die Gesellschaft keine (Vorjahr: 0) MitarbeiterInnen.\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **LAGEBERICHT ZUM KONZERNABSCHLUSS PER 31.12.2023 DER PIERER MOBILITY AG, WELS**\n\n## **1. ENTWICKLUNG DER PIERER MOBILITY-GRUPPE**\n\n## **DAS UNTERNEHMEN**\n\nDie PIERER Mobility AG ist die Dachgesellschaft für Europas führenden Hersteller motorisierter Zweiräder und produziert eine vollständige Premium-Markenpalette von KTM, GASGAS, Husqvarna und MV Agusta Motorcycles. Mit ihrer Innovationskraft ist PIERER Mobility durch ihre Motorradmarken ein wegweisender Technologieführer für zweirädrige E-Mobilität. Mit Husqvarna und GASGAS E-Bicycles wird das Zweiradsortiment komplementiert. Das Premium-Markenangebot bietet weiters Hochleistungskomponenten der Marke WP sowie spezielle KTM X-BOW Hochleistungssportwagen.\n\nInfolge der strategischen Partnerschaft mit Bajaj in Indien konnte das Unternehmen die Produktionskapazitäten in den letzten Jahren diversifizieren und die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit auf dem globalen Markt erhöhen. Die Kooperation mit CFMOTO in China und das Joint Venture mit Maxcom in Bulgarien stärken sowohl die Fahrradals auch die Motorradproduktion nachhaltig. Mit führender Technologie im Bereich der Niedervolt-Elektromobilität will PIERER Mobility weltweit Marktführer bei elektrischen Zweirädern im Leistungsbereich von 250W bis 15 kW werden.\n\nDie Aktien der PIERER Mobility AG sind im \"Swiss Performance Index (SPI)\" der SIX Swiss Exchange in Zürich primärkotiert und zusätzlich im Prime Market der Wiener Börse gelistet.\n\n### **ABSATZ- UND UMSATZENTWICKLUNG IM GESCHÄFTSJAHR 2023**\n\nDie PIERER Mobility-Gruppe steigerte im Geschäftsjahr 2023 trotz schwieriger wirtschaftlicher Rahmenbedingungen und einem Umbruch in der Fahrradindustrie den Konzernumsatz um 9,2 % auf einen neuen Rekordwert von € 2.661,2 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 2.437,2 Mio.). Mit 381.555 verkauften Motorrädern (Vorjahr: 375.492) im Geschäftsjahr 2023 erreichte der Motorradbereich ein Absatzplus von rund 2 %. Aufgrund der weltweiten Überbestände im Fahrradbereich war auch die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe mit stark gefallenen Marktpreisen konfrontiert. Das Absatzwachstum in der Fahrrad-Division von mehr als 30 % war geprägt von Lagerbestandsbereinigungen und der Abgabe der Marke R Raymon. Im Geschäftsjahr 2023 wurden 157.358 Fahrräder (Vorjahr: 118.465) verkauft.\n\nIn den Vertriebsregionen von Europa lag der Absatz bei rund 140.000 Motorrädern (+15 %) und rund zwei Drittel der Motorräder (rund 240.000) wurden in den Märkten außerhalb Europas abgesetzt. Trotz eines leichten Absatzrückgangs in Nordamerika schaffte es die dortige Niederlassung dennoch zum zweiten Mal in Folge mehr als 100.000 Motorräder abzusetzen. Während sich der Absatz in Südamerika (-26 %) und Asien (-27 %) im abgelaufenen Geschäftsjahr rückläufig zeigte, konnte der Absatz in Australien mit rund 19.700 abgesetzten Motorrädern leicht (+1 %) über das Vorjahresniveau gehoben werden.\n\nEntgegen den globalen wirtschaftlichen schwierigen Rahmenbedingungen ist die Nachfrage in den Kernmärkten Europa mit +11 % (~ 820.000 neu zugelassene Motorräder) sehr stark und in Nordamerika (USA & Kanada) mit +4 % (485.000 Motorräder) ebenfalls auch deutlich positiv gestiegen. Der Marktanteil aller drei Marken (KTM, Husqvarna, GASGAS) liegt somit im Jahr 2023 in Europa bei rund 10,6 % bzw. bei 12,6 % in Nordamerika. Leicht rückgängig ist der australische (inklusive Neuseeland) Motorradmarkt mit einem 3%-igen Rückgang auf 67.000 neu registrierte Motorräder. Dennoch gelang in diesem Markt ein Anstieg des Marktanteiles der drei Marken gesamt auf 21 %. Der relevante indische Motorradmarkt befindet sich hingegen wie im Vorjahr deutlich im Aufschwung (+22 %). Bajaj setzte in Indien knapp 66.000 KTM und Husqvarna Motorräder ab, resultierend in einem Marktanteil von 5,3 %.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **STRATEGISCHE PROJEKTE**\n\nIm Geschäftsjahr 2023 wurde die Zusammenarbeit mit CFMOTO weiter intensiviert und ausgebaut. Einerseits wurden im Februar 2023 die Aktivitäten in der im Geschäftsjahr 2022 gegründeten Tochtergesellschaft CFMOTO Motorcycles Distribution GmbH, Munderfing, aufgenommen und somit der Vertrieb von CFMOTO-Motorrädern in Europa, insbesondere in Deutschland, Österreich, der Schweiz, Spanien und Großbritannien übernommen. Andererseits wurde die seit vielen Jahren bestehende Zusammenarbeit bei Industrialisierungsprojekten im etablierten Joint Venture Zhejiang CFMOTO-KTMR2R Motorcycles Co., Ltd., Zhejian, China, intensiviert und die Serienproduktion von KTM-Modellen der Mittelklasse weiter ausgebaut. Die Intensivierung des Joint Ventures und die Zusammenarbeit in den Bereichen Produktstrategie, Produktentwicklung, Industrialisierung und Vertrieb ist ein weiterer Schritt, um die steigende Marktnachfrage in China und dem asiatischen Raum, sowie auch weltweit bedienen zu können. Darüber hinaus wird die Produktionskapazität von 50.000 auf 100.000 Fahrzeuge erhöht. Als Zeichen der intensivierten Zusammenarbeit erhöhte CFMOTO zudem seine Beteiligung an der PIERER Mobility AG auf 2,0 %.\n\nEin wichtiger Meilenstein für das Unternehmen war der Abschluss einer strategischen Kooperation mit dem italienischen Premium-Motoradhersteller MV Agusta S.p.A., mit Sitz in Varese, an dem die KTM AG bereits im November einen Anteil von 25,1 % übernommen hat. Die KTM-Gruppe verantwortet seit dem Geschäftsjahr 2023 den Einkauf sowie den Vertrieb in den wichtigsten europäischen Ländern, das Marketing und die Kundenbetreuung für MV Agusta-Motorräder. Ferner hat der Vorstand den strategischen Beschluss gefasst, die im Zuge des Kooperationsvertrags eingeräumte Call-Option zum Erwerb eines weiteren Anteils von 25,0 an der MV Agusta S.p.A. im Frühjahr 2026 auszuüben.\n\nWeiters hat der Vorstand hat den strategischen Beschluss gefasst, den Fokus noch stärker auf das Kerngeschäft Powered-Two-Wheelers (Motorräder und E-Bicycles) zu legen und sich auf die Premiummarken KTM, GASGAS und Husqvarna sowie MV Agusta zu konzentrieren. Aufgrund dieser Entscheidung wurde der Verkauf der Marken R Raymon und FELT sowie die Abgabe des Non-E-Fahrradbereiches vom Vorstand eingeleitet. In diesem Zusammenhang wurde im September 2023 die Marke \"R Raymon\" an die R RAYMON Bicycles GmbH (vormals: Johansson GmbH), Schweinfurt, Deutschland, veräußert. Weiters wurde der Verkaufsprozess der Fahrradmarke FELT an ein Konsortium rund um Florian Burguet ebenfalls eingeleitet, welcher in der ersten Jahreshälfte 2024 abgeschlossen werden soll. Florian Burguet ist als Vorstand mit Ende Dezember ausgeschieden.\n\n### **AKTIVITÄTEN UND ERFOLGE IM RENNSPORT**\n\n### **Motorsport**\n\nIm Mai 2023 wurde in der KTM Motohall die Ausstellung \"Legends of Dakar\" eröffnet. So konnte das Siegermotorrad, mit dem Kevin Benavides im Januar die Rally Dakar 2023 gewonnen hatte, noch einen stolzen Platz in der Ausstellung einnehmen. Sein Erfolg war der bereits 19. KTM-Sieg bei der Rally Dakar in den letzten 22 Jahren. Auch im Motocross ist PIERER Mobility mit allen Marken erfolgreich. Jeffrey Herlings von KTM Red Bull Factory Racing brach beim Grand Prix von Spanien zur Saisonmitte den Allzeitrekord von 101 Siegen und erhöhte seine persönliche Erfolgsbilanz auf 103 Siege. Andrea Adamo sicherte sich den MX2 WM Titel. Der Deutsche Manuel Lettenbichler holte seine zweite FIM Hard Enduro Weltmeisterschaft in Folge – eine phänomenale Quote von sechs Siegen in sechs Rennen. Jospe Garcia triumphierte nicht nur bei den International Six Days Enduro, sondern krönte sich auch in der EnduroGP E1 Klasse zum Weltmeister. Seit der Einführung des globalen Husqvarna Factory Racing Teams im Jahr 2015 hat Husqvarna Motorcycles seine Position als dominierende Kraft im Offroad-Rennsport konsequent ausgebaut. 2023 wurde diese Erfolgsbilanz mit dem FIM SuperEnduro-Titel von Billy Bolt auf insgesamt 116 Weltmeistertitel verbessert. Als dritte Marke ist GASGAS im Motorsport erfolgreich unterwegs. Jorge Prado schrieb mit seinem MXGP WM Titel Geschichte – es war der erste Titel für GASGAS in der Motocross Königsklasse überhaupt. In der FIM EnduroGP-Weltmeisterschaft konnte GASGAS in den letzten Jahren seine größten Triumphe feiern. Nachdem Andrea Verona 2022 sowohl den EnduroGP- als auch den Enduro1-Titel gewonnen hatte, wechselte er die Klasse und stieg 2023 in die Enduro2 ein.\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\nDer hochspezialisierte Trial-Sport ist für GASGAS nach wie vor äußerst wichtig, da die Marke sowohl drinnen als auch draußen weiterhin auf höchstem Niveau konkurriert. Für 2023 verpflichtete GASGAS die TrialGP-Nummer zwei Jaime Busto, um zusammen mit Sondre Haga, dem Trial2-Weltmeister von 2022, in der Königsklasse anzutreten.\n\nIm Jahr 2023 setzte allein KTM 28 Fahrer in der MotoGP™ sowie bei Nachwuchsveranstaltungen wie dem Red Bull MotoGP™ Rookies Cup und dem Northern Talent Cup eine ganze Reihe von jungen Talenten ein. Red Bull KTM Factory Racing feierte mit Brad Binder zwei Siege im neuen MotoGP™-Sprintformat und errang durch ihn und seinen neuen Teamkollegen Jack Miller insgesamt zehn Podestplätze. KTM sicherte sich dadurch Platz zwei der Herstellerwertung in der MotoGP™. In der Moto2™ ließ Pedro Acosta die Konkurrenz hinter sich und holte bei seiner erst dritten WM-Teilnahme seinen zweiten Titel, nachdem er 2021 die Moto3™ dominiert hatte. Mit ihm wird das GASGAS MotoGP™-Projekt für 2024 um ein weiteres Talent erweitert. Als zweifacher Weltmeister ist Pedro Acosta zweifellos einer der talentiertesten Nachwuchsfahrer im Straßenrennsport. Er wird 2024 von Augusto Fernandez in der Startaufstellung unterstützt, der seine zweite Saison bei Red Bull GASGAS Tech3 antritt. In der Moto3™ feierte GASGAS Aspar Fahrer David Alonso vier Rennsiege und acht Podiumsplatzierungen in seiner Premierensaison. Der Spanier gilt als Favorit für die Moto3™-Krone in der Saison 2024. Bei Husqvarna Factory Racing ging Ayumu Sasaki nach dem vierten Platz in der 2022er Moto3™- Weltmeisterschaft als Titelanwärter in die Saison 2023. Erneut erwies er sich während der gesamten Saison als regelmäßiger Podiumskandidat und beendete die Saison als Vize-Moto3™-Weltmeister. Teamkollege Collin Veijer lieferte ebenfalls beeindruckende Ergebnisse ab und feierte einen Sieg in seiner Debutsaison.\n\n### **Radsport**\n\nSeit 2023 bestreitet die Marke GASGAS E-Bicycles die UCI Mountain Bike World Series, insbesondere den E-Enduro Pro World Cup. Gemeinsam mit Industriepartnern traten Johannes Fischbach und Alex Marin von GASGAS SRAM Racing sowie Simon Carlsson und Alexandre Fayolle von GASGAS MOTOREX Racing an. Nach allen fünf Runden belegte Alex Marin den 4. Platz und hielt das Podium bereits in der allerersten Saison für GASGAS E-Bicycles in greifbarer Nähe.\n\n### **AUSWIRKUNGEN DES RUSSISCH-UKRAINISCHEN KRIEGES**\n\nDie Einschätzungen der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe zu den Auswirkungen des Kriegsgeschehens in der Ukraine sind im Vergleich zum Vorjahr unverändert. Die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe hat keinen wesentlichen Grund identifiziert, ihre Schätzungen und Erwartungen zum 31. Dezember 2023 aufgrund des Kriegsgeschehens in der Ukraine wesentlich zu ändern. Die Gruppe verfügt weder über Investitionen, sonstige Vermögenswerte oder sonstige wesentliche Geschäftsbeziehungen in der Ukraine, Russland oder Weißrussland noch hat die Gruppe wesentliche Geschäftsbeziehungen zu Lieferanten oder Händlern in diesen Ländern. Vor diesem Hintergrund erwartet die Gruppe keine wesentlichen Auswirkungen auf die erwarteten zukünftigen Cashflows. Gleichermaßen hat die Gruppe durch den Krieg und die verhängten Sanktionen keinen Verlust der Beherrschung, der gemeinschaftlichen Führung oder der Fähigkeit zur Ausübung eines maßgeblichen Einflusses auf Unternehmen erlitten und erwartet auch dergleichen nicht.\n\n## **2. WIRTSCHAFTLICHES UMFELD UND MARKTENTWICKLUNG**\n\nDie weltwirtschaftlichen Aussichten sind unverändert eingetrübt. Die Auswirkungen des seit 2022 andauernden Russisch-Ukrainischen Krieges, sowie die unter anderem daraus resultierenden signifikant erhöhten Inflationsraten, haben zu einer deutlichen Verlangsamung der Weltwirtschaft geführt. Zwar haben sich die Prognosen im Laufe des Geschäftsjahres 2023 grundlegend verbessert, allerdings bleiben sie hierdurch weiterhin gehemmt.\n\nIm Zuge dessen lässt sich eine weitgehend positive Normalisierung der Geschäfts- und Verbraucherstimmung erkennen, die Rohstoffpreise sinken und die im vergangenen Geschäftsjahr beobachteten Störungen in der\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nLieferkette erscheinen weitgehend überwunden, da die Logistikkosten und die Lieferzeiten für notwendige Ressourcen im Allgemeinen wieder das Niveau vor der COVID-Pandemie erreichen. Wesentliche finanz- und gesamtwirtschaftliche Risiken bestehen zum einen in der schwelenden Immobilienkrise in China, zum anderen in der weiteren Entwicklung der Inflationsraten. Während sowohl die Gesamtinflation als auch die Kerninflation, die die volatilen Energie- und Nahrungsmittelkomponenten ausschließt, rückläufig sind, wird erwartet, dass beide zumindest kurz- und mittelfristig erhöht bleiben. In einer Gesamtbetrachtung sind die wirtschaftlichen Risiken im Allgemeinen besser ausbalanciert als im vergangenen Geschäftsjahr, aber das Risiko einer Abwärtsbewegung ist immer noch Gegenwertig. Dies verdeutlicht die weiterhin bestehende Unsicherheit insbesondere über den Verlauf des Krieges in der Ukraine, seine weiteren Folgen sowie die jüngsten Unsicherheiten über den Ausgang des aufgeflammten Krieges im Nahen Osten.\n\nLetztlich führt die beschriebene Situation immer noch dazu, dass die globalen Wachstumsprognosen der führenden Organisationen auf diesem Gebiet, wie dem Internationalen Währungsfonds (IWF), der Organisation für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (OECD) und die Weltbank, unsicherer sind als üblich und ständig angepasst werden. Die jüngsten Schätzungen des IWF deuten auf eine im Wesentlichen unveränderte globale Wirtschaftswachstumsprognose von 3,1 % für 2024 und 3,2 % für 2025 im Vergleich zu früheren Schätzungen. Die im Wesentlichen unveränderten Prognosen zeigen, dass die größten Risiken für die globale Wirtschaftsentwicklung inzwischen ausgeglichen und stabilisiert sind, wenngleich angesichts der oben beschriebenen Probleme immer noch Abwärtsrisiken bestehen. Die veröffentlichten Schätzungen basieren auf zahlreichen Annahmen zu einer Vielzahl makroökonomischer Faktoren, insbesondere zur Preisentwicklung fossiler Brennstoffe und anderer Ressourcen sowie zum allgemeinen Zinsniveau.\n\nFür Industrieländer rechnet der IWF für das Jahr 2024 mit einem Wachstum von 1,5 % und für das nächste Jahr 2025 von 1,8 %. Für die Euro-Zone wird für 2024 ein Wachstum von 0,9 % prognostiziert. Für das Jahr 2025 rechnet der IWF mit einem Wachstum von 1,7 % für die Euro-Zone, während das Wachstum insbesondere in Deutschland mit 0,5 % für 2024 und 1,6 % für 2025 unterdurchschnittlich prognostiziert wird.\n\nFür die Schwellen- und Entwicklungsländer prognostiziert der IWF für das Jahr 2024 ein Wachstum der Wirtschaftsleistung von 4,1 %, für 2025 von 4,2 %. Für China wird eine Wachstumsrate von 4,6 % für das Jahr 2024 und 4,1 % für das Jahr 2025 prognostiziert. Für Indien wird ein Anstieg der Wirtschaftsleistung von 5,7 % für 2024 und von 6,8 % für 2025 prognostiziert.\n\nDer IWF prognostiziert Inflationsraten in Höhe von 5,8 % für 2024 und in Höhe von 4,4 % für 2025. Die künftige Entwicklung der Weltwirtschaft hängt insbesondere von der erfolgreichen Kalibrierung der Geldpolitik ab. Dabei muss eine Bilanz der kumulierten Auswirkungen vergangener Zinserhöhungen gezogen werden, die andernfalls zu erheblichen negativen Nebenwirkungen für den Finanzsektor führen können. Darüber hinaus stellen der Verlauf des Krieges in der Ukraine sowie neuerdings auch im Nahen Osten und nicht zuletzt die wirtschaftliche Erholung und Nachfrage aus China wesentliche Faktoren für die zukünftige Entwicklung der Weltwirtschaft dar. Diese Einschätzung wird weitgehend von der OECD und der Weltbank geteilt. Insbesondere der IWF erklärt auch, dass sich zunehmende Divergenzen im Wirtschaftswachstum abzeichnen, da eine Verlangsamung des Wachstums in fortgeschrittenen Volkswirtschaften offenbar ausgeprägter zu sein scheint als in Schwellen- und Entwicklungsländern. Bei einer im Wesentlichen unveränderten globalen Wachstumsprognose des IWF ist kein größerer globaler Wirtschaftsabschwung zu erwarten, wenngleich alle Prognosen zur globalen Wirtschaftsentwicklung weiterhin mit erheblichen Unsicherheiten behaftet sind.\n\nIm abgelaufenen Geschäftsjahr 2023 entwickelte sich der globale1 **Motorradmarkt** positiv (+2,7 %, entsprechend einem Plus von 90.000 Motorrädern). In **Europa**2 stieg der Markt, gemessen an Neuzulassungen, nach einem kleinen Einbruch im Jahr 2022 wieder auf mehr als 800.000 Motorräder an (+11 %). Speziell die Kernmärkte Deutschland (+12 %), Frankreich (+14 %), Italien (+15) und Spanien (+13 %) profitieren von einer gestiegenen Nachfrage. Dadurch stieg der Marktanteil von 10,0 % auf 10,5 % (gemessen an den drei Kernmarken KTM, Husqvarna und GASGAS).\n\n<sup>1</sup> Bezogen auf die wesentlichen Absatzmärkte der KTM Gruppe: DE, FR, IT, UK, ES, SE, BE, NL, AT, CH, FL, DK, NO, GR, PL, SL, HU, BALTIC, USA, CAN, AUS, NZ, JP, SA, TH, CN, AR, BR, CO.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Motorräder = ϣϤϢccm ohne Motocross, Scooters und ATV's, inkl. Elektromotorräder in den Märkten DE, FR, IT, UK, ES, SE, BE, NL, AT, CH, FI, NO, BALTIC.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn **Nordamerika** stieg der Absatz (im Gegensatz zu Europa inklusive Motocrossmodelle) ebenfalls und schließt bei knapp 490.000 verkauften Einheiten (+4 %). Der Marktanteil steigt durch ein erreichtes Wachstum der drei Kernmarken von 11 % auf 12,6 % (Vorjahr: 11,8 %).\n\nLeicht rückläufig zeigt sich die Entwicklung des **australischen** und **neuseeländischen** Marktes mit einem Rückgang von 3,2 %. Da sich die Zulassungen von KTM, Husqvarna und GASGAS aber um 3,4 % erhöhten, konnte der Marktanteil auf 21,0 % gesteigert werden (Vorjahr: 19,7 %). Das Gesamtvolumen beläuft sich auf knapp 67.000 Motorrädern.\n\nDer relevante indische Motorradmarkt (S2/S3-Segment) befindet sich abermals deutlich im Aufschwung (+22 %) und weist ein Volumen von 1,2 Millionen verkauften Motorrädern auf. Dabei setzte der strategische Partner Bajaj in **Indien** über 65.000 Motorräder der Marken KTM und Husqvarna ab, resultierend in einem leicht gestiegenen Marktanteil von 5,3 % (Vorjahr: 5,0 %). Der asiatische Raum ist 2023 von Verlusten geprägt, wobei die Märkte in **Thailand** (-10,4 %) und **China** (Premium-Importeursmarkt; -17 %) in besonderem Maße betroffen sind. In **Japan** (Motorräder >250cc) beläuft sich der Rückgang auf -6 % und fällt damit etwas geringer aus. Der Rückgang (inklusive Hongkong, bei einem Volumen von ca. 2.000 Motorrädern) beträgt knapp -12 % und hält sich bei einem Volumen von nun knapp 200.000 Motorrädern. Der Marktanteil der KTM-Kernmarken ist in dieser wichtigen Wachstumsregion dennoch auf 5,2 % (Vorjahr 4,9 %) gestiegen.\n\nDer Markt für **New Mobility** sieht sich großen Herausforderungen gegenüber. Während die vergangenen Jahre und Erwartungen von den Nachwirkungen des durch die Corona-Pandemie erhöhten Nachfrageniveaus geprägt waren, deutet sich schon in der vom Zweirad-Industrie-Verbandes (ZIV) veröffentlichten Prognose für das Geschäftsjahr 2023 und zumindest im Folgejahr eine wesentliche Abkühlung an. Für das gesamte Jahr 2023 prognostiziert der ZIV einen Absatz von rund 2 Millionen elektrifizierten New Mobility-Produkten. Dies entspricht einem Rückgang von ca. 10 % verglichen mit dem Rekordjahr 2022, in dem ein Absatzvolumen von 2,2 Mio. Stück erzielt wurde. Darüber hinaus ist anzumerken, dass aktuelle makroökonomische Unsicherheiten, wie einleitend dargelegt, sowie Einflüsse auf Verbraucherpreise nicht zuletzt aufgrund von hohen Inflationsraten die Marktentwicklung negativ beeinflussen. Die Prognosen deuten darauf hin, dass sich der gesamte New Mobility-Markt einem Trend der Konsolidierung gegenübersieht.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **3.

(Vorjahr: € 2.437,2 Mio.). Rund 97 % der Umsatzerlöse wurden außerhalb von Österreich erzielt. Regional betrachtet entfielen 54,4 % der Umsatzerlöse auf Europa (+7,9 Prozentpunkte zum Vorjahr), 29,2 % auf Nordamerika inkl. Mexiko (-4,7 Prozentpunkte zum Vorjahr) und 16,4 % auf den Rest der Welt (-3,2 Prozentpunkte zum Vorjahr).\n\nDas operative Betriebsergebnis (EBIT) verringerte sich um rund 32 % auf € 160,0 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 235,3 Mio.), was einer EBIT-Marge von 6,0 % entspricht. Im Motorradsegment beläuft sich die EBIT-Marge bei rund 9 %, welches innerhalb der ursprünglich geplanten Bandbreite von 8-10 % liegt. Demgegenüber hat die eingeleitete Neuausrichtung des Fahrradbereiches das Ergebnis deutlich belastet. Das operative Ergebnis vor Abschreibungen (EBITDA) liegt mit € 323,5 Mio. um rund 15 % unter dem Vorjahreswert was einer EBITDA-Marge von 12,2 % entspricht. Das Ergebnis nach Steuern beträgt € 76,4 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 170,6 Mio.).\n\nDie Gesamtabsatzzahlen der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe sowie der Absatz von PTWs (Motorräder und E-Bicycles) stellen sich wie folgt dar:\n\nImage /page/140/Figure/5 description: The image is a bar graph comparing the number of PTWs (Powered Two-Wheelers) and bicycles in 2022 and 2023. In 2023, there were 482,195 PTWs and 538,913 bicycles. In 2022, there were 449,971 PTWs and 493,957 bicycles.\n\nDie beiden Segmente \"Motorcycles\" und \"Bicycles\" stellen die operativen Hauptbereiche der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe dar, auf deren Entwicklung im Folgenden eingegangen wird.\n\n## **MOTORCYCLES**\n\nIm Geschäftsjahr 2023 konnte in der Motorrad-Division ein Umsatz von € 2.416,4 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 2.262,5 Mio.) erzielt werden (+6,8 % gegenüber Vorjahr). Im Motoradbereich sind die Kosten für die Lagerbestände der Händler trotz guter Nachfrage durch deutlich erhöhte Zinsen stark angestiegen. Dies führte dazu, dass zur Stärkung der Händlerstruktur verlängerte Zahlungsziele und höhere Rabatte an die Händler gewährt werden mussten. Das EBITDA beträgt im Geschäftsjahr 2023 € 371,0 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 381,2 Mio.) und das EBIT liegt bei € 214,4 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 241,0 Mio.). Dies entspricht einer EBITDA-Marge von 15,4 % (Vorjahr: 16,8 %) und einer EBIT-Marge von 8,9 % (Vorjahr: 10,7 %).\n\nIn Europa stieg der Umsatz im Vergleich zum Vorjahresniveau deutlich auf € 1.229,0 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 977,4 Mio.) an, was einem Umsatzanteil von 50,9 % entspricht (Vorjahr: 43,2 %). In Nordamerika verzeichnete der Motorradbereich einen Umsatz von € 754,4 Mio. (Vorjahr: 811,3 Mio.). Damit wurden 31,2 % des Umsatzes in Nordamerika erzielt (Vorjahr: 35,9 %). In den übrigen Ländern sank der Umsatz leicht gegenüber dem Vorjahr um 8,6 % auf € 432,9 Mio. Der Umsatzanteil in den übrigen Ländern beträgt 17,9 % (Vorjahr: 20,9 %).\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\nMit 280.206 verkauften KTM Motorrädern, 67.462 verkauften Husqvarna Motorrädern und 29.532 verkauften GASGAS Motorrädern im Geschäftsjahr 2023 zusätzlich der abgesetzten Motorräder von MV Agusta (1.852) und CFMOTO (2.503) konnte ein Absatz von 381.555 Motorrädern (2022: 375.492 Stück) erzielt werden (dies unter Berücksichtigung der in Indien und Indonesien von Partner Bajaj verkauften Motorräder). Die Motorrad-Division erreichte somit ein Absatzplus von 1,6 % und festigte damit mit ihren drei Motorradmarken ihre Präsenz in den wichtigen Motorradabsatzmärkten.\n\nImage /page/141/Figure/2 description: The image shows two bar charts comparing sales figures for motorcycles in 2022 and 2023. The left chart represents \"Absatz 2022 Motorräder (Stück)\" with a total of 375,492 units. The bars indicate sales for KTM (268,575), Husqvarna Motorcycles (75,266), and GASGAS (31,651). The right chart represents \"Absatz 2023 Motorräder (Stück)\" with a total of 381,555 units. The bars indicate sales for KTM (280,206), Husqvarna Motorcycles (67,462), GASGAS (29,532), CFM (2,503), and MVA (1,852). A note indicates that the 2023 figures include 8,975 E-Balance Bikes and 69 Skutta units.\n\nIn den Vertriebsregionen von Europa lag der Absatz bei 140.214 Motorrädern (+14,9 %). Rund zwei Drittel der produzierten Motorräder (241.341) wurden in Märkten außerhalb Europas abgesetzt. Besonders stark war das Wachstum in Indien/Nepal, wo 66.426 Motorräder abgesetzt wurden, was einem Plus von 29,0 % im Vergleich zum Vorjahr entspricht. Trotz eines leichten Absatzrückgangs in Nordamerika (-7,7 %) schaffte es die dortige Niederlassung zum zweiten Mal in Folge mit 101.277 Stück mehr als 100.000 Motorräder abzusetzen. Während sich der Absatz in Südamerika mit 27.671 (-26,4 %) und in Asien mit 23.129 (-27,3 %) abgesetzten Motorrädern rückläufig zeigte, konnte der Absatz in Australien mit 19.648 abgesetzten Motorrädern leicht über das Vorjahresniveau (Vorjahr: 19.478 Stück) gehoben werden (+1 %).\n\nImage /page/141/Figure/4 description: The image contains two donut charts, each representing regional data for the year 2023. The chart on the left, titled \"ABSATZ NACH REGIONEN GJ 2023\", shows the distribution of sales across different regions. Europe accounts for 36.7%, North America (including Mexico) for 26.5%, India/Indonesia (via Bajaj) for 17.4%, and the rest of the world for 19.3%. The chart on the right, titled \"UMSATZ NACH REGIONEN GJ 2023\", displays the revenue distribution. Europe contributes 50.9%, North America (including Mexico) 31.2%, and the rest of the world 17.9%.\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\nIm Geschäftsjahr 2023 wurden am Produktionsstandort Mattighofen 217.160 und damit abermals mehr als 200.000 Motorräder produziert. Im Vergleich zum Vorjahr entspricht dies einem leichten Rückgang von -4.881 Stück bzw. -2,2 %. Unter Berücksichtigung der von unserem Partner Bajaj Auto Ltd. in Indien produzierten kleinmotorigen KTM- und Husqvarna-Modelle, der in Spanien produzierten GASGAS-Trials sowie der in China mit unserem Partner CFMOTO produzierten Modelle wurden weltweit 385.330 Motorräder (Vorjahr: 381.823) produziert.\n\n## **BICYCLES**\n\nAufgrund der weltweiten Überbestände im Fahrradbereich war auch die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe mit stark gefallenen Marktpreisen konfrontiert. Das Absatzwachstum in diesem Segment mit den Marken Husqvarna, R Raymon, GASGAS und FELT von rund 33 % war geprägt von Lagerbestandsbereinigungen und der Abgabe der Marke R Raymon. Im Geschäftsjahr 2023 wurden 157.358 Fahrräder (Vorjahr: 118.465) verkauft, davon 100.640 E-Bicycles (Vorjahr: 74.479). Im Fahrradbereich stellt die DACH-Region nach wie vor den größten Absatzmarkt mit rund 60% dar. Der Absatzanteil in der Fahrrad-Division in Nordamerika lag in 2023 bei 10 %.\n\nIm Geschäftsjahr 2023 konnte in der Fahrrad-Division ein Umsatz in Höhe von € 240,7 Mio. erzielt werden (Vorjahr: € 171,2 Mio.). Dies bedeutet ein Umsatzplus von 40,6 % im Jahresvergleich. Das EBITDA lag in 2023 bei € -41,8 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 6,5 Mio.) und das EBIT bei € -47,1 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 2,5 Mio.).\n\nVon den im Geschäftsjahr 2023 abgesetzten E-Bicycles wurden 69,9 % unter der Marke R Raymon, 20,7 % unter der Marke Husqvarna E-Bicycles sowie 7,6 % unter der Marke GASGAS verkauft. Die Absätze der Fahrräder ohne Elektroantrieb verteilen sich auf die beiden Marken R Raymon mit 60,0 % und FELT mit 37,8 % (im Vorjahr annähernd gleich).\n\nImage /page/142/Figure/6 description: The image shows a bar chart comparing the sales of E-Bicycles and Bicycles in 2022 and 2023. In 2022, E-Bicycles sales were 74.479, and Bicycles sales were 43.986, with a total of 118.465 (E-)Bicycles (Stück). In 2023, E-Bicycles sales were 100.640, and Bicycles sales were 56.718, with a total of 157.358 (E-)Bicycles (Stück).\n\nRund 87 % des Absatzes entfallen auf Europa und hier insbesondere auf die DACH-Region. Weitere 10 % betreffen die nordamerikanische Vertriebsregion und der restliche Absatz (rund 3 %) betrifft Asien, Südamerika und Australien.\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/143/Figure/1 description: The image contains two donut charts, each representing regional data for the year 2023. The chart on the left, titled \"ABSATZ NACH REGIONEN GJ 2023\", shows the distribution of sales across different regions. 60.1% of sales are attributed to the DACH region, 26.6% to the rest of Europe, and 13.4% to the rest of the world. The chart on the right, titled \"UMSATZ NACH REGIONEN GJ 2023\", displays the revenue distribution across regions. 71.8% of revenue comes from the DACH region, 17.4% from the rest of Europe, and 10.8% from the rest of the world.\n\n## **BILANZANALYSE**\n\nDie Bilanzstruktur der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe setzt sich wie folgt zusammen:\n\n|                             | 2022    |        | 2023    |        |  |\n|-----------------------------|---------|--------|---------|--------|--|\n|                             | Mio. €  | in %   | Mio. €  | in %   |  |\n| Langfristige Vermögenswerte | 1.195,8 | 46,9%  | 1.333,8 | 45,2%  |  |\n| Kurzfristige Vermögenswerte | 1.354,8 | 53,1%  | 1.619,1 | 54,8%  |  |\n| Vermögenswerte              | 2.550,6 | 100,0% | 2.952,9 | 100,0% |  |\n| Eigenkapital                | 914,4   | 35,8%  | 909,3   | 30,8%  |  |\n| Langfristige Schulden       | 625,6   | 24,5%  | 1.130,0 | 38,3%  |  |\n| Kurzfristige Schulden       | 1.010,6 | 39,6%  | 913,6   | 30,9%  |  |\n| Eigenkapital und Schulden   | 2.550,6 | 100,0% | 2.952,9 | 100,0% |  |\n\nDie Bilanzsumme der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe erhöhte sich gegenüber dem Konzernabschluss zum 31. Dezember 2022 von € 2.550,6 Mio. auf € 2.952,9 Mio. um 15,8 %.\n\nDie Erhöhung der langfristigen Vermögenswerte von € 1.195,8 Mio. auf € 1.333,8 Mio. liegt insbesondere analog zu den Vorjahren im Bereich von Entwicklungsprojekten, welche über den Abschreibungen liegen und zu einer Steigerung der immateriellen Vermögenswerte führten. Zudem stieg auch das Sachanlagevermögen insbesondere aufgrund von Investitionen in den Produktionsstandort von PIERER MAXCOM Mobility OOD in Bulgarien.\n\nInnerhalb der kurzfristigen Vermögenswerte erhöhten sich insbesondere die Vorräte um € 203,3 Mio. Die weiteren wesentlichen Veränderungen betreffen einerseits den Anstieg der Forderungen aus Lieferungen und Leistungen in Höhe von € 80,4 Mio. und andererseits die Reduktion der Zahlungsmittel in Höhe von € 19,8 Mio. Dies führte insgesamt zu einer Erhöhung der kurzfristigen Vermögenswerte um 19,5 % auf € 1.619,1 Mio.\n\nDie kurzfristigen Schulden reduzierten sich gegenüber dem 31. Dezember 2022 um € 97,0 Mio. (-9,6 %). Die Reduzierung ist größtenteils auf das Sinken der Verbindlichkeiten aus Lieferungen und Leistungen in Höhe von € -60,6 Mio. sowie Rückstellungen in Höhe von € -22,2 Mio. zurückzuführen. Die im Vorjahr eingestellte Rückstellung in Höhe von € 20,2 Mio., welche im Rahmen der Kooperationsvereinbarung mit MV Agusta gebildet wurde, wurde in 2023 vollständig verbraucht.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\nDie langfristigen Schulden erhöhten sich um 80,6 % auf € 1.130,0 Mio. Der Anstieg ist größtenteils auf die Erhöhung der Finanzverbindlichkeiten und hier insbesondere aus der Aufnahme eines Schuldscheindarlehens mit einem Volumen von € 300,0 Mio., einem Forschungsdarlehen der Europäischen Investitionsbank in Höhe von € 100,0 Mio. sowie einer Namensschuldverschreibung in Höhe von € 50 Mio. zurückzuführen.\n\nDas Eigenkapital verringerte sich im Geschäftsjahr 2023 um € 5,1 Mio. von € 914,4 Mio. auf € 909,3 Mio. Einerseits wurde durch das Ergebnis nach Steuern in Höhe von € 76,4 Mio. das Eigenkapital gestärkt. Andererseits führten Dividendenzahlungen in Höhe von € 68,1 Mio. zu einer Verringerung des Eigenkapitals. Die sonstigen Effekte in Höhe von € -13,4 Mio. betreffen im Wesentlichen die ergebnisneutrale Erfassung von Fremdwährungsdifferenzen, die Bewertung von Finanzinstrumenten sowie die Neubewertung der Nettoschuld aus leistungsorientierten Versorgungsplänen. Die Eigenkapitalquote liegt mit 30,8 % aufgrund der beschriebenen Bilanzerhöhung unter dem Wert per 31. Dezember 2023 von 35,8 %.\n\n## **LIQUIDITÄTSANALYSE**\n\nDer Cash-Flow aus dem operativen Bereich lag im Geschäftsjahr 2023 bei € -110,9 Mio. und damit deutlich unter dem Vorjahreswert von € 280,3 Mio., wofür insbesondere der Anstieg im Working Capital hauptverantwortlich war. Der Zahlungsmittelabfluss aus Investitionen betrug € -302,1 Mio. und liegt insgesamt über dem Vorjahreswert von € -283,1 Mio. Dieser Anstieg resultiert im Wesentlichen aufgrund der höheren Auszahlungen für den Erwerb von immateriellen Vermögenswerten und Sachanlagen (Effekt € -66,4 Mio.).\n\nWie schon erläutert, sind die Kosten für die Lagerbestände der Händler im Motorradbereich trotz guter Nachfrage durch deutlich erhöhte Zinsen stark angestiegen. Dies führte dazu, dass zur Stärkung der Händlerstruktur verlängerte Zahlungsziele und höhere Rabatte an die Händler gewährt werden mussten. Auf Grund der ausreichend vorhandenen Liquiditätsreserven konnte die PIERER Mobility AG neben ihren Händlern auch die Lieferanten entsprechend unterstützen, um auch deren finanzielle Situation zu stabilisieren und die durch das gestiegene Zinsniveau deutlich erhöhten Belastungen zu dämpfen. Die damit einhergehende negative Auswirkung auf den Free Cash-Flow, der sich im Jahr 2023 auf € -413,0 Mio. beläuft (Vorjahr: € -2,8 Mio.), wurde dadurch bewusst in Kauf genommen.\n\nNach Berücksichtigung des Cash-Flows aus Finanzierungsaktivitäten in Höhe von € 398,7 Mio. verringerten sich die liquiden Mittel im Vergleich zum 31. Dezember 2022 um € 19,8 Mio. (inklusive Fremdwährungseffekte von € -5,4 Mio.) auf € 259,0 Mio.\n\nDurch die starke Eigenkapitalbasis und die langfristigen Finanzierungen stehen ausreichende Liquiditätsreserven nachhaltig zur Verfügung.\n\n## **INVESTITIONEN**\n\nIm laufenden Geschäftsjahr wurden in der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe Gesamtinvestitionen in Höhe von € 316,5 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 293,4 Mio.) inklusive IFRS 16 Leasingzugänge in Höhe von € 32,5 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 25,9 Mio.) getätigt. Die Investitionen ohne Leasingprojekte verteilen sich auf Entwicklungsprojekte (inkl. Werkzeuge), Sachanlagen und immaterielle Vermögensgegenstände wie folgt:\n\n{145}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/145/Figure/1 description: The image shows a bar chart comparing investments in GJ 2022 and GJ 2023. In GJ 2022, the total investment is 267.5, broken down into 44.0, 62.1, and 161.4. In GJ 2023, the total investment is 284.0, broken down into 32.6, 56.3, and 195.1.\n\nIm abgelaufenen Geschäftsjahr wurden wie gewohnt hohe Investitionen in Serienentwicklungsprojekte (inkl. Werkzeuge) vorgenommen. Der Anteil an den Investitionen in Entwicklungsprojekte (inkl. Werkzeuge) zu den Gesamtinvestitionen betragen 69 % und liegen somit über dem Vorjahresniveau (Vorjahr: 60 %). Die nachhaltig hohen Investitionen in die Serienproduktentwicklung stellen einen der wesentlichen Erfolgsfaktoren der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe dar. Auch die Investitionen in die Infrastruktur (Sachanlagen) lagen mit 20 % leicht unter dem Vorjahresniveau von 23 %. Weitere 11 % (Vorjahr: 17 %) entfielen auf immaterielle Vermögensgegenstände (IT, Lizenzen).\n\nDie Investitionen der vergangenen Jahre haben die notwendigen Produktionskapazitäten für die kommenden Jahre gesichert. Der Fokus der Investitionen lag und liegt daher auf anderen Projektthemen, insbesondere auf der (Weiter-)Entwicklung bestehender und neuer Modelle, der Elektromobilität und der High-Tech-Modernisierung. Diese markieren für die PIERER Mobility Gruppe derzeit und auch in Zukunft die oberste Priorität der Investitionen. Im Einklang mit den strategischen Zielen werden die Ausgaben für Investitionen in Forschung und Entwicklung auf dem bereits hohen Niveau der vergangenen Jahre bleiben.\n\nEine der bedeutendsten Einzelinvestitionen im Geschäftsjahr 2022 war der Weiterbau und die Fertigstellung des neuen Headquarters von KTM North America in Murrieta, Kalifornien. Das Firmengelände wurde auf einer Fläche von ca. 14.000 m² errichtet und umfasst Büro- und Motorsportgebäude sowie Lagerflächen. Am 28. März 2023 fand die Eröffnungsfeier in Murrieta statt. Mit einem Gesamtinvestitionsvolumen von rund 55 Mio. USD stellt dies eine der größten Einzelinvestitionen in der Geschichte der PIERER Mobility Gruppe dar.\n\nWesentliche Investitionsprojekte in 2023 sind wie in den Vorjahren vor allem Entwicklungsprojekte und der Kauf von Werkzeugen und Anlagen.\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **4. VERWEIS AUF DEN NICHTFINANZIELLEN BERICHT**\n\nDie Gesellschaft erstellte für die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe einen konsolidierten nichtfinanziellen Bericht gemäß § 267a UGB für das Geschäftsjahr 2023, welcher Angaben zu Konzepten, nichtfinanziellen Risiken, Due Diligence Prozessen sowie Ergebnissen und Leistungsindikatoren hinsichtlich Umwelt-, Sozial- und Arbeitnehmerbelangen, der Achtung von Menschenrechten, sowie der Bekämpfung von Korruption und Bestechung, enthält. Dieser Bericht wurde vom Aufsichtsrat gemäß § 96 AktG geprüft und ist online verfügbar unter https://www.pierermobility.com/nachhaltigkeit/publikationen.\n\nDer Corporate Governance Bericht ist auf der Webseite der Gesellschaft verfügbar unter https://www.pierermobility.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance.\n\n## **5. FORSCHUNG & ENTWICKLUNG UND NEUE MODELLE**\n\nFür die PIERER Mobility AG als führender Hersteller von Premium Powered-Two-Wheelers (PTW)-Fahrzeugen in Europa ist es erklärtes Ziel, durch kontinuierliches Wachstum die Vorreiterrolle in Bezug auf Technologie, Vertrieb und Image in der Motorradwelt weiter auszubauen. Der Bereich Forschung- und Entwicklung steht daher seit Jahren besonders im Fokus. Als Resultat der verfolgten F&E-Strategie entstehen innovative Produkte, die den hohen Kundenerwartungen hinsichtlich Technologie und Performance gerecht werden. Gleichzeitig ermöglicht dies, nachhaltig neue Märkte zu erschließen.\n\nBesonders hohe Priorität wird dabei der frühzeitigen Erkennung von Trends im Powered Two-Wheeler (PTW)- Segment und der Weiterentwicklung des Produktportfolios in technischer und funktioneller Sicht beigemessen. Gleichzeitig wird hohes Engagement zur Verfolgung, Erkennung und Umsetzung der Kundenanforderungen an die Produkte und Dienstleistungen der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe aufgebracht, um die in der Vergangenheit erarbeitete Vorreiterrolle weiter auszubauen und eine marktnahe Produktentwicklungsstrategie gewährleisten zu können.\n\nDank der global agierenden Forschungs- und Entwicklungsorganisation verfügt die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe über ein Netzwerk an hoch qualifizierten Mitarbeitern etwa im Bereich Konstruktion, Berechnung und Simulation. Dieses Netzwerk wird durch den betriebsinternen Maschinen- und Anlagenpark, der für Produktion, Aufbau und Validierung neu entwickelter Prototypen verantwortlich ist, unterstützt. Diese Kombination ermöglicht es, mit hoher Flexibilität auf sich ändernde Anforderungen und die damit einhergehende Komplexität zu reagieren.\n\nZum Stichtag 31.12.2023 beschäftigte das Unternehmen 1.302 Mitarbeiter (Vorjahr: 976), das entspricht 21,1 % der gesamten Belegschaft. Operativ, ohne Nebeneffekt aus der Aktivierung und Abschreibung von Entwicklungsaufwendungen, wurden 9,2 % des Gesamtumsatzes für den Bereich Forschung und Entwicklung aufgewendet, dies entspricht in absoluten Werten € 244,4 Mio. (Vorjahr: € 213,2 Mio.).\n\nDer Forschungs- und Entwicklungsbereich der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe, gebündelt in der **KTM Forschungsund Entwicklungs GmbH** (KTM F&E GmbH), ist mit dezentralen Standorten in Europa (insbesondere Österreich und Spanien) sowie Amerika global organisiert. Die zentrale Steuerung der Entwicklungsprogramme erfolgt im F&E-Hauptquartier in Mattighofen sowie in Munderfing, wo ein Großteil der Mitarbeiter aus dem Forschungs- und Entwicklungsbereich angesiedelt ist. Das Forschungs- und Entwicklungszentrum am Hauptsitz in Mattighofen ist ein Innovationsstandort mit einer Nutzfläche von über 20.000 m². Hier werden richtungsweisende Produkte für das Powersport-Segment konzipiert, entwickelt und mit modernsten Mitteln erprobt.\n\nDie **KTM Technologies** GmbH mit Sitz in Anif bei Salzburg, ist organisatorisch Teil der KTM F&E GmbH und gilt als Spezialist für die Mobilität der Zukunft, insbesondere in den Bereichen Konzept-, Technologieentwicklung und \n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\nLeichtbau. Erfolgsfaktor ist die anwendungsorientierte Entwicklung neuer Lösungen und Technologien. Sehr hohe Expertise besteht im Bereich der Entwicklung von Fahrzeugkonzepten, unter anderem durch den Einsatz von Multimaterial, Composite und additiven Fertigungstechnologien. Die KTM Technologies GmbH arbeitet als Innovations-Hub eng mit der KTM F&E GmbH und Kunden aus anderen Industriezweigen zusammen. Zum Kreis von Partnern und Kunden gehören etablierte OEMs und Start-Ups aus Branchen wie Automobil und Luftfahrt, Maschinenbau und der Sportartikelindustrie. Durch das branchenübergreifende Leistungsportfolio profitieren sowohl die Unternehmensgruppe als auch Drittkunden von einem breiten Know-how-Spektrum und den Möglichkeiten des Technologietransfers.\n\nMit der Markteinführung der KTM Freeride E im Jahr 2014 gilt die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe als Pionier auf dem Gebiet der Elektromobilität. In den letzten Jahren wurde das Spektrum an elektrifizierten Fahrzeugen verschiedener Leistungskategorien auf alle Konzernmarken ausgedehnt. Die Entwicklung elektrifizierter Motorradmodelle erfolgt zum überwiegenden Teil in dem hauseigenen Kompetenzzentrum in Anif bei Salzburg.\n\nDa elektrifizierte Antriebssysteme zum gegenwärtigen Zeitpunkt aufgrund ihrer geringen Leistungsdichte mit weitreichenden Einschränkungen hinsichtlich der Nutzbarkeit eines Motorrads einhergehen, zählt insbesondere die Reduktion der Abgas- und Lärmemissionen im Bereich des Verbrennungsmotorenportfolios der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe zu den wesentlichen Arbeitspaketen des abgelaufenen Forschungsjahres. Um die oberen Fahrzeugsegmente mit höheren Leistungs- und Reichweitenanforderungen weiterhin dynamisch betreiben zu können, wurde beispielsweise die Untersuchung zukunftsfähiger synthetischer Kraftstoffe, sogenannter E-Fuels, und die Erprobung von Kraftstoffen mit erhöhtem Bioethanol-Anteil intensiv vorangetrieben.\n\nDas Lärmemissionsverhalten von Motorrädern hat sich in den vergangenen Jahren zu einem bedeutenden Akzeptanzkriterium für diese Fahrzeugkategorie entwickelt. Da es für Offroad-Sportmotorräder noch keine einheitlichen Homologationsstandards vorgegeben sind, wurde im Geschäftsjahr 2023 die Erforschung der Geräuschquellen dieser Modelle und davon abgeleiteten Lösungsansätzen zur signifikanten Reduktion von Lärmemissionen fortgesetzt.\n\nHinsichtlich der Abgasemission wurde mit der Entwicklung einer neuen Powerpackgeneration (Leistungsklasse 110-170 kW) für das Modelljahr 2029 gestartet. Projektziel ist es, den CO2-Verbrauch im WMTC-Zyklus im Vergleich zum Vorgängermodell um 20-35 % zu reduzieren. Für den Serieneinsatz der neuen Power-Packs soll eine Top-Down-Strategie erarbeitet werden. Im ersten Schritt ist es geplant, ab dem Jahr 2029 die Premiummodelle mit diesem Antriebsstrang auszustatten. In späteren Modelljahren soll diese Powerpackgeneration auch in weiteren Segmenten zum Einsatz kommen.\n\nDie **KTM F&E GmbH** engagiert sich weiterhin als Gründungsmitglied des Swappable Batteries Motorcycle Consortium (SBMC). Ziel ist es, durch internationale Standardisierung des Batteriesystems die Kundenerwartungen hinsichtlich Reichweite, Ladezeit und Kosten zu erfüllen und so einen wichtigen Beitrag zur weiteren Verbreitung elektrifizierter Mobilitätskonzepte in urbanen Lebensbereichen zu leisten. Während sich die Aktivitäten im Jahr 2022 hauptsächlich auf die Definition einheitlicher technischer Spezifikationen für das Batteriesystem innerhalb der Mitgliederbasis konzentrierten, umfassten die Aktivitäten im Jahr 2023 die Entwicklung von Batterieprototypen durch ausgewählte Lieferanten. Das Hauptziel der ersten Phase des Prototyping ist die Validierung und Verfeinerung der Spezifikationen.\n\nDie Virtualisierung der Produktentwicklung ist ein wichtiger Baustein zur Reduktion von Entwicklungszeiten, kosten und Qualitätsrisiken. Letztlich ist die physische Freiprüfung von Komponenten und Gesamtfahrzeugen auf entsprechenden Prüfständen ein unerlässlicher Baustein in der Erprobung von Neuprodukten. Hierzu wird am Standort Anif eine Prüffläche im Ausmaß von 300 m² betrieben, um entwicklungsbegleitend die Qualitätssicherung der Produkte gewährleisten zu können.\n\nDie 2022 gestartet Initiative zur modularen Elektronikplattform wurde 2023 fortgesetzt und konnte bereits in erste Fahrzeuge wie beispielsweise die 1390 SUPER DUKE R für den Markt eingeführt werden. Ziel dieser modularen Plattform sind standardisierte Schnittstellen, um so einen schnellen Austausch von Komponenten gewährleisten zu können.\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\nKonnektivität-Funktionen, die einen Datenaustausch zwischen Fahrzeug und Zubehör wie etwa Smartphones ermöglichen, wurden in den letzten Jahren intensiv weiterentwickelt und zählen insbesondere im Premiumsegment zu unverzichtbaren Ausstattungsmerkmalen. Neben der Entwicklung von Komfortfunktionen wie Telefonie und Navigation stellen insbesondere die Entwicklung und Erprobung von Kommunikationssystemen zwischen dem Motorrad und anderen Fahrzeugen bzw. zwischen dem Motorrad und (Verkehrs-)Infrastruktur, wie etwa Ampelanlagen, einen zentralen Bestandteil der Aktivitäten des Berichtsjahres dar. Darüber hinaus wurde auch an der Nutzung von (Fahrzeug-)Daten geforscht – vor allem im Kontext der Produktentwicklung. So ist unter anderem mit der Beschaffung, Herstellung und Instandhaltung von physischen Prototypen ein erheblicher Ressourcenaufwand verbunden. Durch Einführung virtueller Entwicklungsmethoden kann der Aufwand für die Erprobung physischer Bauteile und Baugruppen bis hin zum Gesamtfahrzeug erheblich reduziert und gleichzeitig eine Verbesserung des späteren Produktes erzielt werden. Diese virtuellen Ansätze können etwa bei der Digitalisierung in der Leuchtkörperentwicklung angewandt werden.\n\nDer Einsatz hochwertiger Materialien in allen Fahrzeugen, die darin begründete Reduktion des Fahrzeuggewichts und das damit einhergehende Potential zur **Verbrauchs- und Emissionsreduktion** sowie Verbesserung der Fahrbarkeit sind eine weitere Säule der verfolgten Entwicklungsphilosophie. Durch die intensiven Bemühungen der letzten Jahre konnte etwa das Gewicht unserer Offroad-Competition-Modelle mit jeder Generation weiter reduziert werden. Stellvertretend für eine Vielzahl an Forschungs- und Entwicklungsprojekten im Bereich der Material- und Oberflächenentwicklung wurde an der Entwicklung und Erprobung von Rädern und Fahrwerkskomponenten aus Faserverbundwerkstoffen sowie an der Weiterentwicklung des Fertigungsprozesses von Kunststoffteilen mit Designelementen in Hybridbauweise gearbeitet.\n\n#### **MODELLE MOTORRÄDER**\n\nDas Geschäftsjahr 2023 stand ganz im Zeichen einer großen Modelloffensive mit insgesamt 72 neuen und überarbeiteten Modellen der drei Kernmarken KTM, Husqvarna und GASGAS.\n\nNach dem Erfolg im Jahr 2021 kehrte die **KTM 1290 SUPER DUKE RR** im ersten Quartal 2023 als limitiertes Sondermodell zurück. Bereits im Jahr 2022 wurde die Partnerschaft zwischen KTM und BRABUS mit der Präsentation der BRABUS 1300 R besiegelt, um BRABUS den Einstieg in die Welt des Motorradsports zu ermöglichen. Diese Kooperation wurde mit der Einführung der **BRABUS 1300 R Masterpiece Edition** fortgeführt.\n\nDie **KTM-Enduro-Palette** des Modelljahres 2024 ist der Beweis vieler Jahre an der Spitze des Enduro-Motorsports und bildet eine dynamische Kombination aus Rennsportleistung, Ergonomie sowie führender Technologie in der Branche. Die neue Modellgeneration präsentiert sich in einem brandneuen Look und mit einem neuen Rahmenkonzept, überarbeiteten Motoren mit der neuen Drosselklappenkörper Einspritzung bei Zwei-Takt-Motoren und einer neuen Generation WP Fahrwerkselementen ermöglicht es ein besseres Fahrgefühl sowie höheren Komfort für Fahrer jeden Alters und aller Fähigkeitsstufen.\n\nMit der **890 SMT** 2023 feierte KTM die Wiedergeburt einer Ikone. Das Motorrad mit der überarbeiteten LC8c Plattform wurde entwickelt, um in Sachen Leistung, Drehmoment und Gewicht die Spitzenposition im Supermoto-Touring-Segment zu erreichen. Dieses Modell ist zwischen den KTM ADVENTURE- und KTM Street-Produktreihen platziert.\n\nIm zweiten Halbjahr wurde weiters eine neue, Euro5+ konforme Generation der **DUKE-Modellreihe** präsentiert mit neuen **125, 250, 390, 990 und 1390** Modellen. Die neue LC4c Plattform (125 & 390 DUKE) bietet ein segmentführendes Leistungs-/Gewichtsverhältnis und elektronische Assistenzsysteme mit zwei-Kanal ABS sowie schräglagenabhängige Traktionskontrolle. Die neue 990 DUKE basiert auf einer neuen Generation des LC8c Motors mit 123 PS und 103 Nm Drehmoment sowie einer neu entwickelten Elektronikplattform mit modernsten Assistenzsystemen und einem LED Projektor Scheinwerfer mit Daytime Running Light für eine unverkennbare DUKE-Signatur. Auch die neue 1390 SUPER DUKE R basiert auf einem weiterentwickelten LC8 Motor mit neuer Camshift Technologie, welcher eine weitere Leistungssteigerung auf 190 PS & 145 Nm Drehmoment bei gleichbleibendem Fahrzeuggewicht ermöglichte. Darüber hinaus erhielt die **1390 SUPER DUKE R EVO** ein überarbeitetes WP APEX Fahrwerk mit semiaktiver Technologie, welches die elektronische Einstellung des\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\nFahrwerks, eine verbesserte Performance bei gleichbleibend hohem Fahrkomfort und mehr Einstellungsmöglichkeiten ermöglicht.\n\n**Husqvarna Motorcycles** präsentierte im März 2023 die **Norden 901 Expedition**, ein mit zahlreichen Komfortfunktionen ausgestattetes und leistungsstarkes Reisemotorrad, ausgerichtet für den Einsatz sowohl auf der Straße als auch im Gelände. Im letzten Quartal 2023 wurde zudem der Skutta, ein E-Scooter für urbane Ballungsräume, vorgestellt und ist nur der erste Schritt einer großen Husqvarna Modelloffensive im Street Segment für 2024.\n\nIn der Enduro Modellreihe für das Modelljahr 2024 präsentierte Husqvarna Motorcycles neun komplett neugestaltete Maschinen mit neuester Technologie und weiterentwickelter Elektronik, um auch weiterhin im Offroad-Bereich neue Standards zu setzen. Ein vielfältiges Angebot an technischem Zubehör und Bekleidung vervollständigte die Markteinführung der aktuellen Zwei- und Vier-Takt-Modelle. Die neuen **TE 300 Pro & FE 350 Pro Sondermodelle** sind mit zusätzlichem technischem Zubehör für Hard Enduro Competitions spezifiziert und bilden damit die perfekte Basis für wettbewerbsorientierte Kunden.\n\nIm letzten Quartal folgten darüber hinaus eine neue Generation der beliebten **50cc & 65cc Sportminicycles** mit neuem Look, neuen Rahmen und überarbeiteten Motoren für Offroad Wettbewerbe im Jugendbereich.\n\n**GASGAS** präsentierte ebenfalls eine neue Generation der Motocross, Enduro und Cross Country Modellpalette 2024 mit gleich 16 Dirtbikes auf Basis der aktuellen Offroadplattform und ergänzte dies durch innovative und batterieelektrisch betriebene Produkte in Form der **MC-E 1.12, MC-E 1.16 und MC-E 1.20**. Diese, speziell für Kinder ab drei Jahren konzipierten Electric-Balance-Bikes, ermöglichen das spielerische Erlernen im sicheren Umgang mit Zweiradfahrzeugen und sind mit einem Akku-Schnellwechselsystem ausgestattet, um ein beinahe unterbrechungsloses Fahren zu gewährleisten. Die drei neuen Modelle sind auch für die Marken KTM und Husqvarna Motorcycles erhältlich.\n\nDie Serienüberleitung im Bereich **elektrisch angetriebener Motorradmodelle** wird durch die markenübergreifend angebotenen KTM SX-E 2, Husqvarna EE 2- und GASGAS MC-E 2 ModelleKTM SX E3-, HUSQVARNA EE3- und GASGAS MC E-3-Modelle abgerundet.\n\n### **MODELLE FAHRRÄDER**\n\nIn der ersten Jahreshälfte 2023 gab es auch in der Fahrradsparte eine Reihe an neu gestalteten Produkten und eine Vielzahl an technischen Erneuerungen. **Husqvarna E-Bicycles** setzt auf innovative Elektromobilitätslösungen und öffnet sich dadurch vielversprechende neue Märkte weltweit. Das im Jahr 2022 präsentierte Mountain Cross 6 (MC6) dient als Vorlage für zukünftige Produktinnovationen und stärkt die Position von Husqvarna E-Bicycles im **e-MTB-Sektor**. Das neue **Light Cross 6 (LC6)** erweitert die Modellpalette im Offroad-Segment. Spezifische PG&A-Artikel und mehrere neue Produktlinien runden das Urban Range- und Allroad-Modellsegment ab. Im Oktober 2023 wurden die neuen MY24 Husqvarna E-MTBs präsentiert.\n\n**GASGAS E-Bicycles** baut auf dem Erfolg der Marke GASGAS im Motorradsegment auf. Mit den leistungsstarken E-MTBs für Offroad-Strecken konnte die Marke nach einem erfolgreichen Geschäftsjahr 2022 ihre Reichweite auch im ersten Quartal 2023 weltweit ausbauen. Die Erfahrungen aus dem Offroad-Motorsport sowie das Wissen über Technologien und Materialien werden bei der Entwicklung neuer elektrifizierter New Mobility Produkte eine noch größere Rolle spielen. Der neue GASGAS **ECC Race-Prototyp** wurde auf dem Sea Otter Festival in Monterey, Kalifornien gezeigt. Ein E-Mountainbike, das weitere neue Spezifikationen und Komponenten verbirgt.\n\nIm Juni 2023 stellte PIERER New Mobility auf der EUROBIKE in Frankfurt weitere neue Modelle sowie Produktentwicklungen im Bereich Fahrrad und New Mobility aus. Neben einem neuen Modell der **Grand City-Reihe** für die Stadt- und Allroad-Mobilität von Husqvarna E-Bicycles enthüllte GASGAS Bicycles den **MOTO Urban Cruiser**, einen in Supermoto-Ästhetik designten Beach-Cruiser.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **6. CHANCEN- UND RISIKOBERICHT**\n\nDie Geschäftstätigkeit der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe ist von laufenden Veränderungen geprägt. Die Nutzung der sich durch diese Veränderungen ergebenden Chancen ist der wesentliche Grundstein des Erfolges der PIERER Mobility- Gruppe. Zur Sicherung des zukünftigen unternehmerischen Erfolgs und Nutzung der sich ergebenden Chancen muss die Gruppe bewusst Risiken eingehen.\n\nDas Management von Chancen und Risiken ist die Basis, um auf Änderungen politischer, wirtschaftlicher, technischer oder rechtlicher Rahmenbedingungen adäquat zu reagieren. Sofern es wahrscheinlich ist, dass die identifizierten Chancen beziehungsweise Risiken eintreten, sind sie bereits in den Aussagen im Konzernanhang und -lagebericht verarbeitet. Die nachfolgenden Ausführungen beinhalten mögliche künftige Entwicklungen oder Ereignisse, die zu einer für die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe positiven (Chancen) beziehungsweise negativen (Risiken) Abweichung von der Unternehmensprognose führen können.\n\nIm Rahmen des Risikomanagements werden alle Einzel- und kumulierten Risiken, die den Erfolg des Unternehmens gefährden könnten, überwacht und gesteuert. Bestandsgefährdende Risiken werden grundsätzlich vermieden. Der Risikokonsolidierungskreis entspricht dem Konsolidierungskreis des Konzernabschlusses der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe.\n\n## **RISIKOMANAGEMENTSYSTEM**\n\nDer Hauptzweck des Risikomanagements der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe besteht in der Sicherung und Stärkung des Unternehmens durch eine richtige und transparente Einschätzung der finanziellen, operativen und strategischen Risiken. Der Vorstand übernimmt dabei gemeinsam mit dem Management der wesentlichen Konzerngesellschaften, insbesondere der KTM AG, umfangreiche Steuerungs- und Controlling-Aufgaben im Rahmen eines internen, alle wesentlichen Standorte umfassenden, integrierten Kontrollsystems. Das rechtzeitige Erkennen, Evaluieren und Reagieren auf strategische und operative Risiken ist ein wesentlicher Bestandteil der Führungstätigkeit dieser Einheiten und leistet einen wesentlichen Wertbeitrag für das Unternehmen. Grundlagen dafür sind ein einheitliches und konzernweites, regelmäßiges Berichtswesen und eine laufende Überwachung der operativen und strategischen Pläne.\n\nDie PIERER Mobility-Gruppe verfügt über ein mehrstufiges Risikomanagementsystem, bei dem die konzernweiten Risiken nach Fachbereichen bzw., geografischen Bereichen erhoben werden. Die operative Verantwortung und die Bewertung der konzernweiten Risiken erfolgt durch das Risikomanagement der KTM AG und dem lokalen Management und wird direkt an den Vorstand berichtet und von diesem sowie vom Konzernvorstand überwacht.\n\nEine präventive Analyse von potenziellen Ereignissen ist ebenso Ziel des Risikomanagements. Zusätzlich ist es auch Aufgabe des Risikomanagements, Risiken aktiv zu steuern und entsprechende Maßnahmen mit den betroffenen Unternehmensbereichen zu definieren und evaluieren.\n\n### **RISIKOMANAGEMENTSTRATEGIE**\n\nDie PIERER Mobility-Gruppe orientiert sich im Rahmen Ihrer Risikomanagementstrategie am COSO® Framework. Demgemäß hat der Konzern folgende Kernbereiche der Risikomanagementstrategie definiert:\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/151/Figure/1 description: The image shows a diagram of a risk management process. The diagram is divided into four sections, each representing a stage in the process. The first section is titled \"Risiko Identifikation\" and includes the following bullet points: \"Strukturierte Erfassung von Chancen und Einzelrisiken in den Bereichen\", \"Durchführung von Risikoworkshops\", and \"Identifikation erfolgt u. a. durch den Standard-Risikokatalog\". The second section is titled \"Risiko Bewertung\" and includes the following bullet points: \"Failure Mode und Effekt Analyse\" and \"Schadensausmaß und Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeit\". The third section is titled \"Risiko Steuerung\" and includes the following bullet points: \"Steuerung der Gesamtrisikoposition durch Beeinflussung von Chancen und Einzelrisiken\" and \"Kontrolle der Wirksamkeit von Maßnahmen\". The fourth section is titled \"Berichtswesen + Überwachung\" and includes the following bullet points: \"Kontinuierliche Überwachung\", \"Erfassung, Auswertung, Weiterleitung von Informationen\", and \"Berichterstattung\".\n\nDas auf Ebene der KTM AG eingerichtete Risikomanagement führt regelmäßig Risikoanalysen durch. Es werden nur Risiken abweichend von der Konzern-Bilanz und der Konzern-GuV dargestellt.\n\n### **ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT PROZESS**\n\nDas Enterprise Risikomanagement der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe umfasst einen kontinuierlichen Prozess, welcher die Identifikation und Bewertung, Analyse und Reporting, Maßnahmendefinition sowie -nachverfolgung der gruppenweiten sowohl operativen als auch strategischen Risiken und Chancen sicherstellt. Dieser bildet die Basis für ein einheitliches und konzernweites Berichtswesen und stellt eine laufende Überwachung der operativen und strategischen Risiken sicher.\n\nDie Unternehmensgruppe verfügt über einen mehrstufigen Risikomanagementprozess, bei dem die konzernweiten Risiken nach Bereichen erhoben werden. Die Sicherstellung der Durchführung und der Aktualität der Informationen obliegt der Risikomanagement-Abteilung. Die Informationen über die Risikolage werden durch die Risk Owner der Fachbereiche zur Verfügung gestellt. Die Risikomanagement-Abteilung berichtet direkt an den Vorstand der KTM AG, diesem sowie dem Konzernvorstand wird zur Überwachung ein regelmäßiger Report über die Gesamtrisikolage zur Verfügung gestellt.\n\nKlimabezogene Risiken und Chancen werden in den folgenden Prozessschritten gleichermaßen betrachtet und berücksichtigt:\n\n### **Identifikation & Bewertung**\n\nDie Identifikation der Risiken und Chancen findet im Zuge der Risiko Assessments, gesteuert auf Ebene der KTM AG, statt. In diesen werden klimabezogene Risiken und Chancen gleichermaßen wie auch finanzielle, operative oder strategische Risiken mit den betroffenen Risk Ownern der Fachbereiche diskutiert und identifiziert.\n\nZiel der Risikobewertung ist die kontinuierliche, qualitative und quantitative Bewertung aller identifizierten Chancen und Risiken zur Priorisierung von Risikosteuerungsmaßnahmen. Die Chancen- und Risikobewertung bei der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe soll folgenden Anforderungen entsprechen:\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Objektivität: Die Bewertung soll nach möglichst objektiven Maßstäben erfolgen.\n- Vergleichbarkeit: Damit die Chancen und Risiken miteinander verglichen werden können, erfolgt eine quantitative Bewertung anhand einheitlich definierter Werte (sofern sinnvoll und möglich)\n\nGrundsätzlich erfolgt die Bewertung der Risiken und Chancen hinsichtlich Eintrittswahrscheinlichkeit und Schadensausmaß, für die Vermögens-, Finanz- und Ertragslage des Konzerns, in einem szenariobasierten Ansatz bestehend aus Best Case (BC), Realistic Case (RC) und Worst Case (WC). Die Quantifizierung kann dabei auf (a) tatsächlich in der Vergangenheit eingetretenen Risiken, (b) Benchmark-Werten aus der Branche oder (c) Expertenschätzungen basieren. Die Wahl der jeweiligen Verteilung ist abhängig von der Art des Risikos, in den meisten Fällen entspricht diese aber einer Pert-Verteilung. Neben der quantitativen Bewertung der Risiken und Chancen kann gemäß Methodik zusätzlich auch eine qualitative Bewertung stattfinden, welche gerade im Bereich klima- und umweltbezogener Risiken und Chancen nützlich ist.\n\n### **RISIKOBEWERTUNG**\n\n### **Analyse & Reporting**\n\nNach strukturierter Konsolidierung des Gesamt-Risiko-Inventars erfolgt eine Monte Carlo Simulation, daraus ergibt sich die Gesamtrisikolage sowie die benötigten Kennzahlen. Darüber hinaus werden die größten Risiken und Chancen der Gruppe identifiziert und vervollständigen das Lagebild. Darin sind selbstverständlich auch die wesentlichen klimabezogenen Risiken und Chancen enthalten.\n\n#### **Maßnahmendefinition & -nachverfolgung**\n\n Hauptziel der Risikomitigation ist die aktive, kontinuierliche und kontrollierte Beeinflussung der Risiken und Chancen unter Berücksichtigung der Unternehmensstrategie und der Wirtschaftlichkeit, um den Gesamtrisikoumfang des Unternehmens bewusst zu lenken, und somit langfristig eine Steigerung des Unternehmenswertes zu erreichen. Risiken werden durch entsprechende Maßnahmen minimiert, vermieden oder auch in bestimmten Fällen bewusst eingegangen, die Strategie wird vom jeweiligen Risk Owner festgelegt und evaluiert. Dabei wird die Risikomanagement- Abteilung regelmäßig über den Status der Maßnahmen informiert. In Zusammenarbeit mit der ESG-Abteilung erfolgt die Maßnahmen- sowie Zieldefinition der klimabezogenen Risiken und Chancen.\n\n### **Ad-hoc Berichterstattung**\n\nBei Ad-hoc Änderungen der Risikolage ist die Risikomanagement- Abteilung unverzüglich von den Risk Ownern der Fachabteilungen zu unterrichten und informiert zu halten.\n\nDarauf aufbauend wird die Risiko- und Chancenmanagement Strategie erarbeitet.\n\n#### **Risikoüberwachung /-kontrolle**\n\nKernpunkt des operativen Risikomanagements ist die Identifizierung, Evaluierung und Beherrschung von wesentlichen Risiken aus dem operativen Geschäft. Dieser Prozess wird insbesondere von den oberen und mittleren Managementebenen der KTM AG durchgeführt und vom Vorstand der PIERER Mobility AG überwacht.\n\n## **CHANCEN- UND RISIKOBERICHT**\n\nDie folgende Übersicht dient dem Gesamtüberblick über die wesentlichen identifizierten Risiken und Chancen und zeigt damit deren Bedeutung für die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe auf sowie die zugehörigen Maßnahmenpakete. Gesamthaft hat die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe weder zum Bilanzstichtag noch zum Zeitpunkt der Aufstellung des Abschlusses bestandsgefährdende Risiken identifiziert.\n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Risiken/ Chancen                              | Beschreibung

**7. ANGABEN GEMÄß § 243A (ABS 1) UGB**\n\n- 1. Das Grundkapital beträgt EUR 33.796.535. Es ist zerlegt in 33.796.535 Stück auf Inhaber lautende, Stückaktien mit Stimmrecht, wobei jede Stammaktie am Grundkapital in gleichem Umfang beteiligt ist. Die Aktien gewähren die gewöhnlichen nach dem österreichischen Aktiengesetz den Aktionären zustehenden Rechte. Dazu zählt das Recht auf die Auszahlung der in der Hauptversammlung beschlossenen Dividende sowie das Recht auf Ausübung des Stimmrechtes in der Hauptversammlung. Sämtliche Aktien der PIERER Mobility AG sind seit dem 14. November 2016 an der SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX) im International Reporting Standard hauptkotiert (ISIN AT0000KTMI02). Seit dem 1. März 2022 sind die Aktien der PIERER Mobility AG zusätzlich an der Wiener Börse (Amtlicher Handel) gelistet. Im Geschäftsjahr 2023 kam es zu keiner Änderung im Grundkapital der Gesellschaft. Ebenso wenig wurden eigene Aktien erworben oder veräußert, weshalb die Gesellschaft zum Stichtag 31. Dezember 2023 keine eigenen Aktien hielt.\n- 2. Zwischen der Pierer Konzerngesellschaft mbH, der Pierer Industrie AG und der Pierer Bajaj AG einerseits (die \"Pierer- Gruppe\") und der Bajaj Auto Ltd. und Bajaj Auto International Holdings B.V. andererseits (die \"Bajaj-Gruppe\") besteht seit 29. September 2021 ein Syndikatsvertrag (der \"Syndikatsvertrag 2021\"), der die Rechte und Pflichten der beiden Unternehmensgruppen in Bezug auf die Beteiligung der Pierer Industrie AG und der Bajaj Auto International Holdings B.V. an der Pierer Bajaj AG als Mehrheitsaktionärin der PIERER Mobility AG regelt. Der Syndikatsvertrag 2021 sieht vor, dass die Geschäftsordnung für den Vorstand und den Aufsichtsrat der Pierer Bajaj AG im Falle einer Übertragung des Eigentums von Aktien der PIERER Mobility AG der Zustimmung der von Bajaj nominierten Aufsichtsratsmitglieder der Pierer Bajaj AG bedarf. Die Pierer Bajaj AG, die wirtschaftlich Herrn DI Stefan Pierer zuzurechnen ist, unterliegt angesichts des Syndikatsvertrags auf der Ebene der Pierer Bajaj AG somit Veräußerungsbeschränkungen. Dem Vorstand sind keine weiteren Beschränkungen bekannt, die Stimmrechte oder die Übertragung von Aktien betreffen.\n- 3. Nach Kenntnis der Gesellschaft bestand per 31. Dezember 2023 folgende direkte oder indirekte Beteiligung am Kapital der PIERER Mobility AG, die zumindest 10 von Hundert betragen:\n\t- Pierer Bajaj AG: 74,18 % (direkte Beteiligung);\n\t- Pierer Konzerngesellschaft mbH (direkte und indirekte Beteiligung): 0,09 % (direkte Beteiligung) und 74,18 % (indirekte Beteiligung).\n- 4. Es gibt keine Aktien mit besonderen Kontrollrechten.\n\n- 5. Es bestehen derzeit keine Mitarbeiterbeteiligungsmodelle.\n- 6. Es bestehen keine über das Gesetz hinausgehenden Bestimmungen hinsichtlich der Ernennung und Abberufung der Mitglieder des Vorstandes und des Aufsichtsrates und über die Änderung der Satzung.\n- 7. Möglichkeiten, Aktien auszugeben oder zurückzukaufen:\n\n Berücksichtigt werden nur Möglichkeiten Aktien auszugeben oder zurückzukaufen, die zum Stichtag 31. Dezember 2023 noch aufrecht waren:\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\n Aufgrund der von der Hauptversammlung vom 29. April 2022 erteilten Ermächtigung und gleichzeitig beschlossenen Satzungsänderung enthält die Satzung der Gesellschaft als § 5 \"Genehmigtes Kapital\" folgende Bestimmung:\n\n- a) Der Vorstand ist gemäß § 169 AktG ermächtigt, bis 29.04.2027 mit Zustimmung des Aufsichtsrates das Grundkapital der Gesellschaft von EUR 33.796.535,00, allenfalls in mehreren Tranchen, gegen Barund/oder Sacheinlagen um bis zu EUR 16.898.267,00 durch Ausgabe von bis zu 16.898.267 Stück auf Inhaber lautende nennbetragslose Stückaktien auf bis zu EUR 50.694.802,00 zu erhöhen und den Ausgabebetrag sowie die Ausgabebedingungen und die weiteren Einzelheiten der Durchführung der Kapitalerhöhung im Einvernehmen mit dem Aufsichtsrat festzusetzen sowie allenfalls die neuen Aktien im Wege des mittelbaren Bezugsrechts gemäß § 153 Abs 6 AktG den Aktionären zum Bezug anzubieten.\n- b) Der Vorstand wird ermächtigt, mit Zustimmung des Aufsichtsrates das Bezugsrecht der Aktionäre ganz oder teilweise auszuschließen,\n\t- (i) wenn die Kapitalerhöhung gegen Bareinlagen erfolgt und in Summe der rechnerisch auf die gegen Bareinlagen unter Ausschluss des Bezugsrechts ausgegebenen Aktien entfallende Anteil am Grundkapital der Gesellschaft die Grenze von 10 % des Grundkapitals der Gesellschaft zum Zeitpunkt der Einräumung nicht übersteigt,\n\t- (ii) wenn die Kapitalerhöhung gegen Sacheinlagen erfolgt,\n\t- (iii) zur Bedienung einer Mehrzuteilungsoption (Greenshoe), und / oder\n\t- (iv) für den Ausgleich von Spitzenbeträgen.\n- c) Der Aufsichtsrat ist ermächtigt, Änderungen der Satzung, die sich durch die Ausgabe von Aktien aus dem genehmigten Kapital ergeben, zu beschließen.\n\nAufgrund des von der Hauptversammlung vom 21. April 2023 geschaffenen bedingten Kapitals und der dazu beschlossenen Satzungsänderung enthält die Satzung der Gesellschaft als § 5a \"Bedingtes Kapital\" folgende Bestimmung:\n\nDas Grundkapital der Gesellschaft wird gemäß § 159 Abs 2 Z 1 AktG um bis zu EUR 4.375.000.000,00 durch Ausgabe von bis zu 4.375.000 auf Inhaber lautende Stammaktien ohne Nennwert (Stückaktien) zur Ausgabe an Gläubiger von Finanzinstrumenten gemäß § 174 AktG im Sinne des Hauptversammlungsbeschlusses vom 21.04.2023, die unter Ausnutzung der in dieser Hauptversammlung eingeräumten Ermächtigung von der Gesellschaft ausgegeben werden, erhöht. Die Kapitalerhöhung darf nur soweit durchgeführt werden, als die Gläubiger der Finanzinstrumente von ihrem Umtausch und/ oder Bezugsrecht auf Aktien der Gesellschaft Gebrauch machen. Der Ausgabebetrag und das Umtauschverhältnis sind nach Maßgabe anerkannter finanzmathematischer Methoden sowie des Aktienkurses in einem anerkannten Preisfindungs- verfahren zu ermitteln. Die neu ausgegebenen Aktien der bedingten Kapitalerhöhung sind im gleichen Maße wie die bereits bestehenden Aktien der Gesellschaft dividendenberechtigt. Der Vorstand ist ermächtigt mit Zustimmung des Aufsichtsrates die weiteren Einzelheiten der Durchführung der bedingten Kapitalerhöhung festzusetzen. Der Aufsichtsrat ist ermächtigt, Änderungen der Satzung, die sich durch die Ausgabe von Aktien aus dem bedingten Kapital ergeben, zu beschließen.\n\nDie bedingte Kapitalerhöhung dient der Bedienung einer eventuell begebenen Wandelschuldverschreibung und darf ausdrücklich nur so weit durchgeführt werden, als Gläubiger von Wandelschuldverschreibungen von ihrem Umtausch- und /oder Bezugsrecht auf Aktien der Gesellschaft Gebrauch machen.\n\nDiese bedingte Kapitalerhöhung dient zur Ausgabe von neuen Aktien an Gläubiger von Finanzinstrumenten gemäß § 174 AktG, die unter Ausnutzung der in der Hauptversammlung vom 21. April 2023 eingeräumten Ermächtigung von der Gesellschaft ausgegeben werden. Diese von der Hauptversammlung vom 21. April 2023 eingeräumte Ermächtigung Finanzinstrumente gemäß § 174 AktG auszugeben, wurde bisher nicht ausgenutzt.\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\nVon Hauptversammlung vom 21. April 2023 wurden im Hinblick auf den Erwerb und die Veräußerung eigener Aktien zudem folgende Beschlüsse gefasst:\n\n- d) Der Vorstand ist gemäß § 65 Abs 1 Z 8 AktG für die Dauer von 30 Monaten ab dem Datum der Beschlussfassung ermächtigt, eigene Aktien der Gesellschaft sowohl über die Börse als auch außerbörslich auch unter Ausschluss des quotenmäßigen Andienungsrechtes der Aktionäre zu erwerben und, ohne dass die Hauptversammlung vorher nochmals befasst werden muss, gegebenenfalls diese Aktien mit Zustimmung des Aufsichtsrates einzuziehen. Der Handel mit eigenen Aktien ist als Zweck des Erwerbs ausgeschlossen. Der Anteil der zu erwerbenden Aktien darf 10% des Grundkapitals nicht übersteigen. Der Gegenwert pro zu erwerbender Stückaktie darf jeweils den durchschnittlichen ungewichteten Börseschlusskurs an der SIX Swiss Exchange der vergangenen 10 Handelstage um nicht mehr als 20% unterschreiten oder übersteigen. Die Ermächtigung kann ganz oder teilweise oder auch in mehreren Teilbeträgen und in Verfolgung eines oder mehrerer Zwecke durch die Gesellschaft, mit ihr verbundenen Unternehmen oder für deren Rechnung durch Dritte ausgeübt werden. Der Aufsichtsrat ist ermächtigt, Änderungen der Satzung, die sich durch die Einziehung von Aktien ergeben, zu beschließen.\n- e) Der Vorstand ist für die Dauer von fünf Jahren ab dem Datum der Beschlussfassung ermächtigt, mit Zustimmung des Aufsichtsrates eigene Aktien auch auf andere Art als über die Börse oder durch ein öffentliches Angebot zu jedem gesetzlich zulässigen Zweck zu veräußern oder zu verwenden und hierbei auch das quotenmäßige Kaufrecht der Aktionäre auszuschließen (Ausschluss des Bezugsrechtes) und die Veräußerungsbedingungen festzusetzen. Die Ermächtigung kann ganz oder teilweise oder auch in mehreren Teilbeträgen und in Verfolgung eines oder mehrerer Zwecke ausgeübt werden.\n- 8. Vereinbarungen der Gesellschaft, die bei einem Kontrollwechsel infolge eines Übernahmeangebotes wirksam werden, sich ändern oder enden sowie deren Wirkungen werden seitens der Gesellschaft nicht bekannt gegeben, da dies der Gesellschaft erheblich schaden würde.\n- 9. Es existieren keine Entschädigungsvereinbarungen zwischen der Gesellschaft und ihren Vorstands- und Aufsichtsratsmitgliedern oder Arbeitnehmern für den Fall eines öffentlichen Übernahmeangebotes.\n\n## **8. WESENTLICHE MERKMALE DES INTERNEN KONTROLLSYSTEMS § 243A (ABS2) UGB**\n\nDas interne Kontrollsystem der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe hat die Aufgabe, die Ordnungsmäßigkeit und Zuverlässigkeit der Finanzberichterstattung, die Einhaltung der für das Unternehmen maßgeblichen gesetzlichen und unternehmensinternen Vorschriften sowie die Wirksamkeit und Wirtschaftlichkeit der betrieblichen Tätigkeit einschließlich des Schutzes des Vermögens vor Verlusten durch Schäden und Malversationen sicherzustellen. In der Gestaltung der Elemente des internen Kontrollsystems wurden international anerkannte Rahmenwerke für Interne Kontrollsysteme (z.B. COSO-Framework) berücksichtigt. Das System umfasst:\n\n- x Konzernweite Vorgaben für die Rechnungslegung\n- x Funktionstrennung als organisatorische Maßnahme\n- x Systemgestützte und prozessabhängige Kontrollen\n- x Prozessunabhängige Kontrollen\n- x Management von Risiken der Bilanzerstellung\n\nDie PIERER Mobility-Gruppe setzt auf eine kontinuierliche Weiterentwicklung und Verbesserung des internen Kontrollsystems. Dazu erfolgt regelmäßig eine Überwachung seiner Funktionsfähigkeit durch Prozess- und Datenanalysen sowie unabhängige, externe Prüfungstätigkeiten. Im Folgenden werden die wesentlichen Merkmale des internen Kontrollsystems im Hinblick auf den Rechnungslegungsprozess dargestellt.\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **KONTROLLUMFELD**\n\nDie Organisationsstruktur der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe bildet die Basis für das Kontrollumfeld und das interne Kontrollsystem im Unternehmen. Im Bereich der Aufbauorganisation im (Konzern-)Rechnungswesen bestehen eindeutige Kompetenz- und Verantwortungsbereiche auf den unterschiedlichen Führungs- und Hierarchieebenen des Konzerns. Dies betrifft einerseits die Konzernzentrale in Wels sowie die österreichischen und alle internationalen Tochtergesellschaften. Die Bereiche Treasury und Business Process Finance sind in den operativen Bereichen der Gruppe angesiedelt, wobei auch hier die Aufgaben und Verantwortungen klar aufgeteilt sind.\n\nDer starken internationalen Ausrichtung der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe und der damit zusammenhängenden dezentralen Gesellschafts- und Standortstrukturen wird durch die Zentralisierung von wesentlichen Unternehmensfunktionen im Bereich der Finanzberichterstattung in den österreichischen Standorten (insbesondere in Mattighofen) Rechnung getragen. Die Wahrnehmung und Steuerung der nationalen Geschäftstätigkeiten obliegt dem jeweiligen lokalen Management und wird vom Vorstand der KTM AG sowie vom Konzernvorstand überwacht.\n\nIn der Ablauforganisation setzt die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe auf ein ausgeprägtes und umfangreiches Regelwerk an Bilanzierungs-, Bewertungs- und Kontierungsvorgaben. Dies stellt eine angemessene Basis für ein starkes Kontrollumfeld und Kontrollsystem dar. Neue Bilanzierungsstandards werden hinsichtlich ihrer Auswirkung auf die Rechnungslegung der PIERER Mobility-Gruppe beurteilt. Die Vorgaben an die Rechnungslegung und die Rechnungslegungsprozesse werden laufend überprüft und mindestens jährlich, bei Bedarf häufiger angepasst. Die Überwachung der Einhaltung der rechnungslegungsbezogenen Regelungen und Kontrollen liegt in der Verantwortung des jeweils zuständigen Managements.\n\n#### **RISIKOBEURTEILUNG**\n\nRisiken in Bezug auf den Rechnungslegungsprozess werden durch das Management erhoben und überwacht sowie im Risikomanagementprozess berücksichtigt. Der Fokus wird dabei auf jene Risiken gelegt, die als wesentlich zu betrachten sind.\n\nDie wesentlichen Risiken im Bereich der Rechnungslegung umfassen die nicht vollständige Erfassung von bilanzierungsrelevanten Sachverhalten, Fehler in der Belegerfassung sowie fehlerhafte Berechnungen. Komplexe Bilanzierungsgrundsätze könnten zu einem erhöhten Fehlerrisiko, unrichtigen Ausweis sowie verspätete Bilanzerstellung führen. Zudem besteht das Risiko eines Datenzugriffes von unberechtigten Personen bzw. Datenmanipulation, Ausfall von IT-Systemen und Datenverlust.\n\nFür die Erstellung des Abschlusses müssen regelmäßig Schätzungen vorgenommen werden, bei denen das immanente Risiko besteht, dass die zukünftige Entwicklung von diesen Schätzungen abweicht. Dies trifft insbesondere auf die folgenden Sachverhalte/Posten des Konzernabschlusses zu: Sozialkapital, Ausgang von Rechtsstreitigkeiten, Werthaltigkeit von Forderungen, Beteiligungen und Vorräten. Teilweise werden externe Experten zugezogen bzw. wird auf öffentlich zugängliche Quellen abgestellt, um das Risiko einer Fehleinschätzung zu minimieren.\n\n#### **KONTROLLMAßNAHMEN**\n\nDie PIERER Mobility-Gruppe hat ihre Kontrollen direkt in die (Konzern-)Rechnungslegungsprozesse integriert. Wesentliches Element ist dabei, neben prozessunabhängigen externen Kontrollmechanismen, das Prinzip der Funktionstrennung. Zur Gewährleistung einer vollständigen, zeitgerechten und richtigen Bilanzerstellung wurden in allen am Buchungsprozess beteiligten Bereichen Qualitätssicherungs- und Kontrollmaßnahmen implementiert. Sämtliche Kontrollmaßnahmen werden im laufenden Geschäftsprozess angewandt, um sicherzustellen, dass potenzielle Fehler in der Finanzberichterstattung vorgebeugt bzw. diese entdeckt und korrigiert werden. Des Weiteren führt die Anwendung von unternehmensinternen Richtlinien zu einer einheitlichen Behandlung der Geschäftsfälle sowie zu einer einheitlichen Bilanzierung und Berichterstattung.\n\nIn den wichtigen IT-Systemen mit Rechnungslegungsrelevanz sind Kontrollen integriert, die unter anderem die falsche Erfassung von Geschäftsvorfällen verhindern, die vollständige Erfassung von Geschäftsvorfällen \n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\nbeziehungsweise Bewertung der Geschäftsvorfälle entsprechend den Rechnungslegungsvorschriften sicherstellen oder die Überprüfung der Konsolidierung unterstützen sollen. Im Hinblick auf die steigenden Anforderungen an IT-Systeme in der Rechnungslegung sowie den ständig steigenden technischen Möglichkeiten führt die PIERER Mobility Gruppe regelmäßig IT-gestützte Analysen der Wirksamkeit der gesetzten Maßnahmen durch, um etwaige aufgetretene Kontrollschwächen zu erkennen und anschließend zu beseitigen.\n\nKontrollmaßnahmen in Bezug auf die IT-Sicherheit stellen einen Eckpfeiler des internen Kontrollsystems dar. So wird die Trennung von sensiblen Tätigkeiten durch eine restriktive Vergabe von IT-Berechtigungen unterstützt. Durch die eingesetzte ERP Software finden automatisierte Prüfungen statt, wie z.B. die automatisierten Kontrollen bei Rechnungsfreigabe und Rechnungsprüfung.\n\n#### **KOMMUNIKATION UND ÜBERWACHUNG**\n\nDie Verantwortung für die Wirksamkeit des internen Kontrollsystems im (Konzern-)Rechnungslegungsprozess ist klar geregelt und liegt bei den verantwortlichen Führungskräften und Prozessverantwortlichen. In die Beurteilung der Wirksamkeit fließen neben den Ergebnissen aus der unternehmensinternen Einschätzung auch jene von externen Prüfungen, z. B. im Rahmen der Jahresabschlussprüfung oder von externen IT-Security Audits, sowie des Aufsichtsrats und des Prüfungsausschusses ein. Schwächen im Kontrollsystem werden unter Berücksichtigung ihrer möglichen Auswirkung auf die Rechnungslegungsprozesse behoben.\n\nNeben den gesetzlich vorgeschriebenen Abschlüssen, welche den Führungsebenen zur Verfügung gestellt werden, wurde im Konzern auch ein umfangreiches Internes Berichtswesen implementiert, das je nach Berichtsempfänger in unterschiedlichen Aggregationstiefen erstellt und verteilt wird.\n\nWeitere zentrale Instrumente der Risikoüberwachung und -kontrolle sind die unternehmensweiten Richtlinien über den Umgang mit wesentlichen Risiken, der Planungs- und der Controlling-Prozesse, sowie die laufende Berichterstattung. Die Richtlinien umfassen die Festsetzung und Kontrolle von Limits und Handlungsabläufen zur Begrenzung finanzieller Risiken sowie die strikte Vorgabe des Vier-Augen-Prinzips bei Rechnungs- und Zahlungsfreigaben.\n\nDarüber hinaus basiert das interne Kontrollsystem auf genauen Informationen über die Prozesse für die Rechnungslegung und Finanzberichtserstattung und schließt auch deren vorgelagerte Unternehmensprozesse, z. B. Bestellanforderungen oder Logistikprozesse, mit ein. Die Wirksamkeit des internen Kontrollsystems wird vom Management dahingehend überprüft, dass die Ergebnisse, die in komprimierter Berichtsform an das Management übermittelt werden von ihm analysiert, bewertet und kommentiert werden.\n\nVorstand und Prüfungsausschuss werden jährlich über die Einschätzung zur Wirksamkeit des internen Kontrollsystems in der Rechnungslegung unterrichtet. Bei wesentlichen Veränderungen der Wirksamkeit des internen Kontrollsystems erfolgt eine unverzügliche Berichterstattung an den Vorstand und gegebenenfalls an den Aufsichtsrat sowie eine Ergreifung adäquater Maßnahmen zur Erhöhung der Wirksamkeit.\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **9. AUSBLICK**\n\n### **Geschäftsentwicklung**\n\nAnknüpfend an den Trend aus dem Jahr 2022 konnten die Marken KTM, Husqvarna Motorcycles und GASGAS im Jahr 2023 ihre Marktanteile in den relevanten Absatzmärkten weitgehend ausbauen. Darüber hinaus erwartet die Gruppe mittel- bis langfristig ein weiteres Wachstum des Motorradmarktes und eine insgesamt positive Entwicklung des Motorradmarktes für die von ihr vertriebenen hochwertigen Premiumprodukte.\n\nDie noch im Geschäftsjahr 2022 aufgetretenen Herausforderungen in den internationalen Lieferketten der Unternehmensgruppe haben sich in 2023 deutlich entspannt und werden voraussichtlich auch im Geschäftsjahr 2024 keine größeren Störungen verursachen. Die in der KTM AG Gruppe etablierten Maßnahmen zeigen somit Wirkung, da die Folgen aus der letztjährigen Situation durch die Lieferantenrisikobewertung weitgehend abgemildert wurden. Neben anderen Maßnahmen und den identifizierten Gründen für Lieferkettenprobleme in der Vergangenheit wurde die Beschaffungsstrategie angepasst und das Beschaffungsrisiko insbesondere durch den direkten Zugang zum asiatischen und den weiteren Fokus auf den europäischen Markt reduziert.\n\nFür das Geschäftsjahr 2024 rechnet die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe weiterhin mit einem global schwierigen wirtschaftlichen Umfeld, nicht zuletzt getrieben von den unverändert signifikant hohen Inflationsraten und Lohnund Gehaltsentwicklungen mit weitreichenden Einflüssen auf die Preisentwicklung weltweit. Für die Gruppe wird das Jahr 2024 ein Konsolidierungsjahr, welches zur Stärkung des Kerngeschäfts genutzt wird. Im Zuge dessen erwartet die PIERER Mobility Gruppe für das Geschäftsjahr 2024 einen Umsatz auf ähnlichem Niveau wie im Vorjahr und eine EBIT-Marge von 5-7 %.\n\nUm die Rentabilität der Gruppe zu sichern, wird das Management Kostenreduktionsmaßnahmen im Geschäftsjahr 2024 im zweistelligen Millionenbereich durchführen. Diese Maßnahmen umfassen insbesondere die **stärkere Fokussierung auf das Kerngeschäft Powered-Two-Wheelers** (Motorräder und elektrifizierte Mobility-Produkte) mit den Premiummarken KTM, GASGAS und Husqvarna sowie MV Agusta.\n\nAls weitere wesentliche Maßnahme zur Kostenreduktion werden Teile der Produktion für einzelne Modelle der Mittelklasse und bestimmte Forschungs- und Entwicklungsaktivitäten zum strategischen Partner Bajaj Auto, Indien, sowie zu CFMOTO, China, verlagert. Das betrifft Produkte (Straßenmotorräder) in sehr preis- und wettbewerbsintensiven Märkten. Die bisher bei Bajaj produzierte Modellpalette (zwischen 125 und 390 Kubikzentimeter) wird erweitert. Beim chinesischen Partner CFMOTO werden Straßenmotorräder zwischen 790 und 950 Kubikzentimeter assembliert. Die Unternehmensgruppe erwartet sich daraus nicht nur Kostenvorteile, sondern auch eine Beschleunigung von Entwicklungs- und Industrialisierungsprozessen.\n\nBegleitet werden diese Maßnahmen unter anderem durch die Reduktion der Mitarbeiteranzahl um bis zu 300 Arbeitsplätze in Mattighofen und Munderfing, insbesondere durch die Herausnahme von Leiharbeitern sowie durch Mitarbeiter, die über natürliche Fluktuation das Unternehmen verlassen.\n\nAufgrund oben beschriebener strategischer Anpassungen werden ab dem Geschäftsjahr 2024 die berichteten Teilbereiche neu strukturiert. Künftig erfolgt die Ausrichtung an den Segmenten \"Motorcycles\" sowie \"E-Mobility\". Das neue Segment \"E-Mobility\" umfasst künftig neben elektrifizierten New Mobility-Produkten sämtliche elektrobetriebenen Powered-Two-Wheelers wie E-Motorräder, E-Minis sowie Stand-up Scooters.\n\n### **Investitionen**\n\nDie Investitionen der vergangenen Jahre haben die notwendigen Produktionskapazitäten für die kommenden Jahre gesichert. Der Fokus der Investitionen lag und liegt daher auf anderen Projektthemen, insbesondere auf der (Weiter-)Entwicklung bestehender und neuer Modelle, der Elektromobilität und der High-Tech-Modernisierung. Diese markieren für die Gruppe derzeit und auch in Zukunft die oberste Priorität der Investitionen. Im Einklang mit den strategischen Zielen werden die Ausgaben für Investitionen in Forschung und Entwicklung auf dem bereits hohen Niveau der Vorjahre bleiben.\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\nWichtige geplante Investitionen sind auch die Beschaffung von Werkzeugen, insbesondere für geplante\nForschungs- und Entwicklungsprojekte, Investitionen in digitale Vertriebsplattformen für Händler und Endkunden\nsowie Modernisierungen, Erweiterungen, Verbesserungen und Digitalisierung bestehender\nProduktionskapazitäten.\n\nDie aktuellen Liquiditätsreserven gepaart mit einem ausgewogenen Mix an verschiedenen\nFinanzierungsinstrumenten ermöglichen es der Unternehmensgruppe auch im Jahr 2024 in einem volatilen\nMarktumfeld flexibel zu agieren. In diesem Zusammenhang wurden die verfügbaren Liquiditätsreserven kurz- und\nlangfristig deutlich erhöht. So hat die KTM Gruppe im Geschäftsjahr 2023 etwa ein Schuldscheindarlehen mit\neinem Volumen von EUR 300 Millionen sowie eine Namensschuldverschreibung im Umfang von EUR 50\nMillionen emittiert.\n\nDie Unternehmensgruppe ist auch von den Folgen der aktuellen Zinsentwicklung betroffen und das\nZinsänderungsrisiko wird regelmäßig evaluiert. Weiters wurden Maßnahmen zur Steuerung des\nZinsänderungsrisikos ergriffen. Die PIERER Mobility-Gruppe erwartet mittelfristig eine Reduktion des derzeit\nhohen Zinsniveaus.\n\nWels, am 14.

Dezember 2023 14. März 2024*\n\n## **Bestätigungsvermerk**\n\n## **Bericht zum Jahresabschluss**\n\n## **Prüfungsurteil**\n\nWir haben den Jahresabschluss der\n\n### PIERER Mobility AG, Wels,\n\nbestehend aus der Bilanz zum 31. Dezember 2023, der Gewinn- und Verlustrechnung für das an diesem Stichtag endende Geschäftsjahr und dem Anhang, geprüft.\n\nNach unserer Beurteilung entspricht der Jahresabschluss den gesetzlichen Vorschriften und vermittelt ein möglichst getreues Bild der Vermögens- und Finanzlage zum 31. Dezember 2023 sowie der Ertragslage der Gesellschaft für das an diesem Stichtag endende Geschäftsjahr in Übereinstimmung mit den österreichischen unternehmensrechtlichen Vorschriften.\n\n## **Grundlage für das Prüfungsurteil**\n\nWir haben unsere Abschlussprüfung in Übereinstimmung mit der EU-Verordnung Nr 537/2014 (im Folgenden AP-VO) und mit den österreichischen Grundsätzen ordnungsgemäßer Abschlussprüfung durchgeführt. Diese Grundsätze erfordern die Anwendung der International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Unsere Verantwortlichkeiten nach diesen Vorschriften und Standards sind im Abschnitt \"Verantwortlichkeiten des Abschlussprüfers für die Prüfung des Jahresabschlusses\" unseres Bestätigungsvermerks weitergehend beschrieben. Wir sind von der Gesellschaft unabhängig in Übereinstimmung mit den österreichischen unternehmens- und berufsrechtlichen Vorschriften und wir haben unsere sonstigen beruflichen Pflichten in Übereinstimmung mit diesen Anforderungen erfüllt. Wir sind der Auffassung, dass die von uns erlangten Prüfungsnachweise bis zum Datum dieses Bestätigungsvermerkes ausreichend und geeignet sind, um als Grundlage für unser Prüfungsurteil zu diesem Datum zu dienen.\n\n## **Besonders wichtige Prüfungssachverhalte**\n\nBesonders wichtige Prüfungssachverhalte sind solche Sachverhalte, die nach unserem pflichtgemäßen Ermessen am bedeutsamsten für unsere Prüfung des Jahresabschlusses des Geschäftsjahres waren. Diese Sachverhalte wurden im Zusammenhang mit unserer Prüfung des Jahresabschlusses als Ganzes und bei der Bildung unseres Prüfungsurteils hierzu berücksichtigt und wir geben kein gesondertes Prüfungsurteil zu diesen Sachverhalten ab.\n\nWir haben bestimmt, dass es keine besonders wichtigen Prüfungssachverhalte gibt, die in unserem Vermerk mitzuteilen sind.\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/165/Picture/0 description: The image shows the KPMG logo. The logo consists of the letters \"KPMG\" in a stylized, sans-serif font, with four squares above the letters.\n\n## **Verantwortlichkeiten der gesetzlichen Vertreter und des Prüfungsausschusses für den Jahresabschluss**\n\nDie gesetzlichen Vertreter sind verantwortlich für die Aufstellung des Jahresabschlusses und dafür, dass dieser in Übereinstimmung mit den österreichischen unternehmensrechtlichen Vorschriften ein möglichst getreues Bild der Vermögens-, Finanz- und Ertragslage der Gesellschaft vermittelt. Ferner sind die gesetzlichen Vertreter verantwortlich für die internen Kontrollen, die sie als notwendig erachten, um die Aufstellung eines Jahresabschlusses zu ermöglichen, der frei von wesentlichen falschen Darstellungen aufgrund von dolosen Handlungen oder Irrtümern ist.\n\nBei der Aufstellung des Jahresabschlusses sind die gesetzlichen Vertreter dafür verantwortlich, die Fähigkeit der Gesellschaft zur Fortführung der Unternehmenstätigkeit zu beurteilen, Sachverhalte im Zusammenhang mit der Fortführung der Unternehmenstätigkeit – sofern einschlägig – anzugeben, sowie dafür, den Rechnungslegungsgrundsatz der Fortführung der Unternehmenstätigkeit anzuwenden, es sei denn, die gesetzlichen Vertreter beabsichtigen, entweder die Gesellschaft zu liquidieren oder die Unternehmenstätigkeit einzustellen oder haben keine realistische Alternative dazu.\n\nDer Prüfungsausschuss ist verantwortlich für die Überwachung des Rechnungslegungsprozesses der Gesellschaft.\n\n## **Verantwortlichkeiten des Abschlussprüfers für die Prüfung des Jahresabschlusses**\n\nUnsere Ziele sind hinreichende Sicherheit darüber zu erlangen, ob der Jahresabschluss als Ganzes frei von wesentlichen falschen Darstellungen aufgrund von dolosen Handlungen oder Irrtümern ist und einen Bestätigungsvermerk zu erteilen, der unser Prüfungsurteil beinhaltet. Hinreichende Sicherheit ist ein hohes Maß an Sicherheit, aber keine Garantie dafür, dass eine in Übereinstimmung mit der AP-VO und mit den österreichischen Grundsätzen ordnungsgemäßer Abschlussprüfung, die die Anwendung der ISA erfordern, durchgeführte Abschlussprüfung eine wesentliche falsche Darstellung, falls eine solche vorliegt, stets aufdeckt. Falsche Darstellungen können aus dolosen Handlungen oder Irrtümern resultieren und werden als wesentlich angesehen, wenn von ihnen einzeln oder insgesamt vernünftigerweise erwartet werden könnte, dass sie die auf der Grundlage dieses Jahresabschlusses getroffenen wirtschaftlichen Entscheidungen von Nutzern beeinflussen.\n\nAls Teil einer Abschlussprüfung in Übereinstimmung mit der AP-VO und mit den österreichischen Grundsätzen ordnungsgemäßer Abschlussprüfung, die die Anwendung der ISA erfordern, üben wir während der gesamten Abschlussprüfung pflichtgemäßes Ermessen aus und bewahren eine kritische Grundhaltung.\n\nDarüber hinaus gilt:\n\n— Wir identifizieren und beurteilen die Risiken wesentlicher falscher Darstellungen aufgrund von dolosen Handlungen oder Irrtümern im Abschluss, planen Prüfungshandlungen als Reaktion auf diese Risiken, führen sie durch und erlangen Prüfungsnachweise, die ausreichend und geeignet sind, um als Grundlage für unser Prüfungsurteil zu dienen. Das Risiko, dass aus dolosen Handlungen resultierende wesentliche falsche Darstellungen nicht aufgedeckt werden, ist höher als ein aus Irrtümern resultierendes, da dolose Handlungen kollusives Zusammenwirken, Fälschungen, beabsichtigte Unvollständigkeiten, irreführende Darstellungen oder das Außerkraftsetzen interner Kontrollen beinhalten können.\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/166/Picture/0 description: The image shows the KPMG logo. The letters \"KPMG\" are in bold, blue font. Above the letters are four white squares.\n\n- Wir gewinnen ein Verständnis von dem für die Abschlussprüfung relevanten internen Kontrollsystem, um Prüfungshandlungen zu planen, die unter den gegebenen Umständen angemessen sind, jedoch nicht mit dem Ziel, ein Prüfungsurteil zur Wirksamkeit des internen Kontrollsystems der Gesellschaft abzugeben.\n- Wir beurteilen die Angemessenheit der von den gesetzlichen Vertretern angewandten Rechnungslegungsmethoden sowie die Vertretbarkeit der von den gesetzlichen Vertretern dargestellten geschätzten Werte in der Rechnungslegung und damit zusammenhängende Angaben.\n- Wir ziehen Schlussfolgerungen über die Angemessenheit der Anwendung des Rechnungslegungsgrundsatzes der Fortführung der Unternehmenstätigkeit durch die gesetzlichen Vertreter sowie, auf der Grundlage der erlangten Prüfungsnachweise, ob eine wesentliche Unsicherheit im Zusammenhang mit Ereignissen oder Gegebenheiten besteht, die erhebliche Zweifel an der Fähigkeit der Gesellschaft zur Fortführung der Unternehmenstätigkeit aufwerfen können. Falls wir die Schlussfolgerung ziehen, dass eine wesentliche Unsicherheit besteht, sind wir verpflichtet, in unserem Bestätigungsvermerk auf die dazugehörigen Angaben im Jahresabschluss aufmerksam zu machen oder, falls diese Angaben unangemessen sind, unser Prüfungsurteil zu modifizieren. Wir ziehen unsere Schlussfolgerungen auf der Grundlage der bis zum Datum unseres Bestätigungsvermerks erlangten Prüfungsnachweise. Zukünftige Ereignisse oder Gegebenheiten können jedoch die Abkehr der Gesellschaft von der Fortführung der Unternehmenstätigkeit zur Folge haben.\n- Wir beurteilen die Gesamtdarstellung, den Aufbau und den Inhalt des Jahresabschlusses einschließlich der Angaben sowie ob der Jahresabschluss die zugrunde liegenden Geschäftsvorfälle und Ereignisse in einer Weise wiedergibt, dass ein möglichst getreues Bild erreicht wird.\n- Wir tauschen uns mit dem Prüfungsausschuss unter anderem über den geplanten Umfang und die geplante zeitliche Einteilung der Abschlussprüfung sowie über bedeutsame Prüfungsfeststellungen, einschließlich etwaiger bedeutsamer Mängel im internen Kontrollsystem, die wir während unserer Abschlussprüfung erkennen, aus.\n- Wir geben dem Prüfungsausschuss auch eine Erklärung ab, dass wir die relevanten beruflichen Verhaltensanforderungen zur Unabhängigkeit eingehalten haben und uns mit ihm über alle Beziehungen und sonstigen Sachverhalte austauschen, von denen vernünftigerweise angenommen werden kann, dass sie sich auf unsere Unabhängigkeit und – sofern einschlägig – damit zusammenhängende Schutzmaßnahmen auswirken.\n- Wir bestimmen von den Sachverhalten, über die wir uns mit dem Prüfungsausschuss ausgetauscht haben, diejenigen Sachverhalte, die am bedeutsamsten für die Prüfung des Jahresabschlusses des Geschäftsjahres waren und daher die besonders wichtigen Prüfungssachverhalte sind. Wir beschreiben diese Sachverhalte in unserem Bestätigungsvermerk, es sei denn, Gesetze oder andere Rechtsvorschriften schließen die öffentliche Angabe des Sachverhalts aus oder wir bestimmen in äußerst seltenen Fällen, dass ein Sachverhalt nicht in unserem Bestätigungsvermerk mitgeteilt werden sollte, weil vernünftigerweise erwartet wird, dass die negativen Folgen einer solchen Mitteilung deren Vorteile für das öffentliche Interesse übersteigen würden.\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/167/Picture/0 description: The image shows the KPMG logo.
