KSB MIL India is a driving force behind the technological development of control valves that will better meet the needs of KSB customers and ensure continued growth in the valve market.

In the dry season, the pumps transport water to 58,000-litre tanks at daytime temperatures of up to 40 °C. The farm operator uses photovoltaic panels on the farm roof to power the pumps.

The room is filled with large pipes, machinery, and equipment. The men are dressed in business attire, with some wearing suits and others in more casual clothing. They are positioned in front of the machinery, and some of them are pointing towards it. There are also banners or signs with logos and text visible in the background. The lighting is bright, and the overall composition suggests a professional or promotional photograph.\n\n#### **New heating station**\n\nIn the presence of numerous guests, the four Managing Directors officially inaugurate the new, highly efficient heating station at KSB's main plant in Frankenthal. Fuelled with gas and wood chips, the 15-million-euro heating station will reduce energy consumption for heat generation by 900 tonnes of CO2 per year. It also features a photovoltaic system on the roof.\n\nImage /page/24/Picture/5 description: The image shows an indoor exhibition hall with several booths. The booth in the foreground has the logo \"KSB b\" on a hanging sign. The booth also has a sign that says \"KEEP IT COOL.\"\n\n#### **Trade fair for the shipping industry**\n\nTogether with French subsidiary KSB S.A.S. and Indian subsidiary KSB MIL, South Korean subsidiary KSB Seil participates in KORMARINE, the world's leading maritime exhibition in Busan. For the KSB Group, it is a good opportunity to consolidate its position in the shipping industry. As the market leader for valves in LNG applications, KSB offers reliable solutions for ship owners and shipyards.\n\nImage /page/24/Picture/8 description: The image shows a low-angle shot of two white flags with the text \"KSB SupremeServ\" written on them. The text is arranged vertically, with \"KSB\" in blue and \"SupremeServ\" in gray. The flags are waving in the wind against a bright blue sky with scattered white clouds. The flagpoles are visible at the bottom of the image.\n\n#### **New service brands**\n\nKSB launches five new service brands under the established KSB SupremeServ label:\n\nKSB SupremeServ ReEngineering, KSB SupremeServ Logistics, KSB SupremeServ Efficiency Consulting, KSB SupremeServ Monitoring and KSB SupremeServ Academy. The aim is to highlight the comprehensive range of services offered by KSB Service to customers.\n\nImage /page/24/Picture/12 description: A group of people are standing outside in front of a building. There are adults and children in the group. The adults are dressed in casual clothing, and the children are wearing school uniforms. The adults are holding a long, white object, and the children are clapping. There is a sign on the building behind the group.\n\n#### **Donation of pumps**\n\nKSB supports a drinking water project at Lake Baringo in Kenya by providing ten well pumps. The lake is contaminated with bacteria and the concentration of naturally occurring fluoride is too high. The pumps are installed in water filter systems that are powered by electricity from solar cells and supply around 5,000 people with clean water.\n\nImage /page/24/Picture/15 description: The image shows a large, white, multi-story building with many windows. The building has a modern architectural style and appears to be well-maintained. The sky is visible in the background, with some clouds present. There is a crosswalk in front of the building.\n\n#### **KSB share moves up to SDAX**\n\nOn 18 December, the KSB preference share is included in the SDAX.\n\nThe decisive criterion for its promotion is the market capitalisation of KSB's free float preference shares. Around 20 percent of the preference shares are held through Johannes und Jacob Klein GmbH as well as KSB Stiftung [KSB Foundation]. The KSB shares have been traded on the stock exchange since 1895. The KSB preference share price has almost tripled in the last three years.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-25-0\"></span>**Combined Separate Non-financial Report**\n\nSustainability is one of KSB's strategic pillars and has always been a key focus of its business activities. The company understands sustainability to encompass the responsible use of resources and the environment as well as its responsibility to employees and corporate social commitment. These topics are covered in this combined separate non-financial report pursuant to Sections 289b(3) and 315b(3) HGB [*Handelsgesetzbuch* – German Commercial Code] and Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the Establishment of a Framework to Facilitate Sustainable Investment, and Amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereinafter referred to as the EU Taxonomy Regulation). The report fulfils the requirements of the CSR Directive Implementation Act [*CSR-Richtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz*] and combines the statement at company level with the Group statement outside of the management report.\n\nIn accordance with its business model, KSB supplies customers worldwide with high-quality pumps and valves as well as related support services.

The products are sold via its own sales organisation, supported by dealer networks comprising selected partners. The business model is presented in the Group management report on page 62.\n\nAs a member of the UN Global Compact, KSB commits to aligning its business activities with ten universal principles. The Global Compact principles apply equally to managers and employees throughout the company as well as to all suppliers and business partners.\n\n#### **Sustainability Management at KSB**\n\nKSB has formulated its own corporate sustainability principles via a Group-wide sustainability policy. They are binding for all locations and all companies within the KSB Group. A committee chaired by the CEO regularly reviews progress on sustainability issues and the implementation of Group-wide sustainability goals. In addition, a global network with representatives from all nine KSB Regions ensures that sustainability issues are driven forward in their respective countries. They report on progress, local initiatives and measures, as well as the completion of objectives. Management also receives a compliance report twice a year as well as an annual review of management issues relating to quality, the environment and occupational health and safety.\n\nThe Sustainability Committee includes the CEO and management staff from Human Resources, Legal & Compliance, Production, Product Management, Purchasing, Communications, Strategy and Integrated Management. A Valves representative has been a member of the committee since 2023 in order to report on the development of sustainability issues in this Group segment.\n\nKSB operates a global integrated management system in order to fulfil consistently high standards worldwide with regard to quality, risk, environment, occupational health and safety, and sustainability.

The x-axis is labeled \"Relevance for KSB's business activities\" and ranges from 1 to 5. The y-axis is labeled \"Impact on society\\*\" and ranges from 1 to 5. There are several data points plotted on the scatter plot. \"Resource efficiency\" is plotted at approximately (2.5, 4.5). \"Diversity\" is plotted at approximately (3, 3.7). \"Climate change mitigation\" is plotted at approximately (2.7, 3.2). \"Sustainable supply chains\" is plotted at approximately (2.7, 2.7). \"Social responsibility\" is plotted at approximately (2.5, 2.2). \"Respecting human rights\" is plotted at approximately (3.5, 5). \"Occupational health and safety\" is plotted at approximately (4.5, 5). \"Product responsibility\" is plotted at approximately (4.2, 4.5). \"Energy-efficient products\" is plotted at approximately (4.2, 4.2). \"Professional training and development\" is plotted at approximately (4.2, 3.7). \"Compliance\" is plotted at approximately (4, 3.2). A legend indicates that blue squares represent ecological factors, light blue squares represent social factors, light-blue squares represent economic factors, and gray squares represent general factors. A footnote states \"\\* With regard to the environment, labour and social issues, human rights and anti-corruption\".\n\n#### **Sustainability Reporting**\n\nThe management concepts relating to material issues outlined here apply to both the Group and to KSB SE & Co.KGaA; any instances where this is not the case are duly indicated. All information in the non-financial report relates to KSB SE & Co. KGaA and the Group in 2023. References to information not included in the Group management report in this section represent supplementary information and are not part of the separate non-financial report. PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft performed a limited assurance engagement on the information in this report in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised) and issued an independent assurance report; see page 56.\n\nIn the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environment, anti-corruption and sustainability in the supply chain, the concepts and activities set out in this report follow the principles of the UN Global Compact, as well as national and international regulations.\n\nThe non-financial report covers 29 material Group companies, unless otherwise stated. These were selected on the basis of their significant impact on aspects such as energy consumption and the number of employees. The 29 companies employ 87.9 % of the workforce and account for 97.8 % of Group-wide energy consumption. The remaining companies have no significant impact on non-financial aspects. KSB has therefore not expanded this report to include these Group companies as they have no material impact on the issues it covers in the reporting year. The 29 Group companies include all consolidated subsidiaries with production plants and two service companies with energy-intensive workshops.\n\nAs part of its corporate responsibility strategy, KSB is also committed to supporting a diverse range of social initiatives. The company chooses to report on these activities on an entirely voluntary basis, as these do not have any significant or material impact on its business success.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Non-financial objectives up to 2025 and performance indicators**\n\n| Aspects                               | Objectives up to 2025                                                                                                     | Performance indicators                                            |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Resource efficiency                   | More than half of newly developed products are subject to ecological<br>assessment.                                       | Number of development projects                                    |\n| Energy-efficient products             | KSB's water pumps save an annual 850,000 tonnes of CO2.                                                                   | CO2 savings for KSB water pumps with<br>variable speed drives     |\n| Emissions                             | KSB production plants reduce their CO2 emissions by 30 %.<br>(Reference year: 2018)                                       | CO2 emissions at production sites                                 |\n| Education and training                | Each employee invests at least 30 hours per year in training and development.                                             | Number of training hours per employee per year                    |\n| Equal opportunities                   | Women make up at least 20 % of management staff.                                                                          | Proportion of women in management positions                       |\n| Engagement                            | The employee satisfaction index is 80 %.                                                                                  | Engagement score according to<br>employee survey                  |\n| Occupational health<br>and safety     | The number of working days lost due to occupational accidents is<br>reduced to fewer than 0.3 days per employee per year. | Number of days lost due to accidents<br>(lost time accident rate) |\n| Social commitment                     | KSB is involved in at least 25 social projects worldwide every year.                                                      | Number of CSR projects                                            |\n| Sustainability in the<br>supply chain | The sustainability performance of 90 % of the key regional and<br>global suppliers is assessed.                           | Proportion of suppliers assessed                                  |\n\n\\* The 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations take into account the three dimensions of sustainability: social, environmental and economic aspects. KSB's material sustainability issues relate to the goals addressing poverty (1), hunger (2), health and well-being (3), quality education (4), gender equality (5), clean water and sanitation (6), decent work conditions and economic growth (8), sustainable consumption and production (12) and climate action (13).\n\n#### **Implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive**\n\nFollowing the introduction of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the associated European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), new rules for nonfinancial reporting by companies will apply from the 2024 reporting year. KSB made initial preparations for this in the reporting year. For example, the company commissioned a scientific study to develop a concept for the double materiality assessment required by the EU directive. In addition, experts from an auditing firm helped to identify the material issues for KSB. This involved interviews on the topics of the environment, social matters and corporate governance, validation of the range of topics and an assessment of material impacts, risks and opportunities. The implementation phase for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive is being conducted in the current reporting year.\n\n#### **Material Issues**\n\nKSB communicates regularly with various stakeholders in order to identify their interests and expectations regarding the company. The material sustainability issues defined on this basis have been reviewed and confirmed for 2023 by specialist departments and the Sustainability Committee with oversight \n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe company's social engagement sees KSB making a contribution towards achieving the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nCycling keeps you fit, saves energy and reduces your personal carbon footprint.

In the reporting year, for example, the company donated € 10,000 and multiple pumps to supply people with water following an earthquake in Turkey.\n\nKSB's Indian companies have traditionally been strongly committed to charitable organisations and institutions in the vicinity of their locations. The projects primarily focus on improving the lives of children and women in schools and social institutions, for example through grants for infrastructure and the purchase of study materials. KSB offers particular support for people with disabilities, those in need and the elderly.\n\nThe company's social engagement sees KSB making a contribution towards achieving the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The focuses of the supported projects and measures were, in descending order, the goals of quality education (goal 4), industry, innovation and infrastructure (goal 9) and good health and well-being (goal 3).\n\nFounded in 1942, the Geheimrat Dr. Jacob Klein-Unterstützungseinrichtung e.V. benevolent fund originally functioned to finance the KSB pension scheme.

Responsibility for the data collection and reporting process lies with the Finance department.\n\nThe following findings regarding KSB's economic activities were made as part of the impact analysis in connection with the performance indicators relevant to the EU taxonomy:\n\nKSB's core sales activities almost exclusively comprise the manufacture of pumps and valves, and provision of related spare parts and support services. The EU taxonomy currently in force in particular covers economic activities that have a material impact on the environment. As this is largely not the case with mechanical engineering, KSB cannot allocate its sales activities to such economic activities. In particular, it was assessed whether the new economic activities of environmental objective (4) Transition to a circular economy from Section 5. Services could be relevant for KSB. However, the NACE codes listed in the activity descriptions to narrow down the products considered for this activity do not fall within the scope of the Group's activities. The economic activities added to the other environmental objectives were also assessed and do not correspond to the Group-wide sales revenue-generating economic activities.\n\nFurthermore, KSB does not engage in any of the economic activities described in the European Commission Delegated Regulation 2022/1214 in connection with the production of energy from fossil gas or nuclear energy. KSB therefore has not used the specific reporting forms for these activities in accordance with Annex XII of the European Commission Delegated Regulation 2021/2178.\n\nAccordingly, as in previous years, KSB will not report any taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned sales revenue in the 2023 financial year.\n\nCapital expenditure and operating expenditure relating to assets or processes associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities (Category A) therefore also cannot be reported. Furthermore, there is no CapEx plan to expand a taxonomy-aligned activity or upgrade a taxonomy-eligible activity to become a taxonomy-aligned activity. Thus, no category B capital expenditure or operating expenses are reported.\n\nWith regard to capital expenditure and operating expenditure in category C, from the purchase of taxonomy-aligned products and individual measures, the following taxonomy-eligible economic activities were identified in the impact analysis for the KSB Group:\n\n#### **Taxonomy-eligible economic activities:**\n\n| Economic activities according to the EU taxonomy                                                                                                   | Examples of activities at KSB                                          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Manufacturing / Production of goods                                                                                                                |                                                                        |\n| CCM 3.9 Manufacturing of iron and steel                                                                                                            | Operation of foundries                                                 |\n| Transport                                                                                                                                          |                                                                        |\n| CCM 6.5 Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles                                                                      | Purchasing and leasing of passenger cars                               |\n| Construction and real estate                                                                                                                       |                                                                        |\n| CCM 7.2 / CE 3.2 Renovation of existing buildings                                                                                                  | Renovation of administrative buildings                                 |\n| CCM 7.3 Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment                                                                        | Replacement of existing windows with new energy-efficient windows      |\n| CCM 7.4 Installation, maintenance and repair of charging stations for electric<br>vehicles in buildings (and parking spaces attached to buildings) | Purchasing and installation of charging stations for electric vehicles |\n| CCM 7.6 Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies                                                                      | Purchasing and installation of solar power systems                     |\n| CCM 7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings                                                                                                     | Purchasing and leasing of non-residential buildings                    |\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe identified taxonomy-eligible economic activities were primarily allocated to environmental objective (1) Climate change mitigation, as KSB has a greater influence on the contribution to this environmental objective.\n\nDespite the corresponding activity description, the activities of environmental objective (2) Climate change adaptation were not reported as taxonomy-eligible because they are not enabling activities or there is no separable, specific capital expenditure or operating expenditure for climate change adaptation.\n\n#### **Assessment of Taxonomy Eligibility and Alignment**\n\nThe basis for determining taxonomy-eligible and taxonomyaligned economic activities are the actually identified capital expenditure and operating expenditure calculated for the fully consolidated companies in the Group, which were assessed and audited in terms of a cost-benefit ratio.

As the identified taxonomy-eligible economic activities relate to the acquisition of products from taxonomy-aligned economic activities (Category C), the assessment of alignment (except for economic activities CCM 7.4 and CCM 7.6) is dependent on the provision of relevant proof by external third parties and cannot be carried out independently by KSB. Suppliers were therefore contacted to verify compliance with the technical screening criteria. It was also checked whether the other environmental objectives were caused any significant harm by the specified economic activity. The documents required by the Delegated Acts could not be provided by the external third parties to a sufficient extent.\n\nFor the economic activities CCM 7.4 Installation, maintenance and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings and CCM 7.6 Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies, KSB meets the substantial contribution criteria. However, the suppliers were unable to provide proof of compliance with EU taxonomy alignment.\n\nAs a result, KSB cannot report any taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure and operating expenditure in the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation defines **minimum safeguard requirements** for companies, in particular with regard to the issues of human rights, corruption, bribery, taxation and antitrust law. KSB's actions are in line with the requirements. Among other things, this is reflected by KSB's compliance with the following internationally recognised standards:\n\n- The Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n- The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP)\n- The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n- The eight fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO)\n- The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\nKSB stands up for human rights, equal treatment and decent working conditions worldwide and documents this in policy statements, guidelines and commitments.

Maintenance expenses include both services provided by third parties and maintenance work performed by KSB employees.\n\nGiven the dynamic situation relating to the relevant legislation, KSB points out that the impact analysis and interpretation of the financial indicators to be determined may be subject to adjustments in the future.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Proportion of sales revenue from products or services associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities – Disclosures for the 2023 financial year**\n\n|                                                                                                                                   |                | 2023                    |                                                     |                                        |                                             |              | Substantial contribution criteria |                  |                                                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Economic activities (1)                                                                                                           | Code(s)<br>(2) | Sales<br>revenue<br>(3) | Proportion<br>of<br>sales<br>revenue<br>2023<br>(4) | Climate<br>change<br>mitigation<br>(5) | Climate<br>change<br>adap-<br>tation<br>(6) | Water<br>(7) | Circular<br>economy<br>(8)        | Pollution<br>(9) | Bio<br>diversity<br>and eco<br>systems<br>(10) |\n|                                                                                                                                   |                | € millions              | %                                                   | Y;N;N/EL                               | Y;N;N/EL                                    | Y;N;N/EL     | Y;N;N/EL                          | Y;N;N/EL         | Y;N;N/EL                                       |\n| A.

Gas shortages combined with higher gas prices posed particular challenges for the manufacturing industry in Germany. On the procurement markets, the easing of the inflation wave and a slight improvement in the availability of important bought-in parts provided some relief.\n\nUnfortunately, our hopes for an improvement in the global political situation remained unfulfilled. The war in Ukraine continued unabated. In the second quarter, fears about global economic relations intensified due to the simmering China-Taiwan conflict. Higher interest rates led to a decrease in investments. The Gaza region has been at war since the attack on Israel in October. These serious events led to a further shake-up of the usual global order and continuing uncertainty in the global economy.\n\nEurope, and in particular Germany, suffered from inflation-related consumer reticence and general uncertainty. Overall, Germany experienced negative growth.\n\nWe have tackled the many challenges with confidence and have not only kept the company on a stable course, but also enabled it to advance.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nDr. Stephan Timmermann\n\n**Tense global situation** \n\nin the global economy.\n\nKSB Group / Annual Report 2023\n\n**Dear Shareholders and Business Partners,**\n\nimprovement in the availability of important bought-in parts provided some relief.\n\nbusiness figures despite difficult global political conditions.\n\n**10 Management and Issues 2023** Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements General Information\n\nuncertainty.

These serious events led to a further shake-up of the usual global order and continuing uncertainty\n\nEurope, and in particular Germany, suffered from inflation-related consumer reticence and general\n\nWe have tackled the many challenges with confidence and have not only kept the company on a\n\n#### **Good market positioning**\n\nKSB's global positioning once again proved to be a major strength in 2023. Thanks to our regional production plants organised in a global manufacturing network, we can quickly supply our customers in all key markets with high-quality products. By systematically aligning all activities with market requirements, we achieved a good order intake despite strong competition in nearly all Market Areas.\n\nEconomic downturns, such as in the construction industry and the German mechanical engineering industry, which particularly dampened growth in Building Services and General Industry, were offset by positive developments in the Mining, Petrochemicals / Chemicals, Energy and Water Market Areas. KSB's broad product range proved to be an advantage.\n\nOur strong earnings position is supported by tight cost control across the Group. A consistent focus on the service and spare parts business under the KSB SupremeServ brand made a substantial contribution to the profitable growth of the entire Group.\n\nThis business success is reflected in the rising valuation of KSB on the financial markets, leading to its inclusion in the SDAX in December.\n\n#### **Strategy 2030**\n\nAn important milestone was the adoption of the Mission TEN30 strategy. In addition to the goal of ten percent profitability by 2030, the strategy sets out numerous targets and measures to drive the company forward. Previous programmes, such as reducing costs at KSB SE & Co. KGaA, were successfully completed.\n\n#### **Megatrends as opportunities**\n\nWith our many years of expertise in fluid handling, we are not only benefiting from the megatrends and major challenges in the world, but are also actively shaping them with new technologies.\n\nThe growing demand for electric motors required for e-mobility and the generation of solar and wind energy will increase the demand for copper and consequently for pumps in the mining industry. The Energy Market Area will also tap new potential as a result of the change in the energy mix. In the Petrochemicals / Chemicals Market Area, KSB will set technological standards in hydrogen production and carbon capture. The growing global population and urbanisation are placing huge demands on water supply and waste water disposal. Adding to this are weather extremes as a result of climate change, the consequences of which we can mitigate with futureoriented water management using pumps.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Global investments**\n\nKSB increased its global investment volume to 136 million euros in 2023, investing in the expansion and technological or energy-related modernisation of its locations in all key markets. In Frankenthal, KSB commissioned a new heating station, saving 900 tonnes of CO2 annually. At its Pegnitz location, KSB adopted a comprehensive concept for the future which saw an investment of 25 million euros in capacity expansion and sustainable production. In India, a new office complex commenced operations and in China construction work began on a cuttingedge production facility for chemical pumps.\n\n#### **Employee engagement**\n\nThe satisfaction and engagement of our employees is a key pillar in the company's success – and a matter close to my heart. Successful corporate development is not possible without highly dedicated people who see change as an opportunity. At the same time, the meaningfulness of the company's business activities and its social competence are becoming increasingly important for attracting the best talent. We have therefore introduced a variety of measures worldwide to promote our corporate culture and strengthen loyalty to the company.\n\n#### **The KSB brand**\n\nStrengthened by the company's sustained positive development, strategic goals and marketleading position, KSB focused on raising brand awareness as a Global Champion in the reporting year. In order to visibly reflect this positive change in our brand image, we are currently revising our logo, the associated brand claim and our corporate values. Have a look at the exclusive initial preview on the next page.\n\n#### **The 2024 financial year**\n\nWe anticipate a wide range of challenges in the new financial year, which will be dominated by political elections in key markets such as India, the USA, South Africa and Europe. Uncertain interest rate trends, global conflicts and the current lack of growth impetus in key countries mean that we are not expecting a significant upturn. However, our confidence in developing the company remains unwavering. KSB's positioning makes it resilient and we will once again generate substantial value for our shareholders, employees and business partners in the 2024 financial year.\n\nRilie\n\nDr. Stephan Timmermann, CEO\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/1 description: The image shows the logo for KSB.

Our customer-first approach is emphasised by the circulation symbol placed prominently at the beginning. The KSB lettering has been significantly enlarged for greater impact, making it more prominent. A three-dimensional design underlines KSB's high quality and unique positioning.\n\n#### **Solutions.

It advised the general partner, KSB Management SE, acting through its Managing Directors, on corporate management issues and monitored its work. The Managing Directors informed the Supervisory Board about current developments, including but not limited to the company's business, financial and staffing situation, planned investments, corporate planning and strategy via written and oral reports prepared regularly and on an ad hoc basis in a comprehensive and timely manner.\n\nThe Supervisory Board discussed business transactions of significance to the company in depth on the basis of reports submitted by the Managing Directors. Any departures in business developments from the plans and targets were questioned and commented on in detail by the Managing Directors. The Supervisory Board also dealt with risk situations, risk management and compliance. Beyond the intensive work in plenary sessions and in the committees, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board in particular and other members of the Supervisory Board were in constant contact with the Managing Directors also between scheduled meetings. There was an ongoing exchange of information with the Administrative Board of KSB Management SE, including but not limited to its Chairman, on current business developments and on material transactions, as well as on questions of strategy and planning. The Chairman of the Administrative Board also participated regularly in the Supervisory Board meetings. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board and his deputy were guests of the Administrative Board on selected issues. The Supervisory Board also convened regularly in the absence of the Management.\n\nThe company continued to support the members of the Supervisory Board in their training measures during the reporting year, providing them with regular information about the rights, obligations and practice of the Supervisory Board. As part of the onboarding process, new members of the Supervisory Board are quickly familiarised with relevant company topics through introductory discussions with committee members and managers responsible for functional areas.\n\n#### **Main focus of work in the Supervisory Board plenary sessions**\n\nThe Supervisory Board held five regular in-person meetings in the 2023 financial year; at three of these meetings, one respectively two Supervisory Board members attended via video conference. In addition, the Supervisory Board held a constituent meeting in personal attendance following the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2023.\n\nKey subjects of nearly all Supervisory Board meetings were the performance of the company and the KSB Group, primarily with regard to their business and financial situation, measures for securing future business development, major investment projects and risk management topics.\n\nRegular consultations with the Managing Directors on business development included the analysis of developments in the Market Areas of the Pumps Segment, the Valves and the KSB SupremeServ Segments, as well as in the Regions. Suitable measures to improve results of operations were discussed, as were the growth initiatives presented by the Managing Directors.\n\nThe Managing Directors also provided regular information on the development of ongoing major investments in our production facilities at various sites. The focus in 2023 was on two Asian locations: In the second half of the year, construction work began on a pump factory in Shanghai, \n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\nwhich will in particular supply China's significant chemical industry. At the Shirwal factory in India, the construction of the administration building and the remaining work on the new production halls were completed in 2023.\n\nThe Supervisory Board was also briefed regularly on the further development of the strategy, which was finalised in the fourth quarter of 2023 with the involvement of individual Supervisory Board members and then approved by the Administrative Board of KSB Management SE. Its implementation is to help to sustainably increase the return on sales to a level of at least ten percent by 2030 through targeted growth initiatives in the Segments and Market Areas. The operational plans are supported by overarching and centrally managed measures. In addition to the aforementioned sustainability goals, these include technological development, improving digital customer interfaces and intensifying application knowledge in Sales.\n\nThe following key topics were discussed at the individual Supervisory Board meetings:\n\nThe meeting in March 2023 particularly addressed the audit and approval of the annual financial statements for the 2022 financial year, including the combined management report and the combined separate non-financial report for the company and the KSB Group in accordance with Sections 315b, 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB [*Handelsgesetzbuch* – German Commercial Code]; the auditors also explained the key audit areas and results. The Chairman of the Audit Committee gave a detailed account of the audit carried out on accounting processes for the period. The Supervisory Board agreed to the proposal on the appropriation of the net retained earnings presented by the general partner for the 2022 financial year. It also approved the remuneration report pursuant to Section 162 AktG [*Aktiengesetz* – German Public Companies Act] for the 2022 financial year. At this meeting, the Supervisory Board also discussed the development of a US service and re-engineering company acquired in 2010, which primarily supplies customers in the energy and refinery markets. In 2022, the company and the majority of its activities were relocated to a newly built site with a modern test facility and it has since then increasingly focused on growth.\n\nIn May, the Supervisory Board held a comprehensive review of business development in the countries of Northern, Eastern and Southeastern Europe, which KSB has combined into one area of responsibility. The strength of KSB SupremeServ's business there is very positive, representing an important pillar of the Group's earnings. The valve business is also developing at an aboveaverage rate in this region and reflects the high potential of this Segment. Another focus of the meeting was on the centralised measures for the development of Sales. The aim is to align its organisation and tools with customers' growing digital requirements while simultaneously improving efficiency at KSB.\n\nAt the meeting in July, the Supervisory Board discussed business development in two Regions. The core market of Europe continues to be of particular importance to the Group. The fact that the Europe-based parent company KSB SE & Co. KGaA achieved a significant improvement in its earnings capacity in 2023 was viewed by the Supervisory Board as very encouraging. The positive development is due, among other things, to the earnings enhancement programme that has been systematically implemented since 2020 and overseen by the Supervisory Board.

The positive development is due, among other things, to the earnings enhancement programme that has been systematically implemented since 2020 and overseen by the Supervisory Board. The Managing Directors see great potential in the Region Middle East / Africa, particularly in the Water Market Area; the company therefore plans to further expand its presence there.\n\nIn October, the Supervisory Board held a meeting at KSB ITUR Spain, S.A., Spain. The management reported on the development of the company acquired in 2003 and its strategic role within the KSB Group. The company – together with the companies in France and Portugal – is assigned to the Region Europe West; its development was also discussed in detail. Other topics on the agenda included the expansion of the e-sales business and the status of preparations for rolling out the ERP software SAP S/4HANA, which will replace SAP's ERP software currently used. The Managing Directors wish to combine this transformation with the implementation of even more efficient processes.\n\nThe Supervisory Board addressed the planning for the 2024 financial year and medium-term planning at the meeting in December. It received detailed reports on the corresponding goals, notably on order intake, sales revenue and earnings. Particular emphasis was placed on discussing the investment budget; this is largely earmarked for the extension of production capacities in growth markets and the modernisation of locations. Business development in the Region Asia / Pacific was also discussed: Thanks to the economic dynamics in individual countries, KSB achieved above-average growth there, particularly in the KSB SupremeServ Segment and in the Mining and Water Market Areas.\n\n#### **Main focus of work in the committees**\n\nIn order to enable it to fulfil its duties efficiently, the Supervisory Board worked with four committees during the reporting year. These prepared the Supervisory Board's resolutions and the special topics to be discussed in the plenary sessions. In addition, they made their own decisions within the scope of their authorities. This allocation has proved worthwhile in practice. The Chairs of the committees regularly and comprehensively reported in the plenary sessions on the content and results of the work carried out in the committees.\n\n#### **SUPERVISORY BOARD COMMITTEES**\n\nand their Chairs, as well as number of meetings in the reporting year\n\n#### **CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE**\n\nChair: Klaus Kühborth No. of meetings: 5\n\n#### **NOMINATION COMMITTEE**\n\nMembers: Dr. Bernd Flohr Klaus Kühborth No. of meetings: 1\n\n#### **PERSONNEL COMMITTEE**\n\nChair: Dr. Bernd Flohr No. of meetings: 2\n\n#### **AUDIT COMMITTEE**\n\nChair: Klaus Burchards No. of meetings: 6\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                 | Supervisory<br>Board | Nomination<br>Committee | Corporate<br>Development<br>Committee | Personnel<br>Committee | Audit<br>Committee |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| Dr. Bernd Flohr                 | 5/5                  | 1/1                     |                                       | 2/2                    | 6/6                |\n| René Klotz (until May 2023)     | 2/5                  |                         | 2/5                                   |                        |                    |\n| Claudia Augustin                | 5/5                  |                         |                                       | 2/2                    |                    |\n| Klaus Burchards                 | 4/5                  |                         |                                       |                        | 6/6                |\n| Arturo Esquinca                 | 5/5                  |                         | 5/5                                   |                        |                    |\n| Klaus Kühborth                  | 5/5                  | 1/1                     | 5/5                                   |                        |                    |\n| Birgit Mohme                    | 4/5                  |                         |                                       |                        | 4/6                |\n| Thomas Pabst                    | 5/5                  |                         | 5/5                                   |                        |                    |\n| Prof. Dr. Corinna Salander      | 4/5                  |                         | 3/5                                   |                        |                    |\n| Harald Schöberl                 | 5/5                  |                         |                                       |                        | 6/6                |\n| Volker Seidel                   | 5/5                  |                         | 5/5                                   | 2/2                    |                    |\n| Gabriele Sommer                 | 4/5                  |                         |                                       | 2/2                    |                    |\n| Jürgen Walther (since May 2023) | 3/5                  |                         | 3/5                                   |                        |                    |\n\n#### **Attendance at meetings**\n\nThe **Audit Committee** convened six times in the reporting year, with five meetings held in person and one as a video conference. It discussed the 2022 annual and consolidated financial statements and the relevant audit reports submitted by the auditors. The combined separate non-financial report and remuneration report pursuant to Section 162 AktG were also discussed in detail. The committee meetings were generally attended by the Managing Directors and the managers of the relevant specialist departments, as well as, on multiple occasions, the auditors. The Audit Committee, in particular its Chairman, regularly exchanged ideas with the auditors in preparatory meetings, without participation of the Managing Directors. The committee prepared the independent examination by the Supervisory Board of the financial statements, the combined management reports and the proposal on profit appropriation. In addition, the Audit Committee submitted a recommendation for the selection of auditors by the 2023 Annual General Meeting to the Supervisory Board plenary session. The Audit Committee also commissioned the auditors with auditing the annual and consolidated financial statements for the 2023 financial year and defined specific key areas for the audit together with the auditors. It obtained the declaration of independence by the auditors and monitored the auditors' continued independence and performance of non-audit services. The committee also reviewed the quality of the annual financial statements on the basis of previously defined criteria.\n\nIn addition, the committee focused on reviewing accounting, monitoring the accounting process, the effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system and the internal audit system, as well as the auditing of the annual financial statements and compliance. In this context, it also debated the half-year financial report with the Managing Directors. It also focused regularly on the Internal Audits reports. Another focus of the committee meetings was the economic development of the Group and selected subsidiaries for which earnings enhancement programmes had been initiated. The committee discussed the development of the Group's tax rate, other tax\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe **Audit Committee** convened six times in the reporting year, with five meetings held in person and one as a video conference.

In this context, it also debated the half-year financial report with the Managing Directors. It also focused regularly on the Internal Audits reports. Another focus of the committee meetings was the economic development of the Group and selected subsidiaries for which earnings enhancement programmes had been initiated. The committee discussed the development of the Group's tax rate, other tax-\n\nstatements on the basis of previously defined criteria.\n\nKSB Group / Annual Report 2023\n\n**Attendance at meetings**\n\n**Supervisory Board**\n\n**18 Management and Issues 2023** Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements General Information\n\nRené Klotz (until May 2023) 2/5 2/5\n\nArturo Esquinca 5/5 5/5 Klaus Kühborth 5/5 1/1 5/5\n\nThomas Pabst 5/5 5/5 Prof. Dr. Corinna Salander 4/5 3/5\n\nJürgen Walther (since May 2023) 3/5 3/5\n\nClaudia Augustin 5/5 2/2\n\nVolker Seidel 5/5 5/5 2/2 Gabriele Sommer 4/5 2/2 related topics and preparations for future requirements resulting from public Country-by-Country Reporting and the global minimum tax for multinational enterprises. Another key focus was on the planned implementation of the EU CSRD Directive, which will result in much more extensive sustainability reporting in future. Due to the legally required rotation of the auditors, the committee also dealt with the implementation of a transparent and non-discriminatory procedure for the selection of the auditors for the 2025 financial year. At its meeting on 8 November 2023, the committee decided to prepare and initiate a tender process in accordance with the legal requirements and commissioned the Managing Directors with its implementation.\n\nThe **Personnel Committee** held two in-person meetings in the reporting year. The committee focuses on subjects and challenges relating to Human Resources activities within the Group. It also decides in particular on the conducting of transactions for which the Supervisory Board has been appointed to represent the company pursuant to Section 112 AktG, as well as on matters relating to the remuneration of the Supervisory Board members. In the reporting year, the committee obtained information on the progress of the roll-out of a global HR system for nearly all KSB companies. It was also briefed on how KSB is adapting to changing conditions in personnel recruitment and investing in personnel development. Lastly, the committee also dealt with an issue relating to the Supervisory Board itself: Following an in-depth review of the Supervisory Board remuneration, which has remained unchanged since 2017, it came to the conclusion that it should be moderately increased, in particular due to the constantly growing demands and the associated increase in workload as well as inflation-induced loss in value. Together with the general partner, the Supervisory Board will propose this for resolution at the 2024 Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe **Corporate Development Committee** deals with strategic issues in the fields of technology, production and sales, among other things. It also advises on the budget and planning. It convened five times in the reporting year. The committee members met in person at four meetings, with one member joining one of the meetings via video conference. One meeting was held as a video conference. Guests and speakers were also regularly involved via video conference. During these sessions, the committee engaged in multiple discussions on planned investments in production facilities, service locations and sales units. One example was the expansion of circulator production at the location in Ankara, Turkey. Demand for these products has risen significantly following the boom in the heating market and in particular in the heat pump market. The committee also discussed the successful development of a company founded several years ago in India: KSB Tech Pvt. Ltd., an engineering and IT services company whose portfolio ranges from product development and design through to IT services and collaboration in strategic IT projects. The committee was also briefed on the planned procedure for the introduction of S/4HANA. As the preparatory work has largely been completed, detailed planning for this extensive transformation project will begin in the first half of 2024. Finally, the committee reviewed planning for 2024 and the annual investment budget including discussions of the current investment focus.\n\nThe **Nomination Committee** recommends to the Supervisory Board suitable candidates for election as Supervisory Board members, whom the Supervisory Board then proposes to the Annual General Meeting. In looking for and evaluating suitable candidates with the requisite expertise and experience of the industry, long-term succession planning is a key factor. The committee held one in-person meeting in the reporting year.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Corporate Governance and Statement of Compliance**\n\nThe Supervisory Board continuously monitored developments in corporate governance standards throughout the reporting year.

KGaA \\*\\*\\* Exluding vehicle fleet\n\nCO²\n\nBy 2025, KSB intends to assess the environmental impact of more than 50 % of its development projects in accordance with the international ISO 14040 standard. This concerns new product developments and significant design modifications to existing type series.Detailed information on the life cycle assessments of new products can thus be determined.\n\nA further goal is to reduce the CO2 emissions, excluding those of the vehicle fleet, produced by the main locations – which are chiefly the manufacturing plants – by 30 %, also by 2025 (based on the 2018 figure).\n\n#### **Organisation, processes and measures:**\n\nKSB follows the internationally recognised ISO 14001 environmental management system to continuously improve its environmental performance. To date, the company has implemented the environmental management system at 39 production and assembly locations (KSB SE & Co. KGaA: 3 locations); this represents 93 % coverage.\n\nThe EU Energy Efficiency Directive requires all large companies to carry out regular energy audits in order to contribute to the European energy and climate protection targets. KSB carries out these energy audits at its major European locations to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In the reporting year, audits took place at all five production locations in Germany. The resulting measures are designed to reduce the company's energy consumption. They include construction projects such as new buildings and renovations as well as energy-related measures such as insulation, the replacement of lighting systems with LEDs and the replacement of machinery and systems with low energy efficiency.\n\n# In 2023, KSB's German employees travelled almost 600,000 kilometres by train for their business trips.\n\nA new heating station was commissioned at the Group's largest location in Frankenthal in 2023. The 15-million-euro investment increases the share of renewable heat from biomass. In combination with the latest technology, this will yield energy savings of 3,700,000 kilowatt hours per year, equivalent to 900 tonnes of CO2.\n\nKSB wants to increase the proportion of renewable energy in its energy consumption. Aiming to reduce climate-damaging greenhouse gas emissions, the company obtains its electricity in many places from renewable sources. At the end of the reporting year, 13 Group companies were already using solar modules to generate electricity. Six Group companies in Argentina, Australia, China, Indonesia, Spain and the USA took this initiative in 2023.\n\nToday, many companies primarily use communication channels such as video conferencing and internet-based services for internal meetings and business contacts. KSB also makes the most of these facilities. When personal contact and business trips are necessary, employees opt for environmentally friendly transport wherever possible, such as the rail network of Deutsche Bahn, which uses 100 % green electricity in Germany. Based on Deutsche Bahn's environmental balance sheet, KSB was able to save more than 128 tonnes of CO2 in 2023 compared to journeys with conventional vehicles (previous year: more than 90 tonnes of CO2). In 2023, KSB's German employees travelled almost 600,000 kilometres by train for their business trips.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn terms of Group-wide electricity consumption, the share of renewable energies grew by 3.9 % to 54.3 % (KSB SE & Co. KGaA: +2.2 % to 82.1 %).\n\nKSB regularly records and evaluates data on energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In 2023, energy consumption increased by 8,756 megawatt hours year on year to 276,021 megawatt hours. Compared with 2022, KSB SE & Co. KGaA reduced its energy consumption by 7,859 kilowatt hours to 81,091 kilowatt hours.\n\nIn terms of Group-wide electricity consumption, the share of renewable energies grew by 3.9 % to 54.3 % (KSB SE & Co. KGaA: +2.2 % to 82.1 %). KSB calculates CO2 emissions for Scope 1 and Scope 2 in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (market-based). For the first time, KSB also took into account emissions from the company's own vehicle fleet amounting to 5,573 tonnes of CO2 for the Group. The Group's emissions in the reporting year thus totalled 83,546 tonnes of CO2 (KSB SE & Co. KGaA: 13,289 tonnes of CO2). KSB does not take the vehicle fleet emissions into account for its sustainability target for reducing emissions in the production plants. The respective values are 77,973 tonnes of CO2 (previous year: 79,673 tonnes of CO2) for the Group and 12,077 tonnes of CO2 (previous year: 14,574 tonnes of CO2) for KSB SE & Co. KGaA. \"Out of scope\" is the share of biomass that only relates to KSB SE & Co. KGaA; it amounted to 2,175 tonnes of CO2 in the reporting year.\n\nIn order to further reduce energy consumption, KSB appoints Energy Officers at its German locations. They can be contacted by all employees and advise their colleagues on potential energy savings during regular walks around the premises.\n\nThe vital task of protecting the environment can only be accomplished together. In the reporting year, the KSB Green Community was established, an employee initiative to promote sustainable behaviour within the company and implement ideas from the workforce. Around 202 people are engaged in this project.\n\nKSB is progressively modernising its production facilities to reduce the amount of hazardous substances used in the manufacturing processes. If environmental pollution is identified at a location, the company sets aside provisions to meet obligations for necessary remediation. Provisions totalling € 966,000 were recognised for KSB SE & Co. KGaA in its annual financial statements.\n\nToday, companies are paying more attention to the eco-balance of the products they buy. This also applies to pumps and valves that are used in many applications. In order to assess the environmental impact of products within the scope of new developments or significant design changes to existing type series in accordance with the ISO 14040 international standard, KSB has been using a suitable process to conduct life cycle assessments since 2020. By the end of 2023, this had been applied to 15 out of 22 newly developed products. The company thus assessed the environmental impact of more than two thirds of its development projects in accordance with the ISO 14040 international standard.\n\nIn the reporting year, the KSB Green Community was established, an employee initiative to promote sustainable behaviour within the company and implement ideas from the workforce.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2023, KSB increased the share of recycled aluminium and brass in a circulator pump to more than 90 % by selecting suitable suppliers.\n\nThe circular economy makes an important contribution to achieving economic growth despite increasingly scarce resources, ensuring that the materials and substances used in products are preserved for as long as possible. This approach to sustainable management protects the climate and reduces dependence on raw material imports. KSB therefore focuses on products with maximum durability that can be easily dismantled and broken down into separate material groups after use for comprehensive recycling. The company has adapted the product creation process for new developments accordingly. Each development is now analysed to determine the extent to which it is suitable for the circular economy. This process uses the material circularity indicator (MCI) to map the material flow's capacity for circularity. In 2022, KSB calculated this key indicator for five selected type series. The goal is to increase the current index value of the five series by a factor of 20 % by 2024. In the reporting year, the company increased the share of recycled aluminium and brass in a circulator pump to more than 90 % by selecting suitable suppliers. In the next step, KSB will determine the effects on the product's material circularity indicator.\n\n#### **Results:**\n\nKSB regularly records and evaluates data on energy consump-\n\nIn terms of Group-wide\n\ngrew by 3.9 % to 54.3 %\n\nelectricity consumption, the\n\nshare of renewable energies\n\n(KSB SE & Co.

This also applies to pumps and valves that are used in many applications. In order to assess the environmental impact of products within the scope of new developments or significant design changes to existing type series in accordance with the ISO 14040 international standard, KSB has been using a suitable process to conduct life cycle assessments since 2020. By the end of 2023, this had been applied to 15 out of 22 newly developed products. The company thus assessed the environmental impact of more than two thirds of its development projects in accordance with the ISO 14040\n\nIn the reporting year, the\n\nestablished, an employee\n\nideas from the workforce.\n\ninitiative to promote\n\nKSB Green Community was\n\nsustainable behaviour within\n\nthe company and implement\n\n).

The company's solutions enable its customers to operate their systems efficiently and responsibly. KSB strives to maximise its range of products offering many years of operation characterised by reliability and low energy consumption.\n\nBy 2025, KSB aims to reduce the CO2 emissions generated through the operation of its water pumps by 850,000 tonnes per year in Europe alone by using variable speed drives.\n\n#### **Organisation, processes and measures:**\n\nTo assess how much carbon dioxide KSB water pumps save during operation, Product Management determines the number of these pump sets in use based on the production volume since 2009, and calculates their average annual energy consumption. This estimate assumes 7,000 operating hours and a typical load profile for these applications as well as the average CO2 equivalent for Europe of 333 g/kWh according to the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) for 2020 for the European Union electricity mix. As shown in the Energy Efficiency with Electric Drives study published in 2017 by the German Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association (ZVEI), demand-oriented operation via the use of variable speed drives and high-efficiency motors allows energy savings averaging 30 % compared with conventional fixed-speed pump systems. The savings achieved with KSB standardised water pumps are often even higher than 30 %. The calculation will be continued.\n\nWith many countries seeing increased expansion of renewable energies and a renaissance in nuclear power, the electricity mix has changed considerably. The Sustainability Committee therefore agreed in 2022 to consider not only the current average CO2 equivalent (see above), but also the corresponding value from 2018 when determining CO2 emissions. The figure for 2018 was 590 g/kWh. This means that KSB water pumps are estimated to have saved over 459,000 tonnes of CO2 in 2023 (compared with the 2020 CO2 equivalent) or more than 810,000 tonnes (compared with the 2018 CO2 equivalent) thanks to their variable speed drives.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\nBased on a high-pressure pump that has been tried and tested for decades, KSB developed a new variant specifically for use in biomass power plants that was launched on the market in 2023.\n\nWhen developing new products, KSB focuses holistically on sustainability – from production to recycling the raw materials required. This was systematically implemented for the first time in a fully integrated in-line water pump for use in building services that was launched on the market in 2022. Thanks to reductions in size and weight compared with the previous type series, the product requires fewer raw materials such as aluminium, copper and steel; the manufacturing process of the pump thus generates 43 % less carbon dioxide (using the example of a pump for Q 100 % = 19.4 m<sup>3</sup>/h and H 100 %). KSB offsets the unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions generated in production of the first type series by purchasing certificates in accordance with the Verified Carbon Standard. In operation, control modes make for high levels of energy efficiency. A modular design allows for the straightforward, mono-material dismantling and recycling of individual parts at the end of the pump's service life. In the reporting year, the company increased the number of countries where this innovation has been released for sale by 15 to a total of 24 (previous year: 9).\n\nRenewable energies make an important contribution to climate change mitigation. KSB offers its customers worldwide high-quality solutions for this field of application in order to enable the economic and efficient use of renewable sources of energy for power generation. For example, based on a high-pressure pump that has been tried and tested for decades, KSB developed a new variant specifically for use in biomass power plants that was launched on the market in 2023.\n\nKSB attaches great importance to the role of product quality and safety in preventing accidents and environmental pollution. In production, the company complies with recognised standards such as CE and a well-established quality management system in accordance with the ISO 9001 international standard. This allows processes to be designed such that systematic errors during product manufacturing can be avoided. In addition, the company's own Made by KSB<sup>1</sup> certification available at eleven locations designates a level of quality which exceeds the requirements of the international standard for quality management. The certification stands for quality, short delivery times, professional service and efficient manufacturing processes. In 2023, two locations in India and South Africa completed the first audit as part of their initial certification process. Following a successful second audit in the current reporting year, these two locations will receive the Made by KSB certification.\n\n#### **Results:**\n\n- KSB water pumps are estimated to have saved over 459,000 tonnes of CO2 in 2023 (compared with the 2020 CO2 equivalent) or more than 810,000 tonnes (compared with the 2018 CO2 equivalent) thanks to their variable speed drives.\n- 122 KSB locations are certified to the ISO 9001:2015 quality management standard to ensure the reliability and safety of the products.\n\n#### **Compliance**\n\n#### **Objectives:**\n\nFor KSB, lawful conduct is an important and indispensable part of corporate social responsibility.

It ensures compliance with legal provisions and internal regulations, thereby safeguarding the economic success of the company in the long term. The compliance system is designed to ensure that KSB and its employees always act in line with applicable laws and directives.\n\nGroup Management is responsible for organising compliance and is monitored by the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee. A Group Compliance Officer is responsible for compliance management and reports to Group Management on relevant topics every six months. Support is provided by a Group Compliance Committee, consisting of top-level managers from the company.\n\nKSB's Compliance Manual describes structures and processes designed to ensure compliant conduct, and specifies responsibilities and instruments.\n\nA core element of the compliance system is the KSB Code of Conduct, which applies across the entire Group. It was revised to meet the requirements of the *Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz* [German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act] and published in the 2023 financial year. The Code of Conduct defines the key legal and business policy principles, providing employees with guidance for their actions. The Code also sets forth the corporate values which govern conduct in day-to-day work: honesty,\n\nresponsibility, professionalism, trust and appreciation. On this basis, KSB has formulated and communicated specific principles and rules of conduct.\n\nIn order to avoid risks resulting from a loss of reputation and legal repercussions, KSB issued two binding corporate directives, one covering compliance with cartel / anti-trust law and one dealing with the prevention of corruption. Both of these directives help to prevent potential violations. Employees receive corresponding training in recognising potential risks and practical guidance to ensure proper conduct.\n\nIn the event that employees become aware of violations or are unsure whether their actions are compliant, they refer the matter to the compliance organisation, and specifically to the designated Compliance Officer. If necessary, reports will be treated anonymously. In addition, any circumstances that give rise to legal or anti-trust concerns can be reported by any stakeholder directly to an independent ombudsperson, who can process potential cases without naming informants. Plausible evidence indicating infringements is investigated.\n\nKSB does not tolerate any violations of compliance by its employees. If investigations reveal sufficient evidence of a violation, this will have consequences for the individual concerned. Depending on the severity, sanctions range from a disciplinary warning to immediate termination of employment and law enforcement agencies may also be involved.\n\n#### **Results:**\n\n- 2023 saw 2,500 employees across the Group successfully complete the compliance training e-learning modules launched in 2022.\n- Reports of suspected compliance violations submitted via the ombudsperson and the compliance organisation triggered a clearly defined three-stage procedure in each case to clarify the facts and initiate the necessary measures.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management Rep\n\n## **Human Rights / Sustainability in the Supply Chain**\n\n#### **Objectives:**\n\nKSB respects and protects human rights. The company recognises the obligations this entails – internally and along the entire value creation chain. It is KSB's declared goal to prevent all forms of discrimination on the basis of individual characteristics such as age, origin, religion, appearance, gender, sexual orientation, disability or marital status. KSB does not tolerate discrimination, harassment or reprisals of any kind in the work environment.\n\nThe company also refuses to accept human rights violations by its suppliers. KSB therefore aims to assess 90 % of its global and regional key suppliers in terms of their sustainability performance by 2025. This will focus on, but not be limited to, their safeguarding of human rights.\n\n#### **Organisation, processes and measures:**\n\nBy signing the UN Global Compact, KSB has undertaken to protect and respect international human rights. The company also complies with the conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). All KSB companies respect the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.

In this context, it must be taken into account that compared with the previous year the company adjusted the calculation method in the reporting year in order to assess only the most important main suppliers. The changes resulted in positive effects on the progress towards goal achievement.\n\nKSB derives suitable measures from the self-disclosures requested from its suppliers via questionnaires. These include careful examination of how the issues are handled and monitoring of improvement measures taken.\n\nKSB's employees can contact the compliance organisation or an ombudsperson regarding human rights issues, following the same procedure as for suspected compliance violations (see page 35). The Human Rights Officer is available as an additional contact person.\n\n#### **Results:**\n\n- An online training course raises participants' awareness of human rights issues in the supply chain. In the reporting year, 56 employees participated. Since 2021, a total of 372 participants across the Group have completed this training.\n- By the end of the reporting year, KSB had assessed the sustainability performance of 67 % of its key global suppliers. This also includes the actions of business partners regarding human rights.\n\n#### **Employees**\n\n#### **GLOBAL COMMITMENT**\n\n#### **Objectives:**\n\nHigh-performing and motivated staff are the basis for a company's economic success. At KSB, more than 16,000 people work in a variety of ways around the globe to meet customers' needs in the best way possible. This is most effectively achieved with satisfied and committed employees. KSB is therefore striving to sustainably increase its engagement score, which measures employee satisfaction.\n\nDiversity and open-mindedness are key components of a productive corporate culture. KSB celebrates the diversity of its workforce, because diverse teams contribute the greatest range of different perspectives to the company's success. As a mechanical engineering company with a traditionally low quota of women, KSB is seeking to develop the potential of its female employees in particular. The goal is to increase the proportion of women in management positions to at least 20 % by 2025 (2023: 14 %).\n\nAs KSB's success is largely dependent on qualified personnel, the company attaches great importance to targeted training and development. Increasing digitalisation requires continuous learning in order to remain economically successful in the future. By 2025, the company aims to increase the number of training hours per employee per year to 30 hours; in the reporting year this figure was 21 hours. The industry average determined by VDMA [German Mechanical Engineering Industry Association] is 16.8 hours (source: Business Advisory 2021).\n\n#### **Organisation, processes and measures:**\n\nOverall responsibility for human resources issues at KSB lies with the head of Human Resources, who reports on topics including non-financial issues directly to the CEO and coordinates Group-wide HR issues. Individual locations' human resources departments look after their local managers and employees.\n\nWhen recruiting future employees, the company uses several channels. In addition to traditional job advertisements, contact with potential applicants is also established via online social networks and platforms as well as recruitment fairs. KSB also maintains cooperations with universities and schools to establish contact with potential candidates. Furthermore, KSB uses an employee recommendation programme to recruit suitable personnel.\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\nKSB increased the number of vocational training positions in Germany by more than 20 % at the annual start of training in 2023.\n\nIn order to ensure demand for skilled staff is met in the long term, KSB continuously trains young people. The company increased the number of vocational training positions in Germany by more than 20 % at the annual start of training in the reporting year. Junior employees at KSB have the opportunity to complete part of their training at subsidiaries abroad. This improves their capacity for international cooperation and offers valuable experience gained in a different environment. At the end of 2023, 268 trainees and students in dual work/ degree programmes were preparing for professional life at KSB's German locations. In 2023, KSB spent € 9,256,000 on vocational training programmes (2022: € 8,207,000).\n\nKSB continuously develops the skills and knowledge of its employees to prepare them for specialist and management positions. The company has developed a three-stage approach for this purpose. It distinguishes between Group-wide, departmental and individual professional training measures. Individual training requirements are mutually agreed between managers and employees at annual performance evaluation interviews. Qualification measures cover engineering, business administration, information technology, social competence, communication and leadership.\n\nDeveloping employees and preparing them for future challenges are core elements of People Development at KSB. The concept is aimed at encouraging the exchange of thoughts and ideas with employees and continuously discussing prospects within the company. Through this initiative, KSB strives to create motivating development opportunities for its employees and staff positions in the best way possible.\n\nIn order to inform employees about available training, KSB intensified its communication about training opportunities. These include training modules, courses, workshops and time for free self-study and knowledge exchange between staff. An additional e-learning course for managers raises awareness of the training opportunities. In 2023, employees invested an average of 21 hours (KSB SE & Co. KGaA: 21 hours) into professional development activities (previous year: 17 hours; KSB SE & Co. KGaA: 13 hours).\n\nA one-year fellowship programme focusing on the digital transformation provides employees with current information, background knowledge and explanations about the most important topics of digitalisation.\n\nKSB's internal distance learning programme for interested engineers and technicians, which has been in place for more than ten years, offers participants with relevant experience an opportunity to become experts in the field of pump applications. KSB has been offering the internal professional development opportunity since 2021 as an external distance learning course in cooperation with the technical universities in Berlin and Graz.\n\nIn 2023, employees invested an average of 21 hours (KSB SE & Co. KGaA: 21 hours) into professional development activities (previous year: 17 hours; KSB SE & Co. KGaA: 13 hours).\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n# In the reporting year, KSB's Global Learning Center offered 1,888 different training courses.\n\nA Group-wide HR tool automates and standardises the personnel processes of all KSB Group companies. In the reporting year, KSB added additional functions to this system. Employees now log their absences such as holiday and flexitime via this platform, eliminating the need for paper-based forms. Further functions for recruitment and People Development were added in 2023 with the aim of filling vacancies even faster. Managers also use the web-based application to promote training for their team members. In addition, all users can update information on their knowledge and skills in their personal profile. This increases the visibility of knowledge available in the company.\n\nIn order to ensure demand for skilled staff is met in the long term, KSB continuously trains young people. The company increased the number of vocational training positions in Germany by more than 20 % at the annual start of training in the reporting year. Junior employees at KSB have the opportunity to complete part of their training at subsidiaries abroad. This improves their capacity for international cooperation and offers valuable experience gained in a different environment. At the end of 2023, 268 trainees and students in dual work/ degree programmes were preparing for professional life at KSB's German locations. In 2023, KSB spent € 9,256,000 on vocational train-\n\nKSB increased the number of\n\n**38 Management and Issues 2023** Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements General Information\n\nvocational training positions\n\nin Germany by more than\n\ntraining in 2023.\n\n20 % at the annual start of\n\nIn order to inform employees about available training, KSB intensified its communication about training opportunities. These include training modules, courses, workshops and time for free self-study and knowledge exchange between staff. An additional e-learning course for managers raises awareness of the training opportunities. In 2023, employees invested an average of 21 hours (KSB SE & Co.

Through this initiative, KSB strives to create motivating development opportunities for its employees and\n\ning programmes (2022: € 8,207,000).\n\nstaff positions in the best way possible.\n\ncation and leadership.\n\nKSB Group / Annual Report 2023\n\nBesides conventional classroom training, KSB employees mainly acquire new knowledge through e-learning and online training. In the reporting year, KSB's Global Learning Center offered 1,888 different training courses. More than 15,300 users from 71 countries had access to the company's own internet-based learning platform, marking a further increase in the reach of this online training facility. In addition, the company's Market Areas have introduced their own academies to impart specific expertise via virtual training courses.\n\nEqual opportunities and diversity are viewed as key factors for innovation and sustainable economic growth. KSB's binding human resources principles align with the Conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and apply to all Group companies. The company selects candidates for positions exclusively on the basis of necessary professional requirements and the individual performance and potential of the applicant. Clear responsibilities were defined to support this process. Management works to ensure that the principles of equal opportunities and diversity are realised in company practice. Human Resources communicates these principles within\n\nthe Group and adapts them where required. HR also fosters an awareness of this important topic and offers corresponding training and advice.\n\nKSB focuses on equal opportunities when filling management positions. In 2023, the proportion of female managers in the Group was 14 % (KSB SE & Co. KGaA: 11 %), a decrease of 1 percentage point year on year. Women make up 16 % of the total workforce (KSB SE & Co. KGaA: 20 %). At KSB, this key indicator refers to management positions with at least one direct report.\n\nCommitted female employees from different departments and locations maintain a global women's network to promote gender diversity at KSB. Its aims include establishing a framework for strengthening internal networking among women within the company and creating a space for their professional interaction and further development. The establishment of two regional communities in North America and the Middle East / Africa began in the reporting year. As at 31 December 2023, the network had 228 employees from 24 countries worldwide.\n\nSpecial training and development programmes provide female employees with greater clarity about their career opportunities\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, 228 employees from 24 countries worldwide had joined KSB's women's network.\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\nand prepare them for their future career path. In addition, KSB is increasingly seeking to appoint women to management positions if applicants are equally qualified. Human Resources and Management make concerted efforts to approach potential female candidates, make them aware of their prospects and encourage them to take advantage of opportunities.\n\nIn order to achieve a more balanced mix of men and women in management, KSB implemented several measures in the reporting year. Once again, these included local and global events for promising candidates attended by members of Management. This supports KSB's efforts to ensure that talented women and men are seen and heard within the company.\n\nKSB provides its employees with mobile working options, including working from home. This can help facilitate a balance between family and work commitments. Under the Group works agreement on mobile working, up to 40 % of individual working hours can be spent away from company premises. In addition, many employees have access to flexible working time models, allowing them to care for their family members for example.\n\nEmployees who enjoy their work achieve more. KSB therefore attaches great importance to ensuring committed and satisfied employees who are passionate about making a contribution to the company's success. As an attractive employer, KSB strives to create a motivating working environment in which employees can perform to the best of their ability. KSB regularly analyses employee satisfaction. The company had previously conducted a Group-wide employee survey every three years. In the reporting year, Management decided to reduce the time until the next survey to two years. The engagement index, which measures an employee's emotional attachment to work and the workplace, will therefore be analysed again in 2024. In 2022, the figure was 65 % (2019: 57 %).\n\nThe global employee engagement survey in 2022 provided valuable information on potential for improvement to further improve satisfaction. Following the results, the CEO and the Chief Engagement Officer discussed the local insights with more than 70 Managing Directors of Group companies and Regional Executive Officers around the world in the reporting year. Based on the findings, numerous measures were agreed at country and departmental level to increase engagement. In 2023, a total of 50 short surveys, known as KSB Pulse surveys, were also conducted in individual countries and Regions to obtain feedback from employees on current and strategic topics. This active feedback culture reflects how employees and their opinions are valued and appreciated.\n\nMeasures to promote employee engagement were once again undertaken in all companies in 2023, for example joint team events. Local Managing Directors reported regularly to KSB Group Management on their implementation and further planned measures, including during personal meetings, joint appointments and in conversation via e-mail and video calls. Furthermore, a global network of Engagement Ambassadors ensures that defined measures are followed through and their successful implementation is publicised in all KSB Regions.\n\n#### **Results:**\n\n The number of completed training courses recorded via the company's own online learning platform increased to 42,469 in 2023 as a result of intensified communication measures (2022: 29,830). This corresponds to an increase of over 42 %. A total of 11,675 (2022: 7,533) employees participated in the training courses, which is over 54 % more than in the previous year.\n\n#### **OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY**\n\n#### **Objectives:**\n\nEmployee health and safety are top priorities for KSB. The company's goal is to protect staff from risks at work and to keep the number of occupational accidents as low as possible. By 2025, KSB aims to permanently reduce the number of working days lost due to occupational accidents to fewer than 0.3 days per employee. In addition, the company offers employees a range of health-focused services.\n\n#### **Organisation, processes and measures:**\n\nAt the beginning of the reporting year, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a limited local impact on KSB in certain individual locations and Regions.

All measures and rules adopted during the pandemic were discontinued.\n\nThe focus of accident prevention in everyday work at KSB is in the production areas due to their increased risk. Appropriate training, instruction and other preventive measures are implemented regularly. In the reporting year, 39 production and assembly sites (including all factories of KSB SE & Co. KGaA) were certified to the ISO 45001 international occupational health and safety standard. This represents 93 % of the company's locations.\n\nTo reduce the number of occupational accidents, KSB introduced the global Vision Zero concept from the International Social Security Association (ISSA) in its production departments. This aims to increase involvement of management staff so as to raise awareness of improved occupational health and safety. Managers learn about suitable measures that they can apply individually to their production facilities.\n\nIn 2023, more than 70 production managers at KSB focused intensively on occupational health and safety at the global manufacturing conference in Brazil. At the event, the participants defined their most important topics in this area according to the rules set out in the Vision Zero concept. The focus was on aspects with the highest potential for improvement at the respective locations. After the conference, the production managers were tasked with deriving measures and implementing them in their area of responsibility. Integrated Management will support the global locations in this process and verify the results in the current reporting year. The aim is to establish a sustainable safety culture within the company.\n\nKSB maintains an active occupational health management system with a holistic approach. As well as fulfilling the company's legal occupational health and safety obligations, this framework enables KSB to provide voluntary health-focused services. These include ongoing health initiatives such as vaccinations, support for giving up smoking, preventive health care courses and confidential psychosocial counselling from the company's Health Management department. The implementation of the company's return-to-work programme makes a significant contribution to promoting health in the workplace and restoring employees' ability to work. Addiction prevention services are provided by KSB's Health Management and local addiction support teams.\n\nThe mental health of employees is becoming a key focus of many companies. A positive state of well-being is essential for actively participating in private and professional life and for dealing appropriately with challenging situations. In 2023, KSB expanded an initiative to strengthen the mental health of its workforce. The campaign supported employees and managers in maintaining their health and well-being. The measures aimed to raise awareness and acceptance of mental stresses and jointly develop solutions. Multiple workshops, information events and participative activities were held at various locations.\n\nEmployees who spend most of their working time sitting benefit from an Internet-based health programme that includes exercises to prevent back problems. In the reporting year, KSB added mindfulness exercises to the programme that provide tips on how to confidently deal with stressful phases in daily working life in a relaxed manner.\n\nIn 2023, the focus of KSB's prevention services was on skin health. Employees were invited to participate in preventive examinations, informative presentations and activities.\n\nThe focus of prevention services for employees was on skin health.\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nCycling keeps you fit, saves energy and reduces your personal carbon footprint. Since the middle of the reporting year, KSB has been offering its German employees a cycle-to-work bike leasing scheme to promote healthy mobility. Interest among staff was huge: by the end of 2023, 577 employees had taken up the offer. KSB also supported participation in the annual city cycling event. Over 240 employees from various locations took part in the Germany-wide competition.\n\nJoint sports activities not only strengthen team spirit among employees, but also their health. KSB therefore encourages company sports, participation in sports events and organises sports events at its locations.\n\n#### **Results:**\n\n- The company medical service in Germany organised a total of 897 vaccinations in the reporting year. The majority of these were vaccinations against influenza (555) and shingles (126). 53 employees were also vaccinated against COVID-19.\n- The company's Health Management department in Germany provided counselling sessions in 2023, primarily in connection with mental stress and dealing with crises.\n- The number of accident-related days lost per employee and year in 2023 was slightly higher than in the previous year at 0.36 (lost time accident rate).\n- As part of the reporting year's initiative focusing on skin health in Germany, 433 employees took up the offer of skin cancer screening.\n\n#### **Society**\n\n#### **Objectives:**\n\nKSB seeks to make an active contribution to society through its commitment to social initiatives. This includes financial contributions to organisations engaged in social projects. With its charitable commitments, KSB seeks to contribute to the development of the common good. By 2025, the company intends to support at least 25 social projects every year. KSB defines a project as an undertaking fulfilling at least three of the following five criteria:\n\n- Humanitarian aid benefiting third parties\n- Support for education (child, youth and adult education)\n- Project-related support of more than € 5,000\n- Personal engagement of KSB employees\n- Long-term or permanent aid (e.g. in the field of ecology)\n\nSocial activities that meet fewer than three of the above criteria are classified by the company as social initiatives.\n\n#### **Organisation, processes and measures:**\n\nKSB's binding Donation Directive sets out for which purposes and under which conditions the company may make financial or material commitments. In this context, the focus is on supporting organisations, projects and measures dedicated to the education, social support and protection of children and young people. The company is also committed to helping the disadvantaged. In the event of disasters it provides assistance to both people and organisations. In the reporting year, KSB expanded the potential group of recipients to include organisations and projects that promote local sports and are committed to sustainability and environmental protection.\n\nThe education of young people is one of the most important issues for the future. KSB therefore once again supported relevant projects worldwide in 2023. This not only took the form of direct financial aid, but also imparting knowledge to teachers or representatives of state institutions. Furthermore, the company is committed to helping people in need in order to improve their living conditions. For example, KSB donated\n\nIn the reporting year, KSB expanded the potential group of donation recipients to include organisations and projects that promote local sports and are committed to sustainability and environmental protection.\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-60-0\"></span>**Combined Management Report**\n\n- 62 [Basic Principles of the Group](#page-61-0)\n- 62 Group Business Model\n- 64 [Control System](#page-63-0)\n- 65 [Research and Development](#page-64-0)\n- 67 Economic Review\n\nKSB Group / Annual Report 2022\n\n2023**60** 2023\n\nManagement and Issues 2022 **Combined Management Report** Consolidated Financial Statements General Information\n\n- [67 Macroeconomic Environment and Sector View](#page-66-0)\n- 69 [Business Development and Results of Operations](#page-68-0)\n- 74 [Financial Position and Net Assets](#page-73-0)\n- [79 Summary of the Performance in the Financial Year](#page-78-0)\n- 80 [Report on Expected Developments](#page-79-0)\n- 82 [Opportunities and Risks Report](#page-81-0)\n- 90 [Disclosures Relating to KSB SE & Co.

The responsibilities of sustainable corporate development.\n\nThe KSB Group organises its business activities in the following Segments: Pumps, Valves and KSB SupremeServ.\n\nThe Pumps Segment comprises new business with single-stage and multistage pumps, submersible pumps and the associated control and drive systems. The applications are assigned to the Market Areas of Energy and Mining and to the Market Areas of Water, Building Services, Petrochemicals / Chemicals and General Industry, which are grouped together in the organisational and reporting structure of the Group as Standard Markets.\n\nThe Valves Segment combines the Group's business activities with regard to new business in butterfly valves, globe valves, gate valves, control valves, diaphragm valves and ball valves. as well as associated actuators and control systems. The basic applications for these products are identical to those for pumps.\n\nThe KSB SupremeServ Segment on the one hand comprises the spare parts business for pumps and valves. On the other hand, KSB's service activities are allocated to this Segment. These include the installation, commissioning, inspection, servicing, maintenance, reverse engineering and repair of pumps, related systems and valves, as well as modular service concepts and system analyses for complete plants.\n\n**1** \n\nManaging the Group using this new structure is aimed in particular at strategically strengthening the individual divisions and leveraging market potential. This primarily relates to the business activities of the KSB SupremeServ Segment. In addition, KSB is using its organisational and segment structure to focus on market-specific and customer-specific applications in the solutions it offers. For the Pumps Segment, this is ensured by considering individual Market Areas separately for internal control purposes.\n\nIn addition to the segment information, this management report contains supplementary quantitative explanations on the Group's performance at the reporting regions level.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n**3** \n\n#### <span id=\"page-63-0\"></span>**MARKETS AND LOCATIONS**\n\nIn the KSB Group, sales revenue is generated mainly from goods and services relating to centrifugal pumps. These pumps, as well as valves, are sold to engineering contractors, OEMs and end users or, in some cases, distributed via dealers. The same applies to control and monitoring systems, and to package units with pumps and valves.\n\nThe largest and best developed sales market for these products is Europe, where KSB operates its main manufacturing facilities in Germany and France. The main plant of the present KSB SE & Co. KGaA in Frankenthal is its largest in Europe, ahead of the production sites in Pegnitz (Bavaria) and Halle (Saxony-Anhalt) in Germany, and La Roche-Chalais in France.\n\nThe second-largest market for KSB products is the Region Asia / Pacific, followed by the Region Americas and the Region Middle East / Africa / Russia. Outside Europe, KSB's biggest production sites are in Brazil, China, India and the USA.\n\nKSB manufactures and assembles products and components in a total of 25 countries; they are sold through the Group's own companies or agencies in more than 100 countries. With their products, the Group companies serve customers in industry including the chemical and petrochemical industries, in the energy sector, in construction / building services, in water and waste water management, and in mining. In 2023, the most important markets were general industry, energy and water.\n\nAs the largest company in the KSB Group, KSB SE & Co.

Initially, additive manufacturing technology was used to produce commonly available components using the laser fusion process. Today, design engineers are employing this method to create completely new technical solutions. Containment shrouds produced using additive manufacturing are a particularly impressive example. By using this production method, disadvantages such as heating and eddy current losses in these complex components can be avoided, while significantly increasing the level of safety. The lower temperature rise and eddy current losses allow the pumps to be operated while consuming considerably less energy. turing technology was used to produce commonly available components using the laser fusion process.

In the course of the year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), whose figures are used for planning, increased its estimate only slightly to 3.1 %. This compares with the forecast of 2.9 % for global economic growth at the start of the year. Factors for lower growth included the longterm consequences of the pandemic, the effects of the war in Ukraine and the growing geopolitical fragmentation. In addition and especially in the past year, the restrictive monetary policy that is aimed at reducing inflation was a drag on growth. Inflation worldwide eased to 6.8 % but was still above the expectation of 6.6 % at the start of the year.\n\nThe IMF raised its growth estimate slightly for the group of economically advanced countries to 1.6 % in 2023. At the beginning of the year the forecast was still at 1.2 %. Economic growth in the emerging markets and developing countries was 4.1 %, which slightly exceeded the forecast at the start of the year (+ 4.0 %).\n\nEurope continued to be of major importance for the KSB business in 2023. In what is KSB's largest market, the global energy crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine and the associated price increases had the greatest impact and curbed economic growth, which was 0.5 % in the euro zone. Economic output in France and Italy grew by 0.8 % and 0.7 % respectively. Spain achieved a higher growth rate of 2.4 % compared with other European countries, reflecting its lower dependence on imports of natural gas from Russia. In contrast, the economy in Germany contracted by - 0.3 %. The high share of exports coupled with weaker growth in demand globally, falling production in energy-intensive industries and the weakening of capital-intensive and interest rate-sensitive sectors contributed to this development. The UK reported lower growth of 0.5 % in view of higher key interest rates and high energy costs.\n\nEconomic growth of 2.5 % in the USA was significantly higher than the expectations of 1.4 % at the start of the year. This was supported by higher capital expenditure and robust growth in consumer spending.\n\n**5** \n\n**World market of centrifugal pumps and valves**\n\nImage /page/66/Figure/8 description: The image is a pie chart showing the distribution of something across different regions. Asia/Pacific accounts for 41%, Americas accounts for 25%, Middle East/Africa/Russia accounts for 15%, and Europe accounts for 19%.\n\nSource: KSB estimate (February 2024)\n\nChina's economy recovered only moderately after the pandemic and grew by 5.2 %. Nevertheless, growth, which was slowed by the property market crisis, a high level of youth unemployment and weaker exports in some sectors, met expectations at the beginning of the year.\n\nSupported by higher consumer spending, growth in India of 6.7 % was higher than expected at the start of the year. The economies of the five economically most important countries in South East Asia – Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam – grew by 4.2 % overall, which was only marginally lower than start-of-the-year expectations.\n\nGrowth expectations at the beginning of the year for South America could not be met on average. Chile's economy declined by - 0.5 %, with a significant decrease reported in private consumer spending and investment. Thanks to the good harvest and recovery in the services sector, economic output of 3.1 % in Brazil exceeded expectations at the start of the year.\n\nEconomic developments in the countries in the Region Middle East / Africa / Russia remained below expectations at the beginning of the year. In Turkey, the economy grew more than expected by 4.0 %, bolstered by robust private consumer spending. Power cuts and weaker exports led to a decline in growth to 0.6 % in South Africa. For Saudi Arabia, likewise a large sales market for KSB, the IMF reported a decline of – 1.1 % as a result of falling crude oil prices and production. This was significantly lower than expected at the start of the year.\n\nEven though KSB Guard is primarily aimed at monitoring pumps, steps must also be taken to ensure that the sensor unit itself works reliably.

The chemical industry also record\n\n#### **MODEST GROWTH IN ALL SALES MARKETS**\n\nAll markets and regions in which KSB operates reported modest year-on-year growth.\n\nIn general industry, which covers a series of cyclical sectors in the manufacturing industry, production and investment rose in the past year. The production of capital goods was curbed by inflation and higher interest rates, but increased nonetheless. The pharmaceutical industry, which was one of the winners of the pandemic, were unable to reach the high growth rates of previous years. Given the weaker previous year and existing orders on hand, the automotive industry performed above expectations at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe water and waste water industry, in which economic fluctuations are more moderate than in other economic sectors, posted modest growth in terms of production value. This was dampened by the weaker development in industry as well as the rise in costs in this sector. Investment in municipal water and waste water management was driven by digitalisation and the use of artificial intelligence, as well as by requirements to expand the use of waste water.\n\nThe war in Ukraine and its impact on energy prices affected the energy industry again last year. Global production increased only slightly, given lower economic growth and lower demand especially from Europe and the USA. Electrification in the transport sector and for building heat experienced a strong boost. Investments in expanding storage technologies also increased. The increase in new capacities for generating renewable energies accelerated strongly. Coal-fired electricity generation increased, including as a substitute to hydropower and led by Asia, in particular China and India. Electricity generation from natural gas increased only slightly. In contrast, electricity generation from nuclear energy rose again following the decline in the previous year. Investment in nuclear energy continued to rise worldwide. New nuclear power plants were commissioned in China and the USA, among other countries, and construction work started on others in the past year.\n\nGlobal oil production rose somewhat more strongly than expected at the beginning of the year, supported by stronger demand from China. Gas production worldwide was down slightly from the previous year's level, as the structural changes since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine continued. Production in Russia continued to fall. This was offset by the USA, the Middle East and Asia. Liquefied gas exports from the USA increased once again. Worldwide refinery capacity utilisation increased marginally, albeit with major regional differences. While production rose in Asia and in particular China and in the Middle East, it stagnated in North America and declined in Europe. The chemical industry also recorded weak growth worldwide in response to weaker demand from key sectors. China proved to be a material regional driver, while the chemical industry in Europe declined once again due to high energy and raw material costs.\n\nDespite lower expectations at the start of the year, the construction industry was able to grow at a higher rate year on year. This development was supported by stimulus spending on expanding infrastructure in many countries. Despite lower real income and higher interest rates, residential building construction increased. However, momentum was lower than in other sectors. Growth was also reported in nonresidential construction. Clear regional differences were evident in the development of the two sectors.\n\nMining continued to be supported by strong demand for metals that are required for producing green technologies. There was a significant increase in the demand for metals required for electromobility, renewable energy generation and grid expansion, and for the production of storage technologies. These include copper, aluminium, nickel and lithium. The strong growth in demand was partially reflected in a sharp increase in the extraction of these metals. The demand and global trade in iron continued to grow, too, supported by high demand from China. Coal mining also expanded, driven by Asia, particularly with a strong increase in production in India. The extraction of oil sands was marginally higher than in the previous year. The growth momentum of investment in mining slackened on the back of higher interest rates and inflation.\n\n#### **MECHANICAL ENGINEERING STAGNATED**\n\nThe slowdown in investment led to below-average demand for mechanical engineering products. According to the German Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA), global sales revenue in the mechanical engineering sector stagnated in real terms in 2023, albeit with significant regional differences. While Asian countries achieved considerable growth, sales revenue in Europe and North America declined.\n\nAccording to VDMA, sales revenue in the German mechanical engineering sector fell by – 0.1 % in real terms. Based on the provisional calculations of the German Federal Statistical Office, production up to November rose very slightly by 0.1 % in real terms. Capacity utilisation was down on the previous year.\n\nIn the liquid pumps sector, VDMA recorded real sales revenue growth of 0.3 % among German pump manufacturers. Sales revenue with industrial valves was down – 5.8 % on the previous year, while building services valves saw sales revenue fall by – 13.9 %.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\nworldwide in response to weaker demand from key sectors.

The chemical industry also recorded weak growth\n\n## <span id=\"page-68-0\"></span>**Business Development and Results of Operations**\n\nThe 2023 financial year was defined by global political tensions due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, the China-Taiwan conflict and the outbreak of war in the Gaza region as a result of the attack on Israel. High interest rates led to uncertainty and a decrease in investment. In Germany, the manufacturing industry continued to be challenged by higher gas prices. At the same time, the situation on the procurement markets eased somewhat with regard to price and availability of bought-in parts.\n\nThanks to the company's broad global positioning across several market areas, economic downturns were offset by positive developments. The KSB SupremeServ Segment made a significant contribution to order intake growth.\n\nOverall, there was a substantial increase in sales revenue and EBIT compared with the previous year. Despite signs of a slowdown in demand in the Standard Markets in the second half of the year, mainly in Europe, total order intake was considerably higher than in the previous year. The reasons for the changes are explained in the sections on order intake, sales revenue and EBIT.\n\n#### **ORDER INTAKE**\n\nThe volume of incoming orders rose significantly by € 97.4 million (+ 3.4 %) to € 2,959.5 million in the financial year. The order intake would have been € 83.4 million higher excluding exchange rate effects (excluding the hyperinflationary economies of Argentina and Turkey). This increase is mainly attributable to the positive development of order intake in the KSB SupremeServ Segment.\n\nThe largest percentage growth was reported in the Region Americas with a plus of € 62.0 million (+ 12.0 %) and the Region Asia / Pacific with a plus of € 38.2 million (+ 5.1 %). Order intake in the Region Europe remained at the previous year's level with plus € 8.0 million (+ 0.6 %). On the other hand, the companies in the Region Middle East / Africa / Russia reported a decline of € 10.9 million (– 6.5 %). The marked reduction was largely due to unfavourable exchange rate effects.\n\n#### **Pumps**\n\nOrder intake in the Pumps Segment amounted to € 1,576.5 million compared with € 1,585.7 million in the previous year. The order intake in this Segment is therefore marginally lower than in the prior-year period, which had been impacted positively by several major orders. The Standard Markets accounted for € 1,263.9 million (previous year: € 1,256.3 million) of the total order intake in the Pumps Segment. Order intake in the Water Market Area declined due to a major order in the previous year that was not matched by comparable order intake in the reporting year. Despite the economic slowdown, which led to a weaker second half of the year, increases were achieved in all other Standard Markets. Significant growth was recorded in General Industry in particular, due to the positive development in the Region Asia / Pacific as a result of the relocation of production by many companies from China to India, among other things. In the Energy and Mining operating segments, which include project business in particular, order intake amounted to € 312.6 million (previous year: € 329.5 million). The Mining operating segment recorded substantial growth, thanks to several major orders and positive development of order intake in Brazil. In contrast, order intake in the Energy operating segment declined sharply, because the prior-year figure included two important major orders.\n\n#### **Segment reporting**\n\n**7** \n\n| € thousands             | Order intake |           | Sales revenue |           | EBIT    |         |\n|-------------------------|--------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|---------|---------|\n|                         | 2023         | 2022      | 2023          | 2022      | 2023    | 2022    |\n| Pumps Segment           | 1,576,483    | 1,585,727 | 1,513,653     | 1,390,192 | 52,301  | 27,718  |\n| Valves Segment          | 392,573      | 359,676   | 361,435       | 333,072   | -7,522  | -4,635  |\n| KSB SupremeServ Segment | 990,418      | 916,684   | 943,900       | 850,123   | 179,123 | 146,020 |\n| Total                   | 2,959,474    | 2,862,087 | 2,818,988     | 2,573,387 | 223,902 | 169,103 |\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management Report\n\nImage /page/69/Figure/4 description: This image is a donut chart titled \"Sales revenue by segment\". The chart shows the sales revenue for three segments: KSB SupremeServ, Valves, and Pumps. KSB SupremeServ accounts for 33.5% of the sales revenue, Valves accounts for 12.8% of the sales revenue, and Pumps accounts for 53.7% of the sales revenue.\n\nThe Region Europe contributed the largest share of order intake of the Pumps Segment with € 732.7 million (previous year: € 775.6 million), followed by the Region Asia / Pacific with € 489.7 million (previous year: € 490.4 million) and the Regions Americas and Middle East / Africa / Russia each with lower contributions in absolute terms. The highest growth rate was reported in the Region Americas, while the Region Europe posted a marked decline. This is partly due to the aforementioned major order in the Water Market Area in the previous year.\n\n#### **Valves**\n\nOrder intake in the Valves Segment amounted to € 392.6 million compared with € 359.7 million in the previous year. The growth is driven by the very positive development of the project business, while the Standard Markets remained stable. The largest positive contribution was recorded in the energy industry, where major investments were made in the power plant market. Investment activity was also stepped up in the marine market. The largest Region by far is Europe with € 229.5 million (previous year: € 222.7 million), followed by Asia / Pacific with € 123.3 million (previous year: € 105.2 million) and the Regions Americas and Middle East / Africa / Russia each with lower contributions in absolute terms.\n\n#### **KSB SupremeServ**\n\nOrder intake in the KSB SupremeServ Segment – which covers all service and spare parts activities – reached € 990.4 million and is thus considerably higher than in the previous year (€ 916.7 million). This increase is due to the positive development of the spare parts business. Higher order levels in the nuclear sector, in particular, as well as extensive service assignments as part of maintenance inspections of larger plants in the chemicals / petrochemicals industry contributed to the increase.\n\nIn the KSB SupremeServ Segment, too, the Region Europe made the greatest contribution to order intake with € 470.4 million (previous year: € 426.4 million), followed by Americas with € 292.3 million (previous year: € 276.4 million) and Asia / Pacific and Middle East / Africa / Russia. The highest growth rate was reported in the Region Asia / Pacific.\n\n#### **SALES REVENUE**\n\nThe Group's consolidated sales revenue, which lags behind order intake, grew strongly by € 245.6 million (+ 9.5 %) to € 2,819.0 million). Sales revenue would have been € 77.3 million higher excluding exchange rate effects (excluding the hyperinflationary economies of Argentina and Turkey).\n\nAll the Regions contributed to this sales revenue growth. Europe remained by far the largest Region with sales revenue of € 1,427.8 million (previous year: € 1,271.7 million, followed by Asia / Pacific with € 708.1 million (previous year: € 646.4 million), Americas with € 523.7 million (previous year: € 498.1 million) and the Region Middle East / Africa / Russia with € 159.3 million (previous year: € 157.2 million). The largest percentage increase was reported in the Region Europe with € 156.1 million (+ 12.3 %), followed by the Region Asia / Pacific with € 61.7 million (+ 9.5 %). The Region Americas also developed well with a plus of € 25.6 million (+ 5.1 %). The companies in the Region Middle East / Africa / Russia remained stable with an increase of € 2.1 million (+ 1.4 %).\n\n#### **Pumps**\n\nSales revenue in the Pumps Segment amounted to € 1,513.7 million (previous year: € 1,390.2 million). The Standard Markets accounted for € 1,232.0 million and the Energy and Mining operating segments together for € 281.6 million. The sharp increase in sales revenue in the Pumps Segment is attributable in particular to the positive development in the Water and General Industry Market Areas. In the Water Market Area, the major order received in the previous year was completed. Order intake increased in the General Industry Market Area, especially in the Region Europe, due to sales revenue recognition of orders from the previous year. Europe remains by far the largest Region with sales revenue of € 755.9 million (previous year: € 670.1 million), followed by Asia / Pacific with € 434.4 million (previous year: € 407.4 million), then the Region Americas and the Region Middle East / Africa / Russia.\n\nImage /page/69/Picture/17 description: The image shows the number 2.8 in a blue sans-serif font.

This increase is due to the very positive development of the project business, while development in the Standard Markets remained stable. The damage caused by the hail storm at the La Roche-Chalais site in France in 2022 led to delays in production during the reporting year. These delays were reduced significantly by the end of the year by introducing a more effective production layout. Europe remains by far the largest Region with sales revenue of € 213.8 million (previous year: € 199.7 million), followed by Asia / Pacific with € 116.3 million (previous year: € 102.2 million), then the Region Americas and the Region Middle East / Africa / Russia. Strong double-digit growth rates were achieved in the Regions Asia / Pacific and Middle East / Africa / Russia.\n\n#### **KSB SupremeServ**\n\n**9** \n\nThe Region Europe contributed the largest share of order intake of the Pumps Segment with € 732.7 million (previous year: € 775.6 million), followed by the Region Asia / Pacific with € 489.7 million (previous year: € 490.4 million) and the Regions Americas and Middle East / Africa / Russia each with lower contributions in absolute terms.

This strong increase was a result of the positive development of the spare parts business in the Energy and Mining operating segments. Spare parts orders from previous years were invoiced in the Energy operating segment and the Mining operating segment benefited from the strong capacity utilisation of the mines as well as new long-term service contracts. The largest Region by far is Europe with sales revenue of € 458.1 million (previous year: € 401.9 million), followed by Americas with € 280.8 million (previous year: € 257.9 million), then Asia / Pacific and Middle East / Africa / Russia. The Region Asia / Pacific achieved the strongest growth rate.\n\n#### **EARNINGS BEFORE FINANCE INCOME / EXPENSE AND INCOME TAX (EBIT)**\n\nThe KSB Group achieved earnings before finance income / expense and income tax (EBIT) of € 223.9 million (previous year: € 169.1 million). The earnings improvement is primarily attributable to growth and margin strength in the KSB SupremeServ Segment.\n\n#### **Pumps**\n\nEBIT in the Pumps Segment amounted to € 52.3 million (previous year: € 27.7 million), with the Standard Markets in particular contributing to the very good performance. The main drivers were higher sales revenue and a better profit quality. The EBIT margin achieved was 3.5 % (previous year: 2.0 %).\n\n#### **Valves**\n\nEBIT in the Valves Segment was € – 7.5 million (previous year: € – 4.6 million) and it therefore € 2.9 million lower than in the previous year. The development is largely attributable to project provisions and the after-effects of the damage caused by hail at the French site in La Roche-Chalais in the 2022 financial year. These negative effects could only be partially offset by the higher volume of sales revenue and insurance compensation paid out in 2023 for the hail damage in La Roche-Chalais. The EBIT margin achieved was – 2.1 % (previous year: – 1.4 %).\n\n#### **KSB SupremeServ**\n\nThanks to the profitable growth in the spare parts business, especially in the energy and chemicals industry, EBIT was increased by € 33.1 million to € 179.1 million (previous year: € 146.0 million). This equates to an EBIT margin of 19.0 % (previous year: 17.2 %).\n\n223.9 Consolidated earnings (EBIT) in € millions\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **INCOME STATEMENT**\n\n| € thousands                                                                | 2023       | 2022       | Percentage<br>change |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|----------------------|\n| Sales revenue                                                              | 2,818,988  | 2,573,387  | 9.5                  |\n| Changes in inventories                                                     | 24,271     | 99,412     | −75.6                |\n| Work performed and capitalised                                             | 1,959      | 1,716      | 14.2                 |\n| Total output of operations                                                 | 2,845,217  | 2,674,515  | 6.4                  |\n| Other income                                                               | 44,384     | 34,462     | 28.8                 |\n| Cost of materials                                                          | −1,153,651 | −1,156,292 | −0.2                 |\n| Staff costs                                                                | −960,699   | −901,551   | 6.6                  |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                                              | −88,094    | −90,419    | −2.6                 |\n| Other expenses                                                             | −463,257   | −391,612   | 18.3                 |\n| Earnings before finance income / expense and income tax (EBIT)             | 223,902    | 169,103    | 32.4                 |\n| Finance income                                                             | 9,382      | 7,461      | 25.7                 |\n| Finance expense                                                            | −29,656    | −17,712    | 67.4                 |\n| Income from / expense to investments accounted for using the equity method | 5,361      | 1,816      | 195.2                |\n| Finance income / expense                                                   | −14,913    | −8,435     | 76.8                 |\n| Earnings before income tax (EBT)                                           | 208,989    | 160,668    | 30.1                 |\n| Taxes on income                                                            | −32,376    | −33,330    | −2.9                 |\n| Earnings after income tax                                                  | 176,613    | 127,338    | 38.7                 |\n| Attributable to:                                                           |            |            |                      |\n| Non-controlling interests                                                  | 24,318     | 23,689     | 2.7                  |\n| Shareholders of KSB SE & Co.

Equity increased in the reporting year and amounted to € 1,216.9 million (previous year: €1,125.6 million). The equity ratio of 45.6 % was at the previous year's level (45.4 %).\n\n#### **Liquidity**\n\nKSB recorded cash flows from operating activities of € 280.3 million compared with € 2.1 million in the previous year. This very positive development is mainly due to the good financial position and working capital management. While an outflow of € 206.5 million was recorded in the 2022 financial year, KSB kept working capital almost stable despite the significant increase in business volume in the financial year. In addition, the € 49.3 million increase in earnings after income tax contributed to the inflow of funds.\n\nThe outflows from investing activities rose by € – 14.5 million from € – 89.0 million in the previous year to € – 103.5 million in the reporting year. This is attributable to a € 4.1 million increase in payments to acquire intangible assets and property, plant and equipment on the one hand, and a € 9.4 million decrease in net proceeds from deposits with an original maturity of more than three months on the other hand.\n\nDespite the € 10.7 million increase in dividend payments, cash outflows in the cash flows from financing activities were € 12.4 million lower than in the previous year. The final tranche of the loan against borrower's note was repaid in the previous year, leading to a cash outflow of € 22.0 million in the 2022 financial year.\n\nOverall, cash and cash equivalents increased sharply from € 228.6 million in the previous year to € 340.4 million in the reporting year.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Financial Position and Net Assets** \n\n**€ thousands 2023 2022** \n\n**74** Management and Issues 2023 **Combined Management Report** Consolidated Financial Statements General Information\n\nFurther information is provided in Section VII.

In addition, a syndicated loan has been in place since December 2018 to protect against potential liquidity risk and cover the need for bank guarantees of the KSB Group. The credit line can be used at any time and has a fixed term of five years with the option to renew twice by one year each time. In the 2020 financial year, KSB availed itself of this option for the second time and extended the fixed term of the line early, until the end of 2025. For more information on liquidity management (such as credit lines) see the section on Risk Reporting on the Utilisation of Financial Instruments elsewhere in this group management report.\n\n#### **Investments**\n\nThe additions to intangible assets amounting to € 9.8 million are above the prior-year level (€ 5.2 million).\n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment of € 99.9 million in the reporting year are € 1.1 million lower than in the previous year (€ 101.0 million). At € 34.8 million, the highest additions related to advance payments and assets under construction, as in the previous year (€ 38.1 million). Another € 23.0 million related to other equipment, operating and office equipment (previous year: € 20.5 million), while € 22.4 million related to technical equipment and machinery (previous year: € 22.7 million). As in 2022, the focus of capital investment activity was the Region Europe, mainly Germany, the Netherlands and France. Outside Europe, the highest additions were made at the plants in India, the USA and China.\n\n#### **Net financial position**\n\n**13** \n\n**Percentage change** \n\nin the reporting year. This is attributable to a € 4.1 million increase in payments to acquire intangible assets and property, plant and equipment on the one hand, and a € 9.4 million decrease in net proceeds from deposits with an original maturity of more than three months on the other hand.\n\nDespite the € 10.7 million increase in dividend payments, cash outflows in the cash flows from financing activities were € 12.4 million lower than in the previous year. The final tranche of the loan against borrower's note was repaid in the previous year, leading to a cash outflow of € 22.0 million in\n\nOverall, cash and cash equivalents increased sharply from € 228.6 million in the previous year to € 340.4 million in the\n\nthe 2022 financial year.\n\nreporting year.\n\nAt € 324.9 million, the net financial position rose substantially by € 99.3 million from € 225.6 million in the previous year. It is derived from the balance of interest-bearing financial liabilities and financial assets (mainly cash and cash equivalents and receivables from deposits). The increase in the net financial position is attributable to the significant rise in cash flows from operating activities, in particular.\n\n#### **Contingent liabilities and other financial obligations**\n\nContingent liabilities as at the reporting date totalled € 27.2 million and were therefore € 6.7 million lower (previous year: € 33.9 million).\n\nThere are no other obligations and commitments beyond the reporting date. Further financial obligations arose only within the normal scope from purchase commitments amounting to € 27.9 million (previous year: € 27.3 million).\n\n#### **NET ASSETS**\n\nAround 31.9 % of funds is attributable to non-current assets (previous year: 30.6 %). Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment with a historical cost of € 1,711.0 million (previous year: € 1,657.0 million) had carrying amounts of € 677.9 million (previous year: € 651.2 million). Total intangible assets rose from € 72.7 million in the previous year to € 75.7 million. In the reporting year, impairment of goodwill in the Pumps Segment of € 0.4 million (previous year: € 0.8 million) and of € 0.2 million (previous year: € 0.9 million) in the KSB SupremeServ Segment was reported.\n\nRight-of-use assets for leases (€ 46.9 million) were up on the prior-year level (€ 40.2 million).\n\nProperty, plant and equipment increased from € 578.5 million to € 602.2 million as a result of capital expenditure (€ 99.9 million) in excess of depreciation of € 62.0 million. Currency translation effects had a negative impact of € – 12.9 million.\n\nImage /page/74/Picture/15 description: The image shows the number 324.9 in a large, sans-serif font.

Revenue reserves increased by a total of € 84.5 million. The net profit for the year of € 176.6 million had a particular impact in this context. On the other hand, the remeasurement of defined benefit plans in the amount of € 39.4 million led to a reduction in equity.\n\nThis was contrasted by the taxes on income of € 27.6 million attributable to the remeasurement of defined benefit plans. This includes the reversal of impairment losses that were recognised in the previous year on deferred tax assets in the KSB SE & Co.

The assets chart for 2023 shows the following percentages: Non-current assets at 31.9%, Inventories at 28.0%, Contract assets, receivables and current assets at 27.4%, and Cash and cash equivalents at 12.7%. For 2022, the assets chart shows: Non-current assets at 30.6%, Inventories at 29.0%, Contract assets, receivables and current assets at 31.2%, and Cash and cash equivalents at 9.2%. The equity and liabilities chart for 2023 shows: Equity at 45.6%, Non-current liabilities at 20.6%, and Current liabilities at 33.8%. For 2022, the equity and liabilities chart shows: Equity at 45.4%, Non-current liabilities at 20.4%, and Current liabilities at 34.2%.\n\nCurrency translation effects led to a loss of € 33.4 million in the reporting year (previous year: gains of € 12.5 million). The revenue reserves include the proportion of earnings after income tax attributable to KSB SE & Co. KGaA shareholders, at € 152.3 million (previous year: € 103.6 million). Out of total equity, € 216.5 million (previous year: € 209.7 million) is attributable to non-controlling interests. The equity ratio is stable at 45.6 % (previous year: 45.4 %).\n\nThe non-controlling interests mainly relate to the following companies: KSB Limited, India, KSB Shanghai Pump Co., Ltd., China and the PAB subgroup. The latter consists of Pumpenund Armaturen-Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH, Frankenthal, and its US subsidiaries.\n\n#### **Inflation and exchange rate effects**\n\nOf the Group's consolidated companies, the annual financial statements of the Argentinian and the Turkish company had to be adjusted for the effects of inflation. The net loss from the monetary depreciation of the affected monetary assets and liabilities to be taken into account under IAS 29, amounting to € 6.9 million (previous year: € 4.6 million), is included in the income statement under other finance expense within finance income / expense.\n\nImage /page/77/Picture/7 description: The image shows the number 45.6 in a large, blue font. Below the number, the text \"Equity ratio in percent\" is written in a smaller, blue font.\n\nCurrency translation of financial statements of consolidated companies that are not prepared in euro gave rise to a difference of € – 33.4 million (previous year: € + 12.5 million). The total of currency translation differences was taken directly to equity.\n\n#### **Liabilities**\n\nThe largest item under liabilities continues to be pension provisions, which increased by € 44.5 million from € 451.6 million to € 496.1 million. Higher interest rates account for this increase. This effect was reported in actuarial losses at € 39.4 million (previous year: € – 158.4 million). Obligations for current pensioners and vested benefits of employees who have left the company account for about 49.9 % of the amount recognised in the balance sheet. The rest is attributable to defined benefit obligations for current employees.\n\nNon-current financial liabilities fell slightly by € 4.9 million year on year to € 29.0 million (previous year: € 24.1 million).\n\nOther non-current and current provisions increased from € 115.7 million in 2022 to € 136.5 million in 2023. This is mainly attributable to the € 18.8 million increase in provisions for warranties and contractual penalties.\n\nCurrent liabilities rose overall by € 53.4 million to € 902.3 million compared with € 848.9 million at the end of 2022. The share of current liabilities relative to total equity and liabilities fell marginally to 33.8 % (previous year: 34.2 %).\n\nCurrent financial liabilities of € 26.1 million are largely unchanged from the previous year's level (€ 26.6 million).\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\n**17** \n\nCurrency translation of financial statements of consolidated companies that are not prepared in euro gave rise to a difference of € – 33.4 million (previous year: € + 12.5 million).

KSB is very satisfied with the order intake achieved in the reporting year. The order intake figures of the individual Segments have developed better than originally expected. The Pumps Segment reported a stable development contrary to the anticipated noticeable decline. Order intake figures for the Valves and KSB SupremeServ Segments also showed strong growth. A slight to tangible increase was forecast for the Valves Segment, while KSB anticipated slight growth in the KSB SupremeServ Segment.\n\nThe forecast for sales revenue provided in the 2022 Annual Report, which was expected to be in a range between € 2,500 million and € 2,850 million, was confirmed. The Group is very satisfied with the sales revenue achieved of € 2,819.0 million (previous year: € 2,573.4 million). The forecast of a strong increase for the Pumps Segment was achieved with growth of 8.9 %. Instead of the slight to noticeable growth forecast for the Valves Segment and the stable to slight increase for the KSB SupremeServ Segment, both Segments recorded strong growth. In an ad hoc statement, the forecast for EBIT in the 2022 Annual Report, which was expected to be in a range of € 165.0 million to € 200.0 million, was adjusted to a range of € 210.0 million to € 230.0 million. At € 223.9 million, EBIT in the 2023 financial year was therefore in the upper half of the adjusted forecast range. The basis for the adjustment of the forecast was the positive development in the KSB SupremeServ Segment, which was more pronounced than originally assumed. The strong growth forecast for the Pumps Segment was achieved in the financial year. EBIT in the Valves Segment was expected to increase strongly but declined significantly instead. However, this was more than offset by the very positive development in the KSB SupremeServ Segment, for which KSB predicted a stable to slight increase, with strong growth in the reporting year. Detailed information on the reasons for the EBIT performance is provided in the \"Earnings before finance income / expense and income tax (EBIT)\" section.\n\nThe assumption made in the previous year's financial statements that global economic growth would be decisive for the development of the key indicators has largely materialised. The growth in sales revenue also exceeded the growth in order intake, as predicted. KSB expected EBIT growth to be driven primarily by the Standard Markets. However, EBIT growth was mainly attributable to the positive development in the KSB SupremeServ Segment already described above. The company can confirm the expected contribution to earnings from the Region Europe. The Management of the KSB Group is therefore very satisfied with business performance in the reporting year.\n\nKSB continues to have a healthy financial basis for the future.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-79-0\"></span>In its current forecast for global economic growth, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) most recently anticipated an increase of + 3.1 % in real terms for 2024, which equates to the prior-year growth rate.

The growth in order intake will be driven by the Regions Asia / Pacific and Middle East / Africa / Russia. By contrast, KSB expects slight growth in order intake in Europe, its largest market. The highest growth in sales revenue is expected in the Region Europe and – in line with order intake – in the Region Asia / Pacific. The Group expects higher EBIT, largely from the Regions Europe and Asia / Pacific.\n\nFor the 2024 financial year, the Group anticipates a substantial increase in orders received by the Pumps Segment, which achieved an order intake of € 1,576.5 million in the reporting year. This growth will be supported mainly by the Standard Markets operating segment. By contrast, KSB anticipates a slight increase in order intake in the Valves Segment, which amounted to € 392.6 million in the reporting year. KSB expects a slight increase in the order intake of € 990.4 million in the reporting year for the KSB SupremeServ Segment in 2024.\n\nThe Pumps Segment contributed € 1,513.7 million to the Group's consolidated sales revenue in the reporting year. KSB anticipates a marked increase in this Segment for the 2024 financial year. It expects a marked to strong increase in 2024 for the Valves Segment, which achieved sales revenue of € 361.4 million in the reporting year. The KSB SupremeServ Segment contributed € 943.9 million to consolidated sales revenue. KSB forecasts moderately higher sales revenue for this Segment.\n\nThe Pumps Segment generated earnings before finance income / expense and income tax (EBIT) of € 52.3 million in the 2023 reporting year. KSB is planning a tangible increase in EBIT in this Segment for the 2024 financial year. It also expects a strong increase in the Vales Segment. In the reporting year, the Valves Segment achieved EBIT of € – 7.5 million. In the KSB SupremeServ Segment, which contributed € 179.1 million to EBIT in the reporting year, KSB expects a slight to tangible increase in EBIT.\n\nThe forecast may be influenced in particular by the ongoing geopolitical tensions, which are explained in more detail in the Opportunities and Risks Report.\n\n#### **FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\nThis report contains forward-looking statements and information that are based upon the assumptions of Management. They express current forecasts and expectations with regard to future events. As a result, these forward-looking statements and information are exposed to risks and uncertainties that lie outside the Management's sphere of influence. KSB wishes to point out that actual events or results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements and information presented, if one or more of the following opportunities or risks, or other opportunities, risks and uncertainties should materialise, or if the assumptions underlying the statements prove to be inaccurate.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-81-0\"></span>As an organisation that operates throughout the world, the KSB Group is exposed to macroeconomic, sector-typical, financial and business-specific risks. The risk policy is designed to enable KSB to grow sustainably and profitably. The KSB Group aims to reduce the risks associated with its business and where possible avoid them completely. At the same time its global alignment and extensive product range also offer opportunities. This includes those opportunities that arise on the basis of research and development activities, as well as any that are linked to the quality and cost effectiveness of products. KSB's competitive position is also being strengthened by optimising the global sales and production network. In this context, opportunities are constantly examined to further increase KSB's global presence, by establishing new companies or expanding KSB SupremeServ sites and by acquisitions. Customer focus is the key principle in this context.\n\nThe Group sees opportunities and risks as possible future developments or events that may lead to departures from forecast or targets. The departure can be both positive and negative. In order to manage the varied opportunities and risks professionally and efficiently, the Group aligns its actions accordingly and focuses upon the respective situation when selecting the persons responsible. In doing so, Controlling, Legal, Finance and Accounting as well as Internal Audits perform important monitoring tasks. The following section describes the processes related to the Group-wide opportunities and risk management system, which is based on the Auditing Standards 340 (IDW PS 340 n. F.) and 981 (IDW PS 981) issued by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany.\n\n#### **RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**\n\nKSB has implemented a Group-wide risk management system for identifying and assessing relevant risks in the different areas of responsibility and reporting these to Group headquarters. The risk management process of the KSB Group consists of the successive phases of identification, assessment, management, control, documentation and communication of risks. The six phases form a continuous and IT-based closedloop system. This is documented in KSB's Risk Management Manual, as well as the management responsibility and the description of all relevant tasks. In this manual, KSB also formalises the risk strategy that was specified in detail in 2023. The Managing Directors of KSB Management SE are responsible for determining, implementing and releasing the risk management system that is effective throughout the Group. The risk strategy is reviewed regularly to ensure it is oriented on the Group strategy and meets the regulatory requirements. Changes to the risk strategy require the approval of the Managing Directors of KSB Management SE.\n\nKSB's risk strategy serves as a basis for evaluating business decisions and is based on normative guiding principles. These guiding principles include, among other things, a clear commitment to promoting an interdisciplinary and Groupwide risk culture, efficient and time-critical risk communication processes and a stakeholder-centred focus on value creation and preservation. These qualitative criteria are supplemented by a quantitative approach to analysing the riskbearing capacity.\n\nKSB defines the risk-bearing capacity as an aggregated risk potential that can be absorbed in the medium term without posing a threat to the business continuity of KSB. A corresponding concept for risk-bearing capacity, taking into account the overall risk strategy, was established within the Group. It specifically examines whether and to what extent developments could jeopardise the continued existence of the KSB Group with regard to its equity and / or liquidity position.\n\nThe regular derivation of the risk-bearing capacity and its communication to management is an integral process of the risk management system and is the responsibility of the Risk Manager. Changes require the approval of the Managing Directors of KSB Management SE. If the analysis of the riskbearing capacity reveals a need for additional requirements for risk provisioning, equity or liquidity, further measures are defined to ensure that adequate account is taken of the KSB Group's risk-bearing capacity in accordance with its risk strategy. In addition to risk-bearing capacity, KSB defines risk appetite as part of the risk strategy as a level of risk that it is prepared to bear over a certain period of time.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Opportunities and Risks Report**\n\n**82** Management and Issues 2023 **Combined Management Report** Consolidated Financial Statements General Information\n\nThe Managing Directors of KSB Management SE are responsible for determining, implementing and releasing the risk management system that is effective throughout the Group.

The departure can be both positive and negative. In order to manage the varied opportunities and risks professionally and efficiently, the Group aligns its actions accordingly and focuses upon the respective situation when selecting the persons responsible. In doing so, Controlling, Legal, Finance and Accounting as well as Internal Audits perform important monitoring tasks. The following section describes the processes related to the Group-wide opportunities and risk management system, which is based on the Auditing Standards 340 (IDW PS 340 n. F.) and 981 (IDW PS 981) KSB uses risk management software to support these analytical processes and to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of risk management. This supports the systematic identification, assessment, management and monitoring of Group-wide risks and enables the precise and immediate recording of risk information.\n\nManagers are encouraged to take timely action to define and implement measures to limit or avoid damage that may result from the occurrence of risk events. All corporate and central functions and Group companies, including Group companies that are not consolidated, are included in the risk management system. The responsible managers are required to supply their relevant key business and financial indicators each month. As well as creating forecasts during the year on business performance, they also report twice a year to the central Risk Manager on all recognised risks in the categories of market and competitive risks, technological risks, project- and product-related risks, financial risks, procurement risks, ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) risks, other businessspecific risks and long-term strategic risks in a bottom-up process. The monitoring period was divided into three cycles. In the first cycle, the risks are to be reported for the following financial year or, as part of the risk assessment during the course of the year, for the remainder of the financial year. Accordingly, the second cycle covers the risks that are seen within a time period of up to 24 months. Where applicable, any long-term risks are considered in the third cycle, such as strategic risks that have been a greater focal point of KSB's risk management since 2023. In addition, regular management reporting on day-to-day business-related risk developments and issues is provided by the respective corporate and central functions to the Managing Directors of the KSB Group, in order to ensure from a management perspective that such risks are addressed in an action-oriented manner and are continually tracked between the reporting dates.\n\nThe regular identification and updating of risks in all the Group companies and in the respective corporate and central functions ensure that risk awareness within the KSB Group remains at a high level across the board. A distinction is made between qualitative and quantitative risks.\n\nQualitative risks are developments that cannot or cannot yet be thoroughly quantified due to a lack of precise information. However, to be able to evaluate them for further analysis steps, the scope is assessed using defined evaluation intervals. The mean value of these evaluation intervals is used to determine the significance of these risks for the Group.\n\n**21** \n\nQuantitative risks are risks for which the potential monetary impact on the earnings and/or liquidity of the KSB Group can be estimated. They are evaluated taking into account the specifically calculated probability of occurrence in combination with the potential amount of loss. The scope or amount of loss describes the potential influence of the individual risk on the key indicator of earnings before finance income / expense and income tax (EBIT) or liquidity of the KSB Group or the respective Group company. In 2023, KSB further developed the risk assessment methodology, by evaluating the amount of loss using three scenarios rather than one scenario (one-point evaluation): worst case, most likely case and best case. A distinction is also made between a gross method before taking into account any corrective action that has been taken, and a net method after taking into account such measures. Risk assessment at KSB covers all relevant risk areas for internal and external risks arising from the KSB business and the Group's inherent risk profile. In this context, gross impacts on EBIT of all individual and similar risks of € 500 thousand or more before countermeasures in the most likely case scenario are to be reported uniformly throughout the Group at the earliest possible time, regardless of how the risk is assessed in terms of probability of occurrence. Purely casheffective risks are reported as from a gross impact of € 5.0 million or more (in the most likely case).\n\nKSB defines as material all risks or aggregate risks, for which the product of the probability of occurrence and the most probable amount of loss, after deducting the amount of countermeasures, is greater than € 5.0 million. This applies to qualitative and quantitative risks. The materiality threshold of € 5.0 million presented replaces the previous materiality thresholds for individual risks, which were categorised as \"medium\" or \"high\" based on the defined classification from the previous year. As a result of the new evaluation scheme, risks that were still categorised as high in the previous year according to the risk matrix are no longer material. New reported risks, that would have been classified as high in the former evaluation scheme, fall below the newly defined materiality threshold in the reporting year.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Risk management at KSB**\n\nImage /page/83/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram of an organizational structure. At the top is a box labeled \"Supervisory Board\", which is connected by an arrow to a box labeled \"KSB Management SE\".

The \"Risk Managers\" box is connected by an arrow to a box labeled \"Risk Owners\", which contains a bulleted list: \"Risk identification\", \"Risk evaluation\", \"Risk control and monitoring (incl. implementation of measures)\", \"Risk recording\", and \"Risk communication / Ad hoc reporting\".\n\nThe bodies to which specific responsibilities and competencies were assigned in KSB's risk management system in the reporting year are presented and explained in the above diagram. **Risk management system of the KSB Group** \n\nAs the legal representative, KSB Management SE assumes overall responsibility for risk management. KSB Management SE reports to the Supervisory Board of KSE SE & Co. KGaA via its Managing Directors during regular Audit Committee meetings and is monitored by the latter. The Managing Directors are supported by the Chief Compliance Officer and the Group Finance and Accounting department of KSB SE & Co. KGaA. The latter coordinates the risk management process at Group level and checks all risks reported for relevance to the preparation of financial statements. This ensures that there is a systematic link with the Group accounting process. The Managing Directors, the Administrative Board and the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee receive two risk reports per financial year. These reports include all the risks classed as material that exceed pre-defined threshold values individually or collectively, taking into consideration any corrective action that has been taken (net risk), as well as further significant developments. The net method enables the Managing Directors to focus specifically on the reported risks. Additionally, the risk-bearing capacity of the KSB Group is regularly monitored on the basis of the overall risk position, which is developed by aggregating all the risks recorded. This makes it possible to identify early on any developments that could threaten business continuity in the period under review. Particularly time-critical risks and new or changed risks that are classified as significant are to be reported by the responsible managers to the Risk Managers on an ad hoc basis. The latter review the information and pass it on to the Managing Directors of KSB Management SE. Opportunities are also taken into account in KSB's current risk management system and are reported in line with the specifications for risk assessment.\n\nWith regard to financial risks KSB makes use of additional risk identification, assessment, management and communication. The central Finance department is responsible for this task, which is described in further detail later in this section.\n\nCompliance risks are dealt with by the Chief Compliance Officer, who is assigned to the Legal and Compliance, Patents and Trademarks staff function. The Chief Compliance Officer is supported by the members of the Compliance Committee and the Compliance Managers of the individual companies.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\nRelevant risks from both corporate and central functions as well as other specialised corporate and central functions are transferred to and integrated within the KSB Group's risk management system, thus systematically ensuring a holistic overall risk inventory. The Internal Audits department is integrated into the risk management system as part of the internal control system. When planning audits, it prioritises areas according to potential risks and is provided with all the necessary information. The auditors ensure that all audited units adhere to the applicable guidelines, actively participate in the risk management system, and control or avoid their risks. Information obtained by Internal Audits on both the identified risks and the corrective action initiated in response forms an integral part of the reporting to the Managing Directors and to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. The risk management system is updated promptly if need be, for example in the event of relevant legal or organisational changes. In addition, the auditors examine the early risk detection system within the scope of the audit of the annual financial statements, establishing that it is in place and checking that it is fit for purpose. Relevant basic documents on risk management are archived in accordance with the statutory applicable deadline and in the statutory required formats.\n\n#### **INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM RELATING TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTING PROCESS**\n\nThe accounting-related internal control system (ICS) contributes towards ensuring proper financial reporting. The aim is to ensure that the consolidated financial statements and group management report comply with all relevant regulations. Key elements of the ICS are – as well as the risk management system described above – guidelines and regulations, which include standard accounting and measurement policies. They must be applied to the full extent by all Group companies. There is a segregation of duties and a double-check system is in place. This is ensured by the audits carried out by the Internal Audits department.\n\nIn addition, Accounting and Controlling carry out regular analytical plausibility checks of the financial information requested from the companies as well as actual / budget variance analyses. This enables KSB to identify significant changes early on, which are examined for accounting and measurement discrepancies. The resulting findings are then discussed at management level.\n\nThe responsibility for Group accounting lies with the employees in the central Accounting KSB Group department. The services of qualified external reviewers are employed to evaluate complex issues (such as the calculation of pension\n\n**23** \n\nregularly monitored on the basis of the overall risk position, which is developed by aggregating all the risks recorded.

The accounting and measurement methods that must be applied to compile the consolidated financial statements are defined in writing in a manual that is updated and revised on a continual basis. This includes guidelines for posting intra-Group transactions. New accounting principles and other official announcements are continually analysed with regard to their relevance and impact on the consolidated financial statements. Guidelines and manual are adapted where necessary and any changes communicated immediately to the companies. Group Accounting likewise monitors compliance with requirements. This reduces the risk of compiling inappropriate financial statements or failing to publish them by the defined deadlines.\n\nThe financial statement information for all Group companies is automatically processed using certified and tested standard consolidation software. Systematic checks are implemented to help validate the data. Employees in Accounting KSB Group verify any warning signals that arise before using the data. The sequence of the processing steps is strictly specified through the use of the consolidation monitor within the IT system. This ensures the correct processing of data.\n\nTo enable a seamless and accurate accounting process, only employees who have the appropriate specialist know-how are assigned to this task. These employees are trained on a regular basis to make sure that their expert knowledge remains up to date.\n\nAccess authorisations have been defined for the accountingrelated IT system. This protects the data against unauthorised access as well as improper usage and modification. In addition, the checks at many stages ensure the quality of processing and help to limit operational risks.\n\n#### **INDIVIDUALLY ASSESSED OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS**\n\nThe categories presented below include the net risks classified as material and other net risks that are relevant to the Group as well as the material opportunities for the 2024 financial year. If risks are not flagged as material, they are considered to be of secondary importance. Unless otherwise stated, the following risks relate to all Segments.\n\n#### **Markets / Competition**\n\nThe forecast for the 2024 financial year is based on the expectations and assumptions regarding general economic performance and the development of global GDP as described\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management R\n\nin the Report on Expected Developments. Risks for the Group's business arising from high inflation rates have eased considerable but they continue to exist. The Group manages the risk of fluctuations in the economy and in demand by remaining active in several markets and industries with different economic cycles. Furthermore KSB monitors the development of the economic environment for its markets. If necessary, capacities are adjusted, production facilities relocated and cost-cutting measures implemented.\n\nOther risks arise in particular through current geopolitical uncertainty resulting from trade conflicts and numerous global flashpoints. KSB classifies in particular the further development of the conflicts in Ukraine and in the Middle East as a risk with regard to duration and potential escalation, as it is currently not possible to estimate the effects on the global economy and thus on the Group's business activities and further escalation cannot be ruled out. To make use of potential opportunities arising from strategic mergers or acquisitions, KSB continuously monitors the current market situation as well as forecast developments. This allows it to expand market shares or tap into new areas of application.\n\n#### **Projects / Products**\n\nRegular market analysis and monitoring, together with continuous quality management, generally minimise the risk that products will become technically obsolete, are offered at prices not acceptable in the market or that developments on the markets are missed.\n\nIn KSB's business, there are special requirements when it comes to the processing of technically complex large-scale projects with long contract terms. These typically involve potential risks. There may be cost overruns, tighter import and export regulations or sanctions, staff shortages, technical difficulties or quality problems – including potential contractual penalties – that reduce the margins. KSB therefore continuously trains its employees in project management and equips them with specialist knowledge. This is designed to enable them to identify the risks associated with longer-term orders at an early stage. In addition, project managers are provided with appropriate management tools. Decisions are made in conjunction with clearly structured authorisation processes. Furthermore, there is central monitoring of projects exposed to risk across all KSB companies.\n\nThere are also technical and financial risks to orders with newly designed products. Technical risks are limited to the extent that intermediate steps for development work are defined and partial solutions are subjected to assessments. Commercial risks are minimised by using appropriate contractual clauses. KSB's goal is to ensure that advance payments and collateral provided by customers are structured in such a way that they at least cover the costs incurred. KSB reports contingent liabilities of € 1.8 million (previous year: € 5.1 million) for risks that result from warranty obligations and contractual penalties risks and that were not covered by corresponding provisions. Of this amount, € 0 million is attributable to KSB SE & Co. KGaA, as in the previous year. Beyond this KSB sees no material residual risk (net risk).\n\n#### **Finance / Liquidity**\n\nThe Group's international focus is associated with exchange rate risks. Besides the euro, the most important currencies for KSB are the US dollar, the Indian rupee, the Brazilian real and the Chinese yuan. The liquidity risk arising from foreign currency transactions is hedged by using derivative financial instruments. The hedges are based on fixed contracts and on forecasts about future payment streams, the occurrence of which is uncertain.\n\nEconomic downturns or newly emerging crisis may adversely affect the financial situation of customers. Delayed payments and defaults on receivables as a result of this can burden the earnings. The same effect might occur if the foreign exchange regulations become stricter for individual countries. KSB counters this by means of a strict receivables management system and intensive customer contacts.\n\nAs regards tax matters, the global orientation of the activities of the KSB Group must be taken into consideration. Based on its operative activities in numerous countries with varying tax laws and administrative interpretation, differentiated assessment is required for measuring tax obligations of every jurisdiction. Uncertainty could arise due to different factual interpretations by taxable entities on the one hand and local finance authorities on the other, as well as due to unclear legislative texts. These may come to light during audits. By cooperating closely with external local tax specialists, KSB counteracts the risk of having to pay back taxes. As KSB continually monitors unclear issues, it can generally classify the probability of occurrence. Should a need for subsequent payment arise, the corresponding tax liabilities are recognised in good time. In the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, KSB also reports contingent liabilities of € 1.1 million (previous year: € 0.2 million) from risks associated with income taxes. Of this amount, € 0 million is attributable to KSB SE & Co. KGaA, as in the previous year. € 13.4 million (previous year: € 13.2 million) are reported as contingent liabilities for risks from other tax matters. Of this amount, € 0 million is attributable to KSB SE & Co. KGaA, as in the previous year.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\nand collateral provided by customers are structured in such a way that they at least cover the costs incurred.

Risks for the Group's business arising from high inflation rates have eased considerable but they continue to exist. The Group manages the risk of fluctuations in the economy and in demand by remaining active in several markets and industries with different economic cycles. Furthermore KSB monitors the development of the economic environment for its markets. If necessary, capacities are adjusted, production facilities relo-\n\n**86** Management and Issues 2023 **Combined Management Report** Consolidated Financial Statements General Information\n\nOther risks arise in particular through current geopolitical uncertainty resulting from trade conflicts and numerous global flashpoints.

An increase in costs for raw materials and components can have a negative impact on the earnings situation if the cost increases cannot be compensated for or passed on to customers. Ineffective supply chains, defined by supply bottlenecks and capacity restrictions, can lead to production bottlenecks and delays in delivery, and adversely affect KSB's business activities. In its procurement strategy KSB seeks to prevent dependencies on suppliers and thereby counter any bottlenecks and delays. If local conditions mean that it is impossible to ensure sufficient diversification in this regard, KSB will make use of additional foreign business partners.\n\n#### **Technology / Research and Development**\n\nIt is essential to future success to have a product and service range that is suited to the market in terms of technology, price and delivery time. The changing needs of customers together with new standards and regulations – especially in promising markets – require the continuous development and improvement of products and services. The research and development required for adjustments consumes significant financial and human resources, with no guarantee of success in either the medium or the long term.\n\nTo avoid any negative impact on earnings, it is important to recognise the market-related or technical risks early on. To this end, the KSB Group is constantly updating the development process, which incorporates various control levels. As sales employees are regularly included in this process, risks arising from changes in markets or applications can be taken into account in good time in the evaluation.\n\n#### **Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)**\n\n**25** \n\nESG – short for Environmental, Social and Governance – refers to a comprehensive set of standards covering environmental, social and governance aspects for assessing the Group's sustainable and ethical activities. KSB's business activities, primarily in the area of production, are subject to numerous environmental protection laws and regulations. Environmental damage of any kind (for example, groundwater contamination, renovation needed due to outdated construction materials or unpleasant odours arising from the use of chemicals) may result in costs not covered by insurance policies. Therefore, at all company sites officers monitor compliance with laws and regulations as well as with internal KSB rules. If KSB discovers any contamination, it sets aside provisions to be able to meet obligations for necessary remediation.\n\nIn markets with tightening environmental regulations, there is a risk that KSB products and its in-house or purchased services might give rise to infringements and that the necessary authorisation for the relevant business might be lost and KSB's reputation might be damaged as a result. Legal requirements or restrictions related to products, such as RoHS (Restriction of Certain Hazardous Substances according to EU Directive 2011/65/EU), may lead to a restriction or – in a worst-case scenario – to a ban on selling individual products containing hazardous substances. KSB categorises this risk, which was identified for the first time in the reporting year, as material and is monitoring the current legal situations closely. Identified risks are addressed by continually adjusting the product design in order to be able to offer products that comply with market requirements. A change in rules on liability in environmental protection can also increase the risks for business success. As a member of national and international professional associations the KSB Group becomes aware of imminent changes in environmental law early on. The legal frameworks that are in place in its Operational Units are continually updated, enabling KSB to ensure that its employees always abide by the applicable law. This is monitored by external auditors as part of the management certifications.\n\nIn addition, KSB is exposed to risks from climate and natural hazards. In a first step, KSB evaluates its sites with regard to these risks, which include earthquakes, flooding, lightning strikes and wildfires. The occurrence of these risks would lead to disruptions in ongoing business operations at the respective sites. Sites identified to be exposed to risks based on this evaluation are examined in greater detail in relation to risks from climate and natural hazards, in order to develop and implement individual solutions. Basically KSB counters risks from climate and natural hazards by means of a differentiated production network. This facilitates a flexible response to breakdowns at production sites.\n\nInvestments in plant and machinery are made on the basis of resource efficiency and environmental and health protection in order to optimise energy costs throughout the entire use phase as well as to prevent any follow-on costs incurred through damage to the environment and/or to health.\n\nTo achieve its growth and profitability business objectives, KSB needs qualified employees at all locations, including technical specialists. Due to the demographic change in some countries, the competition for these and other highly skilled professionals is increasing, KSB counters this risk with demand-oriented measures, systematic human resources planning and international recruitment programmes.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n**27** \n\nOther potential risks associated with the activities of KSB's employees include dishonest conduct or violations of laws, which could damage the image of KSB. The KSB Group counters these risks and safeguards its reputation among customers by organising regular compliance training and through individual initiatives in critical regions.\n\nLegal disputes cannot always be avoided within the framework of business activities. These risks are usually disputes arising from operative business, generally involving unclear warranty issues or labour law disputes. In some cases, the continuous further and new development of products can lead to similarities with competitors' products. KSB limits the risk of resulting legal dispute by submitting patent applications at an early stage of the product development. If as a result of these issues KSB expects negative effects on the success of its business with a probability of occurrence of more than 50 %, corresponding provisions are set aside, which cover not only the anticipated amount of loss, but also the costs of proceedings.\n\nIn addition, KSB reports contingent liabilities in the amount of € 2.3 million (previous year: € 3.1 million) in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, € 1.0 million of this is attributable to KSB SE & Co. KGaA (previous year: € 2.0 million).\n\nKSB seeks to counter external fraud activities by raising awareness of its employees and through internal controls. At the same time, KSB continues to develop its compliance organisation. Maintaining its competitive advantage and protecting trade and business secrets is of considerable economic significance to the company. The company responds with specific requirements on conduct to take into account the different protection needs.\n\n#### **Other business-specific opportunities and risks – Information technology**\n\nThe worldwide increase in threats to IT security and cyber crime entail a risk in terms of the security of systems and networks, as well as the confidentiality and availability of data. KSB plans to further expand IT security in the years ahead as part of a multi-year programme to continuously extend the protection of the IT systems.\n\nThe digitalisation of processes helps to make them transparent. KSB uses a process mining tool for this purpose. This innovative approach specifically demonstrates the company processes and identifies any weaknesses and where there is room for improvement. This forms the basis for the continuous development of the internal workflows from start to end of a process.\n\n#### **Strategic opportunities and risks**\n\nStrategic risks are uncertainties and threats arising from strategic decisions and the business environment, which can adversely affect a company's long-term performance and competitiveness. They are closely linked with a company's long-term objectives, orientation and success. Strategic risks typically arise from the complexity and dynamics of the business environment. The occurrence of such risks can be farreaching and impact a company's long-term growth, profitability and image, among other things. It is therefore crucial to recognise and evaluate strategic risks in order to take appropriate measures. The strategic risks presented here are longterm in nature and therefore mainly affect time horizons that extend beyond the following financial year.\n\nAs was already described in the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) section, tighter environmental regulations, which will only come into force in a few years' time, can have negative implications for KSB's business. To counter such risks in good time, relevant measures are defined to identify and subsequently eliminate any violations.\n\nIf the continuous monitoring of the current market situation and forecast developments lead to acquisition plans, there is always a risk that these will fail before a contract is concluded. This can result in a loss of planned income within the scope of strategic planning.\n\nLong-term opportunities stem from the fact that hydrogen is playing an increasingly important role in reducing CO2 as a climate-neutral energy source. KSB participates in this technological trend by providing products for use in hydrogen production and storage. This offers opportunities for the Energy Market Area.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nOther potential risks associated with the activities of KSB's employees include dishonest conduct or violations of laws, which could damage the image of KSB.

The KSB Group bases the nature and scope of all financial transactions exclusively on the requirements of its business. It does not lend itself to business of a speculative nature. The aim is to ensure liquidity at all times and to finance activities under optimal conditions. In export business transactions, foreign exchange and credit risks are hedged. KSB continuously improves its receivables management methods with the goal of settling outstanding amounts by their due dates.\n\nKSB is exposed to the following financial risks as a consequence of its business activities.\n\nKSB is exposed to credit risk, which is defined as potential default or delays in the receipt of contractually agreed payments. KSB is also exposed to liquidity risk which is the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its financial obligations, or will be unable to meet them in full. In addition, KSB is exposed to market price risk. Exchange rate or interest rate changes may adversely affect the economic position of the Group. Risks from fluctuations in the prices of financial instruments are not material.\n\nForeign exchange hedges are used to reduce the risks from transactions involving different currencies. These are generally currency forwards, which KSB uses both for transactions that have already been recognised and for future cash flows from orders still to be processed. At year end, the notional volume of currency forwards used to hedge exchange rate risks totalled € 249.9 million (previous year: € 224.0 million). € 179.9 million of this is attributable to KSB SE & Co. KGaA (previous year: € 160.2 million). The hedged currency risk is mainly in US dollars. A global network of production sites in the local sales markets reduces potential currency risks.\n\nAll these risks are limited through an appropriate risk management system, defining how these risks are addressed through guidelines and work instructions. In addition, the current risk characteristics are continuously monitored and the information obtained in this way is provided to the Managing Directors and the Supervisory Board in the form of standardised reports and individual analyses.\n\nFor more information on the three risk areas and the impact on the balance sheet, see the Notes, Section VI. Additional Disclosures on Financial Instruments.\n\n**27** \n\n#### **OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS**\n\nThe assessment of the KSB Group's overall opportunity and risk situation is summarised in a consolidated appraisal. Compared with the previous year, there was no material change in the overall risk situation for KSB, which is essentially measured in terms of value at risk.\n\nMore stringent legal requirements to be met by the materials used in products in order to lower the environmental impact represent the primary risk for the KSB Group. Risks also arise from the future development of current flashpoints, such as Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East. The risk of rising prices of commodities and materials, which was still considered one of the biggest risks at the end of the previous year, has become much less significant due to price adjustments and better availability.\n\nThe risk management system in place as well as the related organisational measures allow KSB Management SE as the legal representative to identify risks in a timely manner and to take adequate measures. The focus of activities in 2024 will be on the material risks described above.

KGaA, as the parent, directly or indirectly holds the shares in the companies belonging to the KSB Group. The KSB Group is managed via KSB SE & Co. KGaA, which is at the same time the Group's largest operative company. The central administrative offices are located at the company's seat (registered office) in Frankenthal; branch operations are located in Bremen, Halle and Pegnitz.\n\nKSB SE & Co. KGaA is associated via control and profit transfer agreements with the following German service companies: KSB Service GmbH, Frankenthal, KSB Service GmbH, Schwedt, Uder Elektromechanik GmbH, Friedrichsthal, Dynamik-Pumpen GmbH, Stuhr, PMS BERCHEM GmbH, Neuss, Pumpen Service Bentz GmbH, Reinbek, and KAGEMA Industrieausrüstungen GmbH, Pattensen. These companies are therefore under single management by KSB SE & Co. KGaA. Their annual earnings are transferred to KSB SE & Co. KGaA.\n\nThe annual financial statements of KSB SE & Co. KGaA have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB) [German Commercial Code] and the Aktiengesetz (AktG) [German Public Companies Act] including the German principles of proper accounting.\n\nDifferences between the accounting methods under HGB and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), which are the basis of preparation for the consolidated financial statements of KSB, arise primarily from the recognition over time of revenue from customer contracts under IFRS 15, in the calculation of pension provisions, from the recognition of leases under IFRS 16 and in the capitalisation of deferred taxes. Furthermore, differences arise in the recognition of assets and liabilities and of income statement items; under HGB there is expanded scope for the recognition of sales revenue.\n\n## **Business Development and Results of Operations**\n\nThe 2023 financial year was defined by global political tensions due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, the China-Taiwan conflict and the outbreak of war in the Gaza region as a result of the attack on Israel. High interest rates led to uncertainty and a decrease in investment. In Germany, the manufacturing industry continued to be challenged by higher gas prices. At the same time, the situation on the procurement markets eased somewhat with regard to price and availability of bought-in parts.\n\nIn Europe, inflation and general uncertainty led to a noticeable slowdown in demand, particularly in the standard business.\n\nThanks to the company's global and broad positioning across several market areas, economic downturns were offset by positive developments.\n\nSales revenue and EBIT under IFRS were significantly higher than in the previous year. Order intake remained largely unchanged. The key performance indicators – order intake, EBIT and sales revenue under IFRS – are, as described in the Control System section, the material financial performance indicators, which are also used for controlling KSB SE & Co. KGaA.\n\n#### **ORDER INTAKE**\n\nThe volume of orders received by KSB SE & Co. KGaA rose by € 5.7 million to € 863.8 million in the reporting year, an increase of 0.7 %. Despite the economic slowdown, which led to a weaker second half of the year, KSB SE Co. KGaA's diversification across numerous regions and markets helped keep the order intake at a high level.\n\n#### **SALES REVENUE**\n\nAt € 996.3 million, total sales revenue under HGB was up € 96.7 million on the prior-year figure of € 899.6 million.\n\nThe disclosures below refer only to sales revenue from the sale of pumps, valves and spare parts as well as services. Sales revenue of € 916.3 million generated in the 2023 financial year represents a year-on-year increase of € 87.5 million (10.6 %).\n\n70.0 % of sales revenue relates to new business with Pumps, 9.4 % to new business with Valves, and 20.6 % to KSB SupremeServ which comprises all the service and spare parts business. The breakdown of sales revenue is broadly similar to that of the previous year.\n\nUnder IFRS, sales revenue rose from € 796.0 million in the previous year to € 884.4 million. This is attributable to improved business in the Standard Markets and higher sales revenue from large-scale projects.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Business Model** \n\nHandelsgesetzbuch\n\nof sales revenue.\n\nKSB Group / Annual Report 2023\n\nAktiengesetz\n\nthe\n\nlocated in Bremen, Halle and Pegnitz.\n\nKSB SE & Co.

This decline was mainly due to lower currency translation gains.\n\nAt € 418.2 million, the cost of materials was almost unchanged from the prior-year level of € 414.8 million. The cost of materials as a percentage of total output of operations fell from 45.1 % in the previous year to 42.6 % in the reporting year. This is due in particular to procurement costs, some of which were slightly lower.\n\nStaff costs increased in absolute terms by € 11.1 million to € 379.7 million. Higher wages and salaries due to the collectively agreed pay adjustment as from June 2023 as well as provisions for profit bonuses and the collectively agreed, one-off payment of the inflation compensation bonus had an impact here. At 38.7%, staff costs as a percentage of total output of operations were down on the previous year's figure of 40.1 %.\n\nOther operating expenses of € 191.1 million showed a marked increase after € 163.5 million in the previous year. In addition to a general increase in costs, additions to provisions for warranties and penalties (€ 16.5 million) and expenses for maintenance of buildings and machinery (€ 4.9 million) contributed significantly to this increase. Expenses from exchange rate losses showed a contrary trend.\n\nOverall, the income from equity investments, at € 61.6 million, was well below the prior-year level (€ 93.3 million). In the 2022 financial year, income of € 37.6 million from the spin-off of the operational business activities at KSB Finanz S.A., Luxembourg, and subsequent integration into KSB SE & Co. KGaA, had been reported under this item. The item includes profit transfers from the German service companies of € 19.0 million (previous year: € 14.6 million) and dividend income from affiliates and equity investments of € 42.7 million.\n\n#### **NET PROFIT / LOSS FOR THE YEAR UNDER HGB**\n\nOperating earnings improved from - € 14.9 million to - € 5.8 million, especially due to the significantly improved total output of operations. Lower finance income / expense had an opposite effect; in the previous year, it included income from the spin-off of the operational business activities at KSB Finanz S.A., Luxembourg, and subsequent integration into KSB SE & Co. KGaA. As a result, KSB SE & Co. KGaA generated a net profit for the year of € 49.4 million in the 2023 financial year; this compares with a net profit of € 53.9 million in the previous year.\n\n#### **EARNINGS BEFORE FINANCE INCOME / EXPENSE AND INCOME TAX (EBIT) UNDER IFRS**\n\nThe EBIT determined in accordance with IFRS improved significantly to € 4.1 million in the 2023 financial year (previous year: € - 6.0 million). The increase in total output of operations at almost constant cost of materials was higher than the offsetting increases in staff costs and other operating expenses.\n\n#### **Financial Position and Net Assets**\n\n#### **FINANCIAL POSITION**\n\nKSB SE & Co. KGaA is embedded within central financial management at the KSB Group. The latter works within the framework of the guidelines laid down by KSB Management SE as the legal representative and bases the nature and scope of all financial transactions exclusively on the requirements of the business. The objective of financial management is to guarantee liquidity at all times and to ensure the financing of activities on optimum terms. In financing export transactions, KSB SE & Co. KGaA hedges foreign exchange and credit risks. KSB continuously improves its receivables management methods with the goal of settling outstanding amounts by their due dates.\n\n#### **LIABILITIES AND PROVISIONS**\n\nThe largest liabilities item, as in the previous year, was pension provisions, which had grown by € 13.0 million to € 517.5 million on the reporting date. Other expenses, at € 128.5 million, were significantly higher than in the previous year (€ 111.0 million). This was due to additions to provisions for warranties.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\n**33** \n\nOf liabilities totalling € 239.5 million (previous year: € 208.2 million), € 68.5 million was accounted for by trade payables at year end (previous year: € 71.5 million). Liabilities towards affiliates and equity investments increased significantly from € 128.4 million in the previous year to € 162.4 million. They include € 132.7 million (previous year: € 100.2 million) for intercompany loans and cash investments.\n\n#### **NET ASSETS**\n\nTotal assets, at € 1,221.8 million, are up 6.6% on the prioryear level of € 1,146.2 million. The cash and balances with credit institutions item posted an increase. An increase in fixed assets was also recorded. This was offset by almost constant inventories and lower receivables.\n\nIn the reporting year, fixed assets made up 45.8 % (previous year: 46.5 %) of total assets. The share accounted for by current assets was 54.2 % after 53.5 % in 2022. Inventories including advance payments received totalled € 215.2 million after € 212.1 million in the previous year.\n\n#### **EQUITY**\n\nThe share capital of KSB SE & Co. KGaA remained at € 44.8 million. The capital reserve was unchanged at € 66.7 million. At year end, € 136.2 million (previous year: € 136.2 million) was assigned to other revenue reserves. Out of the 2022 net retained earnings of € 73.6 million, dividends totalling € 34.4 million (dividend of € 19.50 per ordinary share and € 19.76 per preference share) were distributed by resolution of the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2023. The remaining amount of € 39.3 million was carried forward to new account.\n\n## **Summary of the Performance in the Financial Year**\n\nThe forecasts made at the beginning of the year were partly exceeded due to the global economic development. Order intake was comparable to the previous year. The forecast tangible decrease due to fewer large-scale orders has not materialised. The expectations for considerable growth in sales revenue under IFRS were met, with higher revenue achieved in the Standard Markets. EBIT under IFRS was expected to remain stable at the level of the previous year. However, a strong increase in EBIT was recorded, the reasons for which were explained in more detail in the \"Earnings before finance income / expense and income tax (EBIT) under IFRS\" subsection.\n\n#### **Opportunities and Risks**\n\nThe business performance of KSB SE & Co. KGaA depends significantly on the risks and opportunities faced by the KSB Group, which are set out in detail in the Report on Expected Developments and the Opportunities and Risks Report in the Combined Management Report. KSB SE & Co. KGaA generally shares in the risks of its equity investments and subsidiaries in line with its equity interest.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nOf liabilities totalling € 239.5 million (previous year: € 208.2 million), € 68.5 million was accounted for by trade payables at year end (previous year: € 71.5 million).

The slowdown was due to the restrictive monetary policy measures, which resulted in higher interest rates to curb inflation. The medium-term outlook for economic growth remains the lowest seen in decades. Inflation is expected to fall further, which should lead to a reduction in interest rates in the current year.\n\nWhile the downside risks to this forecast still prevail, they have diminished in view of the resilience of the global economy recently observed. Looking ahead to 2024, inflation risks and the risks of a financial crisis and associated recession risks, in particular, eased over the course of the past year. Geopolitical risks have increased at the same time. Besides current regional conflicts and intensification of the mutual decoupling between the USA and China, the war in Gaza heightened the risk of escalation in the Middle East. Further risks to global economic growth include economic developments in China and its government's approach to addressing the property crisis, as well as possible turbulence on the commodities markets. The latter could be triggered by geopolitical escalation or extreme climatic conditions.\n\nThe IMF is projecting an overall growth rate of + 4.1% for the emerging markets and developing countries.\n\nThe expected growth in the industrialised nations, at + 1.5% in 2024, is lower than in 2023.\n\nGrowth in the euro zone will pick up only slightly to + 0.9%. For Germany, the most recent forecast was for growth of + 0.5%.\n\nGiven the weakening of global economic growth, the growth in demand for capital goods is expected to be lower. The VDMA expects global machinery sales revenue to stagnate at 0 % in real terms. An increase is anticipated at the largest production facilities in Asia, which should offset the decline in the other regions. In China, sales revenue is expected to grow by + 2 %. A decline of – 2 % is expected for the USA. The VDMA forecast for Germany is also for – 2%.\n\nFor manufacturers of liquid pumps in Germany, VDMA foresees a below-average growth of + 0 % in nominal terms in the current year. It predicts a decline of – 1 % for industrial valves. Sales revenue from building services valves is expected to fall by – 2 % in nominal terms.\n\nOverall, KSB SE & Co. KGaA foresees moderate to tangible growth in sales revenue in the 2024 financial year. Sales revenue growth will be supported especially by growth in the Standard Markets and in large-scale projects. Rising orders in the standard business will result in a moderate increase in the order intake of KSB SE Co. KGaA. EBIT under IFRS will rise significantly to sharply compared with the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe forecast horizon for the above-mentioned information and statements is the 2024 financial year.\n\nThe forecast may be influenced in particular by the continuing geopolitical tensions.\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-95-0\"></span>**Acquisition-related Disclosures**\n\nA summary of the acquisition-related disclosures required by Sections 289a and 315a HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch – German Commercial Code] is given below and explanatory information is provided pursuant to Section 176(1) AktG [Aktiengesetz – German Public Companies Act].\n\nThe share capital of KSB SE & Co.

In the Group Compliance Office, the GCO is supported by the Regional Compliance Officers. In addition, there are Local Compliance Offices in place throughout the Group in countries in which KSB Group companies have their registered office; they usually consist of the Local Compliance Officer. Where several Local Compliance Officers are appointed in a country, they may be headed by a Country Compliance Officer.\n\nAn interdisciplinary Compliance Committee at Group headquarters provides advice on fundamental compliance issues as well as support to the Group Compliance Office in fulfilling its responsibilities.\n\nIf employees or third parties become aware of infringements of the KSB Code of Conduct, i.e. in particular violations of laws or company guidelines, they can get in touch with internal contacts or an external ombudsperson with the relevant information, also anonymously if they wish. The ombudsperson will immediately contact the Group Compliance Office with regard to processing such information.\n\nA key focus of compliance activities in 2023 was the renewed analysis of the compliance management system for the areas of anti-corruption and anti-trust / cartel law at central level; such an analysis was last carried out in 2020. The analysis aims to reveal further development potential for existing processes. Support for this was provided by an auditing firm, whose specialists subjected the relevant internal processes to a critical review. Similarly, the specific handling of the aforementioned compliance regulations was analysed at a selected national company, GIW Industries, Inc., USA. The identified potential for improvement and modernisation will be implemented in the current financial year. Another focus was on the implementation of a country-specific risk analysis for specific compliance sub-areas. This served as a preparatory pilot project for a corresponding Groupwide audit, which is planned for the current financial year. In addition, further relevant compliance sub-areas were subject to an annual status control, in some cases also with the help of external support. Compliance training was continued throughout the year for new employees and employees who were transferred internally to relevant functions. The targeted preventive effect of compliance measures is rounded off by the specific review of operative projects for compliance with the regulations.\n\n#### **STATEMENT ON THE APPROPRIATENESS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SYSTEMS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE A.5 DCGK 2022\\* RECOMMENDATION**\n\nThe internal control system, the risk management system and the compliance management system are subject to process-integrated and process-independent monitoring. Responsibility for process-integrated monitoring lies with the relevant Corporate Functions and decentralised units. The Internal Audits department is responsible for processindependent monitoring of the systems.\n\nProcess-independent monitoring of the internal control system comprises an audit of material controls along selected business processes at the level of Corporate Functions and decentralised units. The basis for this is a risk-oriented audit plan of the Internal Audits department, which is updated annually or as needed in a given situation.\n\nInternal Audits also regularly reviews the risk management system for appropriateness and effectiveness on the basis of relevant standards, such as the DIIR Audit Standard No. 2 – Audit of the Risk Management System by Internal Audits.\n\nFinally, the appropriateness and effectiveness of the compliance management system is also continuously monitored by Internal Audits, mainly in the course of general or special audit measures. For example, the application of compliance regulations in the company is monitored in the form of employee surveys or in-depth analysis of relevant operative projects. In addition, selected parts of the compliance management system occasionally undergo external analyses by auditors, which are based on the requirements of IDW PS 980. The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board is always involved in these processes and their findings, in particular to facilitate independent monitoring of the compliance management system by the Committee.\n\nThe Managing Directors are involved in monitoring the appropriateness and effectiveness of the systems by coordinating the specific key areas for the audit by Internal Audits, commissioning external auditors, managing a Group Compliance Office and maintaining regular dialogue with those responsible for the governance systems, among other things.\n\nBased on the continuous findings from the aforementioned monitoring measures, the Managing Directors have no evidence that would call into question the appropriateness and effectiveness of the compliance management system, the risk management system and the internal control system.\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/101/Picture/3 description: The image shows a large, white number 3 against a solid blue background.

GENERAL INFORMATION AND BASIC PRINCIPLES**\n\n#### **General Information on the Group**\n\nKSB SE & Co. KGaA, Frankenthal / Pfalz, Germany, is a capital market-oriented Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien [partnership limited by shares] under the law of the Federal Republic of Germany. The company is registered with the Handelsregister [German Commercial Register] of the Amtsgericht [Local Court] Ludwigshafen am Rhein, registration No. HRB 65657, and has its registered office at Johann-Klein-Straße 9, 67227 Frankenthal / Pfalz, Germany. KSB SE & Co. KGaA was formed from KSB Aktiengesellschaft by entry in the German Commercial Register on 17 January 2018. The general partner is KSB Management SE, a European public limited company. The shares in this company are wholly owned by Klein, Schanzlin & Becker GmbH, Frankenthal / Pfalz. Klein, Schanzlin & Becker GmbH is jointly managed by its two shareholders, the non-profit KSB Stiftung [KSB Foundation], Stuttgart, and the non-profit Kühborth-Stiftung GmbH [Kühborth Foundation], Stuttgart. KSB SE & Co. KGaA and thus the KSB Group are managed via KSB Management SE, which has four Managing Directors and a five-member Administrative Board.\n\nKSB SE & Co. KGaA is the ultimate and immediate parent company whose consolidated financial statements include the single-entity financial statements of KSB SE & Co. KGaA. The consolidated financial statements of KSB SE & Co. KGaA prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU are published in the Bundesanzeiger [German Federal Gazette].\n\nThe KSB Group (hereinafter also called \"KSB\" or the \"Group\") is a global supplier of high-quality pumps, valves and related systems and also provides a wide range of support services to users of these products. The breakdown of the Group's business activities is based on three Segments: Pumps, Valves and KSB SupremeServ.\n\n**7**\n\n#### **Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements**\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of KSB SE & Co. KGaA were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and the additional requirements of German commercial law under Section 315e(1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch – German Commercial Code]. To do so, the Conceptual Framework and all Standards applicable at the reporting date and adopted by the European Commission for use in the EU that are of relevance to the KSB Group as well as the interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee were applied. For the purposes of this document, the term IFRSs includes applicable International Accounting Standards (IASs). The consolidated financial statements of KSB SE & Co. KGaA therefore meet the requirements of the IFRSs as adopted by the EU. The consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with IAS 1.25. On principle, the historical cost is the measurement basis used for the consolidated financial statements, unless Section III. Accounting Policies provides otherwise.\n\nAmounts in this report are generally presented in thousands of euros (€ thousands) using standard commercial rounding rules. Due to rounding, there may be minor differences in the totals and percentages presented in this report.\n\nThe financial year of the companies consolidated is the calendar year.\n\nThe income statement as part of the statement of comprehensive income has been prepared using the nature of expense method.\n\nAll material items of the balance sheet and the income statement are presented separately and explained in these Notes.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\n**9**\n\nThe main accounting policies used to prepare the consolidated financial statements are presented below. The policies described were applied consistently for the reporting periods presented unless stated otherwise.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements, the annual financial statements of the parent company and the combined management report are submitted to and published in the Bundesanzeiger.\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are released by the Managing Directors of KSB Management SE on 12 March 2024 for approval at the meeting of the Supervisory Board on 20 March 2024.\n\n#### **New accounting principles**\n\n#### **a) Accounting principles applied for the first time in the 2023 financial year**\n\nThe new or revised accounting Standards and Interpretations listed below which were adopted for the first time in the reporting year had no or no material impact on the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations.\n\n#### **b) Accounting principles that have been published but that are not yet mandatory**\n\nThe new or revised Accounting Standards and Interpretations listed below were not yet mandatory and were not applied in the 2023 financial year.\n\nAs a matter of principle, the new or revised Standards or Interpretations shown in the table have not been adopted early.

CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES**\n\n#### **Consolidated Group**\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, in addition to KSB SE & Co. KGaA, 10 German and 78 foreign companies (previous year: 9 German and 79 foreign companies) were fully consolidated in the consolidated financial statements. A majority interest is held, either directly or indirectly, in the voting power of these subsidiaries which the KSB Group has the option to control under IFRS 10.\n\nSubsidiaries are companies controlled by the Group. The Group controls a company if it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the company and has the ability to affect those returns through its power of disposition over the company. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the Group's financial statements from the date on which control begins until the date on which control ends. Changes in the investment ratio that do not result in a loss of control are treated as a transaction between shareholders and recognised directly in equity. Such transactions do not result in the recognition of goodwill or the realisation of disposal profits.\n\nThe consolidation principles apply accordingly to the five joint ventures and associated companies accounted for using the equity method as at 31 December 2023. Upon the loss of joint control or significant influence any retained interest in the investee is remeasured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nAssociates are companies in which the Group has significant influence but does not have control or joint control over financial and business policy. A joint venture is an agreement through which the Group exercises joint control, in that it has rights to the net assets of the agreement rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.\n\nThe shares in companies included at-equity are measured at cost of acquisition plus or minus cumulative changes in net assets, with recognised goodwill reported in the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nThe Thai company KSB Pumps Co. Ltd., Bangkok, and the Indian company KSB Limited, Pimpri (Pune), are included in the group of fully consolidated affiliates despite the fact that KSB holds a group share of capital of less than 50 %. KSB does, however, have the power to determine their business and financial policies and thus the level of variable returns.\n\nKSB gained control over KSB Limited, Pimpri (Pune), in which KSB owns 40.54 % of the shares, through contractual agreements with other shareholders. These agreements ensure that KSB has the majority of voting rights in management committees and also exercises control over the budget.\n\nLikewise, KSB exercises control over KSB Pumps Co. Ltd., Bangkok, in which it owns 40 % of the shares, through additional agreements which give KSB the majority of voting rights in management committees and control over the budget.\n\nCompanies that were not consolidated due to there being no material impact are reported as other investments under noncurrent other financial assets.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Changes in the consolidated Group**\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, there were the following changes in the consolidated Group, none of which had a material impact on the Group's assets, financial position and results of operations. Against this background, no further information is provided in this context.\n\nWith regard to the subsidiaries of D.P. Industries B.V. based in Alphen aan den Rijn, the Netherlands, there have been changes under company law. On the one hand, former DP Pompen B.V. now trades under the name KSB Manufacturing Netherlands B.V. On the other hand, DP Pumps B.V. initially was renamed Duijvelaar Pompen B.V. and subsequently the previously separate entities KSB B.V., Duijvelaar Installatiebouw B.V. and DP Service B.V. were merged with it.\n\nThe acquisition by KSB of all shares in DAG - Dieselanlagen Service GmbH, Oberwaltersdorf, Austria, in the 2023 financial year expands the group of fully consolidated companies.\n\nIn addition, KSB Čerpadlá a Armatúry, s.r.o., Bratislava, Slovakia, and TOO \"KSB Kazakhstan\", Almaty, Kazakhstan, which were previously not consolidated due to immateriality, are now included in the Group financial statements as fully consolidated companies.\n\nThe company Vari.Co. GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany, which was acquired in the reporting year, is not consolidated due to immateriality.\n\nIn addition, former KSB FINANZ S.A. based in Echternach, Luxembourg, now trades as KSB FINANZ GmbH based in Frankenthal / Pfalz, Germany, as at the balance sheet date of the reporting year.\n\nA full list of the shareholdings held by the KSB Group is provided at the end of these Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Consolidation methods**\n\nFor the purposes of consolidation, the effects of any intercompany transactions are eliminated in full. Any receivables and liabilities between the consolidated companies are offset against each other, and any unrealised gains and losses recognised in fixed assets and inventories are eliminated. Any revenues from intercompany sales are offset against the corresponding expenses.\n\nCapital consolidation is based on the purchase method of accounting pursuant to IFRS 3. This means that the amortised cost of the parent's shares in the subsidiary is eliminated against the remeasured equity attributable to the parent at the date of acquisition.\n\nAny goodwill created from the application of the purchase method denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the KSB Group is measured at the relevant current closing rate. Goodwill is reported under intangible assets and tested for impairment at least once a year. If an impairment is identified, an impairment loss is recognised. Any excess of our interest in the fair values of net assets acquired over cost is recognised in profit or loss in the year it occurred.\n\nThose shares of subsidiaries' equity not attributable to KSB SE & Co. KGaA are reported as non-controlling interests. Further explanations on non-controlling interests of other shareholders are included under Notes No. 10. Equity.\n\n#### **Currency translation**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in euro (€). Unless otherwise stated, amounts in this report are presented in thousands of euros (€ thousands) using standard commercial rounding rules.\n\nCurrency translation is effected on the basis of the functional currency of the consolidated companies. As in the previous year, the functional currency is exclusively the local currency of the company consolidated, as it operates as a financially, economically and organisationally independent entity.\n\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the individual companies at the rate prevailing when the transaction is initially recognised. Monetary assets and liabilities are subsequently measured at the closing rate. Measurement effects are recognised in the income statement.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Changes in the consolidated Group** \n\nprovided in this context.\n\nconsolidated companies.\n\nimmateriality.\n\nthe reporting year.\n\nstatements.\n\nKSB Group / Annual Report 2023\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, there were the following changes in the consolidated Group, none of which had a material impact on the Group's assets, financial position and results of operations.

An exception to this, with a translation of the income statement items at the closing rate, results from the application of IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Countries, as explained in greater detail below. Gains and losses from the translation of items of assets and liabilities compared with their translation in the previous year are taken directly to equity in other comprehensive income and reported under currency translation differences.\n\nThe exchange rates of the most important currencies for the KSB Group at the reporting date and on an annual average are presented in the table below.\n\n#### **Hyperinflation**\n\n**11**\n\nArgentina and Turkey have been classified as hyperinflationary economies for accounting purposes since 2018 and 2022 respectively. Accordingly, IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies has since been applied to the translation of the financial statements of KSB Compañía Sudamericana de Bombas S.A., Carapachay (Buenos Aires), Argentina, and KSB-Pompa, Armatür Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S., Ankara, Turkey.\n\nAs a result, the activities of the two said subsidiaries are not accounted for on the basis of historical acquisition and production costs, but are adjusted for the effects of inflation by using country-specific price indices. The inflation adjustment to the financial statements of the Argentine subsidiary is based on the consumer price index IPC (Índice de precios al consumidor), which was at 3,520.10 on 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 1,134.59; 1 January 2022: 582.02). The con-sumer price index TÜFE (Tüketici fiyat endeksi) is used to adjust for inflation in the financial statements of the Turkish subsidiary; the value applied at the reporting date was 1,859.38 (31 December 2022: 1,128.45; 1 January 2022: 686.95).\n\nThe net loss from monetary depreciation to be taken into account under IAS 29 on the affected monetary assets and liabilities, amounting to € 6,872 thousand (previous year: € 4,628 thousand), is included in the income statement under other financial expenses within finance income / expense.\n\nAfter applying the inflation adjustment, the balance sheet and income statement items are translated into the reporting currency (euro) at the closing rate for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Exchange rates of the most important currencies**\n\n|                | Closing rate |              | Average rate |         |\n|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------|\n|                | 31 Dec. 2023 | 31 Dec. 2022 | 2023         | 2022    |\n| US dollar      | 1.1050       | 1.0666       | 1.0813       | 1.0531  |\n| Brazilian real | 5.3618       | 5.6386       | 5.4010       | 5.4399  |\n| Indian rupee   | 91.9045      | 88.1710      | 89.3001      | 82.6864 |\n| Chinese yuan   | 7.8509       | 7.3582       | 7.6600       | 7.0788  |\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### KSB Group / Annual Report 2023\n\n#### **III. ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n#### **1. General accounting policies**\n\n#### **Acquisition and production costs**\n\nIn addition to the purchase price, acquisition cost includes attributable incidental costs (except for costs associated with the acquisition of a company) and subsequent expenditure. Purchase price reductions are deducted.\n\nAs well as directly allocated costs, production costs also include reasonable proportions of material and production overheads based on standard capacity utilisation of the relevant production facilities, if and to the extent these were incurred as part of the production process. This also includes production-related administrative expenses. General administrative expenses, research costs and selling expenses are not capitalised.\n\nBorrowing costs as defined in IAS 23 that can be directly allocated to the acquisition or production of qualifying assets are capitalised. As in the previous year no such borrowing costs were incurred.\n\n#### **Fair value**\n\nFair value is the price that independent market participants would, under standard market conditions, receive when selling an asset or pay when transferring a liability at the measurement date. This applies irrespectively of whether the price is directly observable or has been estimated using a measurement method.\n\nThe KSB Group defined a monitoring framework concept for determining fair value. This includes the monitoring of all material measurements at fair value and the direct communication of material facts to Management and, if necessary, to the audit committee. For the purposes of calculating fair value, KSB makes use wherever possible of estimates from market participants or estimates derived from these. As an initial step, regular checks are made to ascertain if there are current prices on active markets for an identical transaction. If no quoted market prices are available, the preference is to use the marketbased approach (deriving the fair value from the market or transaction prices of comparable assets, for example multipliers) or the income-based approach (calculation of fair value as a future value by discounting future cash surpluses).\n\nBased upon the input factors used in the measurement methods, fair values are assigned to different levels of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n- Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) on active markets for identical assets and liabilities\n- Level 2: Measurement parameters that are not the quoted prices taken into account for level 1, but that are observable for the asset or the liability either directly as a price or indirectly derived from prices\n- Level 3: Measurement parameters for assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data\n\nIf input factors categorised into different levels are included in the fair value measurement, the measurement must be categorised in its entirety in the level of the lowest level input factor that is material for the entire measurement.\n\nReclassifications between different levels in the fair value hierarchy are recognised at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.\n\n#### **Maturities**\n\nMaturities of up to one year are classified as current.\n\nAssets that can only be realised after more than twelve months, as well as liabilities that only become due after more than twelve months, are also classified as current if they are attributable to the operating cycle defined in IAS 1.

When the contractual right to payments from financial assets expires, these are derecognised. Financial liabilities are derecognised at the time when the contractual obligations are settled or cancelled or have expired. The acquisition and sale of financial instruments on an arm's length basis are recognised at the value at the date of settlement.

Financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value are recognised after adjustment for transaction costs. Subsequent measurement is in line with the measurement category allocated to the financial asset or financial liability.\n\nThe fair value option is not being used at the moment.\n\n#### **b) Derivatives**\n\n**13**\n\nDerivatives are exclusively used for hedging purposes. Future cash flows and existing recognised underlyings are hedged against foreign currency and interest rate risks. The hedging instruments used are exclusively currency forwards and interest rate derivatives entered into with prime-rated banks. Interest rate risks are minimised for long-term borrowings at floating rates of interest. Group guidelines govern the use of these instruments. These transactions are also subject to continuous risk monitoring.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are categorised as at fair value through profit or loss unless they are part of hedge accounting. In the case of designated cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the effective portions of the currency derivatives are recognised under other comprehensive income and reported under \"Changes in the fair value of financial instruments\" in equity for as long as the underlying transaction is not recognised in the income statement. Only the spot element of the derivative hedging instrument is designated, while the forward element and currency basis spreads are excluded from the hedge and reported separately in the hedging cost reserve in other comprehensive income. Any ineffectiveness and changes in the market value of currency forwards not designated as hedges are recognised in the income statement.\n\nChanges in the fair value of interest rate derivatives used to hedge against interest rate risks in liabilities are recognised under other comprehensive income and presented under \"Changes in the fair value of financial instruments\" in equity.\n\nThe carrying amounts equal fair value and are determined on the basis of input factors observable either directly (as a price) or indirectly (derived from prices). Fair values may be positive or negative. Fair value is the amount that KSB would receive or have to pay at the reporting date to settle the financial instrument. This amount is determined using the relevant exchange rates, interest rates and counterparty credit ratings at the reporting date. Information is obtained solely from recognised external sources.\n\nCurrency forwards are reported under other financial assets and under other financial liabilities. This also applies in principle to interest rate swaps, where applicable.\n\n#### **2. Specific accounting policies**\n\n#### **Intangible assets**\n\nIntangible assets are recognised at (acquisition or production) cost and reduced by straight-line amortisation. Depreciation / amortisation is reported under \"Depreciation / amortisation\" in the income statement. The underlying useful life of intangible assets – excluding goodwill (indefinite useful life) – is between 2 and 15 years. If an intangible asset's recoverable amount is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment testing is carried out at least once a year for goodwill, other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets under development at the reporting date. In addition, all types of intangible assets are subject to impairment testing if there are indications as defined in IAS 36 of a possible impairment. If the reasons for an impairment loss in a previous period no longer apply, it is reversed up to a maximum of amortised cost (write-up), with the exception of goodwill.\n\nGoodwill is scheduled to be tested for impairment once a year. The test relates to cash-generating units (CGUs). The cashgenerating units are generally represented by the respective share in a legal entity that is allocated to an operating segment. The Group's total of five operating segments encompass Energy, Mining and Standard Markets for new business with Pumps, new business with Valves and KSB SupremeServ. A legal entity contains several cash-generating units if the main business activities are spread over several operating segments. Further details on KSB's segmentation are provided in Section VIII. Segment Reporting in these Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management\n\nThe goodwill is reduced by the difference in value or down to zero at maximum if the value in use is lower than the carrying amount of the CGU. If the difference exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill, further impairment testing is required at the level of intangible assets, rights to use leased assets and property, plant and equipment. Reversal of an impairment loss from an earlier period is not possible for goodwill.\n\nThe discounted cash flow model is used to determine the recoverable amount (value in use). The future earnings (EBIT in accordance with IFRS) applied are taken from a multi-year financial plan (five years), based on the 30 September reporting date taking into account the medium-term strategy approved by Management for the respective cash-generating unit. This planning is carried out based on certain assumptions which are drawn from both forecasts from external sources, e.g. current German Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA) publications, and own experience-based knowledge of markets and competitors. The earnings of the last plan year are consistently extrapolated as a constant, if that level is considered to be achievable in the long term. Growth rates are derived taking account of the estimates with regard to economic circumstances. The Group regularly tests goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of every year based on the figures as per 30 September of the year in question. In addition, a review of impairment is always carried out when events or circumstances (\"trigger events\") suggest that the value could be impaired.\n\nIn order to assess the risk of impairment of material goodwill, the Group also performs sensitivity analyses as part of its impairment testing. To this end, changes deemed possible in material assumptions underlying the calculation of the value in use are taken into account.\n\nWhen companies are acquired, purchase price allocations are made and the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is determined. In addition to the assets and liabilities already recognised by the selling party, account is also taken of marketing-related aspects (primarily brands or trademarks and competitive restrictions), customer-related aspects (primarily customer lists, customer relations and orders on hand), contract-related aspects (mainly particularly advantageous service, work, purchasing and employment contracts) as well as technology-related aspects (primarily patents, know-how and databases). The residual value method, the excess earnings method and cost-oriented procedures are primarily applied to determine values.\n\nDevelopment costs are capitalised as internally generated intangible assets at cost where the criteria described in IAS 38 are met and reduced by straight-line amortisation as from the time the asset becomes operational. Research costs are expensed as incurred. Where research and development costs cannot be reliably distinguished within a project, no costs are capitalised.\n\n#### **Leases**\n\nAccording to IFRS 16, a contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nFor leases where KSB is the lessee, lease liabilities and right-ofuse assets (rights to use leased assets) must be recognised on the balance sheet. Leases of low value assets and short-term leases with a term of up to 12 months are exempt from this provision as KSB has elected to make use of the practical expedient of accounting for lease payments as an expense. In this context, leased assets with a fair value of up to € 5,000 are defined as low-value assets.\n\nLease liabilities and right-of-use assets are generally recognised at the time at which the leased asset is made available to KSB by the lessor for use. The carrying amount of the two items is essentially based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments. It is discounted using the incremental borrowing rate of KSB if no interest rate implicitly underlying the lease is available. Extension and termination options are included in the term and the carrying amounts of a lease if it is deemed reasonably certain that they will be exercised by KSB. Only lease components and in particular no separate service components are taken into account in the measurement of lease payments. The right-of-use assets are depreciated over the economic useful life of the leased asset or over the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method in the form of a redemption and interest portion. Changes in lease payments are taken into account through remeasurements of lease liabilities. The interest expense for the lease liability and depreciation / amortisation expense for the right-of-use asset are recognised separately.\n\n#### **Property, plant and equipment**\n\nIn accordance with IAS 16, property, plant and equipment is measured at cost and reduced by straight-line depreciation over its useful life. If an asset's recoverable amount is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment testing of property, plant and equipment is always carried out if there are indications as defined in IAS 36 of a\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\nDevelopment costs are capitalised as internally generated intangible assets at cost where the criteria described in IAS 38 are met and reduced by straight-line amortisation as from the time the asset becomes operational.

If the reasons for an impairment loss recognised in a previous period no longer apply, the impairment loss is reversed (write-up) up to a maximum of amortised cost.\n\nGovernment grants relating to property, plant and equipment are transferred to an adjustment item on the liabilities side. This item is reversed pro rata over the useful life of the subsidised assets and recognised as other income.\n\nMaintenance expenses are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, unless they lead to the expansion or material improvement of the asset concerned.\n\nAs in the previous year, the following useful lives are applied:\n\n#### **Useful life of property, plant and equipment**\n\n| Buildings                                       | 10 to 50 years |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Plant and machinery                             | 5 to 25 years  |\n| Other equipment, operating and office equipment | 3 to 25 years  |\n\n#### **Non-current financial assets**\n\nInterest-bearing loans are recognised at amortised cost, whereas non-current financial instruments are recognised in the income statement at fair value as at the reporting date. Financial assets such other cash deposits are subject to an expected default risk. The impairment loss is calculated based on the loan amount on the closing or reporting date, the loss ratio of the loan amount and the term-weighted credit default spreads as a benchmark for probability of failure. Furthermore, partial or complete impairment is recognised as soon as there are signs of an increase in default risk.\n\n#### **Non-current other non-financial assets**\n\n**15**\n\nInvestments in non-consolidated subsidiaries are measured at amortised cost.\n\nDefined benefit assets are recognised at the amount by which the fair value of the plan assets exceeds the related defined benefit obligation, less the effects of the asset ceiling in accordance with IAS 19.\n\n#### **Investments accounted for using the equity method**\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method are companies in which the parties exercise joint control (joint venture) or have the power to exercise significant influence over the companies' operating and financial policies (associate); this is usually the case where an entity holds between 20 % and 50 % of the voting power. These assets are recognised at cost at the time of acquisition. If the costs of acquisition exceed the share of the net assets, adjustments are made on the basis of the fair value (pro rata hidden reserves and liabilities). The remaining amount is recognised as goodwill. It forms part of the carrying amount of the joint venture or associate and is not amortised. For subsequent measurement, the carrying amounts are increased / reduced annually by the pro-rata earnings, distributed dividends or other changes in equity of the joint venture or the associate. If local accounting principles differ from the Group's standard accounting policies, adjustments are made accordingly. The share of earnings is reported in the consolidated income statement in a separate line (earnings from investments accounted for using the equity method), and changes such as currency translation effects are taken directly to Group equity. If the losses attributable to the KSB Group correspond to the carrying amount of the company or exceed this, they are not recognised unless KSB has entered into obligations or has made payments for the company. Intercompany gains and losses from transactions between Group companies and investments accounted for using the equity method are offset against the carrying amount in profit or loss. At each reporting date, a review is carried out to determine whether there are any objective indications of impairment, and the amount of such impairment is calculated if required. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount of an investment, it is written down to the recoverable amount. Any impairments or reversals of impairments are reported in the consolidated income statement under finance income / expense.\n\n#### **Inventories**\n\nPursuant to IAS 2, inventories are recognised at the lower of cost and net realisable value as at the reporting date. Cost is measured using the weighted average method. KSB takes account of the inventory risks resulting from slow-moving goods or impaired marketability through write-downs to the net realisable value. This also applies if the selling price is lower than production cost plus costs still to be incurred. If the reasons for an impairment loss charged in a previous period no longer apply, the impairment loss is reversed (write-up).\n\nAdvance payments made on inventories are also presented under inventories because of the correlation and expected realisation of these advances (through conversion into inventories) within the normal business cycle.\n\n#### **Contract assets and contract liabilities**\n\nA contract asset shows KSB's claim to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to customers, with the right to payment being not only conditional on the passage of time but also on the satisfaction of an overall contractual performance obligation by KSB. By contrast, receivables \n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\nreflect KSB's unqualified claim to consideration. A contract liability also represents KSB's obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer. However, in these cases KSB has already received consideration from a customer that exceeds the amount of the goods or services provided. Contract assets relate to ongoing projects that have not yet been invoiced and are subject to similar credit risks as trade receivables for the same types of contract. Against this background, the expected loss ratios of trade receivables are also used for the risk provision for expected credit loss (ECL) of contract assets determined using the simplified impairment model. If it becomes apparent to KSB at the respective project stage that it is sufficiently likely that customers will default on payments, these risks are taken into account by appropriate individual impairment allowances for the contract assets concerned.\n\n#### **Trade receivables**\n\nTrade receivables and other current assets are subsequently recognised at amortised cost. Low-interest or non-interestbearing receivables are discounted. In addition, identifiable risks are taken into account by charging individual impairment losses. Individual impairment allowances are regularly made if insolvency or collection proceedings have been instigated, on the default or failure to meet agreed repayment plans and on overdue payments. Receivables are derecognised if it is reasonably certain that payment cannot be expected. A risk provision for expected credit losses (ECL) is set aside under the simplified impairment model according to IFRS 9 for receivables that are not individually impaired. To measure expected credit losses, trade receivables are summarised on the basis of common credit risk features (risk classes) and number of days overdue. The expected default rates stem from the historical payment profiles of sales revenues over the last three financial years before the reporting date. The historical and forward-looking information forms the basis for the expected probability of failure, adjusted for future-oriented macroeconomic factors.\n\nPart of the default risk exposure of trade receivables is hedged. For more information, please refer to Section VI. Additional Information on Financial Instruments\" – sub-section \"Financial risks – Credit risk\".\n\nFor trade receivables for which collateral, such as credit insurance, has been provided or letters of credit have been opened, a risk provision is set aside, taking account of default risks of the provider of the security and the company's macroeconomic factors.\n\nIf the reasons for an impairment loss charged in a previous period no longer apply, the impairment loss is reversed (writeup).\n\n#### **Other non-financial assets**\n\nThe prepayments made that are presented in this item relate to accrued expenditure prior to the reporting date that will only be classified as an expense after the reporting date.\n\n#### **Cash and cash equivalents**\n\nCash (cash and sight deposits) and cash equivalents (shortterm, highly liquid financial investments that are readily convertible to defined amounts of cash, and that are subject to only immaterial fluctuations in terms of their value) are recognised at amortised cost. Cash and cash equivalents are subject to an expected credit default risk. The impairment allowance under IFRS 9 is calculated based on the loan amount on the closing date, the loss ratio of the loan amount and the term-weighted credit default spreads as a benchmark for probability of failure. Furthermore, partial or complete impairment allowances are recognised as soon as there are signs of an increase in default risk.\n\n#### **Taxes on income**\n\nCurrent taxes on income are recognised in income tax liabilities to the extent that they have not yet been paid. If the amount already paid exceeds the amount owed, an income tax receivable is recognised and reported in other tax assets under other non-financial assets.\n\nDeferred taxes are accounted for in accordance with IAS 12 using the balance sheet liability method on the basis of the enacted or substantively enacted local tax rates. This means that deferred tax assets and liabilities generally arise when the tax base of assets and liabilities differs from their carrying amount in the IFRS financial statements, and this leads to future tax expense or income. KSB recognises deferred tax assets from tax loss carryforwards in those cases where it is more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable profit available in the near future against which these tax loss carryforwards can be utilised. Deferred taxes are also recognised for consolidation adjustments. Deferred taxes are not discounted. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always offset where they relate to the same tax authority. Changes to deferred taxes in the consolidated balance sheet generally result in deferred tax expense or income. If, however, a direct entry is made in other comprehensive income in equity, the change in deferred taxes is also taken directly to equity.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Provisions**\n\nIf the reasons for an impairment loss charged in a previous period no longer apply, the impairment loss is reversed (write-\n\nThe prepayments made that are presented in this item relate to accrued expenditure prior to the reporting date that will only\n\nCash (cash and sight deposits) and cash equivalents (shortterm, highly liquid financial investments that are readily convertible to defined amounts of cash, and that are subject to only immaterial fluctuations in terms of their value) are recognised at amortised cost.

A contract liability also represents KSB's obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer. However, in these cases KSB has already received consideration from a customer that exceeds the amount of the goods or services provided. Contract assets relate to ongoing projects that have not yet been invoiced and are subject to similar credit risks as trade receivables for the same types of contract. Against this background, the expected loss ratios of trade receivables are also used for the risk provision for expected credit loss (ECL) of contract assets determined using the simplified impairment model. If it becomes apparent to KSB at the respective project stage that it is sufficiently likely that customers will default on payments, these risks are taken into account by appropriate individual impairment allowances for the contract assets concerned.\n\nTrade receivables and other current assets are subsequently recognised at amortised cost. Low-interest or non-interestbearing receivables are discounted. In addition, identifiable risks are taken into account by charging individual impairment losses. Individual impairment allowances are regularly made if insolvency or collection proceedings have been instigated, on the default or failure to meet agreed repayment plans and on overdue payments. Receivables are derecognised if it is reasonably certain that payment cannot be expected. A risk provision for expected credit losses (ECL) is set aside under the simplified impairment model according to IFRS 9 for receivables that are not individually impaired. To measure expected credit losses, trade receivables are summarised on the basis of common credit risk features (risk classes) and number of days overdue. The expected default rates stem from the historical payment profiles of sales revenues over the last three financial years before the reporting date. The historical and forward-looking information forms the basis for the expected probability of failure, adjusted for future-oriented macro-\n\nPart of the default risk exposure of trade receivables is hedged.

They are based on defined benefit pension plans. They are measured using the projected unit credit method.\n\nActuarial gains and losses are taken directly to other comprehensive income and reported in equity under \"Remeasurement of defined benefit plans\". The actuarial demographic assumptions and the setting of the discount rate (based on senior, fixed-income corporate bonds) and other measurement parameters (for example income and pension trends) are based on best estimates.\n\nNet interest is calculated by multiplying the discount rate with the net liability (pension obligation minus plan assets) or the net asset value that results if the plan assets exceed the pension obligation.\n\nThe defined benefit costs include the service cost, which is included in staff costs under pension costs, and the net interest income or expense on the net liability or net asset value, which is recognised in finance income / expense under interest and similar expenses or under interest and similar income.\n\nDefined benefit assets are reported under non-current other non-financial assets.\n\nNo provisions are set aside for defined contribution pension plans. In these cases, the premium payments are recognised directly in staff costs in the income statement. Other than an obligation to pay premiums, KSB has no further obligations. Consequently, the insurance risk remains with the insured parties.\n\n#### **b) Other provisions**\n\n**17**\n\nProvisions are recognised if an event that occurred by the reporting date of the respective financial year results in a present legal or constructive external obligation that the company has no realistic alternative to settling, where settlement of this obligation is expected to result in an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits, and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. The amount of the provision corresponds to the best estimate of the settlement amount of the current obligation on the reporting date. Any more or less secure recourse or reimbursement claims are recognised as separate assets.\n\nObligations in the form of expected losses from onerous contracts are recognised if the unavoidable costs to KSB of fulfilling a contract exceed the expected economic benefits. In the case of customer contracts that are expected to be lossmaking, first an impairment of contract-related inventories is recognised before additional provisions are recognised. In contrast, contract assets are reported gross on the one hand and provisions for expected losses from onerous customer contracts are recognised on the other hand.\n\nProvisions for restructurings are recognised only if the criteria set out in IAS 37 are met.\n\nNon-current provisions are discounted if the effects are material.\n\n#### **Contingent liabilities**\n\nContingent liabilities, which are not recognised, are potential obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future events. Contingent liabilities may also be present obligations that arise from past events where it is possible but not probable that there will be an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits.\n\nContingent liabilities correspond to the extent of liability at the reporting date.\n\n#### **Sales revenue**\n\nKSB generates sales revenue from the sale of goods and goods purchased and held for resale from the production, sale and trade of machinery, systems and other industrial products, particularly pumps and valves and related support services. The breadth of orders with pumps ranges from the supply of an individual pump to customised pump sets, including drive and control systems. These goods and services are sold to engineering contractors, OEMs and end users or, in some cases, distributed via dealers. Some customer contracts contain several service components, such as manufacture of a pump and the related installation and commissioning. These installation services cover integration services and can only be carried out by specifically trained and qualified staff. They are not accounted for as independent performance obligations and the transaction price is not split.\n\nSales revenue is recognised in the amount of the consideration expected by KSB based on the transfer of goods or provision of services to the customer. Depending on the type of performance and contractual structure, sales revenue is recognised either over time or at a point in time in line with satisfaction of the performance obligation by KSB.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management\n\nIf a performance obligation meets the criteria for recognising sales revenue over time under IFRS 15 and the progress towards completion and expected consideration can be reliably estimated, the sales revenue is recognised based on progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. KSB specifically recognises sales revenue over time for contracts covering the production of customised pumps and valves as well as contracts for the provision of services. By contrast, standard products in the pumps and valves areas are typically subject to sales revenue recognition at a point in time. KSB applies the input-oriented method to determine progress that is measured by the factors used. The percentage of completion of contracts is determined on the basis of the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed up to the reporting date bear to the estimated total contract costs at the reporting date and thus follows the cost-to-cost method. Contract revenue consists of all contractually agreed revenues, as well as additional claims and incentive payments that are likely to result in revenue and are capable of being reliably measured. Contract revenue may vary, for instance because of renegotiations or penalties. Sales revenue is accounted for based on the amount fixed in the contract less expected consideration. Variable considerations (penalties, bonuses) are estimated at the most likely value. Restrictions on estimate options are taken into account. Estimates on costs and contract progress are corrected if circumstances change. Any resultant increases or reductions in the estimated proceeds or costs are reflected in the profit and loss account for the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the correction occurred. If the earnings from a service or production order with sales revenue recognition over time cannot be reliably estimated, revenue will only be recognised in the amount of the contract costs incurred that are likely to be covered and the contract costs recognised as an expense for the period in which they are incurred.\n\nSales revenue is recognised at a point in time for performance obligations that do not meet the criteria for recognising sales revenue over time under IFRS 15. At KSB, this typically applies in particular to standard products without any significant customer-specific characteristic in the Pumps and Valves segments. At the time of revenue recognition, receipt of the consideration must be probable and the amount of sales revenue must be reliably measurable. A reliable estimation of the associated costs and potential return of the goods must also be possible. The point in time at which KSB satisfies the performance obligations from contracts with customers subject to sales revenue recognition at a point in time is generally based on the agreed delivery terms and conditions (INCOTERMS). For certain deliveries and services, a declaration of acceptance by the customer is required for the recognition of sales revenue. The Group generally aims to agree on delivery terms and conditions with the earliest possible transfer of risk. For customer contracts based on sales revenue recognised at a point in time, sales reductions also reduce sales revenue.\n\nKSB agrees payment terms and conditions for customer contracts that allow for payment in a reasonable period after the invoice has been issued. Extended payment terms are not usually granted to customers. There are usually no long-term financing components.\n\nIn individual cases and in compliance with the statutory requirements of IFRS 15, a customer may ask to obtain control of a product prior to delivery of the goods (bill-and-hold arrangements). This can result in earlier sales revenue recognition.\n\nFor regular fixed-price contracts, the customer pays a fixed amount using a payment plan. Depending on the ratio of the customer payments received to the claim to consideration acquired by KSB based on the transfer of goods and services to the customer, there is an advance or subsequent type of payment on the reporting date for the respective customer contract. Contract assets are reported reduced by advances received, if the amount of the goods and services provided by KSB exceed the payment amount. Payments received from the customer that exceed the amount of the goods and services provided by KSB for the respective customer contract result in the reporting of a contract liability.\n\n#### **Other income statement items**\n\nInterest income and expense are recognised in the period in which they occur. Dividend income from investments is collected when the legal entitlement to payment is created. Operating expenses are recognised when they are incurred or when the services are utilised. Income tax is calculated in accordance with the statutory tax rules in the countries in which the Group operates. Deferred taxes are accounted for on the basis of the enacted or substantively enacted income tax rates.\n\n#### **3. Significant judgements, estimates and assumptions**\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting policies to be applied. When implementing such accounting policies, estimates and assumptions affect the assets, liabilities, income and expenses recognised in the consolidated financial statements, and their presentation.\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\nrecognition of sales revenue.

At KSB, this typically applies in particular to standard products without any significant customer-specific characteristic in the Pumps and Valves segments. At the time of revenue recognition, receipt of the consideration must be probable and the amount of sales revenue must be reliably measurable. A reliable estimation of the associated costs and potential return of the goods must also be possible. The point in time at which KSB satisfies the performance obligations from contracts with customers subject to sales revenue recognition at a point in time is generally based on the agreed delivery terms and conditions (INCOTERMS). For certain deliveries and services, a declaration of acceptance by the customer is required for the These estimates and assumptions are based on past experience and a variety of other factors deemed appropriate under the circumstances. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions made are constantly reviewed. If more recent information and additional knowledge are available, recognised amounts are adjusted to reflect the new circumstances. Any changes in estimates and assumptions that result in material differences are explained separately.\n\n#### **Recoverability of intangible assets, right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment**\n\nImpairment tests for goodwill, which are conducted at least once per year, require an estimate of the recoverable amounts for each cash-generating unit (CGU). These correspond to the higher amount from the fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The earnings forecast on the basis of these estimates are affected by various factors, which may include exchange rate fluctuations, progress in Group integration or the expectations for the economic development of these units. Although management believes that the assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount are appropriate, any unforeseen changes in these assumptions could lead to an impairment loss.\n\nEstimates and assumptions must also be made when testing the impairment of other intangible assets, the rights to use leased assets and property, plant and equipment. For each asset it must be verified to what extent there are indications of an impairment. When determining the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment, the estimation of the relevant useful life is subject to uncertainty.\n\n#### **Net realisable value of inventories**\n\n**19**\n\nDetermining the net realisable value of inventories requires, in particular, estimates of the further marketability of the inventory items and the future development of market prices on the sales markets of KSB in relation to the needed production costs. If the actual development in a later period differs from the original estimates, this may result in an additional impairment requirement for the inventory items or in the reversal of impairments.\n\n#### **Impairments on contract assets and trade receivables**\n\nContract assets and trade receivables are subject to the impairment rules of IFRS 9. The assessments that KSB makes regarding customers' solvency are of central importance here. Depending on the actual payment behaviour of customers, actual defaults on receivables may exceed the impairment losses recognised in previous periods, or impairments may be reversed.\n\n#### **Actuarial assumptions for the measurement of provisions for employee benefits**\n\nProvisions for employee benefits, in particular provisions for pensions and similar obligations, are determined according to actuarial principles. These are based on statistical and other factors so as to anticipate future events. Material factors are the reported market discount rates and life expectancy. The actuarial assumptions made may differ from actual developments as a result of changing market and economic conditions, and this can have material effects on the amount of provisions and thus on the company's overall net assets, financial position and results of operations. For the material pension plans of the German companies, every employee is entitled to apply at any time during the ongoing employment contract for payment in annual instalments, as a one-time payment or as a pension for life. KSB's estimate as to how the specific workforce is likely to decide on exercising the lumpsum option is reviewed on a regular basis and is reflected accordingly in the measurement of pension provisions.\n\n#### **Recognition and measurement of other provisions**\n\nProvisions are recognised for uncertain liabilities with a probability of occurrence of more than 50 %. The provision corresponds to the best estimate of the expenditure to fulfil the current obligation on the reporting date. The later, actual outflow can, however, differ from the estimate as a result of changed economic, political or legal conditions. This will be reflected in additional expenses or income from reversals.\n\n#### **Estimates in connection with the accounting treatment of income taxes**\n\nThe Group's global scope of activities must be taken into account in relation to taxes on income. Based on operative activities in numerous countries with varying tax laws and administrative interpretation, differentiated assessment is required for determining tax liabilities. Uncertainty may arise due to different interpretations by taxable entities on the one hand and local finance authorities on the other. Uncertain tax assets and liabilities are recognised if their probability of occurrence exceeds 50 %. The best estimate of the expected tax payment is used for reporting purposes; depending on the case in question this will take the form of the most probable result or of the expected value. Although KSB believes it has made a reasonable estimate regarding any tax uncertainties, it is possible that the actual tax obligation will differ from the original estimate.\n\nWith regard to future tax benefits, KSB assesses their realisability as at every reporting date. For this reason, deferred tax assets are only recognised if sufficient taxable income is available in future. In assessing this future taxable income within the planning horizon of three to five years it must be\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\n**21**\n\ntaken into account that expected future business developments are subject to uncertainties and are in some cases excluded from control by company management (for example changes to applicable tax legislation). If KSB comes to the conclusion that previously reported deferred tax assets cannot be realised because of changed assumptions, then the assets will be written down by the appropriate amount.\n\n#### **Sales revenue recognition over time**\n\nIf performance obligations meet the relevant criteria of IFRS 15, KSB recognises revenue from customer contracts over time in line with progress towards completion. The progress towards completion is determined according to the percentage of completion. This requires estimates regarding the total contract costs and revenue including the variable considerations of contract risks as well as other relevant factors. These estimates take into account the empirical values of KSB and are reviewed regularly by those with operative responsibility and adjusted where necessary.\n\n#### **Consideration of sustainability issues (ESG)**\n\nIn connection with the ESG sustainability issues – Environmental (E), Social (S) and corporate Governance (G) – estimates are required in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements with regard to the effects on the financial statements. ESG-related aspects did not have a material impact on KSB's net assets, financial position and results of operations in the reporting year. For further information in this context, please refer to the Group's opportunities and risks report as part of the combined management report.\n\n#### **Geopolitical and macroeconomic developments**\n\nThe business activities of the KSB Group take place in an increasingly complex and uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. In particular, the war in Ukraine, the conflicts in the Middle East and especially in the Gaza region, and the China-Taiwan conflict are global flashpoints of key importance for the global economy. The overall picture of the Group's economic environment is characterised by ongoing inflation, increased interest rates as well as volatile share prices and exchange rates. All of these uncertainties are fuelling concerns about a medium-term slowdown in global economic growth in key markets.\n\nThe geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties accompanying the above-mentioned aspects require a high degree of discretionary assessments and assumptions with regard to their future development and impact on the consolidated financial statements of KSB.

As in the previous year, there are no restrictions on ownership or use.\n\nThe increase of € 1,405 thousand in the acquisition costs for goodwill in the \"Other\" line results from the acquired goodwill as part of the acquisition of DAG - Dieselanlagen Service GmbH, Oberwaltersdorf (Austria).\n\n**21**\n\nKSB reported internally generated intangible assets of € 32,788 thousand (previous year: € 32,514 thousand). These are primarily attributable to the KSBase sales software.\n\nIn the reporting year, impairment losses on intangible assets amounting to € 786 thousand (previous year: € 1,715 thousand) were recognised, of which € 678 thousand related to goodwill (previous year: € 1,715 thousand). The impairment losses were recognised in the income statement under depreciation and amortisation expense. Further details on the goodwill impairments are provided in the following explanations on impairment testing under IAS 36.\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\n**23**\n\nAs in the previous year, no product-related development costs were capitalised in the reporting year because not all of the comprehensive recognition criteria defined in IAS 38 were met.\n\n#### **IMPAIRMENT TESTING UNDER IAS 36**\n\nThe date defined by KSB for the mandatory annual impairment testing for goodwill is 30 September of each year. The impairment testing methodology is explained in more detail in Section III. Accounting Policies in the \"Intangible assets\" subsection.\n\nIn the previous year, impairment testing was also carried out for goodwill as at 31 December 2022 to take account of identified indications for a possible impairment of assets as defined in IAS 36. The following information on the basic assumptions and parameters, the goodwill impairments and the sensitivity analyses therefore relates to the reporting year as at 30 September 2023 and to the previous year as at 31 December 2022.\n\n#### **Basic assumptions and parameters**\n\nThe carrying amounts of the cash-generating units in connection with the impairment testing of goodwill do not contain any items relating to income tax or financing activities.\n\nTo determine the discount factor, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) method is applied in conjunction with the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), taking into account a peer group. Under this method, first the cost of equity is determined using CAPM and the borrowing costs are defined, and then the individual capital components are weighted in accordance with the capital structure taking account of the peer group. The peer group information includes aspects like beta factors, capital structure data and borrowing costs. The peer group includes companies that are similar to the Group in terms of industry, size and activity. To account for changes in market parameters, the composition of the peer group is reviewed at regular intervals and adjusted if necessary (e.g. due to changes in the business model of either the cash-generating unit or the comparable company being looked at).\n\nThe interest rate for risk-free 30-year Bunds was used as a base rate. This rate was 2.7 % in the reporting year (previous year: 2.0 %). The market risk premium was set at 6.7 % (previous year: 7.2 %), with a beta factor of 1.25 (previous year: 1.22). In addition, country-specific tax rates and country risk premiums are taken into account individually for each cashgenerating unit (CGU). The growth rate for the cashgenerating units in the reporting year was generally set at 1.5 % (previous year: 0.5 %). The regular review of the peer group did not generate any new findings in relation to the business models of comparative companies. The peer group for examining the weighted capital cost factor therefore remained the same as in the previous year.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\ngroup.

Industries B.V., Alphen aan den Rijn, Netherlands, represents the only goodwill considered material from the Group's perspective, both in the reporting year and in the previous year, totalling € 18,285 thousand.\n\nIn addition, the carrying amount of the other goodwill of € 12,154 thousand is spread over a large number of the Group's cash-generating units. There are no other significant carrying amounts of individual goodwill in relation to the total carrying amount of the Group's goodwill.\n\nThe basic parameters for the impairment testing of material goodwill are summarised in the tables above.\n\nThe Group's material assumptions impacting cash flows from the multi-year financial plan on which the impairment test as at 30 September 2023 is based relate to the performance of order intake, sales revenue and earnings before finance income / expense and taxes (EBIT). For all three of the abovementioned key indicators, tangible growth was projected in all five years of the detailed planning period, both for the KSB SupremeServ operating segment and for the Standard Markets operating segment for new business with pumps of D.P. Industries B.V. The assessments take into account the company's own experience-based knowledge of competitors and markets as well as published economic data collected externally.\n\n#### **Impairment loss on goodwill**\n\nThe impairment losses on goodwill recognised in the reporting year are shown in the \"Impairment loss on goodwill in the 2023 financial year\" table. Impairment testing for goodwill in the previous year resulted in an impairment requirement of € 1,715 thousand.\n\n**Impairment of goodwill in the 2023 financial year** \n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management Re\n\n**25**\n\n#### **Sensitivity analyses**\n\nFor the cash-generating units in the form of the operating segments Standard Markets for new pump business and KSB SupremeServ of D.P. Industries B.V., with goodwill considered material from the Group's perspective, additional sensitivity analyses were performed based on the parameters as at 30 September 2023. As in the previous year, the following assumptions were made: a 15 % increase in the cost of capital (Sensitivity 1), a reduction in the growth rate to 0.0 % (Sensitivity 2) and a reduction in sales revenue of 10 % with the corresponding impact on expense items and performance indicators (Sensitivity 3).\n\nAs in the previous year, the sensitivity analyses did not reveal any impairment requirement in the reporting year.\n\n#### **2.

By introducing a separate item for all trade receivables from related parties, a clear distinction is now made from balances with third parties to increase transparency. The previous year's figure for trade receivables from third parties has been adjusted accordingly in this and the other relevant tables in this section. The change in presentation has no impact on the total value of trade receivables from related parties itemised for the previous year in Section IX. Other Disclosures.\n\nContract assets at the end of the reporting year totalled € 58,969 thousand (previous year: € 80,018 thousand). This decline is due to the fact that KSB's contract progress fell more sharply than the related advance payments received as at the reporting date. Impairment losses on contract assets amounted to € 1,599 thousand (previous year: € 1,609 thousand). Of the contract assets as at the reporting date, € 12,361 thousand (previous year: € 17,482 thousand) relate to project orders with customers whose completion is not expected until more than one year after the reporting date.\n\nImpairment losses of € 33,781 thousand (previous year: € 32,833 thousand) were recognised on trade receivables from third parties as at the reporting date.\n\nImpairment losses on trade receivables and contract assets include the individual impairment allowance (EWB) and risk provisions for expected credit losses (ECL).\n\n**Impairment losses on trade receivables from third parties** \n\n| € thousands                                                      | 31 Dec. 2023 | 31 Dec. 2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Gross carrying amount of trade<br>receivables from third parties | 539,576      | 562,989      |\n| of which unhedged receivables                                    | 373,723      | 404,621      |\n| of which hedged receivables                                      | 165,853      | 158,368      |\n| Individual impairment<br>allowance (EWB)                         | -29,713      | -29,380      |\n| Risk provisions for expected<br>credit losses (ECL)              | -4,068       | -3,453       |\n| of which ECL for<br>unhedged receivables                         | -3,347       | -2,855       |\n| of which ECL for<br>hedged receivables                           | -721         | -598         |\n| Net carrying amount of trade<br>receivables from third parties   | 505,795      | 530,156      |\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\n**31**\n\n#### **Impairment losses on contract assets**\n\n|                              |         | 31 Dec. 2023 | 31 Dec. 2022 |\n|------------------------------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| Gross carrying amount        | € thou- |              |              |\n| of contract assets           | sands   | 60,568       | 81,627       |\n| Individual impairment        | € thou- |              |              |\n| allowance (EWB)              | sands   | -1,150       | -1,258       |\n| Risk provisions for expected | € thou- |              |              |\n| credit losses (ECL)          | sands   | -449         | -351         |\n| Net carrying amount          | € thou- |              |              |\n| of contract assets           | sands   | 58,969       | 80,018       |\n|                              |         |              |              |\n| Expected default risk        |         |              |              |\n| in relation to ECL           | in %    | 0.7          | 0.4          |\n\nImpairment losses of € 151 thousand (previous year: € 87 thousand) were recognised on trade receivables from related parties as at the reporting date.

This is the result of the relatively high recognition of individual impairments for the entirety of the far overdue open receivables items.\n\nOther receivables and other current assets include hedges of credit balances prescribed by law for partial retirement arrangements and long-term working time accounts of the German Group companies in the amount of € 15,810 thousand (previous year: € 13,103 thousand).\n\n€ 37,567 thousand (previous year: € 48,907 thousand) of total receivables and other assets are due after more than one year.\n\n#### **9. Cash and cash equivalents**\n\nCash and cash equivalents are term deposits with short maturities and call deposits, and also current account balances. Cash equivalents include short-term deposits with an original maturity of less than three months.\n\nIn the reporting year, as in the previous year, no material impairment losses were recognised on cash and cash equivalents as no significant default risks were identified.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management Repo\n\n**33**\n\n#### **10. Equity**\n\nThere was no change in the share capital of KSB SE & Co. KGaA as against the previous year. In accordance with the Articles of Association, it totals € 44,771,963.82 and, as in the previous year, is composed of 886,615 ordinary shares and 864,712 preference shares. Each no-par-value share represents an equal notional amount of the share capital. The preference shares carry separate cumulative preferred dividend rights and progressive additional dividend rights. All shares are no-parvalue bearer shares. The individual shares have no par value.\n\nThe capital reserve results from the appropriation of premiums from capital increases in previous years.\n\nIn addition to revenue reserves from previous years, the revenue reserves include currency translation adjustments, consolidation effects, remeasurements of defined benefit plans under IAS 19 and changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives taken directly to equity. These issues resulted in deferred tax assets in the amount of € 57,712 thousand (previous year: € 29,732 thousand) and deferred tax liabilities in the amount of € 793 thousand (previous year: € 856 thousand).\n\nIntercompany results from the transfer of assets within the Group are now eliminated on a pro rata basis in the noncontrolling interests, and no longer in full with an effect on the equity attributable to the shareholders of KSB SE & Co. KGaA. The adjustment resulted in a reclassification of € 3,022 thousand, taken directly to equity, from non-controlling interests to revenue reserves in the reporting year.\n\n#### **Development of currency translation differences in equity**\n\nThe development of the currency translation differences in equity is shown in the table of the same name below.\n\nA total of € 34,376 thousand (dividend of € 19.50 per ordinary share and € 19.76 per preference share) was paid from equity by resolution of the Annual General Meeting of the Group's parent company KSB SE & Co.

Provisions for pensions and similar obligations**\n\nThe pension obligations in the KSB Group include defined contribution and defined benefit plans and contain both obligations from current pensions and future pension benefit entitlements.\n\n#### **Defined contribution pension plans**\n\nTotal expenses for defined contribution pension plans in the reporting year amounted to € 62,327 thousand (previous year: € 52,816 thousand). Of this figure, € 27,884 thousand (previous year: € 27,714 thousand) resulted from contributions into the statutory pension insurance scheme in Germany.\n\n#### **Description of the defined benefit pension plans**\n\nThe obligations for defined benefit pension plans for employees of the Group are mainly due to pension obligations in Germany, as well as in France, the United States and Switzerland.\n\naccordance with HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch – German Comto the German Group companies. These relate to direct commitments by the companies to their employees. The commitments are based on salary and length of service. Contributions from employees themselves are also considered. This pension provision can be broken down into purely company-financed basic provision and the top-up provision from the employer. The latter is based on the amount of own contributions and the generated return on sales before taxes on income. Both components take account of the general pension contribution (the amount of which partially depends on company performance), personal income (the relationship between pensionable income and maximum income threshold) and the annuity conversion factor (based on age). Within the scope of the material pension plans of the German companies, every employee is entitled to apply at any time during the ongoing employment contract for payment in annual instalments, as a one-time payment or as a pension for life.\n\nPension schemes in France are governed by the provisions of the respective collective agreements. The obligations are basically covered by assets that have been paid in to an external fund. Upon retirement, the employees concerned receive a oneoff payment from the fund.\n\n**35**\n\nThe defined benefit pension plans in the United States are closed to new entrants. The pension benefit amount is derived from the average salary and years of service before closure of the plan. The retirement age is 65 years; from this point a monthly payment is made to the beneficiaries. The pension benefits are financed by external funds.\n\nThe obligations for defined benefit pension plans in Switzerland are based on occupational pensions in accordance More than 90 % of the defined benefit plans are attributable with the Bundesgesetz über die berufliche Alters-,\nHinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge (BVG) [Swiss Federal Act on Occupational Retirement, Surviving Dependants', and Disability Pension Plans]. Every employee of a company with a total annual income above a certain minimum amount is insured in the employer's pension fund as a mandatory requirement. The occupational pension plan, as the second pillar of the Swiss pension system supplementing the state pension plan as the first pillar which is classified as a defined contribution plan, includes defined additional benefits in old age, in the event of disability or in the event of death with the aim of safeguarding the accustomed standard of living. Both employer and employee contributions are paid to finance this. If the pension fund has a shortfall, the employer is obliged to make up for it. The pension benefits after retirement are paid out as a monthly pension, as a one-off lump-sum payment or in the form of a combination of these, according to the choice of the employee.\n\nIn addition, employees in other countries are also entitled to a limited extent to retirement and partly to medical care benefits, depending mainly on the length of service and salary.\n\nThese defined benefit plans harbour actuarial risks, such as the longevity risk and interest rate risk. The payments associated with the pension obligations are mostly serviced through liquidity. Plan assets are also partially available for financing these obligations. Most of the plan assets are man-aged by insurers who set their own appropriate investment policies.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\n**37**\n\nThe actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligation (and the related current service cost and the past service cost) are measured and calculated annually on the basis of actuarial reports using the projected unit credit method (IAS 19). Plan assets are measured at fair value.\n\n#### **Explanation of the effects of the defined benefit pension plans on the balance sheet and income statement**\n\nThe regional allocation of the total defined benefit pension plans from the Group's point of view, as well as the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation, the fair value of plan assets and the net liability from defined benefit obligations, as consolidated for the Group, is presented in the following tables.\n\n- **Regional allocation of the defined benefit pension plans**\n- **Change in present value of

assumptions, sensitivities and other disclosures on defined benefit pension plans**\n\nAs in the previous year, measurement of the German pension plans is based on a mean fluctuation rate of 2.0 %. The biometric assumptions continue to be based on the 2018G mortality tables published by Prof. Dr. Klaus Heubeck. The retirement age used for the calculations is based on the Rentenversicherungs-Altersgrenzanpassungsgesetz 2007 [RVAGAnpG – German Act Adapting the Standard Retirement Age for the Statutory Pension Insurance System]. Other measurement parameters (e.g. cost trends in the medical care area) are not material.\n\nFor the material pension plans of the German companies, the regular assessment made by KSB regarding the exercising of the lump-sum option by employees led to an adjustment of the measurement assumptions compared with the previous year. Therefore, as at 31 December 2023, a payment in the form of a lifelong pension was assumed for 65 % (previous year: 45 %) of the specific workforce, a one-off payment for 30 % (previous year: 35 %) and payment in instalments over 10 years after termination of employment for 5 % (previous year: 20 %). The resulting actuarial losses had a negative effect of € 7,068 thousand on other comprehensive income in the reporting year.\n\nThe discount rate and future mortality were identified as key actuarial assumptions.\n\n#### **Discount rate**\n\n| %           | 31 Dec. 2023 | 31 Dec. 2022 |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Germany     | 3.2          | 3.7          |\n| France      | 3.2          | 3.8          |\n| USA         | 5.3          | 4.9          |\n| Switzerland | 2.0          | 1.8          |\n\nAs in the previous year the basis for the calculation of the sensitivities is the same method which was used for the calculation of the provisions for pensions and similar obligations. Were the discount factor to increase by 100 basis points, the DBO would fall by € 62,170 thousand (previous year: € 53,175 thousand). A 100 basis point reduction in the discount factor would increase the DBO by € 78,164 thousand (previous year: € 65,355 thousand). It should be noted that a change in the discount factor due to particular financial effects (such as compound interest) does not affect the development of the DBO on a straight-line basis. Were life expectancy to increase by 1 year, the DBO would increase by € 18,028 thousand (previous year: € 14,932 thousand). Additionally, the individual actuarial assumptions are mutually dependent, but these interdependencies are not taken into account in the sensitivity analysis.\n\nOn 31 December 2023 the weighted average term of the DBO was 14 years (previous year: 13 years).\n\nKSB's expected benefit payments from defined benefit pension plans over the next five years are shown in the table below.\n\n| € thousands at 31 Dec. 2023 | 2024   | 2025   | 2026   | 2027   | 2028   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Expected payments           | 23,894 | 26,901 | 28,235 | 28,625 | 30,626 |\n| € thousands at 31 Dec. 2022 | 2023   | 2024   | 2025   | 2026   | 2027   |\n| Expected payments           | 23,475 | 24,810 | 26,109 | 29,136 | 29,934 |\n\n#### **Expected pension benefit payments**\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\n**41**\n\n#### **12.

This tax rate forms the base for deriving the actual tax rate for the Group.\n\n**Taxes on income in the income statement Taxes on income** \n\n| € thousands                                          | 2023    | 2022    |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Effective taxes                                      | 64,971  | 48,606  |\n| Deferred taxes                                       | −32,595 | −15,276 |\n|                                                      | 32,376  | 33,330  |\n| € thousands                                          | 2023    | 2022    |\n| Change in deferred tax assets                        | -56,966 | -2,455  |\n| Change in deferred tax liabilities                   | -2,153  | 2,833   |\n| Change in deferred taxes recognised in balance sheet | -59,119 | 378     |\n| Change in deferred taxes taken directly to equity    | 27,915  | -14,625 |\n| Changes in consolidated Group / CTA * / Other        | -1,391  | -1,029  |\n| Deferred taxes recognised in income statement        | -32,595 | -15,276 |\n\nEffective taxes include prior-period tax refunds in the amount of € 1,369 thousand (previous year: € 2,090 thousand) and tax arrears in the amount of € 933 thousand (previous year: € 386 thousand).

They are reported under deferred taxes for other liabilities (non-current and current).\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\n**49**\n\n**Further information and explanations on taxes on income**  Contingent liabilities from income tax issues amount to € 1,068 thousand (previous year: € 215 thousand). There are currently no indications that the utilisation of these obligations is likely.\n\nAs far as net income from affiliates and other equity investments is concerned, withholding taxes incurred in connection with distributions and German taxes incurred are recognised as deferred taxes if these gains are expected to be subject to corresponding taxation, or there is no intention of reinvesting them in the long term. No deferred tax liabilities were recognised for taxable temporary differences of € 6,139 thousand (previous year: € 6,297 thousand) in relation to affiliates and associates as it is unlikely that these temporary differences will be reversed in the foreseeable future.\n\nNo deferred tax assets were recognised for corporate tax loss carryforwards amounting to € 17,219 thousand (previous year: € 104,619 thousand) and for trade tax loss carryforwards amounting to € 2,942 thousand (previous year: € 64,917 thousand), due to the recognition criteria of IAS 12, especially in the case where there is a history of losses. The loss carryforwards are largely available for an indefinite period. The income resulting from the use of loss carryforwards for which no deferred tax assets had been recognised so far was € 4,714 thousand (previous year: € 6,033 thousand).\n\nDeductible temporary differences for which no deferred tax assets had to be set up amounted to € 4,663 thousand (previous year: € 107,236 thousand).\n\nKSB considers the existing deferred tax assets in the tax group of KSB SE & Co. KGaA from loss carryforwards and from taxable temporary differences to be fully recoverable. The basis for this assessment is, firstly, the elimination of the loss history for KSB SE & Co. KGaA's tax group. Secondly, KSB expects positive taxable income for KSB SE & Co. KGaA's tax group in the coming years. The reversal of impairment losses recognised in the previous year results in deferred tax income of € 32,532 thousand in the income statement and € 15,261 thousand in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group falls within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules. The Pillar Two legislation was adopted in Germany and has been applicable since 1 January 2024. As the Pillar Two legislation had not yet been finalised as at the reporting date, the Group is not subject to any taxation in this respect for the 2023 financial year. The Group makes use of the exemption from recognising deferred taxes in connection with Pillar Two income taxes, which was the subject of the amendments to IAS 12 published in May 2023. Overall, the Group does not expect the first-time application of the Pillar Two rules in 2024 to have any material impact on its net assets, financial position and results of operations. The Group is currently working with external tax specialists to support the application and implementation of the Pillar Two legislation.\n\n#### **21. Earnings after income tax – Non-controlling interests**\n\nThe net profit attributable to non-controlling interests amounts to € 25,940 thousand (previous year: € 25,244 thousand) and the net loss attributable to non-controlling interests amounts to € 1,622 thousand (previous year: € 1,555 thousand).

Financial risks**\n\nKSB is exposed to certain financial risks as a consequence of its business activities. These risks can be classified into three areas:\n\nKSB is firstly exposed to credit risk. Credit risk is defined as the potential default or delays in the receipt of contractually agreed payments. KSB is also exposed to liquidity risk which is the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its financial obligations, or will be unable to meet them in full. In addition, KSB is exposed to market price risk. The risk of exchange rate or interest rate changes may adversely affect the economic position of the Group. Risks from fluctuations in the prices of financial instruments are not material for KSB.\n\nKSB limits all these risks through an appropriate risk management system, defining how these risks are addressed through guidelines and work instructions. Furthermore, KSB continuously monitors the current risk characteristics and regularly provides the information obtained to the Managing Directors and the Supervisory Board in the form of standardised reports and individual analyses.\n\nThe three risk areas are described in detail in the following. Additional information is also provided in the group management report, in particular in the Economic Review, Report on Expected Developments, Opportunities and Risks Report sections.\n\n#### **Credit risk**\n\nThe primary credit risk is that there is a delay in settling a receivable, or that it is not settled either in full or in part. KSB minimises this risk using a variety of measures. As a matter of principle, KSB runs credit checks on potential and existing counterparties. KSB only enters into business relationships if the results of these checks are positive. Additionally, European companies in particular take out trade credit insurance policies. In exceptional cases KSB accepts other securities (collateral) such as guarantees. The insurance policies primarily cover the risk of loss of receivables. Moreover, cover is also taken out against political and commercial risks in the case of specific customers in selected countries. For both types of insurance, KSB has agreed deductibles, which represent significantly less than 50 % of the insured volume. The total amount of unhedged trade receivables as at the reporting date is shown under Notes No. 8 \"Contract assets, trade receivables and other financial and non-financial assets\". As part of receivables management, KSB continuously monitors out-standing items, performs maturity analyses and establishes contact with customers at an early stage if delays in payment occur. In the case of major projects, the terms and conditions provide for prepayments, guarantees and – for export transactions – letters of credit. These also mitigate risk. KSB recognises impairment losses for the residual risk remaining in trade receivables. It regularly examines the extent to which individual receivables need to be written down for impairment. Indications of this are significant financial difficulties of the debtor, such as insolvency or bankruptcy. Receivables are derecognised when it is reasonably certain that payment cannot be expected.\n\nThe maximum default risk, excluding collateral received, corresponds to the carrying amount of the financial assets.\n\nThere is no concentration of risk because the diversity of KSB's business means that it supplies a considerable number of customers in different sectors.\n\n#### **Liquidity risk**\n\nLiquidity management ensures that the liquidity risk is minimised in the Group and that solvency is ensured at all times. There are no concentrations of risk because KSB works with a number of credit institutions, on which strict creditworthiness requirements are imposed.\n\nKSB generates its financial resources primarily from its operating business. These are used to finance investments in non-current assets. The Group also uses them to cover working capital requirements. KSB monitors changes in inventories, contract assets, trade receivables, trade payables and contract liabilities regularly using a standardised Group reporting system.\n\nThe reporting system additionally ensures, with the help of monthly rolling cash flow planning, that the Group's central financial management is continuously informed about liquidity surpluses and requirements. This enables KSB to optimally meet the needs of the Group as a whole and of the individual companies. In order to be able to provide the necessary collateral in the project business, KSB makes corresponding guarantee volumes available.\n\nIn addition, it is always ensured that free credit facilities are sufficient; KSB identifies the need for these on the basis of regular liquidity planning. This way, it can respond at any time to fluctuating liquidity requirements. The available cash loans and credit lines total € 1,077.9 million (previous year: € 1,086.4 million). The utilisation of cash loans and credit lines by the Group was as follows at the end of the reporting year:\n\n| € thousands / Type of line | Maximum<br>amount of line | Utilisation as at<br>31 Dec.2023 |\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Loans                      | 420.1                     | 10.5                             |\n| Sureties                   | 657.8                     | 212.6                            |\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\nrecognises impairment losses for the residual risk remaining in trade receivables.

The credit line from the syndicated loan agreement comes to € 350.0 million. Following the utilisation of renewal options by KSB in previous years, the cash loan and credit line now has a fixed term until the end of 2025.\n\nThe following tables show the contractually agreed nondiscounted future cash flows of the financial liabilities (primary financial instruments) and derivative financial instruments. Interest payments on fixed-rate liabilities are determined on the basis of the fixed rate. Floating-rate interest payments are based on the last floating interest rates fixed before 31 December. Projections for future new liabilities are not included in the presentation. Based on the current state of knowledge, it is neither expected that the cash flows will take place significantly earlier, nor that the amounts will differ significantly.\n\n#### **Cash flows of financial liabilities 2023**\n\n| € thousands                               | Total   | Up to 1 year | 1 − 5 years | > 5 years |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|--------------|-------------|-----------|\n| Financial liabilities                     | 57,097  | 27,581       | 26,151      | 3,365     |\n| of which from lease obligations           | 46,094  | 16,971       | 25,830      | 3,293     |\n| Trade payables                            | 324,723 | 324,723      | –           | –         |\n| Miscellaneous other financial liabilities | 25,355  | 25,230       | 125         | –         |\n| Derivative financial instruments (net)    | 2,304   | 2,202        | 102         | –         |\n|                                           | 409,479 | 379,736      | 26,378      | 3,365     |\n\n#### **Cash flows of financial liabilities 2022**\n\n**53**\n\n**Utilisation as at 31 Dec.2023** \n\n| € thousands                               | Total   | Up to 1 year | 1 - 5 years | > 5 years |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|--------------|-------------|-----------|\n| Financial liabilities                     | 54,703  | 28,628       | 21,883      | 4,192     |\n| of which from lease obligations           | 40,453  | 15,300       | 21,034      | 4,119     |\n| Trade payables                            | 333,361 | 333,361      | -           | -         |\n| Miscellaneous other financial liabilities | 21,599  | 21,407       | 192         | -         |\n| Derivative financial instruments (net)    | 2,322   | 2,067        | 255         | -         |\n|                                           | 411,985 | 385,463      | 22,330      | 4,192     |\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\n**55**\n\n#### **Market price risk**\n\nGlobal business activities expose KSB primarily to currency and interest rate risk.

To avoid the negative effects of interest rate fluctuations on the international capital markets, KSB concludes interest rate hedges (interest rate swaps) where necessary, generally for long-term loans. These are used exclusively to hedge floating rate loans against rising interest rates. In the reporting year, as in the previous year, there were no such transactions or other interest rate derivatives in the portfolio.\n\nAs part of the interest rate sensitivity analysis shown in the table below, KSB simulates a 100 basis point increase (decrease) in market interest rates and analyses the impact on the floating rate financial instruments.\n\n#### **Interest rate sensitivity**\n\n**55**\n\n|                       | 31 Dec. 2023       |                    | 31 Dec. 2022       |                    |\n|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| € millions            | + 100 basis points | - 100 basis points | + 100 basis points | - 100 basis points |\n| Consolidated earnings | 3.7                | -3.7               | 2.6                | -2.6               |\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\n**57**\n\n#### **3. Hedge accounting**\n\nKSB uses micro hedges (hedging individual transactions) and macro hedges (hedging an overall risk portfolio) to hedge currency risk from transactions already recognised in the balance sheet as well as transactions that are expected in the future with a high degree of probability. The hedging instruments used share the essential terms and conditions with the underlying transactions, i.e. with regard to amount, term and quality. The maturities of the currency derivatives used are, as in the previous year, mostly between one and two years. Internal guidelines govern the use of financial instruments. Such transactions are also subject to ongoing risk control measures.\n\nThe effectiveness of hedges is determined at the beginning of the hedge and through regular prospective assessment. The aim is to ensure that there is a financial relationship between the hedge underlying and hedging instrument. The hedging instruments used are exclusively currency forwards entered into with prime-rated banks. To hedge forward exchange transactions, the Group takes out hedges where the contractual modalities of the hedging instrument essentially match those of the hedged underlying. The hedge ratio for hedges is 1:1, i.e. the volume of hedge transactions matches the designated underlyings.\n\nIn order to measure the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of hedges, KSB compares the fair value of the underlying and the hedge transactions. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives are almost completely offset by changes in the fair value of the cash flows from the underlyings (dollar offset method). The changes in the fair value of the underlyings and hedges in the financial year therefore match the unrealised profits and losses recorded under equity. As a rule, KSB does not hedge currency risks from the translation of foreign operations into the Group currency (€). Ineffectiveness can arise from hedging currency risk if the material measurement parameters of the underlying and hedge no longer match. There was no material ineffectiveness in the KSB Group in respect of currency hedges in the 2023 and 2022 financial years.\n\nAt the reporting date, the notional volume of the currency forwards designated as hedges was € 215,935 thousand (previous year: € 188,568 thousand). In addition to the US dollar, the hedged currency risk relates to a number of other currencies to a lesser extent. The weighted average EUR / USD exchange rate for hedging instruments denominated in US dollars was 1.11 (previous year: 1.07) as at the balance sheet date. The contractual maturities of payments for these currency forwards are as follows:\n\n#### **Notional volumes in 2023**\n\n| € thousands                            | Total   | Up to 1 year | 1 – 5 years | > 5 years |\n|----------------------------------------|---------|--------------|-------------|-----------|\n| Currency forwards designated as hedges | 215,935 | 204,144      | 11,791      | –         |\n| Notional volumes in 2022               |         |              |             |           |\n| € thousands                            | Total   | Up to 1 year | 1 – 5 years | > 5 years |\n| Currency forwards designated as hedges | 188,568 | 155,225      | 32,962      | 381       |\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn order to measure the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of hedges, KSB compares the fair value of the underlying and the hedge transactions.

In the reporting year,\n\nthe realisation of the underlying recognised in income includes amounts of € 62 thousand (previous year: € 29 thousand) resulting from hedging transactions in which the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur.\n\n#### **Fair value changes in derivatives in 2023**\n\n|                                                | OCI                                      |                                                  |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| € thousands                                    | Cash flow<br>hedges –<br>Hedging reserve | Cash flow<br>hedges –<br>Hedging cost<br>reserve |\n| Currency risk                                  |                                          |                                                  |\n| Opening balance at 1 January                   | 1,560                                    | −1,012                                           |\n| Effective portion of changes in fair value     | −832                                     | 2,191                                            |\n| Realisation of underlying recognised in income | −429                                     | −1,389                                           |\n| Closing balance at 31 December                 | 299                                      | −210                                             |\n\n#### **Fair value changes in derivatives in 2022**\n\n**57**\n\n|                                                | OCI                                |                                         |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| € thousands                                    | Cash flow hedges – Hedging reserve | Cash flow hedges – Hedging cost reserve |\n| Currency risk                                  |                                    |                                         |\n| Opening balance at 1 January                   | −5,988                             | 3,213                                   |\n| Effective portion of changes in fair value     | 36,961                             | −22,542                                 |\n| Realisation of underlying recognised in income | −29,413                            | 18,317                                  |\n| Closing balance at 31 December                 | 1,560                              | −1,012                                  |\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\n**59**\n\n#### **VII. STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS**\n\nThe cash flow statement shows how the Group's cash and cash equivalents reported in the balance sheet changed during the reporting year as a result of cash inflows and outflows. In accordance with the requirements of IAS 7, a distinction is made between cash flows from operating activities and from investing and financing activities. The exact composition of these individual components can be seen in the individual items listed in the cash flow statement.\n\nNon-cash effects from currency translation and from changes in the consolidated Group are eliminated in the respective items. Consequently, the cash flows from changes in balance sheet items shown in the cash flow statement cannot be reconciled with the corresponding movements in the Group's balance sheet.\n\nCash flows reported by Group companies in foreign currencies are translated into euros at average exchange rates for the year, while cash and cash equivalents are translated at the closing rate.\n\nThe effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents, as well as the effect of changes in the consolidated Group, are shown in a separate item in the cash flow statement.\n\nThe cash flow from investing activities includes the cash effects from additions and disposals of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. The total additions and disposals in the reporting year are provided in the explanatory notes to the balance sheet items in these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe change in financial liabilities over the year, including the cash-effective portion of this change, which is included in the cash flows from financing activities, is presented in the tables below.\n\nAs in the previous year, the cash and cash equivalents reported as at the reporting date are not subject to any significant restrictions on disposal by KSB.\n\n#### **Change in financial liabilities in 2023**\n\n| € thousands                                                     | 1 Jan. 2023 | Cash-effective in cash flows from financing activities | Additions / Disposals / Acquisitions / Other | Exchange-rate-related changes | 31 Dec. 2023 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|\n| Non-current financial liabilities (excluding lease liabilities) | 1,213       | -865                                                   | 612                                          | -170                          | 790          |\n| Current financial liabilities (excluding lease liabilities)     | 13,103      | -2,835                                                 | 1,933                                        | -2,001                        | 10,200       |\n| Lease liabilities                                               | 36,430      | -19,100                                                | 27,237                                       | -545                          | 44,022       |\n| Total financial liabilities                                     | 50,746      | -22,801                                                | 29,782                                       | -2,717                        | 55,011       |\n\n#### **Change in financial liabilities in 2022**\n\n|                                                                 |             | Non-cash changes                                                |                                                       |                                   |              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|\n| € thousands                                                     | 1 Jan. 2022 | Cash-effective<br>in cash flows<br>from financing<br>activities | Additions /<br>Disposals /<br>Acquisitions /<br>Other | Exchange-rate-<br>related changes | 31 Dec. 2022 |\n| Non-current financial liabilities (excluding lease liabilities) | 2,574       | −1,996                                                          | 226                                                   | 410                               | 1,213        |\n| Current financial liabilities (excluding lease liabilities)     | 37,386      | −26,048                                                         | 2,996                                                 | −1,231                            | 13,103       |\n| Lease liabilities                                               | 39,006      | −17,764                                                         | 15,080                                                | 108                               | 36,430       |\n| Total financial liabilities                                     | 78,966      | −45,808                                                         | 18,302                                                | −713                              | 50,746       |\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents, as well as the effect of changes in the consolidated Group, are shown in a separate item in the cash flow\n\nThe cash flow from investing activities includes the cash effects from additions and disposals of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.

SEGMENT REPORTING**\n\nSegment reporting is prepared in accordance with IFRS 8 based on the management approach and corresponds to the internal organisational and management structure as well as the reporting lines to the Managing Directors as the chief operating decision-makers.\n\nKSB takes management decisions on the basis of the key performance indicators – order intake, external sales revenue and earnings before finance income / expense and taxes (EBIT) – determined for the Pumps, Valves and KSB SupremeServ reporting segments (hereinafter also referred to as \"Segments\"). Reporting the relevant assets, number of employees and inter-segment sales revenue of the Segments is not part of internal reporting.\n\nBased on comprehensive consideration, the reporting segments were aligned with the Group's products and services. For the derivation of the Pumps Segment, the underlying differentiation of individual Market Areas must also be taken into account, as described below.\n\nThe Pumps Segment comprises new business with single-stage and multistage pumps, submersible pumps and the associated control and drive systems. The applications are assigned to the Market Areas of Energy and Mining and to the Market Areas of Water, Building Services, Petrochemicals / Chemicals and General Industry, which are grouped together in the organisational and reporting structure of the Group as Standard Markets. Each customer is assigned by the Group to a specific Market Area according to their main business activity. The allocation of transactions with customers to the Market Areas follows this clear assignment of customers by KSB, irrespective of the specific product underlying the transaction.\n\nFor the new business with pumps, the Energy, Mining and Standard Markets are derived from the organisational and reporting structure of the Group as operating segments as defined by IFRS 8. These segments share the characteristic that they are based on a common product group, i.e. pumps. Furthermore, it follows from the customer-related delineation of the Market Areas described above that these operating segments are not based on a classification according to specific products and services, taking into account technological and economic characteristics, such as production processes or sales methods. According to KSB's estimates and expectations, the three pumps operating segments have similar long-term earnings trends and may also involve fundamentally comparable risks. As a result, the operating segments considered here are aggregated into the Pumps reporting segment pursuant to IFRS 8 in view of the close technological\n\n**59**\n\nand economic interrelationships from the Group's point of view.\n\nThe Valves Segment combines the Group's business activities with regard to new business in butterfly valves, globe valves, gate valves, control valves, diaphragm valves and ball valves. as well as associated actuators and control systems. The basic applications for these products are identical to those for pumps. However, in contrast to the Pumps Segment, the Valves Segment is not divided into individual Market Areas for the central management of the Group.\n\nThe KSB SupremeServ Segment on the one hand comprises the spare parts business for pumps and valves. On the other hand, KSB's service activities are allocated to this Segment. These include the installation, commissioning, start-up, inspection, servicing, maintenance and repair of pumps, related systems and valves, as well as modular service concepts and system analyses for complete plants.\n\nThe amounts disclosed for the individual segments have been established in compliance with the accounting policies of the present consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe order intake by segment presents order intake generated with third parties.\n\nThe sales revenue by segment presents sales revenue generated with third parties.\n\nThe \"Segment reporting\" table shows earnings before finance income / expense and income tax (EBIT) including noncontrolling interests.\n\nEBIT includes depreciation and amortisation of € 40,994 thousand (previous year: € 42,705 thousand) for the Pumps Segment, € 11,353 thousand (previous year: € 11,592 thousand) for the Valves Segment and € 35,747 thousand (previous year: € 36,122 thousand) for the KSB SupremeServ Segment.\n\nThe total depreciation and amortisation included impairment losses on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and rights of use to leased assets in the amount of € 2,476 thousand (previous year: € 5,594 thousand). Of these impairments, € 1,472 thousand (previous year: € 2,712 thousand) relate to the Pumps Segment, € 1,004 thousand (previous year: € 2,447 thousand) to the KSB SupremeServ Segment and € 435 thousand in the previous year to the Valves Segment. In addition, the write-downs for the reporting year include reversals of impairments on property, plant and\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\n**61**\n\nequipment in the amount of € 2,194 thousand. These were attributable to the Pumps Segment in the amount of € 1,811 thousand, the Valves Segment in the amount of € 300 thousand and the KSB SupremeServ Segment in the amount of € 83 thousand.\n\n€ 641,992 thousand (previous year: € 560,517 thousand) of the sales revenue presented were generated by the companies based in Germany, € 215,770 thousand (previous year: € 215,103 thousand) by companies in China, € 200,211 thousand (previous year: € 180,404 thousand) by companies in France, € 238,773 thousand (previous year: € 238,973 thousand) by companies in the USA, € 249.847 thousand (previous year: € 218,850 thousand) by companies in India and € 1,272,395 thousand (previous year: € 1,159,540 thousand) by the other Group companies.\n\nThere were no relationships with individual customers that accounted for a material proportion of Group sales revenue.\n\nAt the reporting date, the total non-current assets of the KSB Group under review for the purposes of segment reporting amounted to € 749,300 thousand (year-end figure in previous year: € 712,238 thousand), with € 285,090 thousand (yearend figure in previous year: € 256,585 thousand) being attributable to the companies based in Germany and € 464,210 thousand (year-end figure in previous year: € 455,653 thousand) being attributable to the other Group companies.

OTHER DISCLOSURES**\n\n#### **Capital disclosures**\n\nSufficient financial independence is a key requirement for safeguarding KSB's continued existence in the long term. Obtaining the necessary funds for ongoing business operations is also extremely important for KSB. KSB regularly monitors the development of the net financial position that is derived from the balance of interest-bearing financial liabilities and financial assets (mainly cash and cash equivalents as well as receivables from deposits). One objective is to avoid net debt. The net financial position at the end of the reporting year was € 324.9 million (previous year: € 225.6 million). This rise is essentially due to the marked increase in cash flows from operating activities.\n\n#### **Contingent liabilities**\n\nContingent liabilities to third parties and other investments are as follows at the reporting date:\n\n#### **Contingent liabilities**\n\n| € thousands                       | 31 Dec. 2023 | 31 Dec. 2022 |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| From legal disputes               | 2,264        | 3,090        |\n| from guarantees                   | 2,055        | 2,000        |\n| From warranty agreements          | 1,755        | 5,109        |\n| From other tax matters            | 13,432       | 13,207       |\n| From other contingent liabilities | 503          | 3,177        |\n|                                   | 20,009       | 26,583       |\n\nIn the context of establishing the contingent liabilities, estimates are required in particular with regard to the existence of any obligations and in relation to the probability and amount of an outflow of resources.\n\nAt present, KSB does not expect a payment obligation for the total of contingent liabilities listed in the table of that name.\n\nIn addition, the KSB Group has contingent liabilities towards associates and joint ventures of € 7,163 thousand (previous year: € 7,311 thousand). The extent to which these will result in a cash outflow depends on the future business performance of the respective company.\n\nAs at the reporting date of the reporting year, there are no material contingent receivables of the Group, as in the previous year.\n\n#### **Other financial obligations**\n\n**61**\n\nAs in the previous year, there are no purchase price obligations from acquisitions of companies and no payment obligations from capitalisation measures at Group companies.\n\nThe aggregate purchase obligation for investments amounts to € 27,852 thousand (previous year: € 27,273 thousand). Of this amount, € 1,052 thousand (previous year: € 2,717 thousand) is attributable to intangible assets and € 26,800 thousand (previous year: € 24,556 thousand) to property, plant and equipment. Most of the corresponding payments are due in 2024.\n\n#### **Leases**\n\n#### **KSB as lessee**\n\nLease agreements in which KSB is the lessee mainly relate to real estate and motor vehicles. The terms of leases and additional cancellation and renewal options for one or both contracting parties are agreed individually and at different conditions.\n\nThe total cash outflow from leases, in the form of the repayment of lease liabilities, payments for leases relating to low-value assets and for short-term leases as well as variable lease payments, totalled € 29,060 thousand in the reporting year (previous year: € 26,697 thousand).\n\nThe Group expects future payments of € 5,328 thousand (previous year: € 5,967 thousand) from leases already concluded where the leased asset had not yet been made available to KSB by the lessor for use at the reporting date.\n\n#### **KSB as lessor**\n\nKSB acts as a lessor to a small extent, including in the context of real estate leasing. These activities have no material impact on the consolidated financial statements, so no further disclosures are made in this context.\n\n#### **Research and development costs**\n\nResearch and development costs in the reporting year amounted to € 60,577 thousand (previous year: € 56,307 thousand).\n\n#### **Related party disclosures**\n\nRelated parties are legal entities or natural persons that have influence over the KSB Group or are subject to control, joint control or significant influence by the KSB Group.\n\nIn order to determine the entirety of related parties of the Group, the organisational and shareholding structure of KSB SE & Co. KGaA must be taken into account. Johannes und Jacob Klein GmbH, Frankenthal / Pfalz, holds an unchanged voting interest of 83.94 % in KSB SE & Co. KGaA. The voting rights in this company are held, again unchanged, by KSB Stiftung, Stuttgart, with 74.93 %, and by Kühborth-Stiftung GmbH, Stuttgart, with 25.07 %.\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\n**63**\n\nTransactions with related parties are performed at arm's length and are described in more detail below.\n\n#### **Related parties (entities)**\n\nIn view of the above explanations, related parties of the KSB Group are, on the one hand, KSB Stiftung, Stuttgart, and Kühborth Stiftung GmbH, Stuttgart, each with their direct and indirect interests, joint ventures and associates. This includes Klein, Schanzlin & Becker GmbH, Frankenthal / Pfalz, which in turn holds 100 % of the voting rights in KSB Management SE, Frankenthal / Pfalz.

At the reporting date, impairments of € 151 thousand (previous year: € 87 thousand) were recognised on the presented receivables from companies not consolidated due to immateriality.\n\nAs the legal representative, KSB Management SE provides management services for KSB. The management fee is charged on to KSB SE & Co. KGaA. In addition, KSB Management SE as general partner assumes liability for KSB and receives annual remuneration for this amounting to 4 % of its share capital. Accordingly, € 6,554 thousand (previous year: € 5,964 thousand) of the purchases of assets and services from KSB Management SE relate firstly to the remuneration of the members of the governing bodies of KSB Management SE, which is explained in more detail under the \"Related parties (persons)\" sub-section below. Secondly, they include the liability remuneration in the amount of € 20 thousand (previous year: € 20 thousand) and a further reimbursement of expenses in connection with the management of the Group's business in the amount of € 137 thousand (previous year: € 194 thousand). The liabilities to KSB Management SE are due in the short term.\n\nRelations covering the supply of products and services in relation with Johannes und Jacob Klein GmbH were of minor scope in the reporting year as in the previous year. In addition, Johannes und Jacob Klein GmbH received dividend payments.\n\nTransactions with subsidiaries of Johannes und Jacob Klein GmbH comprise transactions with Palatina Versicherungsservice GmbH, Abacus alpha GmbH, Abacus Resale GmbH, Abacus Experten GmbH, Salinnova GmbH and airinotec GmbH).

Further information is provided below, in these consolidated financial statements, before the comments concerning the proposal on the appropriation of the net retained earnings of KSB SE & Co. KGaA.\n\nIn the reporting year, two members of the Administrative Board and one member of the Supervisory Board held an immaterial share of interests in KSB SE & Co. KGaA.\n\nThe remuneration paid to key management personnel of the Group, i.e. the Managing Directors and the members of the Administrative Board of KSB Management SE, is listed in the following table. The amounts are paid by KSB under an expense reimbursement agreement.\n\n#### **Management remuneration**\n\n| € thousands              | 2023  | 2022  |\n|--------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Short-term benefits      | 4,594 | 3,729 |\n| Post-employment benefits | 1,439 | 1,602 |\n| Other long-term benefits | 521   | 633   |\n| Total                    | 6,554 | 5,964 |\n\nThe remuneration system for the Managing Directors of KSB Management SE consists of components that are not performance-related, in the form of fixed sum plus benefits and pension commitments, as well as short-term and long-term variable remuneration components. In this context, 60 % of the regular annual salary, i.e. the sum of fixed and variable remuneration, is accounted for by the fixed component. The variable remuneration accounts for 40 % of the regular annual salary, with about two thirds of this being allocated to the long-term variable remuneration. The majority of the variable remuneration is thus linked to the long-term performance of the company.\n\nThe short-term variable remuneration with an assessment period of one year is designed as a target bonus model and is awarded annually. The target amount, i.e. the amount paid out if 100 % of the target is achieved, corresponds to 15 % of the respective regular annual salary. The Administrative Board of KSB Management SE has set the performance targets of EBIT\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\nmargin, sales revenue and the overall assessment of the personal performance of the Managing Directors in equal parts as the basis for assessment.\n\nThe long-term variable remuneration is structured as an annually granted plan with a three-year, forward-looking assessment period. The target amount corresponds to 25 % of the respective regular annual salary. The Administrative Board has defined the performance target as the equally weighted average of the earnings per share (EPS) over three years with a weighting of 80 % and the achievement of the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) sustainability goals with a weighting of 20 %. By considering earnings per share, a focus is placed on the long-term successful performance of the company as well as linking the interests of the Managing Directors with the interests of the shareholders.\n\nThe final payment of the long-term variable remuneration is made after the end of the assessment period. For the 2021 and 2022 financial years, a one-time payment on account amounting to 40 % of the target value in the event of 100 % target achievement was agreed and paid. At the end of the assessment period, it will be offset against any amount paid out in excess of this; no repayment has been agreed in the event that the sum falls short of this amount.\n\nAs at the reporting date, the Group recognised provisions for pension obligations to current Managing Directors of KSB Management SE amounting to € 644 thousand (previous year: € 578 thousand), and to former members of the Board of Management of KSB AG (excluding the Managing Directors of KSB Management SE) and their surviving dependants amounting to € 32,084 thousand (previous year: € 33,070 thousand). The total remuneration of the latter persons amounted to € 2,761 thousand in the past financial year (previous year: € 2,380 thousand).\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board receive a fixed remuneration, attendance fees and reimbursement of expenses. In addition, they receive remuneration for activities that require them to devote special time to the tasks of the Supervisory Board that go beyond preparing and holding meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees. The short-term benefits paid to members of the Supervisory Board amount to € 851 thousand for the 2023 financial year (previous year: € 894 thousand). At the end of the financial year, liabilities of € 472 thousand (previous year: € 513 thousand) were recognised towards the members of the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn addition, assets and services amounting to € 20 thousand (previous year: € 21 thousand) were sold to other related parties (corporate bodies) in the reporting year.\n\n#### **Auditors**\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, based in Frankfurt am Main with an office in Mannheim, were appointed as auditors and group auditors for the 2023 financial year at the Annual General Meeting of KSB SE & Co. KGaA on 4 May 2023.\n\nThe following table shows the total fees for all services that KSB utilised in the reporting year from the global PwC network, to which the group auditors belong. It also shows the specific share of the total amount attributable to the Group auditors based in Germany.\n\n| Total fees PricewaterhouseCoopers / Group auditors in 2023 |                       |                                                                                                   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| € thousands                                                | Global<br>PwC network | Attributable to:<br>Pricewaterhouse<br>-Coopers GmbH<br>Wirtschafts-<br>prüfungs-<br>gesellschaft |\n| Audit fees                                                 | 2,361                 | 886                                                                                               |\n| Tax advisory services                                      | 40                    | –                                                                                                 |\n| Other certification services                               | 98                    | 76                                                                                                |\n| Other services                                             | 139                   | 104                                                                                               |\n|                                                            | 2,638                 | 1,066                                                                                             |\n\nThe audit fees include costs for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the statutory annual financial statements of KSB SE & Co.

KGaA, Frankenthal, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023, and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting policy information. In addition, we have audited the group management report of KSB SE & Co. KGaA, which is combined with the Company's management report, for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the section \"Description of Key Features of the Internal Control System, the Risk Management System and the Compliance Management System in Accordance with the A.5 DCGK 2022 Recommendation\" of the group management report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § [Article] 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and\n- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the group management report does not cover the content of the section referred to above.\n\nPursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n#### **BASIS FOR THE AUDIT OPINIONS**\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") in compliance with German Generally Accepted \n\n{183}------------------------------------------------\n\nStandards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\n#### **KEY AUDIT MATTERS IN THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows:\n\n- <sup>1</sup> Recoverability of goodwill\n- **<sup>2</sup>** Accounting treatment of project orders recognized over time\n\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows:\n\n- **<sup>1</sup>** Matter and issue\n- <sup>2</sup> Audit approach and findings\n- **<sup>3</sup>** Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter we present the key audit matters:\n\n#### **<sup>1</sup> Recoverability of goodwill**\n\n**<sup>1</sup>** In the Company's consolidated financial statements goodwill amounting in total to EUR 30.4 million is reported under the \"Intangible assets\" balance sheet item.

Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide\n\nKSB Group / Annual Report 2023\n\ndeter-mine any possible need for write-downs. Impairment testing is carried out at the level of the cash-generating units to which the relevant goodwill is allocated. The carrying amount of the relevant cash-generating unit, including goodwill, is compared with the corresponding recoverable amount in the context of the impairment test. The recoverable amount is generally calculated on the basis of the value in use. The present value of the future cash flows from the respective cash-generating unit normally serves as the basis of valuation. The present values are calculated using discounted cash flow models. For this purpose, the adopted medium-term business plan of the Group forms the starting point which is extrapolated based on assump-tions about long-term rates of growth. Expectations relating to future market developments and assumptions about the development of macroeconomic factors on the business activities of the Group are also taken into account. The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital for the relevant cash-generating unit. The impairment test determined that it was necessary to recognize write-downs amounting to a total of EUR 0.7 million. The outcome of this valuation is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the executive directors with respect to the future cash inflows from the respective cash-generating unit, on the discount rate used, the rate of growth as well as other assumptions, and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background and due to the complex nature of the valuation, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n**<sup>2</sup>** As part of our audit, we assessed the methodology employed for the purposes of performing the impairment test, among other things. After matching the future cash inflows used for the calculation against the adopted medium-term business plan of the Group, we assessed the appropriateness of the calculation, in particular by reconciling it with general and sector specific market expectations. We also assessed the appropriate consideration of the costs of Group functions. In the knowledge that even relatively small changes in the discount rate applied can have a material impact on the value of the entity calculated using this method, we focused our testing in particular on the parameters used to determine the discount rate applied and assessed the calculation model. We evaluated the sensitivity analyses performed by the Company, in order to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the projections. We verified that the necessary disclosures were made in the notes to the consolidated financial statements relating to the cash-generating units for which a reasonably possible change in an assumption would result in the recoverable amount falling below the carrying amount of the cash-generating units including the allocated goodwill.\n\nOverall, the measurement inputs and assumptions used by the executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also within the ranges considered by us to be reasonable.\n\n**<sup>3</sup>** The Company's disclosures on goodwill are contained in section III \"Accounting policies\", IV. \"Balance sheet disclosures\" note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{185}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **<sup>2</sup> Accounting treatment of project orders recognized over time**\n\n**<sup>1</sup>** In the Company's consolidated financial statements revenue totaling EUR 2,819.0 million is reported in the consolidated income statement. The Company has put in place comprehensive systems and processes throughout the Group for the purposes of accurately recognizing and deferring revenue. Revenue amounting to EUR 676.5 million is attributable to project orders recognized over time and the service business. In the case of project orders, the stage of completion is estimated based on the ratio of costs already incurred to budgeted total costs. IFRS 15 requires estimates and judgments to be made for certain areas, which were assessed for appropriate-ness in the context of our audit. In particular, the estimation of the planned total costs of the project orders to be recognized over time and the appropriate allocation of costs incurred to the orders are based on the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors. Against this background and due to the resulting estimation uncertainties and the complexity of the accounting treatment under Group-wide application of IFRS 15, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n**<sup>2</sup>** As part of our audit, among other things we assessed the processes and controls established by the Group for the recognition of revenue from project orders recognized over time, taking into account the stage of completion. In addition, with respect to project orders recognized over time we examined projects on a sample basis to determine whether they met the requirements for recognizing revenue over time in accordance with IFRS 15. We assessed the estimates and judgments made by the executive directors with respect to the recognition and deferral of revenue for the various business models of the Group companies. Furthermore, we assessed the calculation of percentage of completion and the proportionate recognition of revenue and profit derived from this. In this connection we examined the calculation of both the budgeted total costs and the costs actually incurred. We assessed the pro-gress of the respective projects, among other things based on interviews with project manag-ers and by inspecting project documentation. In addition, we assessed the consistency of the methods used to calculate the costs incurred.\n\nWe also addressed the inherent audit risk in this audit area by means of audit procedures that were consistently applied throughout the Group. We were able to satisfy ourselves that the systems, processes and controls in place are appropriate and that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors are sufficiently documented and substantiated to ensure that revenue is appropriately accounted for.\n\n**<sup>3</sup>** The Company's disclosures on the accounting treatment of project orders recognized over time are contained in sections III. \"Accounting policies\", IV. \"Notes to the balance sheet\", nos. 8 and 13 and V. \"Notes to the income statement\", no. 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{186}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**186** Management and Issues 2023 Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements **General Information**\n\n**<sup>2</sup> Accounting treatment of project orders recognized over time**\n\nwas of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\nrevenue is appropriately accounted for.\n\nfinancial statements.\n\n**<sup>1</sup>** In the Company's consolidated financial statements revenue totaling EUR 2,819.0 million is reported in the consolidated income statement.

We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n\n{189}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis.

Gas shortages combined with higher gas prices posed particular challenges for the manufacturing industry in Germany. On the procurement markets, the easing of the inflation wave and a slight improvement in the availability of important bought-in parts provided some relief.\n\nUnfortunately, our hopes for an improvement in the global political situation remained unfulfilled. The war in Ukraine continued unabated. In the second quarter, fears about global economic relations intensified due to the simmering China-Taiwan conflict.

Thanks to our regional production plants organised in a global manufacturing network, we can quickly supply our customers in all key markets with high-quality products. By systematically aligning all activities with market requirements, we achieved a good order intake despite strong competition in nearly all Market Areas.\n\nEconomic downturns, such as in the construction industry and the German mechanical engineering industry, which particularly dampened growth in Building Services and General Industry, were offset by positive developments in the Mining, Petrochemicals / Chemicals, Energy and Water Market Areas. KSB's broad product range proved to be an advantage.\n\nOur strong earnings position is supported by tight cost control across the Group. A consistent focus on the service and spare parts business under the KSB SupremeServ brand made a substantial contribution to the profitable growth of the entire Group.\n\nThis business success is reflected in the rising valuation of KSB on the financial markets, leading to its inclusion in the SDAX in December.\n\n#### **Strategy 2030**\n\nAn important milestone was the adoption of the Mission TEN30 strategy. In addition to the goal of ten percent profitability by 2030, the strategy sets out numerous targets and measures to drive the company forward. Previous programmes, such as reducing costs at KSB SE & Co. KGaA, were successfully completed.\n\n#### **Megatrends as opportunities**\n\nWith our many years of expertise in fluid handling, we are not only benefiting from the megatrends and major challenges in the world, but are also actively shaping them with new technologies.\n\nThe growing demand for electric motors required for e-mobility and the generation of solar and wind energy will increase the demand for copper and consequently for pumps in the mining industry. The Energy Market Area will also tap new potential as a result of the change in the energy mix. In the Petrochemicals / Chemicals Market Area, KSB will set technological standards in hydrogen production and carbon capture. The growing global population and urbanisation are placing huge demands on water supply and waste water disposal. Adding to this are weather extremes as a result of climate change, the consequences of which we can mitigate with futureoriented water management using pumps.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Global investments**\n\nKSB increased its global investment volume to 136 million euros in 2023, investing in the expansion and technological or energy-related modernisation of its locations in all key markets. In Frankenthal, KSB commissioned a new heating station, saving 900 tonnes of CO2 annually. At its Pegnitz location, KSB adopted a comprehensive concept for the future which saw an investment of 25 million euros in capacity expansion and sustainable production. In India, a new office complex commenced operations and in China construction work began on a cuttingedge production facility for chemical pumps.\n\n#### **Employee engagement**\n\nThe satisfaction and engagement of our employees is a key pillar in the company's success – and a matter close to my heart. Successful corporate development is not possible without highly dedicated people who see change as an opportunity. At the same time, the meaningfulness of the company's business activities and its social competence are becoming increasingly important for attracting the best talent. We have therefore introduced a variety of measures worldwide to promote our corporate culture and strengthen loyalty to the company.\n\n#### **The KSB brand**\n\nStrengthened by the company's sustained positive development, strategic goals and marketleading position, KSB focused on raising brand awareness as a Global Champion in the reporting year. In order to visibly reflect this positive change in our brand image, we are currently revising our logo, the associated brand claim and our corporate values. Have a look at the exclusive initial preview on the next page.\n\n#### **The 2024 financial year**\n\nWe anticipate a wide range of challenges in the new financial year, which will be dominated by political elections in key markets such as India, the USA, South Africa and Europe. Uncertain interest rate trends, global conflicts and the current lack of growth impetus in key countries mean that we are not expecting a significant upturn. However, our confidence in developing the company remains unwavering. KSB's positioning makes it resilient and we will once again generate substantial value for our shareholders, employees and business partners in the 2024 financial year.\n\nRilie\n\nDr. Stephan Timmermann, CEO\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/12/Picture/1 description: The image shows the logo for KSB.

It advised the general partner, KSB Management SE, acting through its Managing Directors, on corporate management issues and monitored its work. The Managing Directors informed the Supervisory Board about current developments, including but not limited to the company's business, financial and staffing situation, planned investments, corporate planning and strategy via written and oral reports prepared regularly and on an ad hoc basis in a comprehensive and timely manner.\n\nThe Supervisory Board discussed business transactions of significance to the company in depth on the basis of reports submitted by the Managing Directors. Any departures in business developments from the plans and targets were questioned and commented on in detail by the Managing Directors. The Supervisory Board also dealt with risk situations, risk management and compliance. Beyond the intensive work in plenary sessions and in the committees, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board in particular and other members of the Supervisory Board were in constant contact with the Managing Directors also between scheduled meetings. There was an ongoing exchange of information with the Administrative Board of KSB Management SE, including but not limited to its Chairman, on current business developments and on material transactions, as well as on questions of strategy and planning. The Chairman of the Administrative Board also participated regularly in the Supervisory Board meetings. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board and his deputy were guests of the Administrative Board on selected issues. The Supervisory Board also convened regularly in the absence of the Management.\n\nThe company continued to support the members of the Supervisory Board in their training measures during the reporting year, providing them with regular information about the rights, obligations and practice of the Supervisory Board. As part of the onboarding process, new members of the Supervisory Board are quickly familiarised with relevant company topics through introductory discussions with committee members and managers responsible for functional areas.\n\n#### **Main focus of work in the Supervisory Board plenary sessions**\n\nThe Supervisory Board held five regular in-person meetings in the 2023 financial year; at three of these meetings, one respectively two Supervisory Board members attended via video conference. In addition, the Supervisory Board held a constituent meeting in personal attendance following the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2023.\n\nKey subjects of nearly all Supervisory Board meetings were the performance of the company and the KSB Group, primarily with regard to their business and financial situation, measures for securing future business development, major investment projects and risk management topics.\n\nRegular consultations with the Managing Directors on business development included the analysis of developments in the Market Areas of the Pumps Segment, the Valves and the KSB SupremeServ Segments, as well as in the Regions. Suitable measures to improve results of operations were discussed, as were the growth initiatives presented by the Managing Directors.\n\nThe Managing Directors also provided regular information on the development of ongoing major investments in our production facilities at various sites. The focus in 2023 was on two Asian locations: In the second half of the year, construction work began on a pump factory in Shanghai, \n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\nwhich will in particular supply China's significant chemical industry. At the Shirwal factory in India, the construction of the administration building and the remaining work on the new production halls were completed in 2023.\n\nThe Supervisory Board was also briefed regularly on the further development of the strategy, which was finalised in the fourth quarter of 2023 with the involvement of individual Supervisory Board members and then approved by the Administrative Board of KSB Management SE. Its implementation is to help to sustainably increase the return on sales to a level of at least ten percent by 2030 through targeted growth initiatives in the Segments and Market Areas. The operational plans are supported by overarching and centrally managed measures. In addition to the aforementioned sustainability goals, these include technological development, improving digital customer interfaces and intensifying application knowledge in Sales.\n\nThe following key topics were discussed at the individual Supervisory Board meetings:\n\nThe meeting in March 2023 particularly addressed the audit and approval of the annual financial statements for the 2022 financial year, including the combined management report and the combined separate non-financial report for the company and the KSB Group in accordance with Sections 315b, 315c in conjunction with Sections 289c to 289e HGB [*Handelsgesetzbuch* – German Commercial Code]; the auditors also explained the key audit areas and results. The Chairman of the Audit Committee gave a detailed account of the audit carried out on accounting processes for the period. The Supervisory Board agreed to the proposal on the appropriation of the net retained earnings presented by the general partner for the 2022 financial year. It also approved the remuneration report pursuant to Section 162 AktG [*Aktiengesetz* – German Public Companies Act] for the 2022 financial year. At this meeting, the Supervisory Board also discussed the development of a US service and re-engineering company acquired in 2010, which primarily supplies customers in the energy and refinery markets. In 2022, the company and the majority of its activities were relocated to a newly built site with a modern test facility and it has since then increasingly focused on growth.\n\nIn May, the Supervisory Board held a comprehensive review of business development in the countries of Northern, Eastern and Southeastern Europe, which KSB has combined into one area of responsibility. The strength of KSB SupremeServ's business there is very positive, representing an important pillar of the Group's earnings. The valve business is also developing at an aboveaverage rate in this region and reflects the high potential of this Segment. Another focus of the meeting was on the centralised measures for the development of Sales. The aim is to align its organisation and tools with customers' growing digital requirements while simultaneously improving efficiency at KSB.\n\nAt the meeting in July, the Supervisory Board discussed business development in two Regions. The core market of Europe continues to be of particular importance to the Group. The fact that the Europe-based parent company KSB SE & Co. KGaA achieved a significant improvement in its earnings capacity in 2023 was viewed by the Supervisory Board as very encouraging. The positive development is due, among other things, to the earnings enhancement programme that has been systematically implemented since 2020 and overseen by the Supervisory Board.

The positive development is due, among other things, to the earnings enhancement programme that has been systematically implemented since 2020 and overseen by the Supervisory Board. The Managing Directors see great potential in the Region Middle East / Africa, particularly in the Water Market Area; the company therefore plans to further expand its presence there.\n\nIn October, the Supervisory Board held a meeting at KSB ITUR Spain, S.A., Spain. The management reported on the development of the company acquired in 2003 and its strategic role within the KSB Group. The company – together with the companies in France and Portugal – is assigned to the Region Europe West; its development was also discussed in detail. Other topics on the agenda included the expansion of the e-sales business and the status of preparations for rolling out the ERP software SAP S/4HANA, which will replace SAP's ERP software currently used. The Managing Directors wish to combine this transformation with the implementation of even more efficient processes.\n\nThe Supervisory Board addressed the planning for the 2024 financial year and medium-term planning at the meeting in December. It received detailed reports on the corresponding goals, notably on order intake, sales revenue and earnings. Particular emphasis was placed on discussing the investment budget; this is largely earmarked for the extension of production capacities in growth markets and the modernisation of locations. Business development in the Region Asia / Pacific was also discussed: Thanks to the economic dynamics in individual countries, KSB achieved above-average growth there, particularly in the KSB SupremeServ Segment and in the Mining and Water Market Areas.\n\n#### **Main focus of work in the committees**\n\nIn order to enable it to fulfil its duties efficiently, the Supervisory Board worked with four committees during the reporting year. These prepared the Supervisory Board's resolutions and the special topics to be discussed in the plenary sessions. In addition, they made their own decisions within the scope of their authorities. This allocation has proved worthwhile in practice. The Chairs of the committees regularly and comprehensively reported in the plenary sessions on the content and results of the work carried out in the committees.\n\n#### **SUPERVISORY BOARD COMMITTEES**\n\nand their Chairs, as well as number of meetings in the reporting year\n\n#### **CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE**\n\nChair: Klaus Kühborth No. of meetings: 5\n\n#### **NOMINATION COMMITTEE**\n\nMembers: Dr. Bernd Flohr Klaus Kühborth No. of meetings: 1\n\n#### **PERSONNEL COMMITTEE**\n\nChair: Dr. Bernd Flohr No. of meetings: 2\n\n#### **AUDIT COMMITTEE**\n\nChair: Klaus Burchards No. of meetings: 6\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                 | Supervisory<br>Board | Nomination<br>Committee | Corporate<br>Development<br>Committee | Personnel<br>Committee | Audit<br>Committee |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| Dr. Bernd Flohr                 | 5/5                  | 1/1                     |                                       | 2/2                    | 6/6                |\n| René Klotz (until May 2023)     | 2/5                  |                         | 2/5                                   |                        |                    |\n| Claudia Augustin                | 5/5                  |                         |                                       | 2/2                    |                    |\n| Klaus Burchards                 | 4/5                  |                         |                                       |                        | 6/6                |\n| Arturo Esquinca                 | 5/5                  |                         | 5/5                                   |                        |                    |\n| Klaus Kühborth                  | 5/5                  | 1/1                     | 5/5                                   |                        |                    |\n| Birgit Mohme                    | 4/5                  |                         |                                       |                        | 4/6                |\n| Thomas Pabst                    | 5/5                  |                         | 5/5                                   |                        |                    |\n| Prof. Dr. Corinna Salander      | 4/5                  |                         | 3/5                                   |                        |                    |\n| Harald Schöberl                 | 5/5                  |                         |                                       |                        | 6/6                |\n| Volker Seidel                   | 5/5                  |                         | 5/5                                   | 2/2                    |                    |\n| Gabriele Sommer                 | 4/5                  |                         |                                       | 2/2                    |                    |\n| Jürgen Walther (since May 2023) | 3/5                  |                         | 3/5                                   |                        |                    |\n\n#### **Attendance at meetings**\n\nThe **Audit Committee** convened six times in the reporting year, with five meetings held in person and one as a video conference. It discussed the 2022 annual and consolidated financial statements and the relevant audit reports submitted by the auditors. The combined separate non-financial report and remuneration report pursuant to Section 162 AktG were also discussed in detail. The committee meetings were generally attended by the Managing Directors and the managers of the relevant specialist departments, as well as, on multiple occasions, the auditors. The Audit Committee, in particular its Chairman, regularly exchanged ideas with the auditors in preparatory meetings, without participation of the Managing Directors. The committee prepared the independent examination by the Supervisory Board of the financial statements, the combined management reports and the proposal on profit appropriation. In addition, the Audit Committee submitted a recommendation for the selection of auditors by the 2023 Annual General Meeting to the Supervisory Board plenary session. The Audit Committee also commissioned the auditors with auditing the annual and consolidated financial statements for the 2023 financial year and defined specific key areas for the audit together with the auditors. It obtained the declaration of independence by the auditors and monitored the auditors' continued independence and performance of non-audit services.

Another key focus was on the planned implementation of the EU CSRD Directive, which will result in much more extensive sustainability reporting in future. Due to the legally required rotation of the auditors, the committee also dealt with the implementation of a transparent and non-discriminatory procedure for the selection of the auditors for the 2025 financial year. At its meeting on 8 November 2023, the committee decided to prepare and initiate a tender process in accordance with the legal requirements and commissioned the Managing Directors with its implementation.\n\nThe **Personnel Committee** held two in-person meetings in the reporting year. The committee focuses on subjects and challenges relating to Human Resources activities within the Group. It also decides in particular on the conducting of transactions for which the Supervisory Board has been appointed to represent the company pursuant to Section 112 AktG, as well as on matters relating to the remuneration of the Supervisory Board members. In the reporting year, the committee obtained information on the progress of the roll-out of a global HR system for nearly all KSB companies. It was also briefed on how KSB is adapting to changing conditions in personnel recruitment and investing in personnel development. Lastly, the committee also dealt with an issue relating to the Supervisory Board itself: Following an in-depth review of the Supervisory Board remuneration, which has remained unchanged since 2017, it came to the conclusion that it should be moderately increased, in particular due to the constantly growing demands and the associated increase in workload as well as inflation-induced loss in value. Together with the general partner, the Supervisory Board will propose this for resolution at the 2024 Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe **Corporate Development Committee** deals with strategic issues in the fields of technology, production and sales, among other things. It also advises on the budget and planning. It convened five times in the reporting year.

Guests and speakers were also regularly involved via video conference. During these sessions, the committee engaged in multiple discussions on planned investments in production facilities, service locations and sales units. One example was the expansion of circulator production at the location in Ankara, Turkey. Demand for these products has risen significantly following the boom in the heating market and in particular in the heat pump market. The committee also discussed the successful development of a company founded several years ago in India: KSB Tech Pvt. Ltd., an engineering and IT services company whose portfolio ranges from product development and design through to IT services and collaboration in strategic IT projects. The committee was also briefed on the planned procedure for the introduction of S/4HANA. As the preparatory work has largely been completed, detailed planning for this extensive transformation project will begin in the first half of 2024. Finally, the committee reviewed planning for 2024 and the annual investment budget including discussions of the current investment focus.\n\nThe **Nomination Committee** recommends to the Supervisory Board suitable candidates for election as Supervisory Board members, whom the Supervisory Board then proposes to the Annual General Meeting. In looking for and evaluating suitable candidates with the requisite expertise and experience of the industry, long-term succession planning is a key factor. The committee held one in-person meeting in the reporting year.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Corporate Governance and Statement of Compliance**\n\nThe Supervisory Board continuously monitored developments in corporate governance standards throughout the reporting year.

The pumps are installed in water filter systems that are powered by electricity from solar cells and supply around 5,000 people with clean water.\n\nImage /page/24/Picture/15 description: The image shows a large, white, multi-story building with many windows. The building has a modern architectural style and appears to be well-maintained. The sky is visible in the background, with some clouds present. There is a crosswalk in front of the building.\n\n#### **KSB share moves up to SDAX**\n\nOn 18 December, the KSB preference share is included in the SDAX.\n\nThe decisive criterion for its promotion is the market capitalisation of KSB's free float preference shares. Around 20 percent of the preference shares are held through Johannes und Jacob Klein GmbH as well as KSB Stiftung [KSB Foundation]. The KSB shares have been traded on the stock exchange since 1895. The KSB preference share price has almost tripled in the last three years.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-25-0\"></span>**Combined Separate Non-financial Report**\n\nSustainability is one of KSB's strategic pillars and has always been a key focus of its business activities. The company understands sustainability to encompass the responsible use of resources and the environment as well as its responsibility to employees and corporate social commitment. These topics are covered in this combined separate non-financial report pursuant to Sections 289b(3) and 315b(3) HGB [*Handelsgesetzbuch* – German Commercial Code] and Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the Establishment of a Framework to Facilitate Sustainable Investment, and Amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (hereinafter referred to as the EU Taxonomy Regulation). The report fulfils the requirements of the CSR Directive Implementation Act [*CSR-Richtlinie-Umsetzungsgesetz*] and combines the statement at company level with the Group statement outside of the management report.\n\nIn accordance with its business model, KSB supplies customers worldwide with high-quality pumps and valves as well as related support services. The company develops the vast majority of its products itself and manufactures them in factories on four continents. The products are sold via its own sales organisation, supported by dealer networks comprising selected partners. The business model is presented in the Group management report on page 62.\n\nAs a member of the UN Global Compact, KSB commits to aligning its business activities with ten universal principles. The Global Compact principles apply equally to managers and employees throughout the company as well as to all suppliers and business partners.\n\n#### **Sustainability Management at KSB**\n\nKSB has formulated its own corporate sustainability principles via a Group-wide sustainability policy. They are binding for all locations and all companies within the KSB Group. A committee chaired by the CEO regularly reviews progress on sustainability issues and the implementation of Group-wide sustainability goals. In addition, a global network with representatives from all nine KSB Regions ensures that sustainability issues are driven forward in their respective countries. They report on progress, local initiatives and measures, as well as the completion of objectives. Management also receives a compliance report twice a year as well as an annual review of management issues relating to quality, the environment and occupational health and safety.\n\nThe Sustainability Committee includes the CEO and management staff from Human Resources, Legal & Compliance, Production, Product Management, Purchasing, Communications, Strategy and Integrated Management. A Valves representative has been a member of the committee since 2023 in order to report on the development of sustainability issues in this Group segment.\n\nKSB operates a global integrated management system in order to fulfil consistently high standards worldwide with regard to quality, risk, environment, occupational health and safety, and sustainability. It is process-oriented and complies with the requirements of the international ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 26000 and ISO 45001 standards as well as the UN Global Compact. The management system governs organisational processes and workflows, responsibilities, procedures and processes at Group level and at our individual locations.\n\n**KSB supports the 17 Sustainable Development Goals set out by the United Nations. Ten of these are particularly important for the company:**\n\nImage /page/25/Figure/13 description: The image shows a collection of icons representing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The x-axis is labeled \"Relevance for KSB's business activities\" and ranges from 1 to 5. The y-axis is labeled \"Impact on society\\*\" and ranges from 1 to 5. There are several data points plotted on the scatter plot. \"Resource efficiency\" is plotted at approximately (2.5, 4.5). \"Diversity\" is plotted at approximately (3, 3.7). \"Climate change mitigation\" is plotted at approximately (2.7, 3.2). \"Sustainable supply chains\" is plotted at approximately (2.7, 2.7). \"Social responsibility\" is plotted at approximately (2.5, 2.2). \"Respecting human rights\" is plotted at approximately (3.5, 5). \"Occupational health and safety\" is plotted at approximately (4.5, 5). \"Product responsibility\" is plotted at approximately (4.2, 4.5). \"Energy-efficient products\" is plotted at approximately (4.2, 4.2). \"Professional training and development\" is plotted at approximately (4.2, 3.7). \"Compliance\" is plotted at approximately (4, 3.2). A legend indicates that blue squares represent ecological factors, light blue squares represent social factors, light-blue squares represent economic factors, and gray squares represent general factors. A footnote states \"\\* With regard to the environment, labour and social issues, human rights and anti-corruption\".\n\n#### **Sustainability Reporting**\n\nThe management concepts relating to material issues outlined here apply to both the Group and to KSB SE & Co.KGaA; any instances where this is not the case are duly indicated. All information in the non-financial report relates to KSB SE & Co. KGaA and the Group in 2023. References to information not included in the Group management report in this section represent supplementary information and are not part of the separate non-financial report. PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft performed a limited assurance engagement on the information in this report in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised) and issued an independent assurance report; see page 56.\n\nIn the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environment, anti-corruption and sustainability in the supply chain, the concepts and activities set out in this report follow the principles of the UN Global Compact, as well as national and international regulations.\n\nThe non-financial report covers 29 material Group companies, unless otherwise stated. These were selected on the basis of their significant impact on aspects such as energy consumption and the number of employees. The 29 companies employ 87.9 % of the workforce and account for 97.8 % of Group-wide energy consumption. The remaining companies have no significant impact on non-financial aspects. KSB has therefore not expanded this report to include these Group companies as they have no material impact on the issues it covers in the reporting year. The 29 Group companies include all consolidated subsidiaries with production plants and two service companies with energy-intensive workshops.\n\nAs part of its corporate responsibility strategy, KSB is also committed to supporting a diverse range of social initiatives. The company chooses to report on these activities on an entirely voluntary basis, as these do not have any significant or material impact on its business success.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Non-financial objectives up to 2025 and performance indicators**\n\n| Aspects                               | Objectives up to 2025                                                                                                     | Performance indicators                                            |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Resource efficiency                   | More than half of newly developed products are subject to ecological<br>assessment.                                       | Number of development projects                                    |\n| Energy-efficient products             | KSB's water pumps save an annual 850,000 tonnes of CO2.                                                                   | CO2 savings for KSB water pumps with<br>variable speed drives     |\n| Emissions                             | KSB production plants reduce their CO2 emissions by 30 %.<br>(Reference year: 2018)                                       | CO2 emissions at production sites                                 |\n| Education and training                | Each employee invests at least 30 hours per year in training and development.                                             | Number of training hours per employee per year                    |\n| Equal opportunities                   | Women make up at least 20 % of management staff.                                                                          | Proportion of women in management positions                       |\n| Engagement                            | The employee satisfaction index is 80 %.                                                                                  | Engagement score according to<br>employee survey                  |\n| Occupational health<br>and safety     | The number of working days lost due to occupational accidents is<br>reduced to fewer than 0.3 days per employee per year. | Number of days lost due to accidents<br>(lost time accident rate) |\n| Social commitment                     | KSB is involved in at least 25 social projects worldwide every year.                                                      | Number of CSR projects                                            |\n| Sustainability in the<br>supply chain | The sustainability performance of 90 % of the key regional and<br>global suppliers is assessed.                           | Proportion of suppliers assessed                                  |\n\n\\* The 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations take into account the three dimensions of sustainability: social, environmental and economic aspects. KSB's material sustainability issues relate to the goals addressing poverty (1), hunger (2), health and well-being (3), quality education (4), gender equality (5), clean water and sanitation (6), decent work conditions and economic growth (8), sustainable consumption and production (12) and climate action (13).\n\n#### **Implementation of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive**\n\nFollowing the introduction of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the associated European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), new rules for nonfinancial reporting by companies will apply from the 2024 reporting year. KSB made initial preparations for this in the reporting year. For example, the company commissioned a scientific study to develop a concept for the double materiality assessment required by the EU directive. In addition, experts from an auditing firm helped to identify the material issues for KSB. This involved interviews on the topics of the environment, social matters and corporate governance, validation of the range of topics and an assessment of material impacts, risks and opportunities. The implementation phase for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive is being conducted in the current reporting year.\n\n#### **Material Issues**\n\nKSB communicates regularly with various stakeholders in order to identify their interests and expectations regarding the company.

All other risks affecting business activities are described in the Group management report from page 83.\n\n#### **Goals for 2025**\n\nKSB supports the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals. In 2019, the company developed nine specific sustainability objectives which are aligned with these Sustainable Development Goals and the material issues defined. The company aims to achieve them by 2025 at the latest.\n\nThe nine objectives adopted by Management cover environmental, employee, social and supply chain sustainability topics. They focus on climate change mitigation, the promotion of decent working conditions and sustainable economic growth, and health and well-being. In addition, KSB is committed to doing even more to promote equal opportunities. The company also intends to gather more comprehensive information on how suppliers deal with sustainability issues. KSB is dedicated to combating poverty and hunger as well as ensuring the availability of clean water and education through social projects. Developing the knowledge of employees is another binding goal. More information on the individual objectives and progress towards their completion at the end of the reporting year is provided in the overview on pages 28 /29, and in the respective sections of this non-financial report.\n\nManagement staff with specialist responsibility for Production, Product Management, Human Resources, Purchasing, Communications and Integrated Management have developed suitable plans and devised specific measures for achieving the objectives by 2025.

KGaA \\*\\*\\* Exluding vehicle fleet\n\nCO²\n\nBy 2025, KSB intends to assess the environmental impact of more than 50 % of its development projects in accordance with the international ISO 14040 standard. This concerns new product developments and significant design modifications to existing type series.Detailed information on the life cycle assessments of new products can thus be determined.\n\nA further goal is to reduce the CO2 emissions, excluding those of the vehicle fleet, produced by the main locations – which are chiefly the manufacturing plants – by 30 %, also by 2025 (based on the 2018 figure).\n\n#### **Organisation, processes and measures:**\n\nKSB follows the internationally recognised ISO 14001 environmental management system to continuously improve its environmental performance. To date, the company has implemented the environmental management system at 39 production and assembly locations (KSB SE & Co. KGaA: 3 locations); this represents 93 % coverage.\n\nThe EU Energy Efficiency Directive requires all large companies to carry out regular energy audits in order to contribute to the European energy and climate protection targets. KSB carries out these energy audits at its major European locations to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In the reporting year, audits took place at all five production locations in Germany. The resulting measures are designed to reduce the company's energy consumption. They include construction projects such as new buildings and renovations as well as energy-related measures such as insulation, the replacement of lighting systems with LEDs and the replacement of machinery and systems with low energy efficiency.\n\n# In 2023, KSB's German employees travelled almost 600,000 kilometres by train for their business trips.\n\nA new heating station was commissioned at the Group's largest location in Frankenthal in 2023. The 15-million-euro investment increases the share of renewable heat from biomass. In combination with the latest technology, this will yield energy savings of 3,700,000 kilowatt hours per year, equivalent to 900 tonnes of CO2.\n\nKSB wants to increase the proportion of renewable energy in its energy consumption. Aiming to reduce climate-damaging greenhouse gas emissions, the company obtains its electricity in many places from renewable sources. At the end of the reporting year, 13 Group companies were already using solar modules to generate electricity. Six Group companies in Argentina, Australia, China, Indonesia, Spain and the USA took this initiative in 2023.\n\nToday, many companies primarily use communication channels such as video conferencing and internet-based services for internal meetings and business contacts. KSB also makes the most of these facilities. When personal contact and business trips are necessary, employees opt for environmentally friendly transport wherever possible, such as the rail network of Deutsche Bahn, which uses 100 % green electricity in Germany. Based on Deutsche Bahn's environmental balance sheet, KSB was able to save more than 128 tonnes of CO2 in 2023 compared to journeys with conventional vehicles (previous year: more than 90 tonnes of CO2). In 2023, KSB's German employees travelled almost 600,000 kilometres by train for their business trips.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn terms of Group-wide electricity consumption, the share of renewable energies grew by 3.9 % to 54.3 % (KSB SE & Co. KGaA: +2.2 % to 82.1 %).\n\nKSB regularly records and evaluates data on energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In 2023, energy consumption increased by 8,756 megawatt hours year on year to 276,021 megawatt hours. Compared with 2022, KSB SE & Co. KGaA reduced its energy consumption by 7,859 kilowatt hours to 81,091 kilowatt hours.\n\nIn terms of Group-wide electricity consumption, the share of renewable energies grew by 3.9 % to 54.3 % (KSB SE & Co. KGaA: +2.2 % to 82.1 %). KSB calculates CO2 emissions for Scope 1 and Scope 2 in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (market-based). For the first time, KSB also took into account emissions from the company's own vehicle fleet amounting to 5,573 tonnes of CO2 for the Group. The Group's emissions in the reporting year thus totalled 83,546 tonnes of CO2 (KSB SE & Co. KGaA: 13,289 tonnes of CO2). KSB does not take the vehicle fleet emissions into account for its sustainability target for reducing emissions in the production plants. The respective values are 77,973 tonnes of CO2 (previous year: 79,673 tonnes of CO2) for the Group and 12,077 tonnes of CO2 (previous year: 14,574 tonnes of CO2) for KSB SE & Co. KGaA. \"Out of scope\" is the share of biomass that only relates to KSB SE & Co. KGaA; it amounted to 2,175 tonnes of CO2 in the reporting year.\n\nIn order to further reduce energy consumption, KSB appoints Energy Officers at its German locations. They can be contacted by all employees and advise their colleagues on potential energy savings during regular walks around the premises.\n\nThe vital task of protecting the environment can only be accomplished together. In the reporting year, the KSB Green Community was established, an employee initiative to promote sustainable behaviour within the company and implement ideas from the workforce. Around 202 people are engaged in this project.\n\nKSB is progressively modernising its production facilities to reduce the amount of hazardous substances used in the manufacturing processes. If environmental pollution is identified at a location, the company sets aside provisions to meet obligations for necessary remediation. Provisions totalling € 966,000 were recognised for KSB SE & Co. KGaA in its annual financial statements.\n\nToday, companies are paying more attention to the eco-balance of the products they buy. This also applies to pumps and valves that are used in many applications. In order to assess the environmental impact of products within the scope of new developments or significant design changes to existing type series in accordance with the ISO 14040 international standard, KSB has been using a suitable process to conduct life cycle assessments since 2020. By the end of 2023, this had been applied to 15 out of 22 newly developed products. The company thus assessed the environmental impact of more than two thirds of its development projects in accordance with the ISO 14040 international standard.\n\nIn the reporting year, the KSB Green Community was established, an employee initiative to promote sustainable behaviour within the company and implement ideas from the workforce.\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2023, KSB increased the share of recycled aluminium and brass in a circulator pump to more than 90 % by selecting suitable suppliers.\n\nThe circular economy makes an important contribution to achieving economic growth despite increasingly scarce resources, ensuring that the materials and substances used in products are preserved for as long as possible. This approach to sustainable management protects the climate and reduces dependence on raw material imports. KSB therefore focuses on products with maximum durability that can be easily dismantled and broken down into separate material groups after use for comprehensive recycling. The company has adapted the product creation process for new developments accordingly. Each development is now analysed to determine the extent to which it is suitable for the circular economy. This process uses the material circularity indicator (MCI) to map the material flow's capacity for circularity. In 2022, KSB calculated this key indicator for five selected type series. The goal is to increase the current index value of the five series by a factor of 20 % by 2024. In the reporting year, the company increased the share of recycled aluminium and brass in a circulator pump to more than 90 % by selecting suitable suppliers. In the next step, KSB will determine the effects on the product's material circularity indicator.\n\n#### **Results:**\n\nKSB regularly records and evaluates data on energy consump-\n\nIn terms of Group-wide\n\ngrew by 3.9 % to 54.3 %\n\nelectricity consumption, the\n\nshare of renewable energies\n\n(KSB SE & Co.

The company's solutions enable its customers to operate their systems efficiently and responsibly. KSB strives to maximise its range of products offering many years of operation characterised by reliability and low energy consumption.\n\nBy 2025, KSB aims to reduce the CO2 emissions generated through the operation of its water pumps by 850,000 tonnes per year in Europe alone by using variable speed drives.\n\n#### **Organisation, processes and measures:**\n\nTo assess how much carbon dioxide KSB water pumps save during operation, Product Management determines the number of these pump sets in use based on the production volume since 2009, and calculates their average annual energy consumption. This estimate assumes 7,000 operating hours and a typical load profile for these applications as well as the average CO2 equivalent for Europe of 333 g/kWh according to the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) for 2020 for the European Union electricity mix. As shown in the Energy Efficiency with Electric Drives study published in 2017 by the German Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association (ZVEI), demand-oriented operation via the use of variable speed drives and high-efficiency motors allows energy savings averaging 30 % compared with conventional fixed-speed pump systems. The savings achieved with KSB standardised water pumps are often even higher than 30 %. The calculation will be continued.\n\nWith many countries seeing increased expansion of renewable energies and a renaissance in nuclear power, the electricity mix has changed considerably. The Sustainability Committee therefore agreed in 2022 to consider not only the current average CO2 equivalent (see above), but also the corresponding value from 2018 when determining CO2 emissions. The figure for 2018 was 590 g/kWh. This means that KSB water pumps are estimated to have saved over 459,000 tonnes of CO2 in 2023 (compared with the 2020 CO2 equivalent) or more than 810,000 tonnes (compared with the 2018 CO2 equivalent) thanks to their variable speed drives.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\nBased on a high-pressure pump that has been tried and tested for decades, KSB developed a new variant specifically for use in biomass power plants that was launched on the market in 2023.\n\nWhen developing new products, KSB focuses holistically on sustainability – from production to recycling the raw materials required. This was systematically implemented for the first time in a fully integrated in-line water pump for use in building services that was launched on the market in 2022. Thanks to reductions in size and weight compared with the previous type series, the product requires fewer raw materials such as aluminium, copper and steel; the manufacturing process of the pump thus generates 43 % less carbon dioxide (using the example of a pump for Q 100 % = 19.4 m<sup>3</sup>/h and H 100 %). KSB offsets the unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions generated in production of the first type series by purchasing certificates in accordance with the Verified Carbon Standard. In operation, control modes make for high levels of energy efficiency. A modular design allows for the straightforward, mono-material dismantling and recycling of individual parts at the end of the pump's service life. In the reporting year, the company increased the number of countries where this innovation has been released for sale by 15 to a total of 24 (previous year: 9).\n\nRenewable energies make an important contribution to climate change mitigation. KSB offers its customers worldwide high-quality solutions for this field of application in order to enable the economic and efficient use of renewable sources of energy for power generation. For example, based on a high-pressure pump that has been tried and tested for decades, KSB developed a new variant specifically for use in biomass power plants that was launched on the market in 2023.\n\nKSB attaches great importance to the role of product quality and safety in preventing accidents and environmental pollution. In production, the company complies with recognised standards such as CE and a well-established quality management system in accordance with the ISO 9001 international standard. This allows processes to be designed such that systematic errors during product manufacturing can be avoided. In addition, the company's own Made by KSB<sup>1</sup> certification available at eleven locations designates a level of quality which exceeds the requirements of the international standard for quality management. The certification stands for quality, short delivery times, professional service and efficient manufacturing processes. In 2023, two locations in India and South Africa completed the first audit as part of their initial certification process. Following a successful second audit in the current reporting year, these two locations will receive the Made by KSB certification.\n\n#### **Results:**\n\n- KSB water pumps are estimated to have saved over 459,000 tonnes of CO2 in 2023 (compared with the 2020 CO2 equivalent) or more than 810,000 tonnes (compared with the 2018 CO2 equivalent) thanks to their variable speed drives.\n- 122 KSB locations are certified to the ISO 9001:2015 quality management standard to ensure the reliability and safety of the products.\n\n#### **Compliance**\n\n#### **Objectives:**\n\nFor KSB, lawful conduct is an important and indispensable part of corporate social responsibility. Integrity and honest conduct is also something customers and business partners expect of the company. That is why compliance with legal regulations and Group-wide directives is part of KSB's core values.\n\nThe aim is to train all relevant employees on anti-trust/ cartel law and anti-corruption policies. Using a global matrix of requirements, KSB for example ensures that personnel with customer or supplier contact are regularly familiarised with these topics. The most recent Group-wide training programme started in 2022 and continued into the reporting year.

It ensures compliance with legal provisions and internal regulations, thereby safeguarding the economic success of the company in the long term. The compliance system is designed to ensure that KSB and its employees always act in line with applicable laws and directives.\n\nGroup Management is responsible for organising compliance and is monitored by the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee. A Group Compliance Officer is responsible for compliance management and reports to Group Management on relevant topics every six months. Support is provided by a Group Compliance Committee, consisting of top-level managers from the company.\n\nKSB's Compliance Manual describes structures and processes designed to ensure compliant conduct, and specifies responsibilities and instruments.\n\nA core element of the compliance system is the KSB Code of Conduct, which applies across the entire Group. It was revised to meet the requirements of the *Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz* [German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act] and published in the 2023 financial year. The Code of Conduct defines the key legal and business policy principles, providing employees with guidance for their actions. The Code also sets forth the corporate values which govern conduct in day-to-day work: honesty,\n\nresponsibility, professionalism, trust and appreciation. On this basis, KSB has formulated and communicated specific principles and rules of conduct.\n\nIn order to avoid risks resulting from a loss of reputation and legal repercussions, KSB issued two binding corporate directives, one covering compliance with cartel / anti-trust law and one dealing with the prevention of corruption. Both of these directives help to prevent potential violations. Employees receive corresponding training in recognising potential risks and practical guidance to ensure proper conduct.\n\nIn the event that employees become aware of violations or are unsure whether their actions are compliant, they refer the matter to the compliance organisation, and specifically to the designated Compliance Officer. If necessary, reports will be treated anonymously. In addition, any circumstances that give rise to legal or anti-trust concerns can be reported by any stakeholder directly to an independent ombudsperson, who can process potential cases without naming informants. Plausible evidence indicating infringements is investigated.\n\nKSB does not tolerate any violations of compliance by its employees. If investigations reveal sufficient evidence of a violation, this will have consequences for the individual concerned. Depending on the severity, sanctions range from a disciplinary warning to immediate termination of employment and law enforcement agencies may also be involved.\n\n#### **Results:**\n\n- 2023 saw 2,500 employees across the Group successfully complete the compliance training e-learning modules launched in 2022.\n- Reports of suspected compliance violations submitted via the ombudsperson and the compliance organisation triggered a clearly defined three-stage procedure in each case to clarify the facts and initiate the necessary measures.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management Rep\n\n## **Human Rights / Sustainability in the Supply Chain**\n\n#### **Objectives:**\n\nKSB respects and protects human rights. The company recognises the obligations this entails – internally and along the entire value creation chain. It is KSB's declared goal to prevent all forms of discrimination on the basis of individual characteristics such as age, origin, religion, appearance, gender, sexual orientation, disability or marital status. KSB does not tolerate discrimination, harassment or reprisals of any kind in the work environment.\n\nThe company also refuses to accept human rights violations by its suppliers. KSB therefore aims to assess 90 % of its global and regional key suppliers in terms of their sustainability performance by 2025. This will focus on, but not be limited to, their safeguarding of human rights.\n\n#### **Organisation, processes and measures:**\n\nBy signing the UN Global Compact, KSB has undertaken to protect and respect international human rights. The company also complies with the conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). All KSB companies respect the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. The company also observes government sanctions such as embargoes, and communicates internal directives on export control.\n\nKSB published a Human Rights Policy Statement. It documents the company's commitment with respect to employees, business partners and the public. The policy statement defines human rights criteria which must be observed in everyday business.\n\nAs required by the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, KSB has appointed a Human Rights Officer as an internal contact person. In 2022, the Group created an internal, globally valid documented procedure. It describes roles and responsibilities as well as the following processes: Due Diligence Process Supply Chain, Due Diligence Process Own Business Operations and General Risk Management Process.

In this context, it must be taken into account that compared with the previous year the company adjusted the calculation method in the reporting year in order to assess only the most important main suppliers. The changes resulted in positive effects on the progress towards goal achievement.\n\nKSB derives suitable measures from the self-disclosures requested from its suppliers via questionnaires. These include careful examination of how the issues are handled and monitoring of improvement measures taken.\n\nKSB's employees can contact the compliance organisation or an ombudsperson regarding human rights issues, following the same procedure as for suspected compliance violations (see page 35). The Human Rights Officer is available as an additional contact person.\n\n#### **Results:**\n\n- An online training course raises participants' awareness of human rights issues in the supply chain. In the reporting year, 56 employees participated. Since 2021, a total of 372 participants across the Group have completed this training.\n- By the end of the reporting year, KSB had assessed the sustainability performance of 67 % of its key global suppliers. This also includes the actions of business partners regarding human rights.\n\n#### **Employees**\n\n#### **GLOBAL COMMITMENT**\n\n#### **Objectives:**\n\nHigh-performing and motivated staff are the basis for a company's economic success. At KSB, more than 16,000 people work in a variety of ways around the globe to meet customers' needs in the best way possible. This is most effectively achieved with satisfied and committed employees. KSB is therefore striving to sustainably increase its engagement score, which measures employee satisfaction.\n\nDiversity and open-mindedness are key components of a productive corporate culture. KSB celebrates the diversity of its workforce, because diverse teams contribute the greatest range of different perspectives to the company's success. As a mechanical engineering company with a traditionally low quota of women, KSB is seeking to develop the potential of its female employees in particular. The goal is to increase the proportion of women in management positions to at least 20 % by 2025 (2023: 14 %).\n\nAs KSB's success is largely dependent on qualified personnel, the company attaches great importance to targeted training and development. Increasing digitalisation requires continuous learning in order to remain economically successful in the future. By 2025, the company aims to increase the number of training hours per employee per year to 30 hours; in the reporting year this figure was 21 hours. The industry average determined by VDMA [German Mechanical Engineering Industry Association] is 16.8 hours (source: Business Advisory 2021).\n\n#### **Organisation, processes and measures:**\n\nOverall responsibility for human resources issues at KSB lies with the head of Human Resources, who reports on topics including non-financial issues directly to the CEO and coordinates Group-wide HR issues. Individual locations' human resources departments look after their local managers and employees.\n\nWhen recruiting future employees, the company uses several channels. In addition to traditional job advertisements, contact with potential applicants is also established via online social networks and platforms as well as recruitment fairs. KSB also maintains cooperations with universities and schools to establish contact with potential candidates. Furthermore, KSB uses an employee recommendation programme to recruit suitable personnel.\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\nKSB increased the number of vocational training positions in Germany by more than 20 % at the annual start of training in 2023.\n\nIn order to ensure demand for skilled staff is met in the long term, KSB continuously trains young people. The company increased the number of vocational training positions in Germany by more than 20 % at the annual start of training in the reporting year. Junior employees at KSB have the opportunity to complete part of their training at subsidiaries abroad. This improves their capacity for international cooperation and offers valuable experience gained in a different environment. At the end of 2023, 268 trainees and students in dual work/ degree programmes were preparing for professional life at KSB's German locations. In 2023, KSB spent € 9,256,000 on vocational training programmes (2022: € 8,207,000).\n\nKSB continuously develops the skills and knowledge of its employees to prepare them for specialist and management positions. The company has developed a three-stage approach for this purpose. It distinguishes between Group-wide, departmental and individual professional training measures. Individual training requirements are mutually agreed between managers and employees at annual performance evaluation interviews. Qualification measures cover engineering, business administration, information technology, social competence, communication and leadership.\n\nDeveloping employees and preparing them for future challenges are core elements of People Development at KSB. The concept is aimed at encouraging the exchange of thoughts and ideas with employees and continuously discussing prospects within the company. Through this initiative, KSB strives to create motivating development opportunities for its employees and staff positions in the best way possible.\n\nIn order to inform employees about available training, KSB intensified its communication about training opportunities. These include training modules, courses, workshops and time for free self-study and knowledge exchange between staff. An additional e-learning course for managers raises awareness of the training opportunities. In 2023, employees invested an average of 21 hours (KSB SE & Co. KGaA: 21 hours) into professional development activities (previous year: 17 hours; KSB SE & Co. KGaA: 13 hours).\n\nA one-year fellowship programme focusing on the digital transformation provides employees with current information, background knowledge and explanations about the most important topics of digitalisation.\n\nKSB's internal distance learning programme for interested engineers and technicians, which has been in place for more than ten years, offers participants with relevant experience an opportunity to become experts in the field of pump applications. KSB has been offering the internal professional development opportunity since 2021 as an external distance learning course in cooperation with the technical universities in Berlin and Graz.\n\nIn 2023, employees invested an average of 21 hours (KSB SE & Co.

In the reporting year, KSB added additional functions to this system. Employees now log their absences such as holiday and flexitime via this platform, eliminating the need for paper-based forms. Further functions for recruitment and People Development were added in 2023 with the aim of filling vacancies even faster. Managers also use the web-based application to promote training for their team members. In addition, all users can update information on their knowledge and skills in their personal profile. This increases the visibility of knowledge available in the company.\n\nIn order to ensure demand for skilled staff is met in the long term, KSB continuously trains young people.

In the reporting year, KSB's Global Learning Center offered 1,888 different training courses. More than 15,300 users from 71 countries had access to the company's own internet-based learning platform, marking a further increase in the reach of this online training facility. In addition, the company's Market Areas have introduced their own academies to impart specific expertise via virtual training courses.\n\nEqual opportunities and diversity are viewed as key factors for innovation and sustainable economic growth. KSB's binding human resources principles align with the Conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and apply to all Group companies. The company selects candidates for positions exclusively on the basis of necessary professional requirements and the individual performance and potential of the applicant. Clear responsibilities were defined to support this process. Management works to ensure that the principles of equal opportunities and diversity are realised in company practice. Human Resources communicates these principles within\n\nthe Group and adapts them where required. HR also fosters an awareness of this important topic and offers corresponding training and advice.\n\nKSB focuses on equal opportunities when filling management positions. In 2023, the proportion of female managers in the Group was 14 % (KSB SE & Co. KGaA: 11 %), a decrease of 1 percentage point year on year. Women make up 16 % of the total workforce (KSB SE & Co. KGaA: 20 %). At KSB, this key indicator refers to management positions with at least one direct report.\n\nCommitted female employees from different departments and locations maintain a global women's network to promote gender diversity at KSB. Its aims include establishing a framework for strengthening internal networking among women within the company and creating a space for their professional interaction and further development. The establishment of two regional communities in North America and the Middle East / Africa began in the reporting year. As at 31 December 2023, the network had 228 employees from 24 countries worldwide.\n\nSpecial training and development programmes provide female employees with greater clarity about their career opportunities\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, 228 employees from 24 countries worldwide had joined KSB's women's network.\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\nand prepare them for their future career path. In addition, KSB is increasingly seeking to appoint women to management positions if applicants are equally qualified. Human Resources and Management make concerted efforts to approach potential female candidates, make them aware of their prospects and encourage them to take advantage of opportunities.\n\nIn order to achieve a more balanced mix of men and women in management, KSB implemented several measures in the reporting year. Once again, these included local and global events for promising candidates attended by members of Management. This supports KSB's efforts to ensure that talented women and men are seen and heard within the company.\n\nKSB provides its employees with mobile working options, including working from home. This can help facilitate a balance between family and work commitments. Under the Group works agreement on mobile working, up to 40 % of individual working hours can be spent away from company premises. In addition, many employees have access to flexible working time models, allowing them to care for their family members for example.\n\nEmployees who enjoy their work achieve more. KSB therefore attaches great importance to ensuring committed and satisfied employees who are passionate about making a contribution to the company's success. As an attractive employer, KSB strives to create a motivating working environment in which employees can perform to the best of their ability. KSB regularly analyses employee satisfaction. The company had previously conducted a Group-wide employee survey every three years. In the reporting year, Management decided to reduce the time until the next survey to two years. The engagement index, which measures an employee's emotional attachment to work and the workplace, will therefore be analysed again in 2024. In 2022, the figure was 65 % (2019: 57 %).\n\nThe global employee engagement survey in 2022 provided valuable information on potential for improvement to further improve satisfaction. Following the results, the CEO and the Chief Engagement Officer discussed the local insights with more than 70 Managing Directors of Group companies and Regional Executive Officers around the world in the reporting year. Based on the findings, numerous measures were agreed at country and departmental level to increase engagement.

Once again, these included local and global events for promising candidates attended by members of Management. This supports KSB's efforts to ensure that talented women and\n\nKSB provides its employees with mobile working options, including working from home. This can help facilitate a balance between family and work commitments. Under the Group works agreement on mobile working, up to 40 % of individual working hours can be spent away from company premises. In addition, many employees have access to flexible working time models, allowing them to care for their family members for\n\nEmployees who enjoy their work achieve more. KSB therefore attaches great importance to ensuring committed and satisfied employees who are passionate about making a contribution to the company's success. As an attractive employer, KSB strives to create a motivating working environment in which employees can perform to the best of their ability. KSB regularly analyses employee satisfaction. The company had previously conducted a Group-wide employee survey every three years. In the reporting year, Management decided to reduce the time until the next survey to two years. The engagement index, which measures an employee's emotional attachment to work and the workplace, will therefore be analysed again in 2024. In 2022, the figure\n\nThe global employee engagement survey in 2022 provided valuable information on potential for improvement to further improve satisfaction. Following the results, the CEO and the Chief Engagement Officer discussed the local insights with more than 70 Managing Directors of Group companies and Regional Executive Officers around the world in the reporting year. Based on the findings, numerous measures were agreed at country and departmental level to increase engagement. In 2023, a total of 50 short surveys, known as KSB Pulse surveys,\n\nencourage them to take advantage of opportunities.\n\nmen are seen and heard within the company.\n\nexample.\n\nwas 65 % (2019: 57 %).\n\nKSB Group / Annual Report 2023\n\nthe future. All measures and rules adopted during the pandemic were discontinued.\n\nThe focus of accident prevention in everyday work at KSB is in the production areas due to their increased risk. Appropriate training, instruction and other preventive measures are implemented regularly. In the reporting year, 39 production and assembly sites (including all factories of KSB SE & Co. KGaA) were certified to the ISO 45001 international occupational health and safety standard. This represents 93 % of the company's locations.\n\nTo reduce the number of occupational accidents, KSB introduced the global Vision Zero concept from the International Social Security Association (ISSA) in its production departments. This aims to increase involvement of management staff so as to raise awareness of improved occupational health and safety. Managers learn about suitable measures that they can apply individually to their production facilities.\n\nIn 2023, more than 70 production managers at KSB focused intensively on occupational health and safety at the global manufacturing conference in Brazil. At the event, the participants defined their most important topics in this area according to the rules set out in the Vision Zero concept. The focus was on aspects with the highest potential for improvement at the respective locations. After the conference, the production managers were tasked with deriving measures and implementing them in their area of responsibility. Integrated Management will support the global locations in this process and verify the results in the current reporting year. The aim is to establish a sustainable safety culture within the company.\n\nKSB maintains an active occupational health management system with a holistic approach. As well as fulfilling the company's legal occupational health and safety obligations, this framework enables KSB to provide voluntary health-focused services. These include ongoing health initiatives such as vaccinations, support for giving up smoking, preventive health care courses and confidential psychosocial counselling from the company's Health Management department. The implementation of the company's return-to-work programme makes a significant contribution to promoting health in the workplace and restoring employees' ability to work. Addiction prevention services are provided by KSB's Health Management and local addiction support teams.\n\nThe mental health of employees is becoming a key focus of many companies. A positive state of well-being is essential for actively participating in private and professional life and for dealing appropriately with challenging situations. In 2023, KSB expanded an initiative to strengthen the mental health of its workforce. The campaign supported employees and managers in maintaining their health and well-being. The measures aimed to raise awareness and acceptance of mental stresses and jointly develop solutions. Multiple workshops, information events and participative activities were held at various locations.\n\nEmployees who spend most of their working time sitting benefit from an Internet-based health programme that includes exercises to prevent back problems. In the reporting year, KSB added mindfulness exercises to the programme that provide tips on how to confidently deal with stressful phases in daily working life in a relaxed manner.\n\nIn 2023, the focus of KSB's prevention services was on skin health. Employees were invited to participate in preventive examinations, informative presentations and activities.\n\nThe focus of prevention services for employees was on skin health.\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nCycling keeps you fit, saves energy and reduces your personal carbon footprint.

Interest among staff was huge: by the end of 2023, 577 employees had taken up the offer. KSB also supported participation in the annual city cycling event. Over 240 employees from various locations took part in the Germany-wide competition.\n\nJoint sports activities not only strengthen team spirit among employees, but also their health. KSB therefore encourages company sports, participation in sports events and organises sports events at its locations.\n\n#### **Results:**\n\n- The company medical service in Germany organised a total of 897 vaccinations in the reporting year. The majority of these were vaccinations against influenza (555) and shingles (126). 53 employees were also vaccinated against COVID-19.\n- The company's Health Management department in Germany provided counselling sessions in 2023, primarily in connection with mental stress and dealing with crises.\n- The number of accident-related days lost per employee and year in 2023 was slightly higher than in the previous year at 0.36 (lost time accident rate).\n- As part of the reporting year's initiative focusing on skin health in Germany, 433 employees took up the offer of skin cancer screening.\n\n#### **Society**\n\n#### **Objectives:**\n\nKSB seeks to make an active contribution to society through its commitment to social initiatives. This includes financial contributions to organisations engaged in social projects. With its charitable commitments, KSB seeks to contribute to the development of the common good. By 2025, the company intends to support at least 25 social projects every year. KSB defines a project as an undertaking fulfilling at least three of the following five criteria:\n\n- Humanitarian aid benefiting third parties\n- Support for education (child, youth and adult education)\n- Project-related support of more than € 5,000\n- Personal engagement of KSB employees\n- Long-term or permanent aid (e.g. in the field of ecology)\n\nSocial activities that meet fewer than three of the above criteria are classified by the company as social initiatives.\n\n#### **Organisation, processes and measures:**\n\nKSB's binding Donation Directive sets out for which purposes and under which conditions the company may make financial or material commitments. In this context, the focus is on supporting organisations, projects and measures dedicated to the education, social support and protection of children and young people. The company is also committed to helping the disadvantaged. In the event of disasters it provides assistance to both people and organisations. In the reporting year, KSB expanded the potential group of recipients to include organisations and projects that promote local sports and are committed to sustainability and environmental protection.\n\nThe education of young people is one of the most important issues for the future.

Responsibility for the data collection and reporting process lies with the Finance department.\n\nThe following findings regarding KSB's economic activities were made as part of the impact analysis in connection with the performance indicators relevant to the EU taxonomy:\n\nKSB's core sales activities almost exclusively comprise the manufacture of pumps and valves, and provision of related spare parts and support services. The EU taxonomy currently in force in particular covers economic activities that have a material impact on the environment. As this is largely not the case with mechanical engineering, KSB cannot allocate its sales activities to such economic activities. In particular, it was assessed whether the new economic activities of environmental objective (4) Transition to a circular economy from Section 5. Services could be relevant for KSB. However, the NACE codes listed in the activity descriptions to narrow down the products considered for this activity do not fall within the scope of the Group's activities. The economic activities added to the other environmental objectives were also assessed and do not correspond to the Group-wide sales revenue-generating economic activities.\n\nFurthermore, KSB does not engage in any of the economic activities described in the European Commission Delegated Regulation 2022/1214 in connection with the production of energy from fossil gas or nuclear energy. KSB therefore has not used the specific reporting forms for these activities in accordance with Annex XII of the European Commission Delegated Regulation 2021/2178.\n\nAccordingly, as in previous years, KSB will not report any taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned sales revenue in the 2023 financial year.\n\nCapital expenditure and operating expenditure relating to assets or processes associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities (Category A) therefore also cannot be reported. Furthermore, there is no CapEx plan to expand a taxonomy-aligned activity or upgrade a taxonomy-eligible activity to become a taxonomy-aligned activity. Thus, no category B capital expenditure or operating expenses are reported.\n\nWith regard to capital expenditure and operating expenditure in category C, from the purchase of taxonomy-aligned products and individual measures, the following taxonomy-eligible economic activities were identified in the impact analysis for the KSB Group:\n\n#### **Taxonomy-eligible economic activities:**\n\n| Economic activities according to the EU taxonomy                                                                                                   | Examples of activities at KSB                                          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Manufacturing / Production of goods                                                                                                                |                                                                        |\n| CCM 3.9 Manufacturing of iron and steel                                                                                                            | Operation of foundries                                                 |\n| Transport                                                                                                                                          |                                                                        |\n| CCM 6.5 Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles                                                                      | Purchasing and leasing of passenger cars                               |\n| Construction and real estate                                                                                                                       |                                                                        |\n| CCM 7.2 / CE 3.2 Renovation of existing buildings                                                                                                  | Renovation of administrative buildings                                 |\n| CCM 7.3 Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment                                                                        | Replacement of existing windows with new energy-efficient windows      |\n| CCM 7.4 Installation, maintenance and repair of charging stations for electric<br>vehicles in buildings (and parking spaces attached to buildings) | Purchasing and installation of charging stations for electric vehicles |\n| CCM 7.6 Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies                                                                      | Purchasing and installation of solar power systems                     |\n| CCM 7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings                                                                                                     | Purchasing and leasing of non-residential buildings                    |\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe identified taxonomy-eligible economic activities were primarily allocated to environmental objective (1) Climate change mitigation, as KSB has a greater influence on the contribution to this environmental objective.\n\nDespite the corresponding activity description, the activities of environmental objective (2) Climate change adaptation were not reported as taxonomy-eligible because they are not enabling activities or there is no separable, specific capital expenditure or operating expenditure for climate change adaptation.\n\n#### **Assessment of Taxonomy Eligibility and Alignment**\n\nThe basis for determining taxonomy-eligible and taxonomyaligned economic activities are the actually identified capital expenditure and operating expenditure calculated for the fully consolidated companies in the Group, which were assessed and audited in terms of a cost-benefit ratio. The relevant performance indicators were determined using a questionnaire prepared by KSB in which the potential taxonomy-eligible economic activities identified in the impact analysis were assessed. When validating the questionnaires, particular care was taken to ensure that the figures reported by the companies were not counted twice.\n\nThe analysis of capital expenditure showed that economic activities amounting to € 62.8 million (46.3 % of total investments) (previous year: € 38.5 million, 31.7 % of total investments) correspond to the activity descriptions of the Delegated Acts and therefore constitute taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure.\n\n#### **Breakdown of capital expenditure by environmental objectives**\n\n|                                        | Proportion of CapEx / Total CapEx |                                |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                        | Taxonomy-aligned per objective    | Taxonomy-aligned per objective |\n| Climate change mitigation (CCM)        | -                                 | 46.3 %                         |\n| Climate change adaptation (CCA)        | -                                 | -                              |\n| Water (WTR)                            | -                                 | -                              |\n| Circular economy (CE)                  | -                                 | 13.8 %                         |\n| Pollution prevention and control (PPC) | -                                 | -                              |\n| Biodiversity (BIO)                     | -                                 | -                              |\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe identified taxonomy-eligible economic activities were primarily allocated to environmental objective (1) Climate change mitigation, as KSB has a greater influence on the contribution\n\n**46 Management and Issues 2023** Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements General Information\n\naudited in terms of a cost-benefit ratio.

As the identified taxonomy-eligible economic activities relate to the acquisition of products from taxonomy-aligned economic activities (Category C), the assessment of alignment (except for economic activities CCM 7.4 and CCM 7.6) is dependent on the provision of relevant proof by external third parties and cannot be carried out independently by KSB. Suppliers were therefore contacted to verify compliance with the technical screening criteria. It was also checked whether the other environmental objectives were caused any significant harm by the specified economic activity. The documents required by the Delegated Acts could not be provided by the external third parties to a sufficient extent.\n\nFor the economic activities CCM 7.4 Installation, maintenance and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings and CCM 7.6 Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technologies, KSB meets the substantial contribution criteria. However, the suppliers were unable to provide proof of compliance with EU taxonomy alignment.\n\nAs a result, KSB cannot report any taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure and operating expenditure in the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation defines **minimum safeguard requirements** for companies, in particular with regard to the issues of human rights, corruption, bribery, taxation and antitrust law. KSB's actions are in line with the requirements. Among other things, this is reflected by KSB's compliance with the following internationally recognised standards:\n\n- The Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n- The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP)\n- The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n- The eight fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO)\n- The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\nKSB stands up for human rights, equal treatment and decent working conditions worldwide and documents this in policy statements, guidelines and commitments. For further details, please refer to the Human Rights / Sustainability in the Supply Chain section in this part of the report.\n\nIn addition, all information on perceived compliance violations is taken seriously and followed up in accordance with the stipulations of KSB's Code of Conduct. Compliance with applicable cartel / anti-trust law is also part of the core KSB values set out in the KSB Code of Conduct. Further information is provided in the Compliance section of this part of the report.\n\nAs an globally operating Group, KSB also observes all relevant tax law provisions. KSB sets transfer prices using globally recognised principles and compares them with the terms and conditions of external third parties. Employees on international assignments are obliged to comply with the tax laws that apply to them personally in line with the company's Expatriate Assignment Directive.\n\nIn the reporting year, KSB experienced no proven violations or convictions relating to human rights, compliance (corruption and bribery), cartel / anti-trust law or tax law.\n\nThe results demonstrate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the processes and systems established throughout the Group for identifying and mitigating potential risks or breaches of the minimum safeguards.\n\n#### **Calculation of Performance Indicators**\n\nThe **sales revenue** performance indicator was calculated as the proportion of sales revenue derived from products and services generated by taxonomy-eligible and -aligned economic activities (numerator) divided by the sales revenue \n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nto them personally in line with the company's Expatriate\n\nIn the reporting year, KSB experienced no proven violations or convictions relating to human rights, compliance (corrup-\n\nThe results demonstrate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the processes and systems established throughout the Group for identifying and mitigating potential risks or\n\n**Calculation of Performance Indicators** \n\nThe **sales revenue** performance indicator was calculated as the proportion of sales revenue derived from products and services generated by taxonomy-eligible and -aligned economic activities (numerator) divided by the sales revenue\n\ntion and bribery), cartel / anti-trust law or tax law.\n\nbreaches of the minimum safeguards.\n\nAssignment Directive.\n\nKSB stands up for human rights, equal treatment and decent working conditions worldwide and documents this in policy statements, guidelines and commitments.

The denominator of the sales revenue performance indicator is provided in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the Consolidated Financial Statements section. As described above, no taxonomy-eligible and -aligned economic activities can be reported in relation to sales revenue.\n\nThe **capital expenditure (CapEx)** performance indicator is defined as capital expenditure in taxonomy-aligned and -eligible economic activities (numerator) divided by total capital expenditure made in the financial year (denominator). Total capital expenditure includes additions to property, plant and equipment (IAS 16), intangible assets (IAS 38) and right-of-use assets (IFRS 16). A breakdown of the composition of capital expenditure by asset class is presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements, Section IV. Balance Sheet Disclosures, Subsections \"1. Intangible assets\", \"2. Right-of-use assets\" and \"3. Property, plant and equipment\".\n\nThe **operating expenses (OpEx)** performance indicator is defined as operating expenses in taxonomy-aligned and -eligible economic activities (numerator) divided by total operating expenses (denominator). The denominator of operating expenses comprises direct, non-capitalised costs related to research and development, maintenance and short-term lease expenses.

Initially, additive manufacturing technology was used to produce commonly available components using the laser fusion process. Today, design engineers are employing this method to create completely new technical solutions. Containment shrouds produced using additive manufacturing are a particularly impressive example. By using this production method, disadvantages such as heating and eddy current losses in these complex components can be avoided, while significantly increasing the level of safety. The lower temperature rise and eddy current losses allow the pumps to be operated while consuming considerably less energy. turing technology was used to produce commonly available components using the laser fusion process.

Together with the Testing Engineering department in Frankenthal, the specialist departments that look after the global test facilities on site were involved in the planning, design, engineering, implementation, commissioning and documentaengineering, implementation, commissioning and documentation of new test facilities. This also included preparing design and engineering requirements, as well as harmonising the data As part of the Standardising Test Facilities Worldwide project, KSB worked on improving the testing processes for pumps, valves and individual components in the reporting year.\n\n**4** \n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n**5** \n\nwill make it easier for KSB and its customers to compare the measurement results of the different test facilities.\n\nLaunched a few years ago, KSB Guard is a smart monitoring service for pumps and other rotating machinery. It comprises a sensor component that is attached to a pump or other rotating machinery, a transmission unit and an app that allows users to remotely review a pump's condition and operating data. KSB Guard records and analyses important data. It prevents potential damage from happening before it can lead to costly disruptions.\n\nPreviously, only measurements with a manually selectable time interval were carried out by KSB Guard. In the reporting year, the KSB specialists worked on advanced functions, such as repeat measurement. If an unusual value is detected in the pump's performance during a measurement, the system triggers further measurements. This generates a better database for diagnosing the related machine behaviour.\n\nEven though KSB Guard is primarily aimed at monitoring pumps, steps must also be taken to ensure that the sensor unit itself works reliably. Advanced functions are therefore used to monitor transmission reliability and battery battery charge condition.\n\nOverall, the Group spent € 60.6 million on research and acquisition process and associated test stand software. This sales revenue. KSB SE & Co. KGaA invested € 42.6 million in research and development in the reporting year, which equates development in the reporting year. This equates to 2.1 % of\nto around 4.8 % of sales revenue. Across the Group, 445 staff were employed in research and development on average over the year. At KSB SE & Co. KGaA, 285 staff worked in research and development in the reporting year.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-66-0\"></span>**Economic Review**\n\n## **Macroeconomic Environment and Sector View**\n\nThe forecast for global economic growth in 2023 was below the growth rate of the previous year from the outset and therefore also below the growth path before the COVID-19 pandemic. In the course of the year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), whose figures are used for planning, increased its estimate only slightly to 3.1 %. This compares with the forecast of 2.9 % for global economic growth at the start of the year. Factors for lower growth included the longterm consequences of the pandemic, the effects of the war in Ukraine and the growing geopolitical fragmentation. In addition and especially in the past year, the restrictive monetary policy that is aimed at reducing inflation was a drag on growth. Inflation worldwide eased to 6.8 % but was still above the expectation of 6.6 % at the start of the year.\n\nThe IMF raised its growth estimate slightly for the group of economically advanced countries to 1.6 % in 2023. At the beginning of the year the forecast was still at 1.2 %. Economic growth in the emerging markets and developing countries was 4.1 %, which slightly exceeded the forecast at the start of the year (+ 4.0 %).\n\nEurope continued to be of major importance for the KSB business in 2023. In what is KSB's largest market, the global energy crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine and the associated price increases had the greatest impact and curbed economic growth, which was 0.5 % in the euro zone. Economic output in France and Italy grew by 0.8 % and 0.7 % respectively. Spain achieved a higher growth rate of 2.4 % compared with other European countries, reflecting its lower dependence on imports of natural gas from Russia. In contrast, the economy in Germany contracted by - 0.3 %. The high share of exports coupled with weaker growth in demand globally, falling production in energy-intensive industries and the weakening of capital-intensive and interest rate-sensitive sectors contributed to this development. The UK reported lower growth of 0.5 % in view of higher key interest rates and high energy costs.\n\nEconomic growth of 2.5 % in the USA was significantly higher than the expectations of 1.4 % at the start of the year. This was supported by higher capital expenditure and robust growth in consumer spending.\n\n**5** \n\n**World market of centrifugal pumps and valves**\n\nImage /page/66/Figure/8 description: The image is a pie chart showing the distribution of something across different regions. Asia/Pacific accounts for 41%, Americas accounts for 25%, Middle East/Africa/Russia accounts for 15%, and Europe accounts for 19%.\n\nSource: KSB estimate (February 2024)\n\nChina's economy recovered only moderately after the pandemic and grew by 5.2 %. Nevertheless, growth, which was slowed by the property market crisis, a high level of youth unemployment and weaker exports in some sectors, met expectations at the beginning of the year.\n\nSupported by higher consumer spending, growth in India of 6.7 % was higher than expected at the start of the year. The economies of the five economically most important countries in South East Asia – Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam – grew by 4.2 % overall, which was only marginally lower than start-of-the-year expectations.\n\nGrowth expectations at the beginning of the year for South America could not be met on average. Chile's economy declined by - 0.5 %, with a significant decrease reported in private consumer spending and investment. Thanks to the good harvest and recovery in the services sector, economic output of 3.1 % in Brazil exceeded expectations at the start of the year.\n\nEconomic developments in the countries in the Region Middle East / Africa / Russia remained below expectations at the beginning of the year. In Turkey, the economy grew more than expected by 4.0 %, bolstered by robust private consumer spending. Power cuts and weaker exports led to a decline in growth to 0.6 % in South Africa. For Saudi Arabia, likewise a large sales market for KSB, the IMF reported a decline of – 1.1 % as a result of falling crude oil prices and production. This was significantly lower than expected at the start of the year.\n\nEven though KSB Guard is primarily aimed at monitoring pumps, steps must also be taken to ensure that the sensor unit itself works reliably.

The chemical industry also record\n\n#### **MODEST GROWTH IN ALL SALES MARKETS**\n\nAll markets and regions in which KSB operates reported modest year-on-year growth.\n\nIn general industry, which covers a series of cyclical sectors in the manufacturing industry, production and investment rose in the past year. The production of capital goods was curbed by inflation and higher interest rates, but increased nonetheless. The pharmaceutical industry, which was one of the winners of the pandemic, were unable to reach the high growth rates of previous years. Given the weaker previous year and existing orders on hand, the automotive industry performed above expectations at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe water and waste water industry, in which economic fluctuations are more moderate than in other economic sectors, posted modest growth in terms of production value. This was dampened by the weaker development in industry as well as the rise in costs in this sector. Investment in municipal water and waste water management was driven by digitalisation and the use of artificial intelligence, as well as by requirements to expand the use of waste water.\n\nThe war in Ukraine and its impact on energy prices affected the energy industry again last year. Global production increased only slightly, given lower economic growth and lower demand especially from Europe and the USA. Electrification in the transport sector and for building heat experienced a strong boost. Investments in expanding storage technologies also increased. The increase in new capacities for generating renewable energies accelerated strongly. Coal-fired electricity generation increased, including as a substitute to hydropower and led by Asia, in particular China and India. Electricity generation from natural gas increased only slightly. In contrast, electricity generation from nuclear energy rose again following the decline in the previous year. Investment in nuclear energy continued to rise worldwide. New nuclear power plants were commissioned in China and the USA, among other countries, and construction work started on others in the past year.\n\nGlobal oil production rose somewhat more strongly than expected at the beginning of the year, supported by stronger demand from China. Gas production worldwide was down slightly from the previous year's level, as the structural changes since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine continued. Production in Russia continued to fall. This was offset by the USA, the Middle East and Asia. Liquefied gas exports from the USA increased once again. Worldwide refinery capacity utilisation increased marginally, albeit with major regional differences. While production rose in Asia and in particular China and in the Middle East, it stagnated in North America and declined in Europe. The chemical industry also recorded weak growth worldwide in response to weaker demand from key sectors. China proved to be a material regional driver, while the chemical industry in Europe declined once again due to high energy and raw material costs.\n\nDespite lower expectations at the start of the year, the construction industry was able to grow at a higher rate year on year. This development was supported by stimulus spending on expanding infrastructure in many countries. Despite lower real income and higher interest rates, residential building construction increased. However, momentum was lower than in other sectors. Growth was also reported in nonresidential construction. Clear regional differences were evident in the development of the two sectors.\n\nMining continued to be supported by strong demand for metals that are required for producing green technologies. There was a significant increase in the demand for metals required for electromobility, renewable energy generation and grid expansion, and for the production of storage technologies. These include copper, aluminium, nickel and lithium. The strong growth in demand was partially reflected in a sharp increase in the extraction of these metals. The demand and global trade in iron continued to grow, too, supported by high demand from China. Coal mining also expanded, driven by Asia, particularly with a strong increase in production in India. The extraction of oil sands was marginally higher than in the previous year. The growth momentum of investment in mining slackened on the back of higher interest rates and inflation.\n\n#### **MECHANICAL ENGINEERING STAGNATED**\n\nThe slowdown in investment led to below-average demand for mechanical engineering products. According to the German Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA), global sales revenue in the mechanical engineering sector stagnated in real terms in 2023, albeit with significant regional differences. While Asian countries achieved considerable growth, sales revenue in Europe and North America declined.\n\nAccording to VDMA, sales revenue in the German mechanical engineering sector fell by – 0.1 % in real terms. Based on the provisional calculations of the German Federal Statistical Office, production up to November rose very slightly by 0.1 % in real terms. Capacity utilisation was down on the previous year.\n\nIn the liquid pumps sector, VDMA recorded real sales revenue growth of 0.3 % among German pump manufacturers. Sales revenue with industrial valves was down – 5.8 % on the previous year, while building services valves saw sales revenue fall by – 13.9 %.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\nworldwide in response to weaker demand from key sectors.

Worldwide refinery capacity utilisation increased marginally, albeit with major regional differences. While production rose in Asia and in particular China and in the Middle East, it stagnated in North America and declined in Europe. The chemical industry also recorded weak growth\n\n## <span id=\"page-68-0\"></span>**Business Development and Results of Operations**\n\nThe 2023 financial year was defined by global political tensions due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, the China-Taiwan conflict and the outbreak of war in the Gaza region as a result of the attack on Israel. High interest rates led to uncertainty and a decrease in investment. In Germany, the manufacturing industry continued to be challenged by higher gas prices. At the same time, the situation on the procurement markets eased somewhat with regard to price and availability of bought-in parts.\n\nThanks to the company's broad global positioning across several market areas, economic downturns were offset by positive developments. The KSB SupremeServ Segment made a significant contribution to order intake growth.\n\nOverall, there was a substantial increase in sales revenue and EBIT compared with the previous year. Despite signs of a slowdown in demand in the Standard Markets in the second half of the year, mainly in Europe, total order intake was considerably higher than in the previous year. The reasons for the changes are explained in the sections on order intake, sales revenue and EBIT.\n\n#### **ORDER INTAKE**\n\nThe volume of incoming orders rose significantly by € 97.4 million (+ 3.4 %) to € 2,959.5 million in the financial year. The order intake would have been € 83.4 million higher excluding exchange rate effects (excluding the hyperinflationary economies of Argentina and Turkey). This increase is mainly attributable to the positive development of order intake in the KSB SupremeServ Segment.\n\nThe largest percentage growth was reported in the Region Americas with a plus of € 62.0 million (+ 12.0 %) and the Region Asia / Pacific with a plus of € 38.2 million (+ 5.1 %). Order intake in the Region Europe remained at the previous year's level with plus € 8.0 million (+ 0.6 %). On the other hand, the companies in the Region Middle East / Africa / Russia reported a decline of € 10.9 million (– 6.5 %). The marked reduction was largely due to unfavourable exchange rate effects.\n\n#### **Pumps**\n\nOrder intake in the Pumps Segment amounted to € 1,576.5 million compared with € 1,585.7 million in the previous year. The order intake in this Segment is therefore marginally lower than in the prior-year period, which had been impacted positively by several major orders. The Standard Markets accounted for € 1,263.9 million (previous year: € 1,256.3 million) of the total order intake in the Pumps Segment. Order intake in the Water Market Area declined due to a major order in the previous year that was not matched by comparable order intake in the reporting year. Despite the economic slowdown, which led to a weaker second half of the year, increases were achieved in all other Standard Markets. Significant growth was recorded in General Industry in particular, due to the positive development in the Region Asia / Pacific as a result of the relocation of production by many companies from China to India, among other things. In the Energy and Mining operating segments, which include project business in particular, order intake amounted to € 312.6 million (previous year: € 329.5 million). The Mining operating segment recorded substantial growth, thanks to several major orders and positive development of order intake in Brazil. In contrast, order intake in the Energy operating segment declined sharply, because the prior-year figure included two important major orders.\n\n#### **Segment reporting**\n\n**7** \n\n| € thousands             | Order intake |           | Sales revenue |           | EBIT    |         |\n|-------------------------|--------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|---------|---------|\n|                         | 2023         | 2022      | 2023          | 2022      | 2023    | 2022    |\n| Pumps Segment           | 1,576,483    | 1,585,727 | 1,513,653     | 1,390,192 | 52,301  | 27,718  |\n| Valves Segment          | 392,573      | 359,676   | 361,435       | 333,072   | -7,522  | -4,635  |\n| KSB SupremeServ Segment | 990,418      | 916,684   | 943,900       | 850,123   | 179,123 | 146,020 |\n| Total                   | 2,959,474    | 2,862,087 | 2,818,988     | 2,573,387 | 223,902 | 169,103 |\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management Report\n\nImage /page/69/Figure/4 description: This image is a donut chart titled \"Sales revenue by segment\". The chart shows the sales revenue for three segments: KSB SupremeServ, Valves, and Pumps. KSB SupremeServ accounts for 33.5% of the sales revenue, Valves accounts for 12.8% of the sales revenue, and Pumps accounts for 53.7% of the sales revenue.\n\nThe Region Europe contributed the largest share of order intake of the Pumps Segment with € 732.7 million (previous year: € 775.6 million), followed by the Region Asia / Pacific with € 489.7 million (previous year: € 490.4 million) and the Regions Americas and Middle East / Africa / Russia each with lower contributions in absolute terms. The highest growth rate was reported in the Region Americas, while the Region Europe posted a marked decline. This is partly due to the aforementioned major order in the Water Market Area in the previous year.\n\n#### **Valves**\n\nOrder intake in the Valves Segment amounted to € 392.6 million compared with € 359.7 million in the previous year. The growth is driven by the very positive development of the project business, while the Standard Markets remained stable. The largest positive contribution was recorded in the energy industry, where major investments were made in the power plant market. Investment activity was also stepped up in the marine market. The largest Region by far is Europe with € 229.5 million (previous year: € 222.7 million), followed by Asia / Pacific with € 123.3 million (previous year: € 105.2 million) and the Regions Americas and Middle East / Africa / Russia each with lower contributions in absolute terms.\n\n#### **KSB SupremeServ**\n\nOrder intake in the KSB SupremeServ Segment – which covers all service and spare parts activities – reached € 990.4 million and is thus considerably higher than in the previous year (€ 916.7 million). This increase is due to the positive development of the spare parts business. Higher order levels in the nuclear sector, in particular, as well as extensive service assignments as part of maintenance inspections of larger plants in the chemicals / petrochemicals industry contributed to the increase.\n\nIn the KSB SupremeServ Segment, too, the Region Europe made the greatest contribution to order intake with € 470.4 million (previous year: € 426.4 million), followed by Americas with € 292.3 million (previous year: € 276.4 million) and Asia / Pacific and Middle East / Africa / Russia. The highest growth rate was reported in the Region Asia / Pacific.\n\n#### **SALES REVENUE**\n\nThe Group's consolidated sales revenue, which lags behind order intake, grew strongly by € 245.6 million (+ 9.5 %) to € 2,819.0 million). Sales revenue would have been € 77.3 million higher excluding exchange rate effects (excluding the hyperinflationary economies of Argentina and Turkey).\n\nAll the Regions contributed to this sales revenue growth. Europe remained by far the largest Region with sales revenue of € 1,427.8 million (previous year: € 1,271.7 million, followed by Asia / Pacific with € 708.1 million (previous year: € 646.4 million), Americas with € 523.7 million (previous year: € 498.1 million) and the Region Middle East / Africa / Russia with € 159.3 million (previous year: € 157.2 million). The largest percentage increase was reported in the Region Europe with € 156.1 million (+ 12.3 %), followed by the Region Asia / Pacific with € 61.7 million (+ 9.5 %). The Region Americas also developed well with a plus of € 25.6 million (+ 5.1 %). The companies in the Region Middle East / Africa / Russia remained stable with an increase of € 2.1 million (+ 1.4 %).\n\n#### **Pumps**\n\nSales revenue in the Pumps Segment amounted to € 1,513.7 million (previous year: € 1,390.2 million). The Standard Markets accounted for € 1,232.0 million and the Energy and Mining operating segments together for € 281.6 million. The sharp increase in sales revenue in the Pumps Segment is attributable in particular to the positive development in the Water and General Industry Market Areas. In the Water Market Area, the major order received in the previous year was completed. Order intake increased in the General Industry Market Area, especially in the Region Europe, due to sales revenue recognition of orders from the previous year. Europe remains by far the largest Region with sales revenue of € 755.9 million (previous year: € 670.1 million), followed by Asia / Pacific with € 434.4 million (previous year: € 407.4 million), then the Region Americas and the Region Middle East / Africa / Russia.\n\nImage /page/69/Picture/17 description: The image shows the number 2.8 in a blue sans-serif font.

This increase is due to the very positive development of the project business, while development in the Standard Markets remained stable. The damage caused by the hail storm at the La Roche-Chalais site in France in 2022 led to delays in production during the reporting year. These delays were reduced significantly by the end of the year by introducing a more effective production layout. Europe remains by far the largest Region with sales revenue of € 213.8 million (previous year: € 199.7 million), followed by Asia / Pacific with € 116.3 million (previous year: € 102.2 million), then the Region Americas and the Region Middle East / Africa / Russia. Strong double-digit growth rates were achieved in the Regions Asia / Pacific and Middle East / Africa / Russia.\n\n#### **KSB SupremeServ**\n\n**9** \n\nThe Region Europe contributed the largest share of order intake of the Pumps Segment with € 732.7 million (previous year: € 775.6 million), followed by the Region Asia / Pacific with € 489.7 million (previous year: € 490.4 million) and the Regions Americas and Middle East / Africa / Russia each with lower contributions in absolute terms.

This strong increase was a result of the positive development of the spare parts business in the Energy and Mining operating segments. Spare parts orders from previous years were invoiced in the Energy operating segment and the Mining operating segment benefited from the strong capacity utilisation of the mines as well as new long-term service contracts. The largest Region by far is Europe with sales revenue of € 458.1 million (previous year: € 401.9 million), followed by Americas with € 280.8 million (previous year: € 257.9 million), then Asia / Pacific and Middle East / Africa / Russia. The Region Asia / Pacific achieved the strongest growth rate.\n\n#### **EARNINGS BEFORE FINANCE INCOME / EXPENSE AND INCOME TAX (EBIT)**\n\nThe KSB Group achieved earnings before finance income / expense and income tax (EBIT) of € 223.9 million (previous year: € 169.1 million). The earnings improvement is primarily attributable to growth and margin strength in the KSB SupremeServ Segment.\n\n#### **Pumps**\n\nEBIT in the Pumps Segment amounted to € 52.3 million (previous year: € 27.7 million), with the Standard Markets in particular contributing to the very good performance. The main drivers were higher sales revenue and a better profit quality. The EBIT margin achieved was 3.5 % (previous year: 2.0 %).\n\n#### **Valves**\n\nEBIT in the Valves Segment was € – 7.5 million (previous year: € – 4.6 million) and it therefore € 2.9 million lower than in the previous year. The development is largely attributable to project provisions and the after-effects of the damage caused by hail at the French site in La Roche-Chalais in the 2022 financial year. These negative effects could only be partially offset by the higher volume of sales revenue and insurance compensation paid out in 2023 for the hail damage in La Roche-Chalais. The EBIT margin achieved was – 2.1 % (previous year: – 1.4 %).\n\n#### **KSB SupremeServ**\n\nThanks to the profitable growth in the spare parts business, especially in the energy and chemicals industry, EBIT was increased by € 33.1 million to € 179.1 million (previous year: € 146.0 million). This equates to an EBIT margin of 19.0 % (previous year: 17.2 %).\n\n223.9 Consolidated earnings (EBIT) in € millions\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **INCOME STATEMENT**\n\n| € thousands                                                                | 2023       | 2022       | Percentage<br>change |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|----------------------|\n| Sales revenue                                                              | 2,818,988  | 2,573,387  | 9.5                  |\n| Changes in inventories                                                     | 24,271     | 99,412     | −75.6                |\n| Work performed and capitalised                                             | 1,959      | 1,716      | 14.2                 |\n| Total output of operations                                                 | 2,845,217  | 2,674,515  | 6.4                  |\n| Other income                                                               | 44,384     | 34,462     | 28.8                 |\n| Cost of materials                                                          | −1,153,651 | −1,156,292 | −0.2                 |\n| Staff costs                                                                | −960,699   | −901,551   | 6.6                  |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                                              | −88,094    | −90,419    | −2.6                 |\n| Other expenses                                                             | −463,257   | −391,612   | 18.3                 |\n| Earnings before finance income / expense and income tax (EBIT)             | 223,902    | 169,103    | 32.4                 |\n| Finance income                                                             | 9,382      | 7,461      | 25.7                 |\n| Finance expense                                                            | −29,656    | −17,712    | 67.4                 |\n| Income from / expense to investments accounted for using the equity method | 5,361      | 1,816      | 195.2                |\n| Finance income / expense                                                   | −14,913    | −8,435     | 76.8                 |\n| Earnings before income tax (EBT)                                           | 208,989    | 160,668    | 30.1                 |\n| Taxes on income                                                            | −32,376    | −33,330    | −2.9                 |\n| Earnings after income tax                                                  | 176,613    | 127,338    | 38.7                 |\n| Attributable to:                                                           |            |            |                      |\n| Non-controlling interests                                                  | 24,318     | 23,689     | 2.7                  |\n| Shareholders of KSB SE & Co.

While sales revenue increased by € 245.6 million, the change in inventories of € 24.3 million (previous year: € 99.4 million) reduced the total output of operations by € 75.1 million.\n\n#### **INCOME AND EXPENSES**\n\nOther income rose by € 9.9 million year on year to € 44.4 million (previous year: € 34.5 million). This was mainly due to the insurance compensation received in connection with hail damage at the French plant in La Roche-Chalais in 2022.\n\nThe cost of materials as a percentage of total output of operations fell from 43.2 % in the previous year to 40.5 % in the reporting year. The cost of materials remained at the previous year's level, while sales revenue increased year on year. This was due to sales revenue growth in the KSB SupremeServ Segment, among other things. In addition, procurement costs, some of which were slightly lower, had an effect.\n\nStaff costs rose from € 901.6 million to € 960.7 million in the financial year (a rise of € 59.1 million). The increase is largely attributable to the higher headcount, increased profit bonuses for employees and general wage and salary increases. The number of employees rose from 15,643 to 15,938 on average over the year. On average in the reporting year, the KSB Group had 295 employees (1.9 %) more than in the previous year. Asia / Pacific reported the greatest increase in the number of employees with a plus of 209. The number of employees in the Region Europe rose by 123. On the other hand, employee numbers in the Region Middle East / Africa / Russia fell by 115. Despite the higher number of employees, the total output of operations per employee rose from € 171 thousand to € 179 thousand, due to the 6.4 % increase in the total output of operations.\n\nDepreciation and amortisation fell by € 2.3 million to € 88.1 million compared with the prior-year period. This is due to a € 5.3 million reduction in impairment losses. At € 87.8 million, scheduled depreciation and amortisation, by contrast, was € 3.0 million higher than in the previous year (€ 84.8 million).\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Percentage change** \n\n**INCOME STATEMENT** \n\nAttributable to:\n\nFurther information is provided in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nTotal output of operations amounted to € 2,845.2 million compared with € 2,674.5 million in the previous year.

In addition, procurement costs,\n\nsome of which were slightly lower, had an effect.\n\n**TOTAL OUTPUT OF OPERATIONS** \n\n**INCOME AND EXPENSES** \n\n**€ thousands 2023 2022** \n\n**72** Management and Issues 2023 **Combined Management Report** Consolidated Financial Statements General Information\n\n**Sales revenue 2,818,988 2,573,387 9.5**  Changes in inventories 24,271 99,412 −75.6 Work performed and capitalised 1,959 1,716 14.2 **Total output of operations 2,845,217 2,674,515 6.4**  Other income 44,384 34,462 28.8 Cost of materials −1,153,651 −1,156,292 −0.2 Staff costs −960,699 −901,551 6.6 Depreciation and amortisation −88,094 −90,419 −2.6 Other expenses −463,257 −391,612 18.3 **Earnings before finance income / expense and income tax (EBIT) 223,902 169,103 32.4**  Finance income 9,382 7,461 25.7 Finance expense −29,656 −17,712 67.4 Income from / expense to investments accounted for using the equity method 5,361 1,816 195.2 **Finance income / expense −14,913 −8,435 76.8 Earnings before income tax (EBT) 208,989 160,668 30.1**  Taxes on income −32,376 −33,330 −2.9 **Earnings after income tax 176,613 127,338 38.7** \n\nNon-controlling interests 24,318 23,689 2.7 **Shareholders of KSB SE & Co.

The increase is largely attributable to the higher headcount, increased profit bonuses for employees and general wage and salary increases. The number of employees rose from 15,643 to 15,938 on average over the year. On average in the reporting year, the KSB Group had 295 employees (1.9 %) more than in the previous year. Asia / Pacific reported the greatest increase in the number of employees with a plus of 209. The number of employees in the Region Europe rose by 123. On the other hand, employee numbers in the Region Middle East / Africa / Russia fell by 115. Despite the higher number of employees, the total output of operations per employee rose from € 171 thousand to € 179 thousand, due to the 6.4 % increase in the total output of\n\nDepreciation and amortisation fell by € 2.3 million to € 88.1 million compared with the prior-year period. This is due to a € 5.3 million reduction in impairment losses. At € 87.8 million, scheduled depreciation and amortisation, by contrast, was € 3.0 million higher than in the previous year At € 463.3 million, other expenses exceeded the prior-year level (€ 391.6 million) by € 71.7 million. This is largely attributable to € 30.0 million higher administrative and selling expenses. Higher consulting costs and an increase in travel activity contributed to the increase. € 20.0 million higher maintenance costs and third-party services were also incurred. Expenses for warranties rose by € 17.5 million as a result of provisions for several projects. As a percentage of total output of operations, expenses increased only moderately from 14.6 % in the previous year to 16.3 % in the financial year.\n\nThe finance income / expense amounted to € – 14.9 million (previous year: € – 8.4 million), largely because of the € 9.1 million increase in interest expenses on pension claims.\n\n#### **EARNINGS**\n\n**11** \n\nmillion increase in interest expenses on pension claims.\n\nmillion. Income from deferred taxes is largely defined by the full reversal of impairment losses on deferred tax assets in the previous year for loss carryforwards and temporary differences in the KSB SE & Co. KGaA tax group. The income tax rate fell again to 15.5 % after 20.7 % in the previous year, which was due, in particular, to the reversal of impairment losses. Overall, earnings after income tax rose from € 127.3 million in the previous year to € 176.6 million in the reporting year.\n\nAt € 24.3 million, earnings attributable to non-controlling interests rose by € 0.6 million compared with the previous year. The ratio of non-controlling interests to earnings after income tax declined noticeably from 18.6 % to 13.8 %.\n\nEarnings attributable to shareholders of KSB SE & Co.

Equity increased in the reporting year and amounted to € 1,216.9 million (previous year: €1,125.6 million). The equity ratio of 45.6 % was at the previous year's level (45.4 %).\n\n#### **Liquidity**\n\nKSB recorded cash flows from operating activities of € 280.3 million compared with € 2.1 million in the previous year. This very positive development is mainly due to the good financial position and working capital management. While an outflow of € 206.5 million was recorded in the 2022 financial year, KSB kept working capital almost stable despite the significant increase in business volume in the financial year. In addition, the € 49.3 million increase in earnings after income tax contributed to the inflow of funds.\n\nThe outflows from investing activities rose by € – 14.5 million from € – 89.0 million in the previous year to € – 103.5 million in the reporting year. This is attributable to a € 4.1 million increase in payments to acquire intangible assets and property, plant and equipment on the one hand, and a € 9.4 million decrease in net proceeds from deposits with an original maturity of more than three months on the other hand.\n\nDespite the € 10.7 million increase in dividend payments, cash outflows in the cash flows from financing activities were € 12.4 million lower than in the previous year. The final tranche of the loan against borrower's note was repaid in the previous year, leading to a cash outflow of € 22.0 million in the 2022 financial year.\n\nOverall, cash and cash equivalents increased sharply from € 228.6 million in the previous year to € 340.4 million in the reporting year.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Financial Position and Net Assets** \n\n**€ thousands 2023 2022** \n\n**74** Management and Issues 2023 **Combined Management Report** Consolidated Financial Statements General Information\n\nFurther information is provided in Section VII.

In addition, a syndicated loan has been in place since December 2018 to protect against potential liquidity risk and cover the need for bank guarantees of the KSB Group. The credit line can be used at any time and has a fixed term of five years with the option to renew twice by one year each time. In the 2020 financial year, KSB availed itself of this option for the second time and extended the fixed term of the line early, until the end of 2025. For more information on liquidity management (such as credit lines) see the section on Risk Reporting on the Utilisation of Financial Instruments elsewhere in this group management report.\n\n#### **Investments**\n\nThe additions to intangible assets amounting to € 9.8 million are above the prior-year level (€ 5.2 million).\n\nInvestments in property, plant and equipment of € 99.9 million in the reporting year are € 1.1 million lower than in the previous year (€ 101.0 million). At € 34.8 million, the highest additions related to advance payments and assets under construction, as in the previous year (€ 38.1 million). Another € 23.0 million related to other equipment, operating and office equipment (previous year: € 20.5 million), while € 22.4 million related to technical equipment and machinery (previous year: € 22.7 million). As in 2022, the focus of capital investment activity was the Region Europe, mainly Germany, the Netherlands and France. Outside Europe, the highest additions were made at the plants in India, the USA and China.\n\n#### **Net financial position**\n\n**13** \n\n**Percentage change** \n\nin the reporting year. This is attributable to a € 4.1 million increase in payments to acquire intangible assets and property, plant and equipment on the one hand, and a € 9.4 million decrease in net proceeds from deposits with an original maturity of more than three months on the other hand.\n\nDespite the € 10.7 million increase in dividend payments, cash outflows in the cash flows from financing activities were € 12.4 million lower than in the previous year. The final tranche of the loan against borrower's note was repaid in the previous year, leading to a cash outflow of € 22.0 million in\n\nOverall, cash and cash equivalents increased sharply from € 228.6 million in the previous year to € 340.4 million in the\n\nthe 2022 financial year.\n\nreporting year.\n\nAt € 324.9 million, the net financial position rose substantially by € 99.3 million from € 225.6 million in the previous year. It is derived from the balance of interest-bearing financial liabilities and financial assets (mainly cash and cash equivalents and receivables from deposits). The increase in the net financial position is attributable to the significant rise in cash flows from operating activities, in particular.\n\n#### **Contingent liabilities and other financial obligations**\n\nContingent liabilities as at the reporting date totalled € 27.2 million and were therefore € 6.7 million lower (previous year: € 33.9 million).\n\nThere are no other obligations and commitments beyond the reporting date. Further financial obligations arose only within the normal scope from purchase commitments amounting to € 27.9 million (previous year: € 27.3 million).\n\n#### **NET ASSETS**\n\nAround 31.9 % of funds is attributable to non-current assets (previous year: 30.6 %). Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment with a historical cost of € 1,711.0 million (previous year: € 1,657.0 million) had carrying amounts of € 677.9 million (previous year: € 651.2 million). Total intangible assets rose from € 72.7 million in the previous year to € 75.7 million. In the reporting year, impairment of goodwill in the Pumps Segment of € 0.4 million (previous year: € 0.8 million) and of € 0.2 million (previous year: € 0.9 million) in the KSB SupremeServ Segment was reported.\n\nRight-of-use assets for leases (€ 46.9 million) were up on the prior-year level (€ 40.2 million).\n\nProperty, plant and equipment increased from € 578.5 million to € 602.2 million as a result of capital expenditure (€ 99.9 million) in excess of depreciation of € 62.0 million. Currency translation effects had a negative impact of € – 12.9 million.\n\nImage /page/74/Picture/15 description: The image shows the number 324.9 in a large, sans-serif font.

For 2022, the assets chart shows: Non-current assets at 30.6%, Inventories at 29.0%, Contract assets, receivables and current assets at 31.2%, and Cash and cash equivalents at 9.2%. The equity and liabilities chart for 2023 shows: Equity at 45.6%, Non-current liabilities at 20.6%, and Current liabilities at 33.8%. For 2022, the equity and liabilities chart shows: Equity at 45.4%, Non-current liabilities at 20.4%, and Current liabilities at 34.2%.\n\nCurrency translation effects led to a loss of € 33.4 million in the reporting year (previous year: gains of € 12.5 million). The revenue reserves include the proportion of earnings after income tax attributable to KSB SE & Co. KGaA shareholders, at € 152.3 million (previous year: € 103.6 million). Out of total equity, € 216.5 million (previous year: € 209.7 million) is attributable to non-controlling interests. The equity ratio is stable at 45.6 % (previous year: 45.4 %).\n\nThe non-controlling interests mainly relate to the following companies: KSB Limited, India, KSB Shanghai Pump Co., Ltd., China and the PAB subgroup. The latter consists of Pumpenund Armaturen-Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH, Frankenthal, and its US subsidiaries.\n\n#### **Inflation and exchange rate effects**\n\nOf the Group's consolidated companies, the annual financial statements of the Argentinian and the Turkish company had to be adjusted for the effects of inflation.

The total of currency translation differences was taken directly to equity.\n\n#### **Liabilities**\n\nThe largest item under liabilities continues to be pension provisions, which increased by € 44.5 million from € 451.6 million to € 496.1 million. Higher interest rates account for this increase. This effect was reported in actuarial losses at € 39.4 million (previous year: € – 158.4 million). Obligations for current pensioners and vested benefits of employees who have left the company account for about 49.9 % of the amount recognised in the balance sheet. The rest is attributable to defined benefit obligations for current employees.\n\nNon-current financial liabilities fell slightly by € 4.9 million year on year to € 29.0 million (previous year: € 24.1 million).\n\nOther non-current and current provisions increased from € 115.7 million in 2022 to € 136.5 million in 2023. This is mainly attributable to the € 18.8 million increase in provisions for warranties and contractual penalties.\n\nCurrent liabilities rose overall by € 53.4 million to € 902.3 million compared with € 848.9 million at the end of 2022. The share of current liabilities relative to total equity and liabilities fell marginally to 33.8 % (previous year: 34.2 %).\n\nCurrent financial liabilities of € 26.1 million are largely unchanged from the previous year's level (€ 26.6 million).\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\n**17** \n\nCurrency translation of financial statements of consolidated companies that are not prepared in euro gave rise to a difference of € – 33.4 million (previous year: € + 12.5 million).

The Pumps Segment reported a stable development contrary to the anticipated noticeable decline. Order intake figures for the Valves and KSB SupremeServ Segments also showed strong growth. A slight to tangible increase was forecast for the Valves Segment, while KSB anticipated slight growth in the KSB SupremeServ Segment.\n\nThe forecast for sales revenue provided in the 2022 Annual Report, which was expected to be in a range between € 2,500 million and € 2,850 million, was confirmed. The Group is very satisfied with the sales revenue achieved of € 2,819.0 million (previous year: € 2,573.4 million). The forecast of a strong increase for the Pumps Segment was achieved with growth of 8.9 %. Instead of the slight to noticeable growth forecast for the Valves Segment and the stable to slight increase for the KSB SupremeServ Segment, both Segments recorded strong growth. In an ad hoc statement, the forecast for EBIT in the 2022 Annual Report, which was expected to be in a range of € 165.0 million to € 200.0 million, was adjusted to a range of € 210.0 million to € 230.0 million. At € 223.9 million, EBIT in the 2023 financial year was therefore in the upper half of the adjusted forecast range. The basis for the adjustment of the forecast was the positive development in the KSB SupremeServ Segment, which was more pronounced than originally assumed. The strong growth forecast for the Pumps Segment was achieved in the financial year. EBIT in the Valves Segment was expected to increase strongly but declined significantly instead. However, this was more than offset by the very positive development in the KSB SupremeServ Segment, for which KSB predicted a stable to slight increase, with strong growth in the reporting year. Detailed information on the reasons for the EBIT performance is provided in the \"Earnings before finance income / expense and income tax (EBIT)\" section.\n\nThe assumption made in the previous year's financial statements that global economic growth would be decisive for the development of the key indicators has largely materialised. The growth in sales revenue also exceeded the growth in order intake, as predicted. KSB expected EBIT growth to be driven primarily by the Standard Markets. However, EBIT growth was mainly attributable to the positive development in the KSB SupremeServ Segment already described above. The company can confirm the expected contribution to earnings from the Region Europe. The Management of the KSB Group is therefore very satisfied with business performance in the reporting year.\n\nKSB continues to have a healthy financial basis for the future.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-79-0\"></span>In its current forecast for global economic growth, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) most recently anticipated an increase of + 3.1 % in real terms for 2024, which equates to the prior-year growth rate.

The growth in order intake will be driven by the Regions Asia / Pacific and Middle East / Africa / Russia. By contrast, KSB expects slight growth in order intake in Europe, its largest market. The highest growth in sales revenue is expected in the Region Europe and – in line with order intake – in the Region Asia / Pacific. The Group expects higher EBIT, largely from the Regions Europe and Asia / Pacific.\n\nFor the 2024 financial year, the Group anticipates a substantial increase in orders received by the Pumps Segment, which achieved an order intake of € 1,576.5 million in the reporting year. This growth will be supported mainly by the Standard Markets operating segment. By contrast, KSB anticipates a slight increase in order intake in the Valves Segment, which amounted to € 392.6 million in the reporting year. KSB expects a slight increase in the order intake of € 990.4 million in the reporting year for the KSB SupremeServ Segment in 2024.\n\nThe Pumps Segment contributed € 1,513.7 million to the Group's consolidated sales revenue in the reporting year. KSB anticipates a marked increase in this Segment for the 2024 financial year. It expects a marked to strong increase in 2024 for the Valves Segment, which achieved sales revenue of € 361.4 million in the reporting year. The KSB SupremeServ Segment contributed € 943.9 million to consolidated sales revenue. KSB forecasts moderately higher sales revenue for this Segment.\n\nThe Pumps Segment generated earnings before finance income / expense and income tax (EBIT) of € 52.3 million in the 2023 reporting year. KSB is planning a tangible increase in EBIT in this Segment for the 2024 financial year. It also expects a strong increase in the Vales Segment. In the reporting year, the Valves Segment achieved EBIT of € – 7.5 million. In the KSB SupremeServ Segment, which contributed € 179.1 million to EBIT in the reporting year, KSB expects a slight to tangible increase in EBIT.\n\nThe forecast may be influenced in particular by the ongoing geopolitical tensions, which are explained in more detail in the Opportunities and Risks Report.\n\n#### **FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\nThis report contains forward-looking statements and information that are based upon the assumptions of Management. They express current forecasts and expectations with regard to future events. As a result, these forward-looking statements and information are exposed to risks and uncertainties that lie outside the Management's sphere of influence. KSB wishes to point out that actual events or results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements and information presented, if one or more of the following opportunities or risks, or other opportunities, risks and uncertainties should materialise, or if the assumptions underlying the statements prove to be inaccurate.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-81-0\"></span>As an organisation that operates throughout the world, the KSB Group is exposed to macroeconomic, sector-typical, financial and business-specific risks. The risk policy is designed to enable KSB to grow sustainably and profitably. The KSB Group aims to reduce the risks associated with its business and where possible avoid them completely. At the same time its global alignment and extensive product range also offer opportunities. This includes those opportunities that arise on the basis of research and development activities, as well as any that are linked to the quality and cost effectiveness of products. KSB's competitive position is also being strengthened by optimising the global sales and production network. In this context, opportunities are constantly examined to further increase KSB's global presence, by establishing new companies or expanding KSB SupremeServ sites and by acquisitions. Customer focus is the key principle in this context.\n\nThe Group sees opportunities and risks as possible future developments or events that may lead to departures from forecast or targets. The departure can be both positive and negative. In order to manage the varied opportunities and risks professionally and efficiently, the Group aligns its actions accordingly and focuses upon the respective situation when selecting the persons responsible. In doing so, Controlling, Legal, Finance and Accounting as well as Internal Audits perform important monitoring tasks. The following section describes the processes related to the Group-wide opportunities and risk management system, which is based on the Auditing Standards 340 (IDW PS 340 n. F.) and 981 (IDW PS 981) issued by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany.\n\n#### **RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**\n\nKSB has implemented a Group-wide risk management system for identifying and assessing relevant risks in the different areas of responsibility and reporting these to Group headquarters. The risk management process of the KSB Group consists of the successive phases of identification, assessment, management, control, documentation and communication of risks. The six phases form a continuous and IT-based closedloop system. This is documented in KSB's Risk Management Manual, as well as the management responsibility and the description of all relevant tasks. In this manual, KSB also formalises the risk strategy that was specified in detail in 2023. The Managing Directors of KSB Management SE are responsible for determining, implementing and releasing the risk management system that is effective throughout the Group. The risk strategy is reviewed regularly to ensure it is oriented on the Group strategy and meets the regulatory requirements. Changes to the risk strategy require the approval of the Managing Directors of KSB Management SE.\n\nKSB's risk strategy serves as a basis for evaluating business decisions and is based on normative guiding principles. These guiding principles include, among other things, a clear commitment to promoting an interdisciplinary and Groupwide risk culture, efficient and time-critical risk communication processes and a stakeholder-centred focus on value creation and preservation. These qualitative criteria are supplemented by a quantitative approach to analysing the riskbearing capacity.\n\nKSB defines the risk-bearing capacity as an aggregated risk potential that can be absorbed in the medium term without posing a threat to the business continuity of KSB. A corresponding concept for risk-bearing capacity, taking into account the overall risk strategy, was established within the Group. It specifically examines whether and to what extent developments could jeopardise the continued existence of the KSB Group with regard to its equity and / or liquidity position.\n\nThe regular derivation of the risk-bearing capacity and its communication to management is an integral process of the risk management system and is the responsibility of the Risk Manager. Changes require the approval of the Managing Directors of KSB Management SE. If the analysis of the riskbearing capacity reveals a need for additional requirements for risk provisioning, equity or liquidity, further measures are defined to ensure that adequate account is taken of the KSB Group's risk-bearing capacity in accordance with its risk strategy. In addition to risk-bearing capacity, KSB defines risk appetite as part of the risk strategy as a level of risk that it is prepared to bear over a certain period of time.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Opportunities and Risks Report**\n\n**82** Management and Issues 2023 **Combined Management Report** Consolidated Financial Statements General Information\n\nThe Managing Directors of KSB Management SE are responsible for determining, implementing and releasing the risk management system that is effective throughout the Group.

The departure can be both positive and negative. In order to manage the varied opportunities and risks professionally and efficiently, the Group aligns its actions accordingly and focuses upon the respective situation when selecting the persons responsible. In doing so, Controlling, Legal, Finance and Accounting as well as Internal Audits perform important monitoring tasks. The following section describes the processes related to the Group-wide opportunities and risk management system, which is based on the Auditing Standards 340 (IDW PS 340 n. F.) and 981 (IDW PS 981) KSB uses risk management software to support these analytical processes and to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of risk management. This supports the systematic identification, assessment, management and monitoring of Group-wide risks and enables the precise and immediate recording of risk information.\n\nManagers are encouraged to take timely action to define and implement measures to limit or avoid damage that may result from the occurrence of risk events. All corporate and central functions and Group companies, including Group companies that are not consolidated, are included in the risk management system. The responsible managers are required to supply their relevant key business and financial indicators each month. As well as creating forecasts during the year on business performance, they also report twice a year to the central Risk Manager on all recognised risks in the categories of market and competitive risks, technological risks, project- and product-related risks, financial risks, procurement risks, ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) risks, other businessspecific risks and long-term strategic risks in a bottom-up process. The monitoring period was divided into three cycles. In the first cycle, the risks are to be reported for the following financial year or, as part of the risk assessment during the course of the year, for the remainder of the financial year. Accordingly, the second cycle covers the risks that are seen within a time period of up to 24 months. Where applicable, any long-term risks are considered in the third cycle, such as strategic risks that have been a greater focal point of KSB's risk management since 2023. In addition, regular management reporting on day-to-day business-related risk developments and issues is provided by the respective corporate and central functions to the Managing Directors of the KSB Group, in order to ensure from a management perspective that such risks are addressed in an action-oriented manner and are continually tracked between the reporting dates.\n\nThe regular identification and updating of risks in all the Group companies and in the respective corporate and central functions ensure that risk awareness within the KSB Group remains at a high level across the board. A distinction is made between qualitative and quantitative risks.\n\nQualitative risks are developments that cannot or cannot yet be thoroughly quantified due to a lack of precise information. However, to be able to evaluate them for further analysis steps, the scope is assessed using defined evaluation intervals. The mean value of these evaluation intervals is used to determine the significance of these risks for the Group.\n\n**21** \n\nQuantitative risks are risks for which the potential monetary impact on the earnings and/or liquidity of the KSB Group can be estimated. They are evaluated taking into account the specifically calculated probability of occurrence in combination with the potential amount of loss. The scope or amount of loss describes the potential influence of the individual risk on the key indicator of earnings before finance income / expense and income tax (EBIT) or liquidity of the KSB Group or the respective Group company. In 2023, KSB further developed the risk assessment methodology, by evaluating the amount of loss using three scenarios rather than one scenario (one-point evaluation): worst case, most likely case and best case. A distinction is also made between a gross method before taking into account any corrective action that has been taken, and a net method after taking into account such measures. Risk assessment at KSB covers all relevant risk areas for internal and external risks arising from the KSB business and the Group's inherent risk profile. In this context, gross impacts on EBIT of all individual and similar risks of € 500 thousand or more before countermeasures in the most likely case scenario are to be reported uniformly throughout the Group at the earliest possible time, regardless of how the risk is assessed in terms of probability of occurrence. Purely casheffective risks are reported as from a gross impact of € 5.0 million or more (in the most likely case).\n\nKSB defines as material all risks or aggregate risks, for which the product of the probability of occurrence and the most probable amount of loss, after deducting the amount of countermeasures, is greater than € 5.0 million. This applies to qualitative and quantitative risks. The materiality threshold of € 5.0 million presented replaces the previous materiality thresholds for individual risks, which were categorised as \"medium\" or \"high\" based on the defined classification from the previous year. As a result of the new evaluation scheme, risks that were still categorised as high in the previous year according to the risk matrix are no longer material. New reported risks, that would have been classified as high in the former evaluation scheme, fall below the newly defined materiality threshold in the reporting year.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Risk management at KSB**\n\nImage /page/83/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram of an organizational structure. At the top is a box labeled \"Supervisory Board\", which is connected by an arrow to a box labeled \"KSB Management SE\". This box is connected by an arrow to a box labeled \"Risk Managers\", which contains a bulleted list: \"Controlling the risk management process\", \"Analyzing the risk reports\", and \"Reporting to the Managing Directors\". To the right of the \"Risk Managers\" box is an arrow pointing to a box labeled \"Internal Audits\", which contains the bulleted list \"Monitoring of proper functioning and effectiveness\". The \"Risk Managers\" box is connected by an arrow to a box labeled \"Risk Owners\", which contains a bulleted list: \"Risk identification\", \"Risk evaluation\", \"Risk control and monitoring (incl. implementation of measures)\", \"Risk recording\", and \"Risk communication / Ad hoc reporting\".\n\nThe bodies to which specific responsibilities and competencies were assigned in KSB's risk management system in the reporting year are presented and explained in the above diagram. **Risk management system of the KSB Group** \n\nAs the legal representative, KSB Management SE assumes overall responsibility for risk management. KSB Management SE reports to the Supervisory Board of KSE SE & Co. KGaA via its Managing Directors during regular Audit Committee meetings and is monitored by the latter. The Managing Directors are supported by the Chief Compliance Officer and the Group Finance and Accounting department of KSB SE & Co. KGaA. The latter coordinates the risk management process at Group level and checks all risks reported for relevance to the preparation of financial statements. This ensures that there is a systematic link with the Group accounting process. The Managing Directors, the Administrative Board and the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee receive two risk reports per financial year. These reports include all the risks classed as material that exceed pre-defined threshold values individually or collectively, taking into consideration any corrective action that has been taken (net risk), as well as further significant developments. The net method enables the Managing Directors to focus specifically on the reported risks. Additionally, the risk-bearing capacity of the KSB Group is regularly monitored on the basis of the overall risk position, which is developed by aggregating all the risks recorded. This makes it possible to identify early on any developments that could threaten business continuity in the period under review. Particularly time-critical risks and new or changed risks that are classified as significant are to be reported by the responsible managers to the Risk Managers on an ad hoc basis. The latter review the information and pass it on to the Managing Directors of KSB Management SE. Opportunities are also taken into account in KSB's current risk management system and are reported in line with the specifications for risk assessment.\n\nWith regard to financial risks KSB makes use of additional risk identification, assessment, management and communication. The central Finance department is responsible for this task, which is described in further detail later in this section.\n\nCompliance risks are dealt with by the Chief Compliance Officer, who is assigned to the Legal and Compliance, Patents and Trademarks staff function. The Chief Compliance Officer is supported by the members of the Compliance Committee and the Compliance Managers of the individual companies.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\nRelevant risks from both corporate and central functions as well as other specialised corporate and central functions are transferred to and integrated within the KSB Group's risk management system, thus systematically ensuring a holistic overall risk inventory. The Internal Audits department is integrated into the risk management system as part of the internal control system. When planning audits, it prioritises areas according to potential risks and is provided with all the necessary information. The auditors ensure that all audited units adhere to the applicable guidelines, actively participate in the risk management system, and control or avoid their risks. Information obtained by Internal Audits on both the identified risks and the corrective action initiated in response forms an integral part of the reporting to the Managing Directors and to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. The risk management system is updated promptly if need be, for example in the event of relevant legal or organisational changes. In addition, the auditors examine the early risk detection system within the scope of the audit of the annual financial statements, establishing that it is in place and checking that it is fit for purpose. Relevant basic documents on risk management are archived in accordance with the statutory applicable deadline and in the statutory required formats.\n\n#### **INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM RELATING TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTING PROCESS**\n\nThe accounting-related internal control system (ICS) contributes towards ensuring proper financial reporting. The aim is to ensure that the consolidated financial statements and group management report comply with all relevant regulations. Key elements of the ICS are – as well as the risk management system described above – guidelines and regulations, which include standard accounting and measurement policies. They must be applied to the full extent by all Group companies. There is a segregation of duties and a double-check system is in place. This is ensured by the audits carried out by the Internal Audits department.\n\nIn addition, Accounting and Controlling carry out regular analytical plausibility checks of the financial information requested from the companies as well as actual / budget variance analyses. This enables KSB to identify significant changes early on, which are examined for accounting and measurement discrepancies. The resulting findings are then discussed at management level.\n\nThe responsibility for Group accounting lies with the employees in the central Accounting KSB Group department. The services of qualified external reviewers are employed to evaluate complex issues (such as the calculation of pension\n\n**23** \n\nregularly monitored on the basis of the overall risk position, which is developed by aggregating all the risks recorded.

Additionally, the risk-bearing capacity of the KSB Group is\n\n**Risk management system of the KSB Group** \n\nKSB Group / Annual Report 2023\n\nobligations) as part of the preparation of the financial statements.\n\nBinding schedules and guidelines apply to accounting within the KSB Group and to accounting at each individual subsidiary. The accounting and measurement methods that must be applied to compile the consolidated financial statements are defined in writing in a manual that is updated and revised on a continual basis. This includes guidelines for posting intra-Group transactions. New accounting principles and other official announcements are continually analysed with regard to their relevance and impact on the consolidated financial statements. Guidelines and manual are adapted where necessary and any changes communicated immediately to the companies. Group Accounting likewise monitors compliance with requirements. This reduces the risk of compiling inappropriate financial statements or failing to publish them by the defined deadlines.\n\nThe financial statement information for all Group companies is automatically processed using certified and tested standard consolidation software. Systematic checks are implemented to help validate the data. Employees in Accounting KSB Group verify any warning signals that arise before using the data. The sequence of the processing steps is strictly specified through the use of the consolidation monitor within the IT system. This ensures the correct processing of data.\n\nTo enable a seamless and accurate accounting process, only employees who have the appropriate specialist know-how are assigned to this task. These employees are trained on a regular basis to make sure that their expert knowledge remains up to date.\n\nAccess authorisations have been defined for the accountingrelated IT system. This protects the data against unauthorised access as well as improper usage and modification. In addition, the checks at many stages ensure the quality of processing and help to limit operational risks.\n\n#### **INDIVIDUALLY ASSESSED OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS**\n\nThe categories presented below include the net risks classified as material and other net risks that are relevant to the Group as well as the material opportunities for the 2024 financial year. If risks are not flagged as material, they are considered to be of secondary importance. Unless otherwise stated, the following risks relate to all Segments.\n\n#### **Markets / Competition**\n\nThe forecast for the 2024 financial year is based on the expectations and assumptions regarding general economic performance and the development of global GDP as described\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management R\n\nin the Report on Expected Developments. Risks for the Group's business arising from high inflation rates have eased considerable but they continue to exist. The Group manages the risk of fluctuations in the economy and in demand by remaining active in several markets and industries with different economic cycles. Furthermore KSB monitors the development of the economic environment for its markets. If necessary, capacities are adjusted, production facilities relocated and cost-cutting measures implemented.\n\nOther risks arise in particular through current geopolitical uncertainty resulting from trade conflicts and numerous global flashpoints. KSB classifies in particular the further development of the conflicts in Ukraine and in the Middle East as a risk with regard to duration and potential escalation, as it is currently not possible to estimate the effects on the global economy and thus on the Group's business activities and further escalation cannot be ruled out. To make use of potential opportunities arising from strategic mergers or acquisitions, KSB continuously monitors the current market situation as well as forecast developments. This allows it to expand market shares or tap into new areas of application.\n\n#### **Projects / Products**\n\nRegular market analysis and monitoring, together with continuous quality management, generally minimise the risk that products will become technically obsolete, are offered at prices not acceptable in the market or that developments on the markets are missed.\n\nIn KSB's business, there are special requirements when it comes to the processing of technically complex large-scale projects with long contract terms. These typically involve potential risks. There may be cost overruns, tighter import and export regulations or sanctions, staff shortages, technical difficulties or quality problems – including potential contractual penalties – that reduce the margins. KSB therefore continuously trains its employees in project management and equips them with specialist knowledge. This is designed to enable them to identify the risks associated with longer-term orders at an early stage. In addition, project managers are provided with appropriate management tools. Decisions are made in conjunction with clearly structured authorisation processes. Furthermore, there is central monitoring of projects exposed to risk across all KSB companies.\n\nThere are also technical and financial risks to orders with newly designed products. Technical risks are limited to the extent that intermediate steps for development work are defined and partial solutions are subjected to assessments. Commercial risks are minimised by using appropriate contractual clauses. KSB's goal is to ensure that advance payments and collateral provided by customers are structured in such a way that they at least cover the costs incurred. KSB reports contingent liabilities of € 1.8 million (previous year: € 5.1 million) for risks that result from warranty obligations and contractual penalties risks and that were not covered by corresponding provisions. Of this amount, € 0 million is attributable to KSB SE & Co. KGaA, as in the previous year. Beyond this KSB sees no material residual risk (net risk).\n\n#### **Finance / Liquidity**\n\nThe Group's international focus is associated with exchange rate risks. Besides the euro, the most important currencies for KSB are the US dollar, the Indian rupee, the Brazilian real and the Chinese yuan. The liquidity risk arising from foreign currency transactions is hedged by using derivative financial instruments. The hedges are based on fixed contracts and on forecasts about future payment streams, the occurrence of which is uncertain.\n\nEconomic downturns or newly emerging crisis may adversely affect the financial situation of customers. Delayed payments and defaults on receivables as a result of this can burden the earnings. The same effect might occur if the foreign exchange regulations become stricter for individual countries. KSB counters this by means of a strict receivables management system and intensive customer contacts.\n\nAs regards tax matters, the global orientation of the activities of the KSB Group must be taken into consideration. Based on its operative activities in numerous countries with varying tax laws and administrative interpretation, differentiated assessment is required for measuring tax obligations of every jurisdiction. Uncertainty could arise due to different factual interpretations by taxable entities on the one hand and local finance authorities on the other, as well as due to unclear legislative texts. These may come to light during audits. By cooperating closely with external local tax specialists, KSB counteracts the risk of having to pay back taxes. As KSB continually monitors unclear issues, it can generally classify the probability of occurrence. Should a need for subsequent payment arise, the corresponding tax liabilities are recognised in good time. In the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, KSB also reports contingent liabilities of € 1.1 million (previous year: € 0.2 million) from risks associated with income taxes. Of this amount, € 0 million is attributable to KSB SE & Co. KGaA, as in the previous year. € 13.4 million (previous year: € 13.2 million) are reported as contingent liabilities for risks from other tax matters. Of this amount, € 0 million is attributable to KSB SE & Co. KGaA, as in the previous year.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\nand collateral provided by customers are structured in such a way that they at least cover the costs incurred.

An increase in costs for raw materials and components can have a negative impact on the earnings situation if the cost increases cannot be compensated for or passed on to customers. Ineffective supply chains, defined by supply bottlenecks and capacity restrictions, can lead to production bottlenecks and delays in delivery, and adversely affect KSB's business activities. In its procurement strategy KSB seeks to prevent dependencies on suppliers and thereby counter any bottlenecks and delays. If local conditions mean that it is impossible to ensure sufficient diversification in this regard, KSB will make use of additional foreign business partners.\n\n#### **Technology / Research and Development**\n\nIt is essential to future success to have a product and service range that is suited to the market in terms of technology, price and delivery time. The changing needs of customers together with new standards and regulations – especially in promising markets – require the continuous development and improvement of products and services. The research and development required for adjustments consumes significant financial and human resources, with no guarantee of success in either the medium or the long term.\n\nTo avoid any negative impact on earnings, it is important to recognise the market-related or technical risks early on. To this end, the KSB Group is constantly updating the development process, which incorporates various control levels. As sales employees are regularly included in this process, risks arising from changes in markets or applications can be taken into account in good time in the evaluation.\n\n#### **Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)**\n\n**25** \n\nESG – short for Environmental, Social and Governance – refers to a comprehensive set of standards covering environmental, social and governance aspects for assessing the Group's sustainable and ethical activities. KSB's business activities, primarily in the area of production, are subject to numerous environmental protection laws and regulations. Environmental damage of any kind (for example, groundwater contamination, renovation needed due to outdated construction materials or unpleasant odours arising from the use of chemicals) may result in costs not covered by insurance policies. Therefore, at all company sites officers monitor compliance with laws and regulations as well as with internal KSB rules. If KSB discovers any contamination, it sets aside provisions to be able to meet obligations for necessary remediation.\n\nIn markets with tightening environmental regulations, there is a risk that KSB products and its in-house or purchased services might give rise to infringements and that the necessary authorisation for the relevant business might be lost and KSB's reputation might be damaged as a result. Legal requirements or restrictions related to products, such as RoHS (Restriction of Certain Hazardous Substances according to EU Directive 2011/65/EU), may lead to a restriction or – in a worst-case scenario – to a ban on selling individual products containing hazardous substances. KSB categorises this risk, which was identified for the first time in the reporting year, as material and is monitoring the current legal situations closely. Identified risks are addressed by continually adjusting the product design in order to be able to offer products that comply with market requirements. A change in rules on liability in environmental protection can also increase the risks for business success. As a member of national and international professional associations the KSB Group becomes aware of imminent changes in environmental law early on. The legal frameworks that are in place in its Operational Units are continually updated, enabling KSB to ensure that its employees always abide by the applicable law. This is monitored by external auditors as part of the management certifications.\n\nIn addition, KSB is exposed to risks from climate and natural hazards. In a first step, KSB evaluates its sites with regard to these risks, which include earthquakes, flooding, lightning strikes and wildfires. The occurrence of these risks would lead to disruptions in ongoing business operations at the respective sites. Sites identified to be exposed to risks based on this evaluation are examined in greater detail in relation to risks from climate and natural hazards, in order to develop and implement individual solutions. Basically KSB counters risks from climate and natural hazards by means of a differentiated production network. This facilitates a flexible response to breakdowns at production sites.\n\nInvestments in plant and machinery are made on the basis of resource efficiency and environmental and health protection in order to optimise energy costs throughout the entire use phase as well as to prevent any follow-on costs incurred through damage to the environment and/or to health.\n\nTo achieve its growth and profitability business objectives, KSB needs qualified employees at all locations, including technical specialists. Due to the demographic change in some countries, the competition for these and other highly skilled professionals is increasing, KSB counters this risk with demand-oriented measures, systematic human resources planning and international recruitment programmes.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n**27** \n\nOther potential risks associated with the activities of KSB's employees include dishonest conduct or violations of laws, which could damage the image of KSB. The KSB Group counters these risks and safeguards its reputation among customers by organising regular compliance training and through individual initiatives in critical regions.\n\nLegal disputes cannot always be avoided within the framework of business activities. These risks are usually disputes arising from operative business, generally involving unclear warranty issues or labour law disputes. In some cases, the continuous further and new development of products can lead to similarities with competitors' products. KSB limits the risk of resulting legal dispute by submitting patent applications at an early stage of the product development. If as a result of these issues KSB expects negative effects on the success of its business with a probability of occurrence of more than 50 %, corresponding provisions are set aside, which cover not only the anticipated amount of loss, but also the costs of proceedings.\n\nIn addition, KSB reports contingent liabilities in the amount of € 2.3 million (previous year: € 3.1 million) in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, € 1.0 million of this is attributable to KSB SE & Co. KGaA (previous year: € 2.0 million).\n\nKSB seeks to counter external fraud activities by raising awareness of its employees and through internal controls. At the same time, KSB continues to develop its compliance organisation. Maintaining its competitive advantage and protecting trade and business secrets is of considerable economic significance to the company. The company responds with specific requirements on conduct to take into account the different protection needs.\n\n#### **Other business-specific opportunities and risks – Information technology**\n\nThe worldwide increase in threats to IT security and cyber crime entail a risk in terms of the security of systems and networks, as well as the confidentiality and availability of data. KSB plans to further expand IT security in the years ahead as part of a multi-year programme to continuously extend the protection of the IT systems.\n\nThe digitalisation of processes helps to make them transparent. KSB uses a process mining tool for this purpose. This innovative approach specifically demonstrates the company processes and identifies any weaknesses and where there is room for improvement. This forms the basis for the continuous development of the internal workflows from start to end of a process.\n\n#### **Strategic opportunities and risks**\n\nStrategic risks are uncertainties and threats arising from strategic decisions and the business environment, which can adversely affect a company's long-term performance and competitiveness. They are closely linked with a company's long-term objectives, orientation and success. Strategic risks typically arise from the complexity and dynamics of the business environment. The occurrence of such risks can be farreaching and impact a company's long-term growth, profitability and image, among other things. It is therefore crucial to recognise and evaluate strategic risks in order to take appropriate measures. The strategic risks presented here are longterm in nature and therefore mainly affect time horizons that extend beyond the following financial year.\n\nAs was already described in the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) section, tighter environmental regulations, which will only come into force in a few years' time, can have negative implications for KSB's business. To counter such risks in good time, relevant measures are defined to identify and subsequently eliminate any violations.\n\nIf the continuous monitoring of the current market situation and forecast developments lead to acquisition plans, there is always a risk that these will fail before a contract is concluded. This can result in a loss of planned income within the scope of strategic planning.\n\nLong-term opportunities stem from the fact that hydrogen is playing an increasingly important role in reducing CO2 as a climate-neutral energy source. KSB participates in this technological trend by providing products for use in hydrogen production and storage. This offers opportunities for the Energy Market Area.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nOther potential risks associated with the activities of KSB's employees include dishonest conduct or violations of laws, which could damage the image of KSB.

The KSB Group bases the nature and scope of all financial transactions exclusively on the requirements of its business. It does not lend itself to business of a speculative nature. The aim is to ensure liquidity at all times and to finance activities under optimal conditions. In export business transactions, foreign exchange and credit risks are hedged. KSB continuously improves its receivables management methods with the goal of settling outstanding amounts by their due dates.\n\nKSB is exposed to the following financial risks as a consequence of its business activities.\n\nKSB is exposed to credit risk, which is defined as potential default or delays in the receipt of contractually agreed payments. KSB is also exposed to liquidity risk which is the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its financial obligations, or will be unable to meet them in full. In addition, KSB is exposed to market price risk. Exchange rate or interest rate changes may adversely affect the economic position of the Group. Risks from fluctuations in the prices of financial instruments are not material.\n\nForeign exchange hedges are used to reduce the risks from transactions involving different currencies. These are generally currency forwards, which KSB uses both for transactions that have already been recognised and for future cash flows from orders still to be processed. At year end, the notional volume of currency forwards used to hedge exchange rate risks totalled € 249.9 million (previous year: € 224.0 million). € 179.9 million of this is attributable to KSB SE & Co. KGaA (previous year: € 160.2 million). The hedged currency risk is mainly in US dollars. A global network of production sites in the local sales markets reduces potential currency risks.\n\nAll these risks are limited through an appropriate risk management system, defining how these risks are addressed through guidelines and work instructions. In addition, the current risk characteristics are continuously monitored and the information obtained in this way is provided to the Managing Directors and the Supervisory Board in the form of standardised reports and individual analyses.\n\nFor more information on the three risk areas and the impact on the balance sheet, see the Notes, Section VI. Additional Disclosures on Financial Instruments.\n\n**27** \n\n#### **OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS**\n\nThe assessment of the KSB Group's overall opportunity and risk situation is summarised in a consolidated appraisal. Compared with the previous year, there was no material change in the overall risk situation for KSB, which is essentially measured in terms of value at risk.\n\nMore stringent legal requirements to be met by the materials used in products in order to lower the environmental impact represent the primary risk for the KSB Group. Risks also arise from the future development of current flashpoints, such as Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East. The risk of rising prices of commodities and materials, which was still considered one of the biggest risks at the end of the previous year, has become much less significant due to price adjustments and better availability.\n\nThe risk management system in place as well as the related organisational measures allow KSB Management SE as the legal representative to identify risks in a timely manner and to take adequate measures. The focus of activities in 2024 will be on the material risks described above. On the basis of the risk management system established by the KSB Group, and taking into account the regulatory requirements (IDW PS 340 n. F.), the legal representative states that at the present time, according to the analysis of the KSB Group's overall risk position and risk-bearing capacity, no threat has been identified to business continuity.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-89-0\"></span>**Balance Sheet**\n\n#### **Assets**\n\n| € thousands                                | 31 Dec. 2023 | 31 Dec. 2022 |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Fixed assets                               |              |              |\n| Intangible assets                          | 38,437       | 38,276       |\n| Property, plant and equipment              | 175,660      | 157,067      |\n| Financial assets                           | 346,053      | 337,838      |\n|                                            | 560,150      | 533,181      |\n| Current assets                             |              |              |\n| Inventories                                | 283,330      | 300,754      |\n| Advances received from customers           | -68,142      | -88,664      |\n|                                            | 215,188      | 212,090      |\n| Receivables and other assets               | 339,293      | 362,283      |\n| Cash and balances with credit institutions | 102,868      | 34,704       |\n|                                            | 442,161      | 396,987      |\n| Prepaid expenses                           | 4,258        | 3,970        |\n|                                            | 1,221,757    | 1,146,228    |\n\n#### **Equity and liabilities**\n\n| € thousands                      | 31 Dec. 2023 | 31 Dec. 2022 |\n|----------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Equity                           |              |              |\n| Subscribed capital               | 44,772       | 44,772       |\n| Capital reserve                  | 66,663       | 66,663       |\n| Revenue reserves                 | 136,180      | 136,180      |\n| Net retained profits             | 88,641       | 73,637       |\n|                                  | 336,257      | 321,253      |\n| Provisions                       |              |              |\n| Pensions and similar obligations | 517,464      | 504,498      |\n| Miscellaneous other provisions   | 128,524      | 111,046      |\n|                                  | 645,987      | 615,544      |\n| Liabilities                      |              |              |\n| Deferred income                  | –            | 1,260        |\n|                                  | 1,221,757    | 1,146,228    |\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Disclosures Relating to KSB SE & Co.

KGaA, as the parent, directly or indirectly holds the shares in the companies belonging to the KSB Group. The KSB Group is managed via KSB SE & Co. KGaA, which is at the same time the Group's largest operative company. The central administrative offices are located at the company's seat (registered office) in Frankenthal; branch operations are located in Bremen, Halle and Pegnitz.\n\nKSB SE & Co. KGaA is associated via control and profit transfer agreements with the following German service companies: KSB Service GmbH, Frankenthal, KSB Service GmbH, Schwedt, Uder Elektromechanik GmbH, Friedrichsthal, Dynamik-Pumpen GmbH, Stuhr, PMS BERCHEM GmbH, Neuss, Pumpen Service Bentz GmbH, Reinbek, and KAGEMA Industrieausrüstungen GmbH, Pattensen. These companies are therefore under single management by KSB SE & Co. KGaA. Their annual earnings are transferred to KSB SE & Co. KGaA.\n\nThe annual financial statements of KSB SE & Co. KGaA have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB) [German Commercial Code] and the Aktiengesetz (AktG) [German Public Companies Act] including the German principles of proper accounting.\n\nDifferences between the accounting methods under HGB and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), which are the basis of preparation for the consolidated financial statements of KSB, arise primarily from the recognition over time of revenue from customer contracts under IFRS 15, in the calculation of pension provisions, from the recognition of leases under IFRS 16 and in the capitalisation of deferred taxes. Furthermore, differences arise in the recognition of assets and liabilities and of income statement items; under HGB there is expanded scope for the recognition of sales revenue.\n\n## **Business Development and Results of Operations**\n\nThe 2023 financial year was defined by global political tensions due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, the China-Taiwan conflict and the outbreak of war in the Gaza region as a result of the attack on Israel. High interest rates led to uncertainty and a decrease in investment. In Germany, the manufacturing industry continued to be challenged by higher gas prices. At the same time, the situation on the procurement markets eased somewhat with regard to price and availability of bought-in parts.\n\nIn Europe, inflation and general uncertainty led to a noticeable slowdown in demand, particularly in the standard business.\n\nThanks to the company's global and broad positioning across several market areas, economic downturns were offset by positive developments.\n\nSales revenue and EBIT under IFRS were significantly higher than in the previous year. Order intake remained largely unchanged. The key performance indicators – order intake, EBIT and sales revenue under IFRS – are, as described in the Control System section, the material financial performance indicators, which are also used for controlling KSB SE & Co. KGaA.\n\n#### **ORDER INTAKE**\n\nThe volume of orders received by KSB SE & Co. KGaA rose by € 5.7 million to € 863.8 million in the reporting year, an increase of 0.7 %. Despite the economic slowdown, which led to a weaker second half of the year, KSB SE Co. KGaA's diversification across numerous regions and markets helped keep the order intake at a high level.\n\n#### **SALES REVENUE**\n\nAt € 996.3 million, total sales revenue under HGB was up € 96.7 million on the prior-year figure of € 899.6 million.\n\nThe disclosures below refer only to sales revenue from the sale of pumps, valves and spare parts as well as services. Sales revenue of € 916.3 million generated in the 2023 financial year represents a year-on-year increase of € 87.5 million (10.6 %).\n\n70.0 % of sales revenue relates to new business with Pumps, 9.4 % to new business with Valves, and 20.6 % to KSB SupremeServ which comprises all the service and spare parts business. The breakdown of sales revenue is broadly similar to that of the previous year.\n\nUnder IFRS, sales revenue rose from € 796.0 million in the previous year to € 884.4 million. This is attributable to improved business in the Standard Markets and higher sales revenue from large-scale projects.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Business Model** \n\nHandelsgesetzbuch\n\nof sales revenue.\n\nKSB Group / Annual Report 2023\n\nAktiengesetz\n\nthe\n\nlocated in Bremen, Halle and Pegnitz.\n\nKSB SE & Co.

This decline was mainly due to lower currency translation gains.\n\nAt € 418.2 million, the cost of materials was almost unchanged from the prior-year level of € 414.8 million. The cost of materials as a percentage of total output of operations fell from 45.1 % in the previous year to 42.6 % in the reporting year. This is due in particular to procurement costs, some of which were slightly lower.\n\nStaff costs increased in absolute terms by € 11.1 million to € 379.7 million. Higher wages and salaries due to the collectively agreed pay adjustment as from June 2023 as well as provisions for profit bonuses and the collectively agreed, one-off payment of the inflation compensation bonus had an impact here. At 38.7%, staff costs as a percentage of total output of operations were down on the previous year's figure of 40.1 %.\n\nOther operating expenses of € 191.1 million showed a marked increase after € 163.5 million in the previous year. In addition to a general increase in costs, additions to provisions for warranties and penalties (€ 16.5 million) and expenses for maintenance of buildings and machinery (€ 4.9 million) contributed significantly to this increase. Expenses from exchange rate losses showed a contrary trend.\n\nOverall, the income from equity investments, at € 61.6 million, was well below the prior-year level (€ 93.3 million). In the 2022 financial year, income of € 37.6 million from the spin-off of the operational business activities at KSB Finanz S.A., Luxembourg, and subsequent integration into KSB SE & Co. KGaA, had been reported under this item. The item includes profit transfers from the German service companies of € 19.0 million (previous year: € 14.6 million) and dividend income from affiliates and equity investments of € 42.7 million.\n\n#### **NET PROFIT / LOSS FOR THE YEAR UNDER HGB**\n\nOperating earnings improved from - € 14.9 million to - € 5.8 million, especially due to the significantly improved total output of operations. Lower finance income / expense had an opposite effect; in the previous year, it included income from the spin-off of the operational business activities at KSB Finanz S.A., Luxembourg, and subsequent integration into KSB SE & Co. KGaA. As a result, KSB SE & Co. KGaA generated a net profit for the year of € 49.4 million in the 2023 financial year; this compares with a net profit of € 53.9 million in the previous year.\n\n#### **EARNINGS BEFORE FINANCE INCOME / EXPENSE AND INCOME TAX (EBIT) UNDER IFRS**\n\nThe EBIT determined in accordance with IFRS improved significantly to € 4.1 million in the 2023 financial year (previous year: € - 6.0 million). The increase in total output of operations at almost constant cost of materials was higher than the offsetting increases in staff costs and other operating expenses.\n\n#### **Financial Position and Net Assets**\n\n#### **FINANCIAL POSITION**\n\nKSB SE & Co. KGaA is embedded within central financial management at the KSB Group. The latter works within the framework of the guidelines laid down by KSB Management SE as the legal representative and bases the nature and scope of all financial transactions exclusively on the requirements of the business. The objective of financial management is to guarantee liquidity at all times and to ensure the financing of activities on optimum terms. In financing export transactions, KSB SE & Co. KGaA hedges foreign exchange and credit risks. KSB continuously improves its receivables management methods with the goal of settling outstanding amounts by their due dates.\n\n#### **LIABILITIES AND PROVISIONS**\n\nThe largest liabilities item, as in the previous year, was pension provisions, which had grown by € 13.0 million to € 517.5 million on the reporting date. Other expenses, at € 128.5 million, were significantly higher than in the previous year (€ 111.0 million). This was due to additions to provisions for warranties.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\n**33** \n\nOf liabilities totalling € 239.5 million (previous year: € 208.2 million), € 68.5 million was accounted for by trade payables at year end (previous year: € 71.5 million). Liabilities towards affiliates and equity investments increased significantly from € 128.4 million in the previous year to € 162.4 million. They include € 132.7 million (previous year: € 100.2 million) for intercompany loans and cash investments.\n\n#### **NET ASSETS**\n\nTotal assets, at € 1,221.8 million, are up 6.6% on the prioryear level of € 1,146.2 million. The cash and balances with credit institutions item posted an increase. An increase in fixed assets was also recorded. This was offset by almost constant inventories and lower receivables.\n\nIn the reporting year, fixed assets made up 45.8 % (previous year: 46.5 %) of total assets. The share accounted for by current assets was 54.2 % after 53.5 % in 2022. Inventories including advance payments received totalled € 215.2 million after € 212.1 million in the previous year.\n\n#### **EQUITY**\n\nThe share capital of KSB SE & Co. KGaA remained at € 44.8 million. The capital reserve was unchanged at € 66.7 million. At year end, € 136.2 million (previous year: € 136.2 million) was assigned to other revenue reserves. Out of the 2022 net retained earnings of € 73.6 million, dividends totalling € 34.4 million (dividend of € 19.50 per ordinary share and € 19.76 per preference share) were distributed by resolution of the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2023. The remaining amount of € 39.3 million was carried forward to new account.\n\n## **Summary of the Performance in the Financial Year**\n\nThe forecasts made at the beginning of the year were partly exceeded due to the global economic development. Order intake was comparable to the previous year. The forecast tangible decrease due to fewer large-scale orders has not materialised. The expectations for considerable growth in sales revenue under IFRS were met, with higher revenue achieved in the Standard Markets. EBIT under IFRS was expected to remain stable at the level of the previous year. However, a strong increase in EBIT was recorded, the reasons for which were explained in more detail in the \"Earnings before finance income / expense and income tax (EBIT) under IFRS\" subsection.\n\n#### **Opportunities and Risks**\n\nThe business performance of KSB SE & Co. KGaA depends significantly on the risks and opportunities faced by the KSB Group, which are set out in detail in the Report on Expected Developments and the Opportunities and Risks Report in the Combined Management Report. KSB SE & Co. KGaA generally shares in the risks of its equity investments and subsidiaries in line with its equity interest.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nOf liabilities totalling € 239.5 million (previous year: € 208.2 million), € 68.5 million was accounted for by trade payables at year end (previous year: € 71.5 million).

The slowdown was due to the restrictive monetary policy measures, which resulted in higher interest rates to curb inflation. The medium-term outlook for economic growth remains the lowest seen in decades. Inflation is expected to fall further, which should lead to a reduction in interest rates in the current year.\n\nWhile the downside risks to this forecast still prevail, they have diminished in view of the resilience of the global economy recently observed. Looking ahead to 2024, inflation risks and the risks of a financial crisis and associated recession risks, in particular, eased over the course of the past year. Geopolitical risks have increased at the same time. Besides current regional conflicts and intensification of the mutual decoupling between the USA and China, the war in Gaza heightened the risk of escalation in the Middle East. Further risks to global economic growth include economic developments in China and its government's approach to addressing the property crisis, as well as possible turbulence on the commodities markets. The latter could be triggered by geopolitical escalation or extreme climatic conditions.\n\nThe IMF is projecting an overall growth rate of + 4.1% for the emerging markets and developing countries.\n\nThe expected growth in the industrialised nations, at + 1.5% in 2024, is lower than in 2023.\n\nGrowth in the euro zone will pick up only slightly to + 0.9%. For Germany, the most recent forecast was for growth of + 0.5%.\n\nGiven the weakening of global economic growth, the growth in demand for capital goods is expected to be lower. The VDMA expects global machinery sales revenue to stagnate at 0 % in real terms. An increase is anticipated at the largest production facilities in Asia, which should offset the decline in the other regions. In China, sales revenue is expected to grow by + 2 %. A decline of – 2 % is expected for the USA. The VDMA forecast for Germany is also for – 2%.\n\nFor manufacturers of liquid pumps in Germany, VDMA foresees a below-average growth of + 0 % in nominal terms in the current year. It predicts a decline of – 1 % for industrial valves. Sales revenue from building services valves is expected to fall by – 2 % in nominal terms.\n\nOverall, KSB SE & Co. KGaA foresees moderate to tangible growth in sales revenue in the 2024 financial year. Sales revenue growth will be supported especially by growth in the Standard Markets and in large-scale projects. Rising orders in the standard business will result in a moderate increase in the order intake of KSB SE Co. KGaA. EBIT under IFRS will rise significantly to sharply compared with the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe forecast horizon for the above-mentioned information and statements is the 2024 financial year.\n\nThe forecast may be influenced in particular by the continuing geopolitical tensions.\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-95-0\"></span>**Acquisition-related Disclosures**\n\nA summary of the acquisition-related disclosures required by Sections 289a and 315a HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch – German Commercial Code] is given below and explanatory information is provided pursuant to Section 176(1) AktG [Aktiengesetz – German Public Companies Act].\n\nThe share capital of KSB SE & Co.

The analysis aims to reveal further development potential for existing processes. Support for this was provided by an auditing firm, whose specialists subjected the relevant internal processes to a critical review. Similarly, the specific handling of the aforementioned compliance regulations was analysed at a selected national company, GIW Industries, Inc., USA. The identified potential for improvement and modernisation will be implemented in the current financial year. Another focus was on the implementation of a country-specific risk analysis for specific compliance sub-areas. This served as a preparatory pilot project for a corresponding Groupwide audit, which is planned for the current financial year. In addition, further relevant compliance sub-areas were subject to an annual status control, in some cases also with the help of external support. Compliance training was continued throughout the year for new employees and employees who were transferred internally to relevant functions. The targeted preventive effect of compliance measures is rounded off by the specific review of operative projects for compliance with the regulations.\n\n#### **STATEMENT ON THE APPROPRIATENESS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SYSTEMS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE A.5 DCGK 2022\\* RECOMMENDATION**\n\nThe internal control system, the risk management system and the compliance management system are subject to process-integrated and process-independent monitoring.

The Internal Audits department is responsible for processindependent monitoring of the systems.\n\nProcess-independent monitoring of the internal control system comprises an audit of material controls along selected business processes at the level of Corporate Functions and decentralised units. The basis for this is a risk-oriented audit plan of the Internal Audits department, which is updated annually or as needed in a given situation.\n\nInternal Audits also regularly reviews the risk management system for appropriateness and effectiveness on the basis of relevant standards, such as the DIIR Audit Standard No. 2 – Audit of the Risk Management System by Internal Audits.\n\nFinally, the appropriateness and effectiveness of the compliance management system is also continuously monitored by Internal Audits, mainly in the course of general or special audit measures. For example, the application of compliance regulations in the company is monitored in the form of employee surveys or in-depth analysis of relevant operative projects. In addition, selected parts of the compliance management system occasionally undergo external analyses by auditors, which are based on the requirements of IDW PS 980. The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board is always involved in these processes and their findings, in particular to facilitate independent monitoring of the compliance management system by the Committee.\n\nThe Managing Directors are involved in monitoring the appropriateness and effectiveness of the systems by coordinating the specific key areas for the audit by Internal Audits, commissioning external auditors, managing a Group Compliance Office and maintaining regular dialogue with those responsible for the governance systems, among other things.\n\nBased on the continuous findings from the aforementioned monitoring measures, the Managing Directors have no evidence that would call into question the appropriateness and effectiveness of the compliance management system, the risk management system and the internal control system.\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/101/Picture/3 description: The image shows a large, white number 3 against a solid blue background.

GENERAL INFORMATION AND BASIC PRINCIPLES**\n\n#### **General Information on the Group**\n\nKSB SE & Co. KGaA, Frankenthal / Pfalz, Germany, is a capital market-oriented Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien [partnership limited by shares] under the law of the Federal Republic of Germany. The company is registered with the Handelsregister [German Commercial Register] of the Amtsgericht [Local Court] Ludwigshafen am Rhein, registration No. HRB 65657, and has its registered office at Johann-Klein-Straße 9, 67227 Frankenthal / Pfalz, Germany. KSB SE & Co. KGaA was formed from KSB Aktiengesellschaft by entry in the German Commercial Register on 17 January 2018. The general partner is KSB Management SE, a European public limited company. The shares in this company are wholly owned by Klein, Schanzlin & Becker GmbH, Frankenthal / Pfalz. Klein, Schanzlin & Becker GmbH is jointly managed by its two shareholders, the non-profit KSB Stiftung [KSB Foundation], Stuttgart, and the non-profit Kühborth-Stiftung GmbH [Kühborth Foundation], Stuttgart. KSB SE & Co. KGaA and thus the KSB Group are managed via KSB Management SE, which has four Managing Directors and a five-member Administrative Board.\n\nKSB SE & Co. KGaA is the ultimate and immediate parent company whose consolidated financial statements include the single-entity financial statements of KSB SE & Co. KGaA. The consolidated financial statements of KSB SE & Co. KGaA prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU are published in the Bundesanzeiger [German Federal Gazette].\n\nThe KSB Group (hereinafter also called \"KSB\" or the \"Group\") is a global supplier of high-quality pumps, valves and related systems and also provides a wide range of support services to users of these products. The breakdown of the Group's business activities is based on three Segments: Pumps, Valves and KSB SupremeServ.\n\n**7**\n\n#### **Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements**\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of KSB SE & Co. KGaA were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and the additional requirements of German commercial law under Section 315e(1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch – German Commercial Code]. To do so, the Conceptual Framework and all Standards applicable at the reporting date and adopted by the European Commission for use in the EU that are of relevance to the KSB Group as well as the interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee were applied. For the purposes of this document, the term IFRSs includes applicable International Accounting Standards (IASs). The consolidated financial statements of KSB SE & Co. KGaA therefore meet the requirements of the IFRSs as adopted by the EU. The consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with IAS 1.25. On principle, the historical cost is the measurement basis used for the consolidated financial statements, unless Section III. Accounting Policies provides otherwise.\n\nAmounts in this report are generally presented in thousands of euros (€ thousands) using standard commercial rounding rules. Due to rounding, there may be minor differences in the totals and percentages presented in this report.\n\nThe financial year of the companies consolidated is the calendar year.\n\nThe income statement as part of the statement of comprehensive income has been prepared using the nature of expense method.\n\nAll material items of the balance sheet and the income statement are presented separately and explained in these Notes.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\n**9**\n\nThe main accounting policies used to prepare the consolidated financial statements are presented below. The policies described were applied consistently for the reporting periods presented unless stated otherwise.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements, the annual financial statements of the parent company and the combined management report are submitted to and published in the Bundesanzeiger.\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are released by the Managing Directors of KSB Management SE on 12 March 2024 for approval at the meeting of the Supervisory Board on 20 March 2024.\n\n#### **New accounting principles**\n\n#### **a) Accounting principles applied for the first time in the 2023 financial year**\n\nThe new or revised accounting Standards and Interpretations listed below which were adopted for the first time in the reporting year had no or no material impact on the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations.\n\n#### **b) Accounting principles that have been published but that are not yet mandatory**\n\nThe new or revised Accounting Standards and Interpretations listed below were not yet mandatory and were not applied in the 2023 financial year.\n\nAs a matter of principle, the new or revised Standards or Interpretations shown in the table have not been adopted early.

CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES**\n\n#### **Consolidated Group**\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, in addition to KSB SE & Co. KGaA, 10 German and 78 foreign companies (previous year: 9 German and 79 foreign companies) were fully consolidated in the consolidated financial statements. A majority interest is held, either directly or indirectly, in the voting power of these subsidiaries which the KSB Group has the option to control under IFRS 10.\n\nSubsidiaries are companies controlled by the Group. The Group controls a company if it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the company and has the ability to affect those returns through its power of disposition over the company. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the Group's financial statements from the date on which control begins until the date on which control ends. Changes in the investment ratio that do not result in a loss of control are treated as a transaction between shareholders and recognised directly in equity. Such transactions do not result in the recognition of goodwill or the realisation of disposal profits.\n\nThe consolidation principles apply accordingly to the five joint ventures and associated companies accounted for using the equity method as at 31 December 2023. Upon the loss of joint control or significant influence any retained interest in the investee is remeasured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nAssociates are companies in which the Group has significant influence but does not have control or joint control over financial and business policy. A joint venture is an agreement through which the Group exercises joint control, in that it has rights to the net assets of the agreement rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.\n\nThe shares in companies included at-equity are measured at cost of acquisition plus or minus cumulative changes in net assets, with recognised goodwill reported in the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nThe Thai company KSB Pumps Co. Ltd., Bangkok, and the Indian company KSB Limited, Pimpri (Pune), are included in the group of fully consolidated affiliates despite the fact that KSB holds a group share of capital of less than 50 %. KSB does, however, have the power to determine their business and financial policies and thus the level of variable returns.\n\nKSB gained control over KSB Limited, Pimpri (Pune), in which KSB owns 40.54 % of the shares, through contractual agreements with other shareholders. These agreements ensure that KSB has the majority of voting rights in management committees and also exercises control over the budget.\n\nLikewise, KSB exercises control over KSB Pumps Co. Ltd., Bangkok, in which it owns 40 % of the shares, through additional agreements which give KSB the majority of voting rights in management committees and control over the budget.\n\nCompanies that were not consolidated due to there being no material impact are reported as other investments under noncurrent other financial assets.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Changes in the consolidated Group**\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, there were the following changes in the consolidated Group, none of which had a material impact on the Group's assets, financial position and results of operations. Against this background, no further information is provided in this context.\n\nWith regard to the subsidiaries of D.P. Industries B.V. based in Alphen aan den Rijn, the Netherlands, there have been changes under company law. On the one hand, former DP Pompen B.V. now trades under the name KSB Manufacturing Netherlands B.V. On the other hand, DP Pumps B.V. initially was renamed Duijvelaar Pompen B.V. and subsequently the previously separate entities KSB B.V., Duijvelaar Installatiebouw B.V. and DP Service B.V. were merged with it.\n\nThe acquisition by KSB of all shares in DAG - Dieselanlagen Service GmbH, Oberwaltersdorf, Austria, in the 2023 financial year expands the group of fully consolidated companies.\n\nIn addition, KSB Čerpadlá a Armatúry, s.r.o., Bratislava, Slovakia, and TOO \"KSB Kazakhstan\", Almaty, Kazakhstan, which were previously not consolidated due to immateriality, are now included in the Group financial statements as fully consolidated companies.\n\nThe company Vari.Co. GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany, which was acquired in the reporting year, is not consolidated due to immateriality.\n\nIn addition, former KSB FINANZ S.A. based in Echternach, Luxembourg, now trades as KSB FINANZ GmbH based in Frankenthal / Pfalz, Germany, as at the balance sheet date of the reporting year.\n\nA full list of the shareholdings held by the KSB Group is provided at the end of these Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Consolidation methods**\n\nFor the purposes of consolidation, the effects of any intercompany transactions are eliminated in full. Any receivables and liabilities between the consolidated companies are offset against each other, and any unrealised gains and losses recognised in fixed assets and inventories are eliminated. Any revenues from intercompany sales are offset against the corresponding expenses.\n\nCapital consolidation is based on the purchase method of accounting pursuant to IFRS 3. This means that the amortised cost of the parent's shares in the subsidiary is eliminated against the remeasured equity attributable to the parent at the date of acquisition.\n\nAny goodwill created from the application of the purchase method denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the KSB Group is measured at the relevant current closing rate. Goodwill is reported under intangible assets and tested for impairment at least once a year. If an impairment is identified, an impairment loss is recognised. Any excess of our interest in the fair values of net assets acquired over cost is recognised in profit or loss in the year it occurred.\n\nThose shares of subsidiaries' equity not attributable to KSB SE & Co. KGaA are reported as non-controlling interests. Further explanations on non-controlling interests of other shareholders are included under Notes No. 10. Equity.\n\n#### **Currency translation**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in euro (€). Unless otherwise stated, amounts in this report are presented in thousands of euros (€ thousands) using standard commercial rounding rules.\n\nCurrency translation is effected on the basis of the functional currency of the consolidated companies. As in the previous year, the functional currency is exclusively the local currency of the company consolidated, as it operates as a financially, economically and organisationally independent entity.\n\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the individual companies at the rate prevailing when the transaction is initially recognised. Monetary assets and liabilities are subsequently measured at the closing rate. Measurement effects are recognised in the income statement.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Changes in the consolidated Group** \n\nprovided in this context.\n\nconsolidated companies.\n\nimmateriality.\n\nthe reporting year.\n\nstatements.\n\nKSB Group / Annual Report 2023\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, there were the following changes in the consolidated Group, none of which had a material impact on the Group's assets, financial position and results of operations.

An exception to this, with a translation of the income statement items at the closing rate, results from the application of IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Countries, as explained in greater detail below. Gains and losses from the translation of items of assets and liabilities compared with their translation in the previous year are taken directly to equity in other comprehensive income and reported under currency translation differences.\n\nThe exchange rates of the most important currencies for the KSB Group at the reporting date and on an annual average are presented in the table below.\n\n#### **Hyperinflation**\n\n**11**\n\nArgentina and Turkey have been classified as hyperinflationary economies for accounting purposes since 2018 and 2022 respectively. Accordingly, IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies has since been applied to the translation of the financial statements of KSB Compañía Sudamericana de Bombas S.A., Carapachay (Buenos Aires), Argentina, and KSB-Pompa, Armatür Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S., Ankara, Turkey.\n\nAs a result, the activities of the two said subsidiaries are not accounted for on the basis of historical acquisition and production costs, but are adjusted for the effects of inflation by using country-specific price indices. The inflation adjustment to the financial statements of the Argentine subsidiary is based on the consumer price index IPC (Índice de precios al consumidor), which was at 3,520.10 on 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 1,134.59; 1 January 2022: 582.02). The con-sumer price index TÜFE (Tüketici fiyat endeksi) is used to adjust for inflation in the financial statements of the Turkish subsidiary; the value applied at the reporting date was 1,859.38 (31 December 2022: 1,128.45; 1 January 2022: 686.95).\n\nThe net loss from monetary depreciation to be taken into account under IAS 29 on the affected monetary assets and liabilities, amounting to € 6,872 thousand (previous year: € 4,628 thousand), is included in the income statement under other financial expenses within finance income / expense.\n\nAfter applying the inflation adjustment, the balance sheet and income statement items are translated into the reporting currency (euro) at the closing rate for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Exchange rates of the most important currencies**\n\n|                | Closing rate |              | Average rate |         |\n|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------|\n|                | 31 Dec. 2023 | 31 Dec. 2022 | 2023         | 2022    |\n| US dollar      | 1.1050       | 1.0666       | 1.0813       | 1.0531  |\n| Brazilian real | 5.3618       | 5.6386       | 5.4010       | 5.4399  |\n| Indian rupee   | 91.9045      | 88.1710      | 89.3001      | 82.6864 |\n| Chinese yuan   | 7.8509       | 7.3582       | 7.6600       | 7.0788  |\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### KSB Group / Annual Report 2023\n\n#### **III. ACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n#### **1. General accounting policies**\n\n#### **Acquisition and production costs**\n\nIn addition to the purchase price, acquisition cost includes attributable incidental costs (except for costs associated with the acquisition of a company) and subsequent expenditure. Purchase price reductions are deducted.\n\nAs well as directly allocated costs, production costs also include reasonable proportions of material and production overheads based on standard capacity utilisation of the relevant production facilities, if and to the extent these were incurred as part of the production process. This also includes production-related administrative expenses. General administrative expenses, research costs and selling expenses are not capitalised.\n\nBorrowing costs as defined in IAS 23 that can be directly allocated to the acquisition or production of qualifying assets are capitalised. As in the previous year no such borrowing costs were incurred.\n\n#### **Fair value**\n\nFair value is the price that independent market participants would, under standard market conditions, receive when selling an asset or pay when transferring a liability at the measurement date. This applies irrespectively of whether the price is directly observable or has been estimated using a measurement method.\n\nThe KSB Group defined a monitoring framework concept for determining fair value. This includes the monitoring of all material measurements at fair value and the direct communication of material facts to Management and, if necessary, to the audit committee. For the purposes of calculating fair value, KSB makes use wherever possible of estimates from market participants or estimates derived from these. As an initial step, regular checks are made to ascertain if there are current prices on active markets for an identical transaction. If no quoted market prices are available, the preference is to use the marketbased approach (deriving the fair value from the market or transaction prices of comparable assets, for example multipliers) or the income-based approach (calculation of fair value as a future value by discounting future cash surpluses).\n\nBased upon the input factors used in the measurement methods, fair values are assigned to different levels of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n- Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) on active markets for identical assets and liabilities\n- Level 2: Measurement parameters that are not the quoted prices taken into account for level 1, but that are observable for the asset or the liability either directly as a price or indirectly derived from prices\n- Level 3: Measurement parameters for assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data\n\nIf input factors categorised into different levels are included in the fair value measurement, the measurement must be categorised in its entirety in the level of the lowest level input factor that is material for the entire measurement.\n\nReclassifications between different levels in the fair value hierarchy are recognised at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.\n\n#### **Maturities**\n\nMaturities of up to one year are classified as current.\n\nAssets that can only be realised after more than twelve months, as well as liabilities that only become due after more than twelve months, are also classified as current if they are attributable to the operating cycle defined in IAS 1.

When the contractual right to payments from financial assets expires, these are derecognised. Financial liabilities are derecognised at the time when the contractual obligations are settled or cancelled or have expired. The acquisition and sale of financial instruments on an arm's length basis are recognised at the value at the date of settlement.

Financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value are recognised after adjustment for transaction costs. Subsequent measurement is in line with the measurement category allocated to the financial asset or financial liability.\n\nThe fair value option is not being used at the moment.\n\n#### **b) Derivatives**\n\n**13**\n\nDerivatives are exclusively used for hedging purposes. Future cash flows and existing recognised underlyings are hedged against foreign currency and interest rate risks. The hedging instruments used are exclusively currency forwards and interest rate derivatives entered into with prime-rated banks. Interest rate risks are minimised for long-term borrowings at floating rates of interest. Group guidelines govern the use of these instruments. These transactions are also subject to continuous risk monitoring.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are categorised as at fair value through profit or loss unless they are part of hedge accounting. In the case of designated cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the effective portions of the currency derivatives are recognised under other comprehensive income and reported under \"Changes in the fair value of financial instruments\" in equity for as long as the underlying transaction is not recognised in the income statement. Only the spot element of the derivative hedging instrument is designated, while the forward element and currency basis spreads are excluded from the hedge and reported separately in the hedging cost reserve in other comprehensive income. Any ineffectiveness and changes in the market value of currency forwards not designated as hedges are recognised in the income statement.\n\nChanges in the fair value of interest rate derivatives used to hedge against interest rate risks in liabilities are recognised under other comprehensive income and presented under \"Changes in the fair value of financial instruments\" in equity.\n\nThe carrying amounts equal fair value and are determined on the basis of input factors observable either directly (as a price) or indirectly (derived from prices). Fair values may be positive or negative. Fair value is the amount that KSB would receive or have to pay at the reporting date to settle the financial instrument. This amount is determined using the relevant exchange rates, interest rates and counterparty credit ratings at the reporting date. Information is obtained solely from recognised external sources.\n\nCurrency forwards are reported under other financial assets and under other financial liabilities. This also applies in principle to interest rate swaps, where applicable.\n\n#### **2. Specific accounting policies**\n\n#### **Intangible assets**\n\nIntangible assets are recognised at (acquisition or production) cost and reduced by straight-line amortisation. Depreciation / amortisation is reported under \"Depreciation / amortisation\" in the income statement. The underlying useful life of intangible assets – excluding goodwill (indefinite useful life) – is between 2 and 15 years. If an intangible asset's recoverable amount is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment testing is carried out at least once a year for goodwill, other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets under development at the reporting date. In addition, all types of intangible assets are subject to impairment testing if there are indications as defined in IAS 36 of a possible impairment. If the reasons for an impairment loss in a previous period no longer apply, it is reversed up to a maximum of amortised cost (write-up), with the exception of goodwill.\n\nGoodwill is scheduled to be tested for impairment once a year. The test relates to cash-generating units (CGUs). The cashgenerating units are generally represented by the respective share in a legal entity that is allocated to an operating segment. The Group's total of five operating segments encompass Energy, Mining and Standard Markets for new business with Pumps, new business with Valves and KSB SupremeServ. A legal entity contains several cash-generating units if the main business activities are spread over several operating segments. Further details on KSB's segmentation are provided in Section VIII. Segment Reporting in these Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management\n\nThe goodwill is reduced by the difference in value or down to zero at maximum if the value in use is lower than the carrying amount of the CGU. If the difference exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill, further impairment testing is required at the level of intangible assets, rights to use leased assets and property, plant and equipment. Reversal of an impairment loss from an earlier period is not possible for goodwill.\n\nThe discounted cash flow model is used to determine the recoverable amount (value in use). The future earnings (EBIT in accordance with IFRS) applied are taken from a multi-year financial plan (five years), based on the 30 September reporting date taking into account the medium-term strategy approved by Management for the respective cash-generating unit. This planning is carried out based on certain assumptions which are drawn from both forecasts from external sources, e.g. current German Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA) publications, and own experience-based knowledge of markets and competitors. The earnings of the last plan year are consistently extrapolated as a constant, if that level is considered to be achievable in the long term. Growth rates are derived taking account of the estimates with regard to economic circumstances. The Group regularly tests goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of every year based on the figures as per 30 September of the year in question. In addition, a review of impairment is always carried out when events or circumstances (\"trigger events\") suggest that the value could be impaired.\n\nIn order to assess the risk of impairment of material goodwill, the Group also performs sensitivity analyses as part of its impairment testing. To this end, changes deemed possible in material assumptions underlying the calculation of the value in use are taken into account.\n\nWhen companies are acquired, purchase price allocations are made and the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired is determined. In addition to the assets and liabilities already recognised by the selling party, account is also taken of marketing-related aspects (primarily brands or trademarks and competitive restrictions), customer-related aspects (primarily customer lists, customer relations and orders on hand), contract-related aspects (mainly particularly advantageous service, work, purchasing and employment contracts) as well as technology-related aspects (primarily patents, know-how and databases). The residual value method, the excess earnings method and cost-oriented procedures are primarily applied to determine values.\n\nDevelopment costs are capitalised as internally generated intangible assets at cost where the criteria described in IAS 38 are met and reduced by straight-line amortisation as from the time the asset becomes operational. Research costs are expensed as incurred. Where research and development costs cannot be reliably distinguished within a project, no costs are capitalised.\n\n#### **Leases**\n\nAccording to IFRS 16, a contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nFor leases where KSB is the lessee, lease liabilities and right-ofuse assets (rights to use leased assets) must be recognised on the balance sheet. Leases of low value assets and short-term leases with a term of up to 12 months are exempt from this provision as KSB has elected to make use of the practical expedient of accounting for lease payments as an expense. In this context, leased assets with a fair value of up to € 5,000 are defined as low-value assets.\n\nLease liabilities and right-of-use assets are generally recognised at the time at which the leased asset is made available to KSB by the lessor for use. The carrying amount of the two items is essentially based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments. It is discounted using the incremental borrowing rate of KSB if no interest rate implicitly underlying the lease is available. Extension and termination options are included in the term and the carrying amounts of a lease if it is deemed reasonably certain that they will be exercised by KSB. Only lease components and in particular no separate service components are taken into account in the measurement of lease payments. The right-of-use assets are depreciated over the economic useful life of the leased asset or over the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method in the form of a redemption and interest portion. Changes in lease payments are taken into account through remeasurements of lease liabilities. The interest expense for the lease liability and depreciation / amortisation expense for the right-of-use asset are recognised separately.\n\n#### **Property, plant and equipment**\n\nIn accordance with IAS 16, property, plant and equipment is measured at cost and reduced by straight-line depreciation over its useful life. If an asset's recoverable amount is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment testing of property, plant and equipment is always carried out if there are indications as defined in IAS 36 of a\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\nDevelopment costs are capitalised as internally generated intangible assets at cost where the criteria described in IAS 38 are met and reduced by straight-line amortisation as from the time the asset becomes operational.

If the reasons for an impairment loss recognised in a previous period no longer apply, the impairment loss is reversed (write-up) up to a maximum of amortised cost.\n\nGovernment grants relating to property, plant and equipment are transferred to an adjustment item on the liabilities side. This item is reversed pro rata over the useful life of the subsidised assets and recognised as other income.\n\nMaintenance expenses are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, unless they lead to the expansion or material improvement of the asset concerned.\n\nAs in the previous year, the following useful lives are applied:\n\n#### **Useful life of property, plant and equipment**\n\n| Buildings                                       | 10 to 50 years |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Plant and machinery                             | 5 to 25 years  |\n| Other equipment, operating and office equipment | 3 to 25 years  |\n\n#### **Non-current financial assets**\n\nInterest-bearing loans are recognised at amortised cost, whereas non-current financial instruments are recognised in the income statement at fair value as at the reporting date. Financial assets such other cash deposits are subject to an expected default risk. The impairment loss is calculated based on the loan amount on the closing or reporting date, the loss ratio of the loan amount and the term-weighted credit default spreads as a benchmark for probability of failure. Furthermore, partial or complete impairment is recognised as soon as there are signs of an increase in default risk.\n\n#### **Non-current other non-financial assets**\n\n**15**\n\nInvestments in non-consolidated subsidiaries are measured at amortised cost.\n\nDefined benefit assets are recognised at the amount by which the fair value of the plan assets exceeds the related defined benefit obligation, less the effects of the asset ceiling in accordance with IAS 19.\n\n#### **Investments accounted for using the equity method**\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method are companies in which the parties exercise joint control (joint venture) or have the power to exercise significant influence over the companies' operating and financial policies (associate); this is usually the case where an entity holds between 20 % and 50 % of the voting power. These assets are recognised at cost at the time of acquisition. If the costs of acquisition exceed the share of the net assets, adjustments are made on the basis of the fair value (pro rata hidden reserves and liabilities). The remaining amount is recognised as goodwill. It forms part of the carrying amount of the joint venture or associate and is not amortised. For subsequent measurement, the carrying amounts are increased / reduced annually by the pro-rata earnings, distributed dividends or other changes in equity of the joint venture or the associate. If local accounting principles differ from the Group's standard accounting policies, adjustments are made accordingly. The share of earnings is reported in the consolidated income statement in a separate line (earnings from investments accounted for using the equity method), and changes such as currency translation effects are taken directly to Group equity. If the losses attributable to the KSB Group correspond to the carrying amount of the company or exceed this, they are not recognised unless KSB has entered into obligations or has made payments for the company. Intercompany gains and losses from transactions between Group companies and investments accounted for using the equity method are offset against the carrying amount in profit or loss. At each reporting date, a review is carried out to determine whether there are any objective indications of impairment, and the amount of such impairment is calculated if required. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount of an investment, it is written down to the recoverable amount. Any impairments or reversals of impairments are reported in the consolidated income statement under finance income / expense.\n\n#### **Inventories**\n\nPursuant to IAS 2, inventories are recognised at the lower of cost and net realisable value as at the reporting date. Cost is measured using the weighted average method. KSB takes account of the inventory risks resulting from slow-moving goods or impaired marketability through write-downs to the net realisable value. This also applies if the selling price is lower than production cost plus costs still to be incurred. If the reasons for an impairment loss charged in a previous period no longer apply, the impairment loss is reversed (write-up).\n\nAdvance payments made on inventories are also presented under inventories because of the correlation and expected realisation of these advances (through conversion into inventories) within the normal business cycle.\n\n#### **Contract assets and contract liabilities**\n\nA contract asset shows KSB's claim to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to customers, with the right to payment being not only conditional on the passage of time but also on the satisfaction of an overall contractual performance obligation by KSB. By contrast, receivables \n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\nreflect KSB's unqualified claim to consideration. A contract liability also represents KSB's obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer. However, in these cases KSB has already received consideration from a customer that exceeds the amount of the goods or services provided. Contract assets relate to ongoing projects that have not yet been invoiced and are subject to similar credit risks as trade receivables for the same types of contract. Against this background, the expected loss ratios of trade receivables are also used for the risk provision for expected credit loss (ECL) of contract assets determined using the simplified impairment model. If it becomes apparent to KSB at the respective project stage that it is sufficiently likely that customers will default on payments, these risks are taken into account by appropriate individual impairment allowances for the contract assets concerned.\n\n#### **Trade receivables**\n\nTrade receivables and other current assets are subsequently recognised at amortised cost. Low-interest or non-interestbearing receivables are discounted. In addition, identifiable risks are taken into account by charging individual impairment losses. Individual impairment allowances are regularly made if insolvency or collection proceedings have been instigated, on the default or failure to meet agreed repayment plans and on overdue payments. Receivables are derecognised if it is reasonably certain that payment cannot be expected. A risk provision for expected credit losses (ECL) is set aside under the simplified impairment model according to IFRS 9 for receivables that are not individually impaired. To measure expected credit losses, trade receivables are summarised on the basis of common credit risk features (risk classes) and number of days overdue. The expected default rates stem from the historical payment profiles of sales revenues over the last three financial years before the reporting date. The historical and forward-looking information forms the basis for the expected probability of failure, adjusted for future-oriented macroeconomic factors.\n\nPart of the default risk exposure of trade receivables is hedged. For more information, please refer to Section VI. Additional Information on Financial Instruments\" – sub-section \"Financial risks – Credit risk\".\n\nFor trade receivables for which collateral, such as credit insurance, has been provided or letters of credit have been opened, a risk provision is set aside, taking account of default risks of the provider of the security and the company's macroeconomic factors.\n\nIf the reasons for an impairment loss charged in a previous period no longer apply, the impairment loss is reversed (writeup).\n\n#### **Other non-financial assets**\n\nThe prepayments made that are presented in this item relate to accrued expenditure prior to the reporting date that will only be classified as an expense after the reporting date.\n\n#### **Cash and cash equivalents**\n\nCash (cash and sight deposits) and cash equivalents (shortterm, highly liquid financial investments that are readily convertible to defined amounts of cash, and that are subject to only immaterial fluctuations in terms of their value) are recognised at amortised cost. Cash and cash equivalents are subject to an expected credit default risk. The impairment allowance under IFRS 9 is calculated based on the loan amount on the closing date, the loss ratio of the loan amount and the term-weighted credit default spreads as a benchmark for probability of failure. Furthermore, partial or complete impairment allowances are recognised as soon as there are signs of an increase in default risk.\n\n#### **Taxes on income**\n\nCurrent taxes on income are recognised in income tax liabilities to the extent that they have not yet been paid. If the amount already paid exceeds the amount owed, an income tax receivable is recognised and reported in other tax assets under other non-financial assets.\n\nDeferred taxes are accounted for in accordance with IAS 12 using the balance sheet liability method on the basis of the enacted or substantively enacted local tax rates. This means that deferred tax assets and liabilities generally arise when the tax base of assets and liabilities differs from their carrying amount in the IFRS financial statements, and this leads to future tax expense or income. KSB recognises deferred tax assets from tax loss carryforwards in those cases where it is more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable profit available in the near future against which these tax loss carryforwards can be utilised. Deferred taxes are also recognised for consolidation adjustments. Deferred taxes are not discounted. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always offset where they relate to the same tax authority. Changes to deferred taxes in the consolidated balance sheet generally result in deferred tax expense or income. If, however, a direct entry is made in other comprehensive income in equity, the change in deferred taxes is also taken directly to equity.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Provisions**\n\nIf the reasons for an impairment loss charged in a previous period no longer apply, the impairment loss is reversed (write-\n\nThe prepayments made that are presented in this item relate to accrued expenditure prior to the reporting date that will only\n\nCash (cash and sight deposits) and cash equivalents (shortterm, highly liquid financial investments that are readily convertible to defined amounts of cash, and that are subject to only immaterial fluctuations in terms of their value) are recognised at amortised cost.

A contract liability also represents KSB's obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer. However, in these cases KSB has already received consideration from a customer that exceeds the amount of the goods or services provided. Contract assets relate to ongoing projects that have not yet been invoiced and are subject to similar credit risks as trade receivables for the same types of contract. Against this background, the expected loss ratios of trade receivables are also used for the risk provision for expected credit loss (ECL) of contract assets determined using the simplified impairment model. If it becomes apparent to KSB at the respective project stage that it is sufficiently likely that customers will default on payments, these risks are taken into account by appropriate individual impairment allowances for the contract assets concerned.\n\nTrade receivables and other current assets are subsequently recognised at amortised cost. Low-interest or non-interestbearing receivables are discounted. In addition, identifiable risks are taken into account by charging individual impairment losses. Individual impairment allowances are regularly made if insolvency or collection proceedings have been instigated, on the default or failure to meet agreed repayment plans and on overdue payments. Receivables are derecognised if it is reasonably certain that payment cannot be expected. A risk provision for expected credit losses (ECL) is set aside under the simplified impairment model according to IFRS 9 for receivables that are not individually impaired. To measure expected credit losses, trade receivables are summarised on the basis of common credit risk features (risk classes) and number of days overdue. The expected default rates stem from the historical payment profiles of sales revenues over the last three financial years before the reporting date. The historical and forward-looking information forms the basis for the expected probability of failure, adjusted for future-oriented macro-\n\nPart of the default risk exposure of trade receivables is hedged.

They are based on defined benefit pension plans. They are measured using the projected unit credit method.\n\nActuarial gains and losses are taken directly to other comprehensive income and reported in equity under \"Remeasurement of defined benefit plans\". The actuarial demographic assumptions and the setting of the discount rate (based on senior, fixed-income corporate bonds) and other measurement parameters (for example income and pension trends) are based on best estimates.\n\nNet interest is calculated by multiplying the discount rate with the net liability (pension obligation minus plan assets) or the net asset value that results if the plan assets exceed the pension obligation.\n\nThe defined benefit costs include the service cost, which is included in staff costs under pension costs, and the net interest income or expense on the net liability or net asset value, which is recognised in finance income / expense under interest and similar expenses or under interest and similar income.\n\nDefined benefit assets are reported under non-current other non-financial assets.\n\nNo provisions are set aside for defined contribution pension plans. In these cases, the premium payments are recognised directly in staff costs in the income statement. Other than an obligation to pay premiums, KSB has no further obligations. Consequently, the insurance risk remains with the insured parties.\n\n#### **b) Other provisions**\n\n**17**\n\nProvisions are recognised if an event that occurred by the reporting date of the respective financial year results in a present legal or constructive external obligation that the company has no realistic alternative to settling, where settlement of this obligation is expected to result in an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits, and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. The amount of the provision corresponds to the best estimate of the settlement amount of the current obligation on the reporting date. Any more or less secure recourse or reimbursement claims are recognised as separate assets.\n\nObligations in the form of expected losses from onerous contracts are recognised if the unavoidable costs to KSB of fulfilling a contract exceed the expected economic benefits. In the case of customer contracts that are expected to be lossmaking, first an impairment of contract-related inventories is recognised before additional provisions are recognised. In contrast, contract assets are reported gross on the one hand and provisions for expected losses from onerous customer contracts are recognised on the other hand.\n\nProvisions for restructurings are recognised only if the criteria set out in IAS 37 are met.\n\nNon-current provisions are discounted if the effects are material.\n\n#### **Contingent liabilities**\n\nContingent liabilities, which are not recognised, are potential obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future events. Contingent liabilities may also be present obligations that arise from past events where it is possible but not probable that there will be an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits.\n\nContingent liabilities correspond to the extent of liability at the reporting date.\n\n#### **Sales revenue**\n\nKSB generates sales revenue from the sale of goods and goods purchased and held for resale from the production, sale and trade of machinery, systems and other industrial products, particularly pumps and valves and related support services. The breadth of orders with pumps ranges from the supply of an individual pump to customised pump sets, including drive and control systems. These goods and services are sold to engineering contractors, OEMs and end users or, in some cases, distributed via dealers. Some customer contracts contain several service components, such as manufacture of a pump and the related installation and commissioning. These installation services cover integration services and can only be carried out by specifically trained and qualified staff. They are not accounted for as independent performance obligations and the transaction price is not split.\n\nSales revenue is recognised in the amount of the consideration expected by KSB based on the transfer of goods or provision of services to the customer. Depending on the type of performance and contractual structure, sales revenue is recognised either over time or at a point in time in line with satisfaction of the performance obligation by KSB.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management\n\nIf a performance obligation meets the criteria for recognising sales revenue over time under IFRS 15 and the progress towards completion and expected consideration can be reliably estimated, the sales revenue is recognised based on progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. KSB specifically recognises sales revenue over time for contracts covering the production of customised pumps and valves as well as contracts for the provision of services. By contrast, standard products in the pumps and valves areas are typically subject to sales revenue recognition at a point in time. KSB applies the input-oriented method to determine progress that is measured by the factors used. The percentage of completion of contracts is determined on the basis of the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed up to the reporting date bear to the estimated total contract costs at the reporting date and thus follows the cost-to-cost method. Contract revenue consists of all contractually agreed revenues, as well as additional claims and incentive payments that are likely to result in revenue and are capable of being reliably measured. Contract revenue may vary, for instance because of renegotiations or penalties. Sales revenue is accounted for based on the amount fixed in the contract less expected consideration. Variable considerations (penalties, bonuses) are estimated at the most likely value. Restrictions on estimate options are taken into account. Estimates on costs and contract progress are corrected if circumstances change. Any resultant increases or reductions in the estimated proceeds or costs are reflected in the profit and loss account for the period in which the circumstances giving rise to the correction occurred. If the earnings from a service or production order with sales revenue recognition over time cannot be reliably estimated, revenue will only be recognised in the amount of the contract costs incurred that are likely to be covered and the contract costs recognised as an expense for the period in which they are incurred.\n\nSales revenue is recognised at a point in time for performance obligations that do not meet the criteria for recognising sales revenue over time under IFRS 15. At KSB, this typically applies in particular to standard products without any significant customer-specific characteristic in the Pumps and Valves segments. At the time of revenue recognition, receipt of the consideration must be probable and the amount of sales revenue must be reliably measurable. A reliable estimation of the associated costs and potential return of the goods must also be possible. The point in time at which KSB satisfies the performance obligations from contracts with customers subject to sales revenue recognition at a point in time is generally based on the agreed delivery terms and conditions (INCOTERMS). For certain deliveries and services, a declaration of acceptance by the customer is required for the recognition of sales revenue. The Group generally aims to agree on delivery terms and conditions with the earliest possible transfer of risk. For customer contracts based on sales revenue recognised at a point in time, sales reductions also reduce sales revenue.\n\nKSB agrees payment terms and conditions for customer contracts that allow for payment in a reasonable period after the invoice has been issued. Extended payment terms are not usually granted to customers. There are usually no long-term financing components.\n\nIn individual cases and in compliance with the statutory requirements of IFRS 15, a customer may ask to obtain control of a product prior to delivery of the goods (bill-and-hold arrangements). This can result in earlier sales revenue recognition.\n\nFor regular fixed-price contracts, the customer pays a fixed amount using a payment plan. Depending on the ratio of the customer payments received to the claim to consideration acquired by KSB based on the transfer of goods and services to the customer, there is an advance or subsequent type of payment on the reporting date for the respective customer contract. Contract assets are reported reduced by advances received, if the amount of the goods and services provided by KSB exceed the payment amount. Payments received from the customer that exceed the amount of the goods and services provided by KSB for the respective customer contract result in the reporting of a contract liability.\n\n#### **Other income statement items**\n\nInterest income and expense are recognised in the period in which they occur. Dividend income from investments is collected when the legal entitlement to payment is created. Operating expenses are recognised when they are incurred or when the services are utilised. Income tax is calculated in accordance with the statutory tax rules in the countries in which the Group operates. Deferred taxes are accounted for on the basis of the enacted or substantively enacted income tax rates.\n\n#### **3. Significant judgements, estimates and assumptions**\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting policies to be applied. When implementing such accounting policies, estimates and assumptions affect the assets, liabilities, income and expenses recognised in the consolidated financial statements, and their presentation.\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\nrecognition of sales revenue.

At KSB, this typically applies in particular to standard products without any significant customer-specific characteristic in the Pumps and Valves segments. At the time of revenue recognition, receipt of the consideration must be probable and the amount of sales revenue must be reliably measurable. A reliable estimation of the associated costs and potential return of the goods must also be possible. The point in time at which KSB satisfies the performance obligations from contracts with customers subject to sales revenue recognition at a point in time is generally based on the agreed delivery terms and conditions (INCOTERMS). For certain deliveries and services, a declaration of acceptance by the customer is required for the These estimates and assumptions are based on past experience and a variety of other factors deemed appropriate under the circumstances. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates and assumptions. The estimates and assumptions made are constantly reviewed. If more recent information and additional knowledge are available, recognised amounts are adjusted to reflect the new circumstances. Any changes in estimates and assumptions that result in material differences are explained separately.\n\n#### **Recoverability of intangible assets, right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment**\n\nImpairment tests for goodwill, which are conducted at least once per year, require an estimate of the recoverable amounts for each cash-generating unit (CGU). These correspond to the higher amount from the fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The earnings forecast on the basis of these estimates are affected by various factors, which may include exchange rate fluctuations, progress in Group integration or the expectations for the economic development of these units. Although management believes that the assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount are appropriate, any unforeseen changes in these assumptions could lead to an impairment loss.\n\nEstimates and assumptions must also be made when testing the impairment of other intangible assets, the rights to use leased assets and property, plant and equipment. For each asset it must be verified to what extent there are indications of an impairment. When determining the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment, the estimation of the relevant useful life is subject to uncertainty.\n\n#### **Net realisable value of inventories**\n\n**19**\n\nDetermining the net realisable value of inventories requires, in particular, estimates of the further marketability of the inventory items and the future development of market prices on the sales markets of KSB in relation to the needed production costs. If the actual development in a later period differs from the original estimates, this may result in an additional impairment requirement for the inventory items or in the reversal of impairments.\n\n#### **Impairments on contract assets and trade receivables**\n\nContract assets and trade receivables are subject to the impairment rules of IFRS 9. The assessments that KSB makes regarding customers' solvency are of central importance here. Depending on the actual payment behaviour of customers, actual defaults on receivables may exceed the impairment losses recognised in previous periods, or impairments may be reversed.\n\n#### **Actuarial assumptions for the measurement of provisions for employee benefits**\n\nProvisions for employee benefits, in particular provisions for pensions and similar obligations, are determined according to actuarial principles. These are based on statistical and other factors so as to anticipate future events. Material factors are the reported market discount rates and life expectancy. The actuarial assumptions made may differ from actual developments as a result of changing market and economic conditions, and this can have material effects on the amount of provisions and thus on the company's overall net assets, financial position and results of operations. For the material pension plans of the German companies, every employee is entitled to apply at any time during the ongoing employment contract for payment in annual instalments, as a one-time payment or as a pension for life. KSB's estimate as to how the specific workforce is likely to decide on exercising the lumpsum option is reviewed on a regular basis and is reflected accordingly in the measurement of pension provisions.\n\n#### **Recognition and measurement of other provisions**\n\nProvisions are recognised for uncertain liabilities with a probability of occurrence of more than 50 %. The provision corresponds to the best estimate of the expenditure to fulfil the current obligation on the reporting date. The later, actual outflow can, however, differ from the estimate as a result of changed economic, political or legal conditions. This will be reflected in additional expenses or income from reversals.\n\n#### **Estimates in connection with the accounting treatment of income taxes**\n\nThe Group's global scope of activities must be taken into account in relation to taxes on income. Based on operative activities in numerous countries with varying tax laws and administrative interpretation, differentiated assessment is required for determining tax liabilities. Uncertainty may arise due to different interpretations by taxable entities on the one hand and local finance authorities on the other. Uncertain tax assets and liabilities are recognised if their probability of occurrence exceeds 50 %. The best estimate of the expected tax payment is used for reporting purposes; depending on the case in question this will take the form of the most probable result or of the expected value. Although KSB believes it has made a reasonable estimate regarding any tax uncertainties, it is possible that the actual tax obligation will differ from the original estimate.\n\nWith regard to future tax benefits, KSB assesses their realisability as at every reporting date. For this reason, deferred tax assets are only recognised if sufficient taxable income is available in future. In assessing this future taxable income within the planning horizon of three to five years it must be\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\n**21**\n\ntaken into account that expected future business developments are subject to uncertainties and are in some cases excluded from control by company management (for example changes to applicable tax legislation). If KSB comes to the conclusion that previously reported deferred tax assets cannot be realised because of changed assumptions, then the assets will be written down by the appropriate amount.\n\n#### **Sales revenue recognition over time**\n\nIf performance obligations meet the relevant criteria of IFRS 15, KSB recognises revenue from customer contracts over time in line with progress towards completion. The progress towards completion is determined according to the percentage of completion. This requires estimates regarding the total contract costs and revenue including the variable considerations of contract risks as well as other relevant factors. These estimates take into account the empirical values of KSB and are reviewed regularly by those with operative responsibility and adjusted where necessary.\n\n#### **Consideration of sustainability issues (ESG)**\n\nIn connection with the ESG sustainability issues – Environmental (E), Social (S) and corporate Governance (G) – estimates are required in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements with regard to the effects on the financial statements. ESG-related aspects did not have a material impact on KSB's net assets, financial position and results of operations in the reporting year. For further information in this context, please refer to the Group's opportunities and risks report as part of the combined management report.\n\n#### **Geopolitical and macroeconomic developments**\n\nThe business activities of the KSB Group take place in an increasingly complex and uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. In particular, the war in Ukraine, the conflicts in the Middle East and especially in the Gaza region, and the China-Taiwan conflict are global flashpoints of key importance for the global economy. The overall picture of the Group's economic environment is characterised by ongoing inflation, increased interest rates as well as volatile share prices and exchange rates. All of these uncertainties are fuelling concerns about a medium-term slowdown in global economic growth in key markets.\n\nThe geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties accompanying the above-mentioned aspects require a high degree of discretionary assessments and assumptions with regard to their future development and impact on the consolidated financial statements of KSB.

As in the previous year, there are no restrictions on ownership or use.\n\nThe increase of € 1,405 thousand in the acquisition costs for goodwill in the \"Other\" line results from the acquired goodwill as part of the acquisition of DAG - Dieselanlagen Service GmbH, Oberwaltersdorf (Austria).\n\n**21**\n\nKSB reported internally generated intangible assets of € 32,788 thousand (previous year: € 32,514 thousand). These are primarily attributable to the KSBase sales software.\n\nIn the reporting year, impairment losses on intangible assets amounting to € 786 thousand (previous year: € 1,715 thousand) were recognised, of which € 678 thousand related to goodwill (previous year: € 1,715 thousand). The impairment losses were recognised in the income statement under depreciation and amortisation expense. Further details on the goodwill impairments are provided in the following explanations on impairment testing under IAS 36.\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\n**23**\n\nAs in the previous year, no product-related development costs were capitalised in the reporting year because not all of the comprehensive recognition criteria defined in IAS 38 were met.\n\n#### **IMPAIRMENT TESTING UNDER IAS 36**\n\nThe date defined by KSB for the mandatory annual impairment testing for goodwill is 30 September of each year. The impairment testing methodology is explained in more detail in Section III. Accounting Policies in the \"Intangible assets\" subsection.\n\nIn the previous year, impairment testing was also carried out for goodwill as at 31 December 2022 to take account of identified indications for a possible impairment of assets as defined in IAS 36. The following information on the basic assumptions and parameters, the goodwill impairments and the sensitivity analyses therefore relates to the reporting year as at 30 September 2023 and to the previous year as at 31 December 2022.\n\n#### **Basic assumptions and parameters**\n\nThe carrying amounts of the cash-generating units in connection with the impairment testing of goodwill do not contain any items relating to income tax or financing activities.\n\nTo determine the discount factor, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) method is applied in conjunction with the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), taking into account a peer group. Under this method, first the cost of equity is determined using CAPM and the borrowing costs are defined, and then the individual capital components are weighted in accordance with the capital structure taking account of the peer group. The peer group information includes aspects like beta factors, capital structure data and borrowing costs. The peer group includes companies that are similar to the Group in terms of industry, size and activity. To account for changes in market parameters, the composition of the peer group is reviewed at regular intervals and adjusted if necessary (e.g. due to changes in the business model of either the cash-generating unit or the comparable company being looked at).\n\nThe interest rate for risk-free 30-year Bunds was used as a base rate. This rate was 2.7 % in the reporting year (previous year: 2.0 %). The market risk premium was set at 6.7 % (previous year: 7.2 %), with a beta factor of 1.25 (previous year: 1.22). In addition, country-specific tax rates and country risk premiums are taken into account individually for each cashgenerating unit (CGU). The growth rate for the cashgenerating units in the reporting year was generally set at 1.5 % (previous year: 0.5 %). The regular review of the peer group did not generate any new findings in relation to the business models of comparative companies. The peer group for examining the weighted capital cost factor therefore remained the same as in the previous year.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\ngroup.

Industries B.V., Alphen aan den Rijn, Netherlands, represents the only goodwill considered material from the Group's perspective, both in the reporting year and in the previous year, totalling € 18,285 thousand.\n\nIn addition, the carrying amount of the other goodwill of € 12,154 thousand is spread over a large number of the Group's cash-generating units. There are no other significant carrying amounts of individual goodwill in relation to the total carrying amount of the Group's goodwill.\n\nThe basic parameters for the impairment testing of material goodwill are summarised in the tables above.\n\nThe Group's material assumptions impacting cash flows from the multi-year financial plan on which the impairment test as at 30 September 2023 is based relate to the performance of order intake, sales revenue and earnings before finance income / expense and taxes (EBIT). For all three of the abovementioned key indicators, tangible growth was projected in all five years of the detailed planning period, both for the KSB SupremeServ operating segment and for the Standard Markets operating segment for new business with pumps of D.P. Industries B.V. The assessments take into account the company's own experience-based knowledge of competitors and markets as well as published economic data collected externally.\n\n#### **Impairment loss on goodwill**\n\nThe impairment losses on goodwill recognised in the reporting year are shown in the \"Impairment loss on goodwill in the 2023 financial year\" table. Impairment testing for goodwill in the previous year resulted in an impairment requirement of € 1,715 thousand.\n\n**Impairment of goodwill in the 2023 financial year** \n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management Re\n\n**25**\n\n#### **Sensitivity analyses**\n\nFor the cash-generating units in the form of the operating segments Standard Markets for new pump business and KSB SupremeServ of D.P. Industries B.V., with goodwill considered material from the Group's perspective, additional sensitivity analyses were performed based on the parameters as at 30 September 2023. As in the previous year, the following assumptions were made: a 15 % increase in the cost of capital (Sensitivity 1), a reduction in the growth rate to 0.0 % (Sensitivity 2) and a reduction in sales revenue of 10 % with the corresponding impact on expense items and performance indicators (Sensitivity 3).\n\nAs in the previous year, the sensitivity analyses did not reveal any impairment requirement in the reporting year.\n\n#### **2.

By introducing a separate item for all trade receivables from related parties, a clear distinction is now made from balances with third parties to increase transparency. The previous year's figure for trade receivables from third parties has been adjusted accordingly in this and the other relevant tables in this section. The change in presentation has no impact on the total value of trade receivables from related parties itemised for the previous year in Section IX. Other Disclosures.\n\nContract assets at the end of the reporting year totalled € 58,969 thousand (previous year: € 80,018 thousand). This decline is due to the fact that KSB's contract progress fell more sharply than the related advance payments received as at the reporting date. Impairment losses on contract assets amounted to € 1,599 thousand (previous year: € 1,609 thousand). Of the contract assets as at the reporting date, € 12,361 thousand (previous year: € 17,482 thousand) relate to project orders with customers whose completion is not expected until more than one year after the reporting date.\n\nImpairment losses of € 33,781 thousand (previous year: € 32,833 thousand) were recognised on trade receivables from third parties as at the reporting date.\n\nImpairment losses on trade receivables and contract assets include the individual impairment allowance (EWB) and risk provisions for expected credit losses (ECL).\n\n**Impairment losses on trade receivables from third parties** \n\n| € thousands                                                      | 31 Dec. 2023 | 31 Dec. 2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Gross carrying amount of trade<br>receivables from third parties | 539,576      | 562,989      |\n| of which unhedged receivables                                    | 373,723      | 404,621      |\n| of which hedged receivables                                      | 165,853      | 158,368      |\n| Individual impairment<br>allowance (EWB)                         | -29,713      | -29,380      |\n| Risk provisions for expected<br>credit losses (ECL)              | -4,068       | -3,453       |\n| of which ECL for<br>unhedged receivables                         | -3,347       | -2,855       |\n| of which ECL for<br>hedged receivables                           | -721         | -598         |\n| Net carrying amount of trade<br>receivables from third parties   | 505,795      | 530,156      |\n\n{133}------------------------------------------------\n\n**31**\n\n#### **Impairment losses on contract assets**\n\n|                              |         | 31 Dec. 2023 | 31 Dec. 2022 |\n|------------------------------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| Gross carrying amount        | € thou- |              |              |\n| of contract assets           | sands   | 60,568       | 81,627       |\n| Individual impairment        | € thou- |              |              |\n| allowance (EWB)              | sands   | -1,150       | -1,258       |\n| Risk provisions for expected | € thou- |              |              |\n| credit losses (ECL)          | sands   | -449         | -351         |\n| Net carrying amount          | € thou- |              |              |\n| of contract assets           | sands   | 58,969       | 80,018       |\n|                              |         |              |              |\n| Expected default risk        |         |              |              |\n| in relation to ECL           | in %    | 0.7          | 0.4          |\n\nImpairment losses of € 151 thousand (previous year: € 87 thousand) were recognised on trade receivables from related parties as at the reporting date.

This is the result of the relatively high recognition of individual impairments for the entirety of the far overdue open receivables items.\n\nOther receivables and other current assets include hedges of credit balances prescribed by law for partial retirement arrangements and long-term working time accounts of the German Group companies in the amount of € 15,810 thousand (previous year: € 13,103 thousand).\n\n€ 37,567 thousand (previous year: € 48,907 thousand) of total receivables and other assets are due after more than one year.\n\n#### **9. Cash and cash equivalents**\n\nCash and cash equivalents are term deposits with short maturities and call deposits, and also current account balances. Cash equivalents include short-term deposits with an original maturity of less than three months.\n\nIn the reporting year, as in the previous year, no material impairment losses were recognised on cash and cash equivalents as no significant default risks were identified.\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nCombined Management Repo\n\n**33**\n\n#### **10. Equity**\n\nThere was no change in the share capital of KSB SE & Co. KGaA as against the previous year. In accordance with the Articles of Association, it totals € 44,771,963.82 and, as in the previous year, is composed of 886,615 ordinary shares and 864,712 preference shares. Each no-par-value share represents an equal notional amount of the share capital. The preference shares carry separate cumulative preferred dividend rights and progressive additional dividend rights. All shares are no-parvalue bearer shares. The individual shares have no par value.\n\nThe capital reserve results from the appropriation of premiums from capital increases in previous years.\n\nIn addition to revenue reserves from previous years, the revenue reserves include currency translation adjustments, consolidation effects, remeasurements of defined benefit plans under IAS 19 and changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives taken directly to equity. These issues resulted in deferred tax assets in the amount of € 57,712 thousand (previous year: € 29,732 thousand) and deferred tax liabilities in the amount of € 793 thousand (previous year: € 856 thousand).\n\nIntercompany results from the transfer of assets within the Group are now eliminated on a pro rata basis in the noncontrolling interests, and no longer in full with an effect on the equity attributable to the shareholders of KSB SE & Co. KGaA. The adjustment resulted in a reclassification of € 3,022 thousand, taken directly to equity, from non-controlling interests to revenue reserves in the reporting year.\n\n#### **Development of currency translation differences in equity**\n\nThe development of the currency translation differences in equity is shown in the table of the same name below.\n\nA total of € 34,376 thousand (dividend of € 19.50 per ordinary share and € 19.76 per preference share) was paid from equity by resolution of the Annual General Meeting of the Group's parent company KSB SE & Co.

Provisions for pensions and similar obligations**\n\nThe pension obligations in the KSB Group include defined contribution and defined benefit plans and contain both obligations from current pensions and future pension benefit entitlements.\n\n#### **Defined contribution pension plans**\n\nTotal expenses for defined contribution pension plans in the reporting year amounted to € 62,327 thousand (previous year: € 52,816 thousand). Of this figure, € 27,884 thousand (previous year: € 27,714 thousand) resulted from contributions into the statutory pension insurance scheme in Germany.\n\n#### **Description of the defined benefit pension plans**\n\nThe obligations for defined benefit pension plans for employees of the Group are mainly due to pension obligations in Germany, as well as in France, the United States and Switzerland.\n\naccordance with HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch – German Comto the German Group companies. These relate to direct commitments by the companies to their employees. The commitments are based on salary and length of service. Contributions from employees themselves are also considered. This pension provision can be broken down into purely company-financed basic provision and the top-up provision from the employer. The latter is based on the amount of own contributions and the generated return on sales before taxes on income. Both components take account of the general pension contribution (the amount of which partially depends on company performance), personal income (the relationship between pensionable income and maximum income threshold) and the annuity conversion factor (based on age). Within the scope of the material pension plans of the German companies, every employee is entitled to apply at any time during the ongoing employment contract for payment in annual instalments, as a one-time payment or as a pension for life.\n\nPension schemes in France are governed by the provisions of the respective collective agreements. The obligations are basically covered by assets that have been paid in to an external fund. Upon retirement, the employees concerned receive a oneoff payment from the fund.\n\n**35**\n\nThe defined benefit pension plans in the United States are closed to new entrants. The pension benefit amount is derived from the average salary and years of service before closure of the plan. The retirement age is 65 years; from this point a monthly payment is made to the beneficiaries. The pension benefits are financed by external funds.\n\nThe obligations for defined benefit pension plans in Switzerland are based on occupational pensions in accordance More than 90 % of the defined benefit plans are attributable with the Bundesgesetz über die berufliche Alters-,\nHinterlassenen- und Invalidenvorsorge (BVG) [Swiss Federal Act on Occupational Retirement, Surviving Dependants', and Disability Pension Plans]. Every employee of a company with a total annual income above a certain minimum amount is insured in the employer's pension fund as a mandatory requirement. The occupational pension plan, as the second pillar of the Swiss pension system supplementing the state pension plan as the first pillar which is classified as a defined contribution plan, includes defined additional benefits in old age, in the event of disability or in the event of death with the aim of safeguarding the accustomed standard of living. Both employer and employee contributions are paid to finance this. If the pension fund has a shortfall, the employer is obliged to make up for it. The pension benefits after retirement are paid out as a monthly pension, as a one-off lump-sum payment or in the form of a combination of these, according to the choice of the employee.\n\nIn addition, employees in other countries are also entitled to a limited extent to retirement and partly to medical care benefits, depending mainly on the length of service and salary.\n\nThese defined benefit plans harbour actuarial risks, such as the longevity risk and interest rate risk. The payments associated with the pension obligations are mostly serviced through liquidity. Plan assets are also partially available for financing these obligations. Most of the plan assets are man-aged by insurers who set their own appropriate investment policies.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\n**37**\n\nThe actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligation (and the related current service cost and the past service cost) are measured and calculated annually on the basis of actuarial reports using the projected unit credit method (IAS 19). Plan assets are measured at fair value.\n\n#### **Explanation of the effects of the defined benefit pension plans on the balance sheet and income statement**\n\nThe regional allocation of the total defined benefit pension plans from the Group's point of view, as well as the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation, the fair value of plan assets and the net liability from defined benefit obligations, as consolidated for the Group, is presented in the following tables.\n\n- **Regional allocation of the defined benefit pension plans**\n- **Change in present value of

assumptions, sensitivities and other disclosures on defined benefit pension plans**\n\nAs in the previous year, measurement of the German pension plans is based on a mean fluctuation rate of 2.0 %. The biometric assumptions continue to be based on the 2018G mortality tables published by Prof. Dr. Klaus Heubeck. The retirement age used for the calculations is based on the Rentenversicherungs-Altersgrenzanpassungsgesetz 2007 [RVAGAnpG – German Act Adapting the Standard Retirement Age for the Statutory Pension Insurance System]. Other measurement parameters (e.g. cost trends in the medical care area) are not material.\n\nFor the material pension plans of the German companies, the regular assessment made by KSB regarding the exercising of the lump-sum option by employees led to an adjustment of the measurement assumptions compared with the previous year. Therefore, as at 31 December 2023, a payment in the form of a lifelong pension was assumed for 65 % (previous year: 45 %) of the specific workforce, a one-off payment for 30 % (previous year: 35 %) and payment in instalments over 10 years after termination of employment for 5 % (previous year: 20 %). The resulting actuarial losses had a negative effect of € 7,068 thousand on other comprehensive income in the reporting year.\n\nThe discount rate and future mortality were identified as key actuarial assumptions.\n\n#### **Discount rate**\n\n| %           | 31 Dec. 2023 | 31 Dec. 2022 |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Germany     | 3.2          | 3.7          |\n| France      | 3.2          | 3.8          |\n| USA         | 5.3          | 4.9          |\n| Switzerland | 2.0          | 1.8          |\n\nAs in the previous year the basis for the calculation of the sensitivities is the same method which was used for the calculation of the provisions for pensions and similar obligations. Were the discount factor to increase by 100 basis points, the DBO would fall by € 62,170 thousand (previous year: € 53,175 thousand). A 100 basis point reduction in the discount factor would increase the DBO by € 78,164 thousand (previous year: € 65,355 thousand). It should be noted that a change in the discount factor due to particular financial effects (such as compound interest) does not affect the development of the DBO on a straight-line basis. Were life expectancy to increase by 1 year, the DBO would increase by € 18,028 thousand (previous year: € 14,932 thousand). Additionally, the individual actuarial assumptions are mutually dependent, but these interdependencies are not taken into account in the sensitivity analysis.\n\nOn 31 December 2023 the weighted average term of the DBO was 14 years (previous year: 13 years).\n\nKSB's expected benefit payments from defined benefit pension plans over the next five years are shown in the table below.\n\n| € thousands at 31 Dec. 2023 | 2024   | 2025   | 2026   | 2027   | 2028   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Expected payments           | 23,894 | 26,901 | 28,235 | 28,625 | 30,626 |\n| € thousands at 31 Dec. 2022 | 2023   | 2024   | 2025   | 2026   | 2027   |\n| Expected payments           | 23,475 | 24,810 | 26,109 | 29,136 | 29,934 |\n\n#### **Expected pension benefit payments**\n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\n**41**\n\n#### **12.

This tax rate forms the base for deriving the actual tax rate for the Group.\n\n**Taxes on income in the income statement Taxes on income** \n\n| € thousands                                          | 2023    | 2022    |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Effective taxes                                      | 64,971  | 48,606  |\n| Deferred taxes                                       | −32,595 | −15,276 |\n|                                                      | 32,376  | 33,330  |\n| € thousands                                          | 2023    | 2022    |\n| Change in deferred tax assets                        | -56,966 | -2,455  |\n| Change in deferred tax liabilities                   | -2,153  | 2,833   |\n| Change in deferred taxes recognised in balance sheet | -59,119 | 378     |\n| Change in deferred taxes taken directly to equity    | 27,915  | -14,625 |\n| Changes in consolidated Group / CTA * / Other        | -1,391  | -1,029  |\n| Deferred taxes recognised in income statement        | -32,595 | -15,276 |\n\nEffective taxes include prior-period tax refunds in the amount of € 1,369 thousand (previous year: € 2,090 thousand) and tax arrears in the amount of € 933 thousand (previous year: € 386 thousand).

They are reported under deferred taxes for other liabilities (non-current and current).\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\n**49**\n\n**Further information and explanations on taxes on income**  Contingent liabilities from income tax issues amount to € 1,068 thousand (previous year: € 215 thousand). There are currently no indications that the utilisation of these obligations is likely.\n\nAs far as net income from affiliates and other equity investments is concerned, withholding taxes incurred in connection with distributions and German taxes incurred are recognised as deferred taxes if these gains are expected to be subject to corresponding taxation, or there is no intention of reinvesting them in the long term. No deferred tax liabilities were recognised for taxable temporary differences of € 6,139 thousand (previous year: € 6,297 thousand) in relation to affiliates and associates as it is unlikely that these temporary differences will be reversed in the foreseeable future.\n\nNo deferred tax assets were recognised for corporate tax loss carryforwards amounting to € 17,219 thousand (previous year: € 104,619 thousand) and for trade tax loss carryforwards amounting to € 2,942 thousand (previous year: € 64,917 thousand), due to the recognition criteria of IAS 12, especially in the case where there is a history of losses. The loss carryforwards are largely available for an indefinite period. The income resulting from the use of loss carryforwards for which no deferred tax assets had been recognised so far was € 4,714 thousand (previous year: € 6,033 thousand).\n\nDeductible temporary differences for which no deferred tax assets had to be set up amounted to € 4,663 thousand (previous year: € 107,236 thousand).\n\nKSB considers the existing deferred tax assets in the tax group of KSB SE & Co. KGaA from loss carryforwards and from taxable temporary differences to be fully recoverable. The basis for this assessment is, firstly, the elimination of the loss history for KSB SE & Co. KGaA's tax group. Secondly, KSB expects positive taxable income for KSB SE & Co. KGaA's tax group in the coming years. The reversal of impairment losses recognised in the previous year results in deferred tax income of € 32,532 thousand in the income statement and € 15,261 thousand in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group falls within the scope of the OECD Pillar Two model rules. The Pillar Two legislation was adopted in Germany and has been applicable since 1 January 2024. As the Pillar Two legislation had not yet been finalised as at the reporting date, the Group is not subject to any taxation in this respect for the 2023 financial year. The Group makes use of the exemption from recognising deferred taxes in connection with Pillar Two income taxes, which was the subject of the amendments to IAS 12 published in May 2023. Overall, the Group does not expect the first-time application of the Pillar Two rules in 2024 to have any material impact on its net assets, financial position and results of operations. The Group is currently working with external tax specialists to support the application and implementation of the Pillar Two legislation.\n\n#### **21. Earnings after income tax – Non-controlling interests**\n\nThe net profit attributable to non-controlling interests amounts to € 25,940 thousand (previous year: € 25,244 thousand) and the net loss attributable to non-controlling interests amounts to € 1,622 thousand (previous year: € 1,555 thousand).

Financial risks**\n\nKSB is exposed to certain financial risks as a consequence of its business activities. These risks can be classified into three areas:\n\nKSB is firstly exposed to credit risk. Credit risk is defined as the potential default or delays in the receipt of contractually agreed payments. KSB is also exposed to liquidity risk which is the risk that an entity will be unable to meet its financial obligations, or will be unable to meet them in full. In addition, KSB is exposed to market price risk. The risk of exchange rate or interest rate changes may adversely affect the economic position of the Group. Risks from fluctuations in the prices of financial instruments are not material for KSB.\n\nKSB limits all these risks through an appropriate risk management system, defining how these risks are addressed through guidelines and work instructions. Furthermore, KSB continuously monitors the current risk characteristics and regularly provides the information obtained to the Managing Directors and the Supervisory Board in the form of standardised reports and individual analyses.\n\nThe three risk areas are described in detail in the following. Additional information is also provided in the group management report, in particular in the Economic Review, Report on Expected Developments, Opportunities and Risks Report sections.\n\n#### **Credit risk**\n\nThe primary credit risk is that there is a delay in settling a receivable, or that it is not settled either in full or in part. KSB minimises this risk using a variety of measures. As a matter of principle, KSB runs credit checks on potential and existing counterparties. KSB only enters into business relationships if the results of these checks are positive. Additionally, European companies in particular take out trade credit insurance policies. In exceptional cases KSB accepts other securities (collateral) such as guarantees. The insurance policies primarily cover the risk of loss of receivables. Moreover, cover is also taken out against political and commercial risks in the case of specific customers in selected countries. For both types of insurance, KSB has agreed deductibles, which represent significantly less than 50 % of the insured volume. The total amount of unhedged trade receivables as at the reporting date is shown under Notes No. 8 \"Contract assets, trade receivables and other financial and non-financial assets\". As part of receivables management, KSB continuously monitors out-standing items, performs maturity analyses and establishes contact with customers at an early stage if delays in payment occur. In the case of major projects, the terms and conditions provide for prepayments, guarantees and – for export transactions – letters of credit. These also mitigate risk. KSB recognises impairment losses for the residual risk remaining in trade receivables. It regularly examines the extent to which individual receivables need to be written down for impairment. Indications of this are significant financial difficulties of the debtor, such as insolvency or bankruptcy. Receivables are derecognised when it is reasonably certain that payment cannot be expected.\n\nThe maximum default risk, excluding collateral received, corresponds to the carrying amount of the financial assets.\n\nThere is no concentration of risk because the diversity of KSB's business means that it supplies a considerable number of customers in different sectors.\n\n#### **Liquidity risk**\n\nLiquidity management ensures that the liquidity risk is minimised in the Group and that solvency is ensured at all times. There are no concentrations of risk because KSB works with a number of credit institutions, on which strict creditworthiness requirements are imposed.\n\nKSB generates its financial resources primarily from its operating business. These are used to finance investments in non-current assets. The Group also uses them to cover working capital requirements. KSB monitors changes in inventories, contract assets, trade receivables, trade payables and contract liabilities regularly using a standardised Group reporting system.\n\nThe reporting system additionally ensures, with the help of monthly rolling cash flow planning, that the Group's central financial management is continuously informed about liquidity surpluses and requirements. This enables KSB to optimally meet the needs of the Group as a whole and of the individual companies. In order to be able to provide the necessary collateral in the project business, KSB makes corresponding guarantee volumes available.\n\nIn addition, it is always ensured that free credit facilities are sufficient; KSB identifies the need for these on the basis of regular liquidity planning. This way, it can respond at any time to fluctuating liquidity requirements. The available cash loans and credit lines total € 1,077.9 million (previous year: € 1,086.4 million). The utilisation of cash loans and credit lines by the Group was as follows at the end of the reporting year:\n\n| € thousands / Type of line | Maximum<br>amount of line | Utilisation as at<br>31 Dec.2023 |\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Loans                      | 420.1                     | 10.5                             |\n| Sureties                   | 657.8                     | 212.6                            |\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\nrecognises impairment losses for the residual risk remaining in trade receivables.

The credit line from the syndicated loan agreement comes to € 350.0 million. Following the utilisation of renewal options by KSB in previous years, the cash loan and credit line now has a fixed term until the end of 2025.\n\nThe following tables show the contractually agreed nondiscounted future cash flows of the financial liabilities (primary financial instruments) and derivative financial instruments. Interest payments on fixed-rate liabilities are determined on the basis of the fixed rate. Floating-rate interest payments are based on the last floating interest rates fixed before 31 December. Projections for future new liabilities are not included in the presentation. Based on the current state of knowledge, it is neither expected that the cash flows will take place significantly earlier, nor that the amounts will differ significantly.\n\n#### **Cash flows of financial liabilities 2023**\n\n| € thousands                               | Total   | Up to 1 year | 1 − 5 years | > 5 years |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|--------------|-------------|-----------|\n| Financial liabilities                     | 57,097  | 27,581       | 26,151      | 3,365     |\n| of which from lease obligations           | 46,094  | 16,971       | 25,830      | 3,293     |\n| Trade payables                            | 324,723 | 324,723      | –           | –         |\n| Miscellaneous other financial liabilities | 25,355  | 25,230       | 125         | –         |\n| Derivative financial instruments (net)    | 2,304   | 2,202        | 102         | –         |\n|                                           | 409,479 | 379,736      | 26,378      | 3,365     |\n\n#### **Cash flows of financial liabilities 2022**\n\n**53**\n\n**Utilisation as at 31 Dec.2023** \n\n| € thousands                               | Total   | Up to 1 year | 1 - 5 years | > 5 years |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|--------------|-------------|-----------|\n| Financial liabilities                     | 54,703  | 28,628       | 21,883      | 4,192     |\n| of which from lease obligations           | 40,453  | 15,300       | 21,034      | 4,119     |\n| Trade payables                            | 333,361 | 333,361      | -           | -         |\n| Miscellaneous other financial liabilities | 21,599  | 21,407       | 192         | -         |\n| Derivative financial instruments (net)    | 2,322   | 2,067        | 255         | -         |\n|                                           | 411,985 | 385,463      | 22,330      | 4,192     |\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\n**55**\n\n#### **Market price risk**\n\nGlobal business activities expose KSB primarily to currency and interest rate risk.

To avoid the negative effects of interest rate fluctuations on the international capital markets, KSB concludes interest rate hedges (interest rate swaps) where necessary, generally for long-term loans. These are used exclusively to hedge floating rate loans against rising interest rates. In the reporting year, as in the previous year, there were no such transactions or other interest rate derivatives in the portfolio.\n\nAs part of the interest rate sensitivity analysis shown in the table below, KSB simulates a 100 basis point increase (decrease) in market interest rates and analyses the impact on the floating rate financial instruments.\n\n#### **Interest rate sensitivity**\n\n**55**\n\n|                       | 31 Dec. 2023       |                    | 31 Dec. 2022       |                    |\n|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| € millions            | + 100 basis points | - 100 basis points | + 100 basis points | - 100 basis points |\n| Consolidated earnings | 3.7                | -3.7               | 2.6                | -2.6               |\n\n{159}------------------------------------------------\n\n**57**\n\n#### **3. Hedge accounting**\n\nKSB uses micro hedges (hedging individual transactions) and macro hedges (hedging an overall risk portfolio) to hedge currency risk from transactions already recognised in the balance sheet as well as transactions that are expected in the future with a high degree of probability. The hedging instruments used share the essential terms and conditions with the underlying transactions, i.e. with regard to amount, term and quality. The maturities of the currency derivatives used are, as in the previous year, mostly between one and two years. Internal guidelines govern the use of financial instruments. Such transactions are also subject to ongoing risk control measures.\n\nThe effectiveness of hedges is determined at the beginning of the hedge and through regular prospective assessment. The aim is to ensure that there is a financial relationship between the hedge underlying and hedging instrument. The hedging instruments used are exclusively currency forwards entered into with prime-rated banks. To hedge forward exchange transactions, the Group takes out hedges where the contractual modalities of the hedging instrument essentially match those of the hedged underlying. The hedge ratio for hedges is 1:1, i.e. the volume of hedge transactions matches the designated underlyings.\n\nIn order to measure the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of hedges, KSB compares the fair value of the underlying and the hedge transactions. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives are almost completely offset by changes in the fair value of the cash flows from the underlyings (dollar offset method). The changes in the fair value of the underlyings and hedges in the financial year therefore match the unrealised profits and losses recorded under equity. As a rule, KSB does not hedge currency risks from the translation of foreign operations into the Group currency (€). Ineffectiveness can arise from hedging currency risk if the material measurement parameters of the underlying and hedge no longer match. There was no material ineffectiveness in the KSB Group in respect of currency hedges in the 2023 and 2022 financial years.\n\nAt the reporting date, the notional volume of the currency forwards designated as hedges was € 215,935 thousand (previous year: € 188,568 thousand). In addition to the US dollar, the hedged currency risk relates to a number of other currencies to a lesser extent. The weighted average EUR / USD exchange rate for hedging instruments denominated in US dollars was 1.11 (previous year: 1.07) as at the balance sheet date. The contractual maturities of payments for these currency forwards are as follows:\n\n#### **Notional volumes in 2023**\n\n| € thousands                            | Total   | Up to 1 year | 1 – 5 years | > 5 years |\n|----------------------------------------|---------|--------------|-------------|-----------|\n| Currency forwards designated as hedges | 215,935 | 204,144      | 11,791      | –         |\n| Notional volumes in 2022               |         |              |             |           |\n| € thousands                            | Total   | Up to 1 year | 1 – 5 years | > 5 years |\n| Currency forwards designated as hedges | 188,568 | 155,225      | 32,962      | 381       |\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn order to measure the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of hedges, KSB compares the fair value of the underlying and the hedge transactions.

In the reporting year,\n\nthe realisation of the underlying recognised in income includes amounts of € 62 thousand (previous year: € 29 thousand) resulting from hedging transactions in which the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur.\n\n#### **Fair value changes in derivatives in 2023**\n\n|                                                | OCI                                      |                                                  |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| € thousands                                    | Cash flow<br>hedges –<br>Hedging reserve | Cash flow<br>hedges –<br>Hedging cost<br>reserve |\n| Currency risk                                  |                                          |                                                  |\n| Opening balance at 1 January                   | 1,560                                    | −1,012                                           |\n| Effective portion of changes in fair value     | −832                                     | 2,191                                            |\n| Realisation of underlying recognised in income | −429                                     | −1,389                                           |\n| Closing balance at 31 December                 | 299                                      | −210                                             |\n\n#### **Fair value changes in derivatives in 2022**\n\n**57**\n\n|                                                | OCI                                |                                         |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| € thousands                                    | Cash flow hedges – Hedging reserve | Cash flow hedges – Hedging cost reserve |\n| Currency risk                                  |                                    |                                         |\n| Opening balance at 1 January                   | −5,988                             | 3,213                                   |\n| Effective portion of changes in fair value     | 36,961                             | −22,542                                 |\n| Realisation of underlying recognised in income | −29,413                            | 18,317                                  |\n| Closing balance at 31 December                 | 1,560                              | −1,012                                  |\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\n**59**\n\n#### **VII. STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS**\n\nThe cash flow statement shows how the Group's cash and cash equivalents reported in the balance sheet changed during the reporting year as a result of cash inflows and outflows. In accordance with the requirements of IAS 7, a distinction is made between cash flows from operating activities and from investing and financing activities. The exact composition of these individual components can be seen in the individual items listed in the cash flow statement.\n\nNon-cash effects from currency translation and from changes in the consolidated Group are eliminated in the respective items. Consequently, the cash flows from changes in balance sheet items shown in the cash flow statement cannot be reconciled with the corresponding movements in the Group's balance sheet.\n\nCash flows reported by Group companies in foreign currencies are translated into euros at average exchange rates for the year, while cash and cash equivalents are translated at the closing rate.\n\nThe effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents, as well as the effect of changes in the consolidated Group, are shown in a separate item in the cash flow statement.\n\nThe cash flow from investing activities includes the cash effects from additions and disposals of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. The total additions and disposals in the reporting year are provided in the explanatory notes to the balance sheet items in these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe change in financial liabilities over the year, including the cash-effective portion of this change, which is included in the cash flows from financing activities, is presented in the tables below.\n\nAs in the previous year, the cash and cash equivalents reported as at the reporting date are not subject to any significant restrictions on disposal by KSB.\n\n#### **Change in financial liabilities in 2023**\n\n| € thousands                                                     | 1 Jan. 2023 | Cash-effective in cash flows from financing activities | Additions / Disposals / Acquisitions / Other | Exchange-rate-related changes | 31 Dec. 2023 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|\n| Non-current financial liabilities (excluding lease liabilities) | 1,213       | -865                                                   | 612                                          | -170                          | 790          |\n| Current financial liabilities (excluding lease liabilities)     | 13,103      | -2,835                                                 | 1,933                                        | -2,001                        | 10,200       |\n| Lease liabilities                                               | 36,430      | -19,100                                                | 27,237                                       | -545                          | 44,022       |\n| Total financial liabilities                                     | 50,746      | -22,801                                                | 29,782                                       | -2,717                        | 55,011       |\n\n#### **Change in financial liabilities in 2022**\n\n|                                                                 |             | Non-cash changes                                                |                                                       |                                   |              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|\n| € thousands                                                     | 1 Jan. 2022 | Cash-effective<br>in cash flows<br>from financing<br>activities | Additions /<br>Disposals /<br>Acquisitions /<br>Other | Exchange-rate-<br>related changes | 31 Dec. 2022 |\n| Non-current financial liabilities (excluding lease liabilities) | 2,574       | −1,996                                                          | 226                                                   | 410                               | 1,213        |\n| Current financial liabilities (excluding lease liabilities)     | 37,386      | −26,048                                                         | 2,996                                                 | −1,231                            | 13,103       |\n| Lease liabilities                                               | 39,006      | −17,764                                                         | 15,080                                                | 108                               | 36,430       |\n| Total financial liabilities                                     | 78,966      | −45,808                                                         | 18,302                                                | −713                              | 50,746       |\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents, as well as the effect of changes in the consolidated Group, are shown in a separate item in the cash flow\n\nThe cash flow from investing activities includes the cash effects from additions and disposals of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.

SEGMENT REPORTING**\n\nSegment reporting is prepared in accordance with IFRS 8 based on the management approach and corresponds to the internal organisational and management structure as well as the reporting lines to the Managing Directors as the chief operating decision-makers.\n\nKSB takes management decisions on the basis of the key performance indicators – order intake, external sales revenue and earnings before finance income / expense and taxes (EBIT) – determined for the Pumps, Valves and KSB SupremeServ reporting segments (hereinafter also referred to as \"Segments\"). Reporting the relevant assets, number of employees and inter-segment sales revenue of the Segments is not part of internal reporting.\n\nBased on comprehensive consideration, the reporting segments were aligned with the Group's products and services. For the derivation of the Pumps Segment, the underlying differentiation of individual Market Areas must also be taken into account, as described below.\n\nThe Pumps Segment comprises new business with single-stage and multistage pumps, submersible pumps and the associated control and drive systems. The applications are assigned to the Market Areas of Energy and Mining and to the Market Areas of Water, Building Services, Petrochemicals / Chemicals and General Industry, which are grouped together in the organisational and reporting structure of the Group as Standard Markets. Each customer is assigned by the Group to a specific Market Area according to their main business activity. The allocation of transactions with customers to the Market Areas follows this clear assignment of customers by KSB, irrespective of the specific product underlying the transaction.\n\nFor the new business with pumps, the Energy, Mining and Standard Markets are derived from the organisational and reporting structure of the Group as operating segments as defined by IFRS 8. These segments share the characteristic that they are based on a common product group, i.e. pumps. Furthermore, it follows from the customer-related delineation of the Market Areas described above that these operating segments are not based on a classification according to specific products and services, taking into account technological and economic characteristics, such as production processes or sales methods. According to KSB's estimates and expectations, the three pumps operating segments have similar long-term earnings trends and may also involve fundamentally comparable risks. As a result, the operating segments considered here are aggregated into the Pumps reporting segment pursuant to IFRS 8 in view of the close technological\n\n**59**\n\nand economic interrelationships from the Group's point of view.\n\nThe Valves Segment combines the Group's business activities with regard to new business in butterfly valves, globe valves, gate valves, control valves, diaphragm valves and ball valves. as well as associated actuators and control systems. The basic applications for these products are identical to those for pumps. However, in contrast to the Pumps Segment, the Valves Segment is not divided into individual Market Areas for the central management of the Group.\n\nThe KSB SupremeServ Segment on the one hand comprises the spare parts business for pumps and valves. On the other hand, KSB's service activities are allocated to this Segment. These include the installation, commissioning, start-up, inspection, servicing, maintenance and repair of pumps, related systems and valves, as well as modular service concepts and system analyses for complete plants.\n\nThe amounts disclosed for the individual segments have been established in compliance with the accounting policies of the present consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe order intake by segment presents order intake generated with third parties.\n\nThe sales revenue by segment presents sales revenue generated with third parties.\n\nThe \"Segment reporting\" table shows earnings before finance income / expense and income tax (EBIT) including noncontrolling interests.\n\nEBIT includes depreciation and amortisation of € 40,994 thousand (previous year: € 42,705 thousand) for the Pumps Segment, € 11,353 thousand (previous year: € 11,592 thousand) for the Valves Segment and € 35,747 thousand (previous year: € 36,122 thousand) for the KSB SupremeServ Segment.\n\nThe total depreciation and amortisation included impairment losses on intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and rights of use to leased assets in the amount of € 2,476 thousand (previous year: € 5,594 thousand). Of these impairments, € 1,472 thousand (previous year: € 2,712 thousand) relate to the Pumps Segment, € 1,004 thousand (previous year: € 2,447 thousand) to the KSB SupremeServ Segment and € 435 thousand in the previous year to the Valves Segment. In addition, the write-downs for the reporting year include reversals of impairments on property, plant and\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\n**61**\n\nequipment in the amount of € 2,194 thousand. These were attributable to the Pumps Segment in the amount of € 1,811 thousand, the Valves Segment in the amount of € 300 thousand and the KSB SupremeServ Segment in the amount of € 83 thousand.\n\n€ 641,992 thousand (previous year: € 560,517 thousand) of the sales revenue presented were generated by the companies based in Germany, € 215,770 thousand (previous year: € 215,103 thousand) by companies in China, € 200,211 thousand (previous year: € 180,404 thousand) by companies in France, € 238,773 thousand (previous year: € 238,973 thousand) by companies in the USA, € 249.847 thousand (previous year: € 218,850 thousand) by companies in India and € 1,272,395 thousand (previous year: € 1,159,540 thousand) by the other Group companies.\n\nThere were no relationships with individual customers that accounted for a material proportion of Group sales revenue.\n\nAt the reporting date, the total non-current assets of the KSB Group under review for the purposes of segment reporting amounted to € 749,300 thousand (year-end figure in previous year: € 712,238 thousand), with € 285,090 thousand (yearend figure in previous year: € 256,585 thousand) being attributable to the companies based in Germany and € 464,210 thousand (year-end figure in previous year: € 455,653 thousand) being attributable to the other Group companies.

OTHER DISCLOSURES**\n\n#### **Capital disclosures**\n\nSufficient financial independence is a key requirement for safeguarding KSB's continued existence in the long term. Obtaining the necessary funds for ongoing business operations is also extremely important for KSB. KSB regularly monitors the development of the net financial position that is derived from the balance of interest-bearing financial liabilities and financial assets (mainly cash and cash equivalents as well as receivables from deposits). One objective is to avoid net debt. The net financial position at the end of the reporting year was € 324.9 million (previous year: € 225.6 million). This rise is essentially due to the marked increase in cash flows from operating activities.\n\n#### **Contingent liabilities**\n\nContingent liabilities to third parties and other investments are as follows at the reporting date:\n\n#### **Contingent liabilities**\n\n| € thousands                       | 31 Dec. 2023 | 31 Dec. 2022 |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| From legal disputes               | 2,264        | 3,090        |\n| from guarantees                   | 2,055        | 2,000        |\n| From warranty agreements          | 1,755        | 5,109        |\n| From other tax matters            | 13,432       | 13,207       |\n| From other contingent liabilities | 503          | 3,177        |\n|                                   | 20,009       | 26,583       |\n\nIn the context of establishing the contingent liabilities, estimates are required in particular with regard to the existence of any obligations and in relation to the probability and amount of an outflow of resources.\n\nAt present, KSB does not expect a payment obligation for the total of contingent liabilities listed in the table of that name.\n\nIn addition, the KSB Group has contingent liabilities towards associates and joint ventures of € 7,163 thousand (previous year: € 7,311 thousand). The extent to which these will result in a cash outflow depends on the future business performance of the respective company.\n\nAs at the reporting date of the reporting year, there are no material contingent receivables of the Group, as in the previous year.\n\n#### **Other financial obligations**\n\n**61**\n\nAs in the previous year, there are no purchase price obligations from acquisitions of companies and no payment obligations from capitalisation measures at Group companies.\n\nThe aggregate purchase obligation for investments amounts to € 27,852 thousand (previous year: € 27,273 thousand). Of this amount, € 1,052 thousand (previous year: € 2,717 thousand) is attributable to intangible assets and € 26,800 thousand (previous year: € 24,556 thousand) to property, plant and equipment. Most of the corresponding payments are due in 2024.\n\n#### **Leases**\n\n#### **KSB as lessee**\n\nLease agreements in which KSB is the lessee mainly relate to real estate and motor vehicles. The terms of leases and additional cancellation and renewal options for one or both contracting parties are agreed individually and at different conditions.\n\nThe total cash outflow from leases, in the form of the repayment of lease liabilities, payments for leases relating to low-value assets and for short-term leases as well as variable lease payments, totalled € 29,060 thousand in the reporting year (previous year: € 26,697 thousand).\n\nThe Group expects future payments of € 5,328 thousand (previous year: € 5,967 thousand) from leases already concluded where the leased asset had not yet been made available to KSB by the lessor for use at the reporting date.\n\n#### **KSB as lessor**\n\nKSB acts as a lessor to a small extent, including in the context of real estate leasing. These activities have no material impact on the consolidated financial statements, so no further disclosures are made in this context.\n\n#### **Research and development costs**\n\nResearch and development costs in the reporting year amounted to € 60,577 thousand (previous year: € 56,307 thousand).\n\n#### **Related party disclosures**\n\nRelated parties are legal entities or natural persons that have influence over the KSB Group or are subject to control, joint control or significant influence by the KSB Group.\n\nIn order to determine the entirety of related parties of the Group, the organisational and shareholding structure of KSB SE & Co. KGaA must be taken into account. Johannes und Jacob Klein GmbH, Frankenthal / Pfalz, holds an unchanged voting interest of 83.94 % in KSB SE & Co. KGaA. The voting rights in this company are held, again unchanged, by KSB Stiftung, Stuttgart, with 74.93 %, and by Kühborth-Stiftung GmbH, Stuttgart, with 25.07 %.\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\n**63**\n\nTransactions with related parties are performed at arm's length and are described in more detail below.\n\n#### **Related parties (entities)**\n\nIn view of the above explanations, related parties of the KSB Group are, on the one hand, KSB Stiftung, Stuttgart, and Kühborth Stiftung GmbH, Stuttgart, each with their direct and indirect interests, joint ventures and associates. This includes Klein, Schanzlin & Becker GmbH, Frankenthal / Pfalz, which in turn holds 100 % of the voting rights in KSB Management SE, Frankenthal / Pfalz.

At the reporting date, impairments of € 151 thousand (previous year: € 87 thousand) were recognised on the presented receivables from companies not consolidated due to immateriality.\n\nAs the legal representative, KSB Management SE provides management services for KSB. The management fee is charged on to KSB SE & Co. KGaA. In addition, KSB Management SE as general partner assumes liability for KSB and receives annual remuneration for this amounting to 4 % of its share capital. Accordingly, € 6,554 thousand (previous year: € 5,964 thousand) of the purchases of assets and services from KSB Management SE relate firstly to the remuneration of the members of the governing bodies of KSB Management SE, which is explained in more detail under the \"Related parties (persons)\" sub-section below. Secondly, they include the liability remuneration in the amount of € 20 thousand (previous year: € 20 thousand) and a further reimbursement of expenses in connection with the management of the Group's business in the amount of € 137 thousand (previous year: € 194 thousand). The liabilities to KSB Management SE are due in the short term.\n\nRelations covering the supply of products and services in relation with Johannes und Jacob Klein GmbH were of minor scope in the reporting year as in the previous year. In addition, Johannes und Jacob Klein GmbH received dividend payments.\n\nTransactions with subsidiaries of Johannes und Jacob Klein GmbH comprise transactions with Palatina Versicherungsservice GmbH, Abacus alpha GmbH, Abacus Resale GmbH, Abacus Experten GmbH, Salinnova GmbH and airinotec GmbH).

Further information is provided below, in these consolidated financial statements, before the comments concerning the proposal on the appropriation of the net retained earnings of KSB SE & Co. KGaA.\n\nIn the reporting year, two members of the Administrative Board and one member of the Supervisory Board held an immaterial share of interests in KSB SE & Co. KGaA.\n\nThe remuneration paid to key management personnel of the Group, i.e. the Managing Directors and the members of the Administrative Board of KSB Management SE, is listed in the following table. The amounts are paid by KSB under an expense reimbursement agreement.\n\n#### **Management remuneration**\n\n| € thousands              | 2023  | 2022  |\n|--------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Short-term benefits      | 4,594 | 3,729 |\n| Post-employment benefits | 1,439 | 1,602 |\n| Other long-term benefits | 521   | 633   |\n| Total                    | 6,554 | 5,964 |\n\nThe remuneration system for the Managing Directors of KSB Management SE consists of components that are not performance-related, in the form of fixed sum plus benefits and pension commitments, as well as short-term and long-term variable remuneration components. In this context, 60 % of the regular annual salary, i.e. the sum of fixed and variable remuneration, is accounted for by the fixed component. The variable remuneration accounts for 40 % of the regular annual salary, with about two thirds of this being allocated to the long-term variable remuneration. The majority of the variable remuneration is thus linked to the long-term performance of the company.\n\nThe short-term variable remuneration with an assessment period of one year is designed as a target bonus model and is awarded annually. The target amount, i.e. the amount paid out if 100 % of the target is achieved, corresponds to 15 % of the respective regular annual salary. The Administrative Board of KSB Management SE has set the performance targets of EBIT\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\nmargin, sales revenue and the overall assessment of the personal performance of the Managing Directors in equal parts as the basis for assessment.\n\nThe long-term variable remuneration is structured as an annually granted plan with a three-year, forward-looking assessment period. The target amount corresponds to 25 % of the respective regular annual salary. The Administrative Board has defined the performance target as the equally weighted average of the earnings per share (EPS) over three years with a weighting of 80 % and the achievement of the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) sustainability goals with a weighting of 20 %. By considering earnings per share, a focus is placed on the long-term successful performance of the company as well as linking the interests of the Managing Directors with the interests of the shareholders.\n\nThe final payment of the long-term variable remuneration is made after the end of the assessment period. For the 2021 and 2022 financial years, a one-time payment on account amounting to 40 % of the target value in the event of 100 % target achievement was agreed and paid. At the end of the assessment period, it will be offset against any amount paid out in excess of this; no repayment has been agreed in the event that the sum falls short of this amount.\n\nAs at the reporting date, the Group recognised provisions for pension obligations to current Managing Directors of KSB Management SE amounting to € 644 thousand (previous year: € 578 thousand), and to former members of the Board of Management of KSB AG (excluding the Managing Directors of KSB Management SE) and their surviving dependants amounting to € 32,084 thousand (previous year: € 33,070 thousand). The total remuneration of the latter persons amounted to € 2,761 thousand in the past financial year (previous year: € 2,380 thousand).\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board receive a fixed remuneration, attendance fees and reimbursement of expenses. In addition, they receive remuneration for activities that require them to devote special time to the tasks of the Supervisory Board that go beyond preparing and holding meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees. The short-term benefits paid to members of the Supervisory Board amount to € 851 thousand for the 2023 financial year (previous year: € 894 thousand). At the end of the financial year, liabilities of € 472 thousand (previous year: € 513 thousand) were recognised towards the members of the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn addition, assets and services amounting to € 20 thousand (previous year: € 21 thousand) were sold to other related parties (corporate bodies) in the reporting year.\n\n#### **Auditors**\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, based in Frankfurt am Main with an office in Mannheim, were appointed as auditors and group auditors for the 2023 financial year at the Annual General Meeting of KSB SE & Co. KGaA on 4 May 2023.\n\nThe following table shows the total fees for all services that KSB utilised in the reporting year from the global PwC network, to which the group auditors belong. It also shows the specific share of the total amount attributable to the Group auditors based in Germany.\n\n| Total fees PricewaterhouseCoopers / Group auditors in 2023 |                       |                                                                                                   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| € thousands                                                | Global<br>PwC network | Attributable to:<br>Pricewaterhouse<br>-Coopers GmbH<br>Wirtschafts-<br>prüfungs-<br>gesellschaft |\n| Audit fees                                                 | 2,361                 | 886                                                                                               |\n| Tax advisory services                                      | 40                    | –                                                                                                 |\n| Other certification services                               | 98                    | 76                                                                                                |\n| Other services                                             | 139                   | 104                                                                                               |\n|                                                            | 2,638                 | 1,066                                                                                             |\n\nThe audit fees include costs for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the statutory annual financial statements of KSB SE & Co.

KGaA, Frankenthal, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2023, and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting policy information. In addition, we have audited the group management report of KSB SE & Co. KGaA, which is combined with the Company's management report, for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of the section \"Description of Key Features of the Internal Control System, the Risk Management System and the Compliance Management System in Accordance with the A.5 DCGK 2022 Recommendation\" of the group management report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § [Article] 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and\n- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the group management report does not cover the content of the section referred to above.\n\nPursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n#### **BASIS FOR THE AUDIT OPINIONS**\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") in compliance with German Generally Accepted \n\n{183}------------------------------------------------\n\nStandards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\n#### **KEY AUDIT MATTERS IN THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows:\n\n- <sup>1</sup> Recoverability of goodwill\n- **<sup>2</sup>** Accounting treatment of project orders recognized over time\n\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows:\n\n- **<sup>1</sup>** Matter and issue\n- <sup>2</sup> Audit approach and findings\n- **<sup>3</sup>** Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter we present the key audit matters:\n\n#### **<sup>1</sup> Recoverability of goodwill**\n\n**<sup>1</sup>** In the Company's consolidated financial statements goodwill amounting in total to EUR 30.4 million is reported under the \"Intangible assets\" balance sheet item.

Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide\n\nKSB Group / Annual Report 2023\n\ndeter-mine any possible need for write-downs. Impairment testing is carried out at the level of the cash-generating units to which the relevant goodwill is allocated. The carrying amount of the relevant cash-generating unit, including goodwill, is compared with the corresponding recoverable amount in the context of the impairment test. The recoverable amount is generally calculated on the basis of the value in use. The present value of the future cash flows from the respective cash-generating unit normally serves as the basis of valuation. The present values are calculated using discounted cash flow models. For this purpose, the adopted medium-term business plan of the Group forms the starting point which is extrapolated based on assump-tions about long-term rates of growth. Expectations relating to future market developments and assumptions about the development of macroeconomic factors on the business activities of the Group are also taken into account. The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital for the relevant cash-generating unit. The impairment test determined that it was necessary to recognize write-downs amounting to a total of EUR 0.7 million. The outcome of this valuation is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the executive directors with respect to the future cash inflows from the respective cash-generating unit, on the discount rate used, the rate of growth as well as other assumptions, and is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background and due to the complex nature of the valuation, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n**<sup>2</sup>** As part of our audit, we assessed the methodology employed for the purposes of performing the impairment test, among other things. After matching the future cash inflows used for the calculation against the adopted medium-term business plan of the Group, we assessed the appropriateness of the calculation, in particular by reconciling it with general and sector specific market expectations. We also assessed the appropriate consideration of the costs of Group functions. In the knowledge that even relatively small changes in the discount rate applied can have a material impact on the value of the entity calculated using this method, we focused our testing in particular on the parameters used to determine the discount rate applied and assessed the calculation model. We evaluated the sensitivity analyses performed by the Company, in order to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the projections. We verified that the necessary disclosures were made in the notes to the consolidated financial statements relating to the cash-generating units for which a reasonably possible change in an assumption would result in the recoverable amount falling below the carrying amount of the cash-generating units including the allocated goodwill.\n\nOverall, the measurement inputs and assumptions used by the executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also within the ranges considered by us to be reasonable.\n\n**<sup>3</sup>** The Company's disclosures on goodwill are contained in section III \"Accounting policies\", IV. \"Balance sheet disclosures\" note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{185}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **<sup>2</sup> Accounting treatment of project orders recognized over time**\n\n**<sup>1</sup>** In the Company's consolidated financial statements revenue totaling EUR 2,819.0 million is reported in the consolidated income statement. The Company has put in place comprehensive systems and processes throughout the Group for the purposes of accurately recognizing and deferring revenue. Revenue amounting to EUR 676.5 million is attributable to project orders recognized over time and the service business. In the case of project orders, the stage of completion is estimated based on the ratio of costs already incurred to budgeted total costs. IFRS 15 requires estimates and judgments to be made for certain areas, which were assessed for appropriate-ness in the context of our audit. In particular, the estimation of the planned total costs of the project orders to be recognized over time and the appropriate allocation of costs incurred to the orders are based on the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors. Against this background and due to the resulting estimation uncertainties and the complexity of the accounting treatment under Group-wide application of IFRS 15, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n**<sup>2</sup>** As part of our audit, among other things we assessed the processes and controls established by the Group for the recognition of revenue from project orders recognized over time, taking into account the stage of completion. In addition, with respect to project orders recognized over time we examined projects on a sample basis to determine whether they met the requirements for recognizing revenue over time in accordance with IFRS 15. We assessed the estimates and judgments made by the executive directors with respect to the recognition and deferral of revenue for the various business models of the Group companies. Furthermore, we assessed the calculation of percentage of completion and the proportionate recognition of revenue and profit derived from this. In this connection we examined the calculation of both the budgeted total costs and the costs actually incurred. We assessed the pro-gress of the respective projects, among other things based on interviews with project manag-ers and by inspecting project documentation. In addition, we assessed the consistency of the methods used to calculate the costs incurred.\n\nWe also addressed the inherent audit risk in this audit area by means of audit procedures that were consistently applied throughout the Group. We were able to satisfy ourselves that the systems, processes and controls in place are appropriate and that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors are sufficiently documented and substantiated to ensure that revenue is appropriately accounted for.\n\n**<sup>3</sup>** The Company's disclosures on the accounting treatment of project orders recognized over time are contained in sections III. \"Accounting policies\", IV. \"Notes to the balance sheet\", nos. 8 and 13 and V. \"Notes to the income statement\", no. 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n{186}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**186** Management and Issues 2023 Combined Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements **General Information**\n\n**<sup>2</sup> Accounting treatment of project orders recognized over time**\n\nwas of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\nrevenue is appropriately accounted for.\n\nfinancial statements.\n\n**<sup>1</sup>** In the Company's consolidated financial statements revenue totaling EUR 2,819.0 million is reported in the consolidated income statement.

We also:\n\n- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n\n{189}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.\n- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.
