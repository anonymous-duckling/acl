This was due to the increase of €177.6 million in retained earnings. The equity ratio underwent a year-on-year increase from 44.6 per cent to 45.8 per cent. In the reporting period, the equity ratio amounted to 17.2 per cent, after 18.6 per cent in the prior year.\n\n| RETURN ON EQUITY AND RETURN ON ASSETS | %    |      |      |      |      |\n|---------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                                       | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Return on equity                      | 17.2 | 18.6 | 20.4 | 19.5 | 19.8 |\n| Return on assets                      | 8.4  | 8.5  | 9.0  | 8.3  | 8.5  |\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the debt ratio dropped from 124.1 per cent to 118.3 per cent. The net debt also improved to €74.8 million, after €83.7 million in the prior year. Thus, it remained on a very comfortable level.\n\nIn the reporting period, the return on assets, which indicates the return on the entire capital employed, decreased slightly from 8.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent.\n\nIn the business of Bechtle, which does not involve a great deal of property, plant and equipment, the ROCE (return on capital employed) is affected by the development of current assets and liabilities, on the one hand, and the earnings performance, on the other. In the reporting period, the ROCE thus amounted to 18.9 per cent, after 20.1 per cent in the prior year.\n\n#### ROCE/CAPITAL EMPLOYED\n\n|                     | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|---------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| ROCE %              | 18.9    | 20.1    | 22.2    | 19.8    | 18.7    |\n| Capital employed €m | 2,017.7 | 1,767.0 | 1,469.6 | 1,395.4 | 1,288.7 |\n\n#### VALUE INFORMATION\n\nImage /page/109/Picture/10 description: The image shows a book icon above the text \"See Notes, page 231 ff\". The book icon is an open book with two pages visible.\n\nIn almost all cases, the fair value of the current assets and liabilities corresponds to the carrying amount. Within the scope of the non-current assets, intangible assets with a limited useful life, property, plant and equipment as well as trade receivables, income tax receivables, other assets as well as time deposits and deferred taxes are measured at amortised cost. The carrying amounts of the goodwill and of the brands presented under other intangible assets (except for Inmac Wstore and ARP, which are subject to scheduled amortisation) are reviewed for impairment by means of annual impairment tests on the basis of the value in use. As the values in use significantly exceeded the carrying amounts, no impairment was applied to these assets. Non-current liabilities are carried at amortised cost.\n\n[For value in use of](#page-205-0) [the goodwill, see Notes,](#page-205-0) [page 206 f](#page-205-0)\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### E U TA X O N O M Y D I S C L O S U R E S F O R T H E 2 0 2 3 F I S C A L Y E A R\n\nIn accordance with Art. 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 and the delegated acts adopted thereunder (below: EU Taxonomy), companies subject to non-financial reporting obligations have been required to make disclosures on environmentally sustainable revenues, capital expenditures (CapEx) and operational expenditures (OpEx) since the 2021 financial year. Business activities are \"environmentally sustainable\" in the meaning of the Taxonomy Regulation if they meet the following criteria: An activity is only considered to be sustainable if it contributes substantially to at least one of the following six objectives of the EU Taxonomy:\n\n� Climate change mitigation,\n\n- � climate change adaptation,\n- � sustainable use and protection of water resources,\n- � transition to a circular economy,\n- � pollution prevention and\n- � protection of ecosystems and biodiversity.\n\nAt the same time, the activity must not harm any of the other environmental objectives (\"do no significant harm\" – DNSH). Moreover, minimum social safeguards (MSS) must be implemented to comply with basic social, labour and human rights standards.\n\nThe regulation distinguishes between \"taxonomy-eligible\" and \"taxonomy-aligned\" activities. Activities are considered to be eligible if they can be mapped to the technical assessment criteria. If they actually meet these criteria, they are considered to be aligned.\n\nBechtle's core activities comprise IT services and the trading business with IT products, which account for the lion's share of our business volume. However, as the regulations do not consider the trading-only business, the business activities relevant in the context of the EU taxonomy only concern secondary activities, not Bechtle's core business. For 2023, we therefore do not report any business volume, but only capital expenditure (CapEx), as we do not have any EU taxonomy-relevant activities.\n\nMoreover, we do not present the operating expenditure (OpEx), as only operating expenses for maintenance and short-term leases would be relevant, but are insignificant and, according to the FAQ on Art. 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation, do not need to be reported. We consider all six environmental objectives, especially climate protection and climate change adaptation. For the full application of the taxonomy, the technical audit and DNSH criteria were taken into consideration.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Description of the activities.** The first step was the identification of the business activities relevant for Bechtle. In an initial phase, this meant identifying those that fulfil the preconditions for taxonomy eligibility and alignment. In a second phase, the figures for the CapEx were determined. At Bechtle, taxonomy-related activities can be found in the areas of mobility and property.\n\nIn the second step, we conducted a qualitative climate risk analysis of the activities and our business activity by assessing the probability of occurrence and the damage impact of previously identified climate risks and classifying them in a three-stage scale. In the 2024 fiscal year, we are going to conduct a comprehensive climate risk analysis in line with the requirements of the ESRS standards and under consideration of the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\n**Process description of the data collection.** The data collection for the report according to the EU taxonomy was performed in the system on the basis of the financial reporting. The plausibility check then took place with a bottom-up approach in which we listed all CapEx on the basis of the relevant company codes. We will automate the internal systems in the medium run in order to reduce the workload for collecting the needed data.\n\nUnlike in the report for 2021 financial year, we have reported CapEx since the 2022 fiscal year without construction in progress (CIP), as CIP and down payments made are only taken into consideration once a building is completed. This is vital in order to be able to duly assess the alignment. Rent increases and contract extensions were not checked for alignment. For the 2024 reporting period, we also plan to check rent increases and contract extensions for alignment. Originally, we had set this goal for 2023.\n\n|                                          |                            |                 |                            |                 | In € m                     |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|\n|                                          |                            | 2023¹           |                            | 2022¹           | 2021²,<br>³                |\n| Activity⁴                                | Taxonomy-eligible<br>CapEx | thereof aligned | Taxonomy-eligible<br>CapEx | thereof aligned | Taxonomy-eligible<br>CapEx |\n| 6.5 Automobiles and lorries              | 37,477                     | 14,619          | 26,455                     | 10,517          | 20,900                     |\n| 7.2 Renovation of existing buildings     | –                          | –               | –                          | –               | –                          |\n| 7.3 Energy-efficient equipment           | 476                        | 476             | 280                        | 280             | 250                        |\n| 7.4 Charging stations                    | 1,923                      | 1,923           | 590                        | 590             | 606                        |\n| 7.5 Total energy efficiency of buildings | –                          | –               | –                          | –               | –                          |\n| 7.6 Renewable energies                   | –                          | –               | 86                         | 86              | –                          |\n| 7.7 Buildings                            | 80,572                     | 35,390          | 36,853                     | 8,929           | 35,120                     |\n| Taxonomy CapEx                           | 120,448                    | 52,408          | 64,264                     | 20,402          | 56,876                     |\n| Total CapEx⁵                             | 250,400                    | 250,400         | 147,700                    | 147,700         | 104,400                    |\n| Taxonomy share                           | 48.1%                      | 20.9%           | 43.5%                      | 13.8%           | 54.5%                      |\n\n#### TAXONOMY-ELIGIBLE AND TAXONOMY-ALIGNED ACTIVITIES in €k\n\n¹ In 2022 and 2023, rent increases and contract extensions were not checked for alignment.\n\n² Prior-year figures adjusted, as construction in progress and down payments made are not included.\n\n³ Taxonomy alignment was not checked in 2021, as this was not required.\n\n⁴ We do not report OpEx of the activities 5.1, 7.2. to 7.7. and 8.1., as they are below the threshold of 1 per cent.\n\n⁵ Without construction in progress and planned down payments\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a result of different methods of calculating RoU assets, there is a deviation in the total capital expenditure disclosed in this chapter. The capital expenditure presented elsewhere in the Annual Report 2023 excludes capitalised rights of use pursuant to IFRS. As Bechtle does not obtain property or comparable rights here, rights of use are not – in the strictest sense of the term – considered capital expenditure. In the calculation of the EU taxonomy, we include capitalised rights of use pursuant to IFRS in the total capital expenditure, as activities pertaining to property and the vehicle fleet greatly influence our sustainability efforts and impact. This explains the deviation in total capital expenditure.\n\n**ASSETS POSITION**\n\nImage /page/112/Picture/2 description: Three people are standing behind a counter in what appears to be a break room or bistro.

Additionally, numerous measures to optimise the working capital and cash flow quickly yielded noticeable effects. Alongside this operational development, the first-time issue of a convertible bond has also meant that the liquidity situation in the group is very comfortable. All of this represents the basis for the further profitable growth of the Bechtle Group.\n\n#### CASH FLOW STATEMENT\n\n[See Assets position,](#page-107-0) [page 108 ff](#page-107-0)\n\n**Operating cash flow reaches new record.** In 2023, the cash flow from operating activities amounted to €459.0 million. This was not only significantly above the prior-year figure of €116.7 million, it also represented a new record. This development is attributable mainly to the changes in net assets. In the reporting period, Bechtle recorded positive changes in trade receivables, in particular. The reduction of trade receivables in the reporting period amounted to €102.7 million. In the prior year, this figure had amounted to –€248.5 million. This clearly shows the positive effect of our measures to optimise receivables management. The stock levels that had gone up due to the problems in the supply chains in 2021 and 2022 were gradually reduced in the reporting period. The change in inventories amounted to €175.7 million in the reporting period, resulting in a positive effect on the cash flow from operating activities (prior year: –€93.7 million). The item of trade payables amounted to –€97.6 million, after €56.7 million in the prior year.\n\nImage /page/113/Picture/9 description: The image shows a book icon above the text \"See Notes, page 229 f\".\n\nThe cash flow from investing activities amounted to –€282.6 million, after –€224.3 million in the prior year. One of the main reasons for this was the much higher outflow for acquisitions, which climbed by €131.3 million to €223.4 million. On the other hand, we recorded an inflow of €60 million for the purchase of time deposits and securities (prior year: €0).\n\nThe cash flow from financing activities as well was positive and amounted to €28.2 million, after −€100.2 million in the prior year. This was due especially to the issue of convertible bonds, which impacted the cash received from the assumption of financial liabilities in the amount of €298.0 million. The cash paid for the repayment of financial liabilities amounted to –€108.1 million. Furthermore, the dividend payment resulted in a change of –€81.9 million.\n\nThe development of the free cash flow in the reporting period was very positive resulting in €151.2 million after −€29.8 million in the prior year. Although the payments for acquisitions as well as for investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment increased, this development was more than offset by the impressive progress of the operating cash flow.\n\n{291}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Disclosures                                                                                                  | Page  | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| GRI 404-2 Programs for upgrading employee skills<br>and transition assistance programs                       | 65 ff |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| GRI 404-3 Percentage of employees receiving<br>regular performance and career<br>development reviews         |       | As a matter of principle, every executive should have a personnel meeting at<br>least once a year with his or her solid-line employees.

We are looking at a long list of negative news reports, the dimensions of which are often shocking. At the same time, we are in the midst of a technological transformation on a scale not seen for a long time. These framework conditions are extremely challenging, without question also for companies operating in future-oriented industries such as IT. And thus also for your company, for Bechtle.\n\n#### However, being pessimistic will not help the situation.\n\nMore than ever, a hands-on mentality is needed. Every day, we do our best to continue to drive the necessary digital transformation with determination and creativity in order to support our customers' competitiveness and performance. In this context, our aim is to sustainably promote the success of our customers through IT. Over the past months, we have again succeeded in doing so.\n\n#### The 2023 fiscal year can be summarised in three words: resilient, successful and future-oriented.\n\nWe are very satisfied with the overall performance delivered by the Bechtle Group despite the challenging conditions in our key markets. In the course of the year, we managed to achieve a steady level above the prior year – a clear sign of strength in these times of turbulence and uncertainty, especially in connection with the good cash flow. What is more, Bechtle's earnings were in line with the forecast for the year as whole.\n\nWe are very pleased to report business volume growth of 7 per cent, revenue growth of 6.5 per cent and an improvement of earnings before taxes of 6.8 per cent. With its revenue increase of 13.5 per cent, the performance of our service and project-oriented system house segment was especially remarkable. Thus, we have greatly outperformed the market. Most importantly, we have achieved profitable growth despite the inflation and especially the increased personnel costs and high energy costs. This is a truly remarkable achievement by our leaders and all employees.\n\n#### As you can see, dear shareholders, your company fared remarkably well in 2023.\n\nIn an impressive manner, the fiscal year ended as well as the new fiscal year we have just entered show that for our customers, we are THE recognised IT partner for the future. Moreover, we have further expanded our lead as Germany's largest system house. We have again demonstrated the remarkable crisis resilience of our business model in a challenging setting, balancing any imbalances in individual country markets, customer segments and business segments as well as fluctuations in, and between, the segments.\n\n#### Companies as well as public administrations are well aware that digitalisation is a key factor for future sustainable success.\n\nTherefore, we look at the current 2024 fiscal year with optimism, knowing that our positioning is outstanding. We benefit from our long-standing experience and the proven success of our service offerings, which help our customers to drive digitalisation and achieve success through the systematic use of IT.\n\nBechtle Annual Report 2023\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2024, we again plan to outperform the market in addressing the high demand for projects and services related to the digital transformation of our customers and gain further market shares, both organically and inorganically. For about 30 years, acquisitions have been part of Bechtle's growth strategy. Last year, we again successfully gained a greater foothold in six European countries: Germany, France, the UK, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Spain. Thus, a total of seven highly successful companies became part of the Bechtle Group. These companies contribute to our progress in future-oriented business fields such as artificial intelligence and IT security, both in geographical terms and with regard to the subject areas covered.\n\n#### In conclusion, I would like to touch on the latest changes in the Executive Board:\n\nFor an unusually long stretch of 14 years, Bechtle did not see any changes in the Executive Board. This continuity is also an expression of stability, reliability and great attachment. We were very pleased to smoothly restaff the position of our esteemed colleague Jürgen Schäfer with Konstantin Ebert, a colleague from our own ranks. As of 1 January 2024, Konstantin Eber took over the responsibility for the IT E-Commerce segment. Only one month later, our new colleague Antje Leminsky was placed in charge of logistics, procurement, partner management, financial services and sustainability management. Accordingly, your company is now headed by four people who represent a very balanced mix of long-standing experience and a fresh perspective.\n\nTogether, we are ready to face this year's doubtlessly formidable challenges with zest and optimism. Trusting in Bechtle and its workforce, we are convinced that we will again be able to leverage existing growth impulses for above-market growth in 2024.\n\n### Knowing our strengths, our goal for 2024 is to again achieve significant growth, while keeping our group margin at least at the prior-year level.\n\nCurrently, we expect the first half of the year to be rather restrained, though we anticipate more economic tailwinds for our business starting from the middle of the year. In 2024, we will continue to pursue our European acquisition strategy. Factors such as our strong cash flow and the successful placement of a convertible bond in the fiscal year ended provide us with an excellent financial basis for further organic growth as well as growth through acquisitions.\n\nWe are proud of what we have achieved so far, and we are looking forward to the great achievements that lie ahead of us. As we move forward, the commitment and skills of our outstanding team imbue us with confidence.\n\nOn behalf of the entire Executive Board, I would like to thank you, dear shareholders, for your trust. I hope that you will stay with us and continue to be part of Bechtle's success story!\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRues Ole of\n\nDr. Thomas Olemotz Chairman of the Executive Board (CEO)\n\nNeckarsulm, 11 March 2024\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-11-0\"></span>DR.

However, with regard to Bechtle AG, we are pleased to confirm that we successfully mastered this difficult year. In 2023, the business volume, revenue and EBT each experienced growth of about 7 per cent. Bechtle AG therefore continued on its growth path despite the more challenging conditions. Once again, we saw evidence of the resilience of our business model and the strength of networked decentralisation, coupled with an ever more important level of internationalism. Moreover, we have benefited from the steady expansion of our range of target customer groups over the years. IT is a future-oriented market. Although our medium-sized customers, in particular, were somewhat more hesitant to invest in 2023, these investments were merely postponed – they are sure to come. After all, every enterprise and every public institution needs to invest in IT in order to be ready for the future. As an IT partner for tomorrow, Bechtle is well prepared for successful further development. Within the scope of its duties, the Supervisory Board will continue to help shape the company's successful development responsibly and systematically.\n\nIn 2023, the Supervisory Board again meticulously performed all its audit and controlling duties pursuant to law and the Articles of Incorporation. The Supervisory Board regularly provided the Executive Board with advice concerning the administration of the group and closely monitored and supported the company's management and development. In this context, the two boards always cooperated in an open and constructive manner.\n\nThe Executive Board regularly informed the Supervisory Board about all aspects significant to the company in a prompt and comprehensive manner. This included the status of the roll-out of the Vision 2030, the Sustainability Strategy, the further development of the Executive Board and management organisation, the group's business performance, possible acquisitions (especially also in relation to the expanded acquisition strategy), the financing of acquisitions and of the daily business, the tense macroeconomic situation and its effects on the realisation of business volume and revenue, future investments, location-related issues, opportunity and risk management, the risk situation as well as basic issues related to the corporate planning and management.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Chairman of the Executive Board, in particular, maintained close contact with individual Supervisory Board members, primarily with the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, even outside the regular meetings. Additionally, the Executive Board informed the Supervisory Board as a whole about key operational indicators, the implementation of business plans and the employment situation of the group, segments and all major subsidiaries on a monthly basis. At quarterly meetings, we also intensively elaborated on the respective past quarter and the short and medium-term perspectives.\n\nAt its meetings, the Supervisory Board regularly looked into the business performance of the group as well as the assets and financial position and the implementation of the corporate strategy. Moreover, we continually dealt with the risk situation – especially also in connection with the global hotspots and the related, tense macroeconomic situation – and actively participated in the further development of the control and risk management system of Bechtle AG.\n\nThanks to the timely and detailed information received from the Executive Board and its own audits, the Supervisory Board was able to comply fully with its monitoring and consulting duties. We confirm that the Executive Board has acted lawfully, correctly and economically in every respect. The Executive Board regularly consulted the legal and compliance department as well as group controlling and actively used the risk management system.\n\nBechtle AG supports the members of the Supervisory Board that have been elected by the shareholders or employees in fulfilling their duties and with respect to training measures. In the reporting period, the Supervisory Board received training on sustainability, on Executive Board compensation and on the reporting obligations in these areas. In the reporting period, some members of the Supervisory Board also took part in various training measures in the fields of corporate governance, ESG (environmental, social, governance), AI (artificial intelligence), risk management and employee share ownership plans.\n\n#### MEETINGS AND CENTRAL ISSUES\n\nIn the reporting period, the Supervisory Board held eight plenary sessions in person: on 2 February, 15 March (balance sheet meeting for the annual and consolidated financial statements for 2022), 20 April, 25 May, 26 July, 27 July, 27 October and 21 December 2023. Meeting attendance was as follows:\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                         | 02.02 | 15.03 | 20.04 | 25.05 | 26.07 | 27.07 | 27.10 | 21.12 | Meeting attendance |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------------------|\n| Shareholder representatives             |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |                    |\n| Kurt Dobitsch                           | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Dr. Lars Grünert                        | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     |       | 87.5%              |\n| Prof. Dr. Thomas Hess                   | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Elke Reichart                           | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Sandra Stegmann                         | •     |       | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Klaus Straub (since 25 May 2023)        |       |       |       | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Elmar König (since 25 May 2023)         |       |       |       | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Klaus Winkler                           | •     |       |       | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Employee representatives                |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |                    |\n| Julia Böttcher (since 25 May 2023)      |       |       |       | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Christian Deppisch (since 25 May 2023)  |       |       |       | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Uli Drautz                              | •     |       | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Daniela Eberle                          |       | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Christine Muhr (since 25 May 2023)      |       |       |       | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Anastasia Polidoros (until 25 May 2023) |       | •     | •     |       |       |       |       |       | 75%                |\n| Julia Randelshofer (since 25 May 2023)  |       |       |       | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Anton Samija                            | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Volker Strohfeld (until 25 May 2023)    | •     | •     | •     |       |       |       |       | •     | 100%               |\n| Michael Unser                           |       | •     | •     |       |       |       | •     | •     | 75%                |\n\nApart from the resolutions adopted at the meetings, the Supervisory Board or its committees also adopted resolutions via circular procedure where relevant, in particular in urgent cases. We discussed all measures and transactions that required the approval of the Supervisory Board or its committees in detail at Supervisory Board and committee meetings. At its balance sheet meeting on 15 March 2023, the Supervisory Board approved the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements of the prior year (thereby adopting the annual financial statements) and accepted the Executive Board's proposal concerning the appropriation of profits and the business planning for 2023.\n\nIn the past fiscal year, the most important subjects discussed included the following:\n\n- � The group's short-term strategy against the backdrop of the tense macroeconomic situation, its medium-to long-term strategy especially with a view to the clouds and managed services business, new business opportunities and the expansion of the M&A strategy in the course of consistent internationalisation as well as the targets achieved in relation to the strategy roll-out\n- � The economic development of the group, especially in the face of the challenging framework conditions\n- � The further development of the Executive Board organisation, the governance structure and the succession planning\n- � The Executive Board compensation system and the Executive Board compensation\n- � Progress in the reduction of the capital commitment\n- � Plans for specific acquisitions\n- � Financing matters in the group, especially the issuance of a convertible bond\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n- � The organisation of the Supervisory Board work, especially in relation to the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (DCGK)\n- � The implementation of the Sustainability and Climate Protection Strategy and of the non-financial group statement\n- � The internal audit and risk management system\n\nSuggestions of shareholder representatives and proxy advisors were actively made use of, and extensive work was done to implement them in the compensation system. This included the introduction of a fully share-based long-term compensation component as a new feature from 2024 and increased transparency of the reporting on the variable income components of the Executive Board. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board formed a nomination committee for the first time. The Supervisory Board is planning further development steps in the future.\n\n#### S TA F F I N G O F T H E S U P E R V I S O R Y B O A R D A N D E X E C U T I V E B O A R D\n\nAt the end of 2023 there was a staff change in the Executive Board of Bechtle AG. On 27 December 2023, Jürgen Schäfer stepped down from the Executive Board after more than 30 years of successful work for Bechtle. We are greatly indebted to Jürgen Schäfer for his outstanding performance and successful work. His responsibilities will be taken over by Konstantin Ebert, who previously served as Executive Vice President in the IT E-Commerce segment for France, Benelux and the United Kingdom.\n\nAs of 1 February 2024, the Supervisory Board appointed Antje Leminsky to the Executive Board. She will take over responsibility for logistics, procurement and partner management as well as financial services and sustainability management, which were previously taken care of by Dr. Thomas Olemotz. The Executive Board of Bechtle AG therefore now comprises four persons. Antje Leminsky most recently served as Vice Chairwoman of the Executive Board of the measuring technology manufacturer, Testo and previously for eight years as member of the Executive Board of the listed financial service provider, Grenke AG, first as CIO and then as Chairwoman of the Executive Board.\n\nIn 2023, Supervisory Board elections were due. As Bechtle had exceeded the threshold of 10,000 employees in Germany, the law required the Supervisory Board to be expanded from 12 to 16 members. On the shareholder side, the Annual General Meeting re-elected all six previous members. Klaus Straub, businessman and former CIO of BMW AG, and Elmar König, former Executive Vice President of Bechtle AG, were newly elected. Julia Böttcher, Christian Deppisch, Christine Muhr and Julia Randelshofer were newly elected on the employee side. Anastasia Polidoros and Volker Strohfeld departed from the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board thanks both of them for the good cooperation over the years.\n\n#### COMMITTEE WORK\n\nTo fulfil its duties, the Supervisory Board has formed three committees: the audit committee, the personnel committee and the arbitration committee. In its meeting on 21 December 2023, the Supervisory Board also decided to set up a nomination committee.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                 | 01.02 | 14.03 | 10.05 | 25.07 | 10.08 | 26.10 | 09.11 | 30.11 | 01.12 | Meeting attendance |\n|-----------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------------------|\n| Kurt Dobitsch   | ●     | ●     |       |       | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | 88.9%              |\n| Sandra Stegmann | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | 100%               |\n\nKlaus Winkler 100% Uli Drautz 100% Daniela Eberle 100%\n\nThe audit committee came together on 1 February, 14 March, 25 July, 26 October, 30 November and 1 December 2023. Additionally, it held telephone conferences prior to the interim reports of Bechtle AG on 10 May, 10 August and 9 November 2023. Meeting attendance was as follows:\n\nIn 2023, the audit committee dealt with transactions that require approval, especially acquisition plans, location-related issues, long-term contracts and the issuance of a convertible bond for the first time. Other subjects discussed included the interim financial reports, the revenue and earnings performance under the difficult framework conditions, the development of the cash flow and of the working capital as well as their further optimisation, the preliminary audits of the annual and consolidated financial statements, the non-financial group statement and the proposal for the appropriation of profits, the review of the internal control and risk management system and the expansion with the identification and assessment of the sustainability risks according to the requirements of the German Corporate Governance Code (DCGK) within the scope of the sustainability risk management. The meetings also focused on the monitoring of the auditor's independence, the definition of the main issues to be audited, the agreement of the audit fee, the corporate governance and the selection of the auditor for the annual and consolidated financial statements for 2023 and subsequent years.\n\nIn 2023, the personnel committee came together twelve times in person: on 30 January, 9 March, 13 March, 30 March, 23 May, 13 July, 18 September, 19 October, 9 November, 15 November, 13 December and 19 December. Meeting attendance was as follows:\n\n|                       | 30.01 | 09.03 | 13.03 | 30.03 | 23.05 | 13.07 | 18.09 | 19.10 | 09.11 | 15.11 | 13.12 | 19.12 | Meeting attendance |\n|-----------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------------------|\n| Prof. Dr. Thomas Hess | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | 100%               |\n| Klaus Winkler         | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | 100%               |\n| Uli Drautz            | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | 100%               |\n\nThe meetings of the personnel committee primarily focused on proposals to the Supervisory Board regarding the revision of the compensation system of the Executive Board, the compensation report, the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (DCGK), the restaffing of the Executive Board, the restaffing of some Executive Vice President and Vice President positions, the further development of the management organisation and the employment contracts with Executive Board members and Executive Vice Presidents.\n\nThe arbitration committee pursuant to Section 27 (3) of the German Co-determination Act (MitbestG) was not convened in 2023.\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly and meticulously conducts a self-assessment of its activity with the support of Deutsche Schutzvereinigung für Wertpapierbesitz e.V. The self-assessment was last conducted in 2022. Based on recommendations from the Supervisory Board, action recommendations are developed, presented at the plenary meeting and, after intensive review, included in the work of the Supervisory Board. We consistently monitor the implementation of these recommendations in our Supervisory Board. The basic results of past self-assessments revealed that the workflows and processes in the Supervisory Board are efficient and target-oriented.\n\n#### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND DECLARATION OF CONFORMITY\n\nIn the reporting period, we intensively examined the set of rules of the German Corporate Governance Code (DCGK) and, in doing so, identified optimisation potential. To ensure compliance with DCGK, we checked the implementation of the recommendations. Together with the Executive Board, we issued the Declaration of Conformity pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in January 2023 and again on 2 February 2024. Deviations from the recommendations of the Government Commission are explained in detail in the Declaration of Conformity. All Declarations of Conformity of the last five years and other documents concerning the corporate governance have been, and continue to be, made permanently available to the shareholders on the company's website. Bechtle's Corporate Governance Statement is the central document concerning the corporate governance. In the fiscal year ended, no conflicts of interest of Executive Board or Supervisory Board members arose that, according to the code, would have had to be disclosed to the plenum without delay and about which the Annual General Meeting would have had to be informed.\n\n#### AUDIT OF THE ANNUAL AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2023\n\nThe Annual General Meeting appointed Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Stuttgart, as auditor of the annual and consolidated financial statements for the 2023 fiscal year. Following the commissioning by the Supervisory Board, the auditor audited the annual financial statements of Bechtle AG, the consolidated financial statements and the consolidated management reports of Bechtle AG and of the Bechtle Group for the 2023 fiscal year, including the accounts as well as the risk management and early risk detection system, with unqualified auditor's opinions. The audit also included the implemented monitoring system for early identification of risks and the internal audit and risk management system with respect to the accounting process. The auditor has confirmed that the installed systems are suitable for identifying developments endangering the company's going concern at an early stage.\n\nThe documents related to the financial statements, the proposal of the Executive Board for the appropriation of profits and the auditor's audit reports (including the opinion on the compensation report) were duly sent to the members of the Supervisory Board and discussed in detail in the audit committee and in the board as a whole. The auditor of the annual and consolidated financial statements also participated in the meeting of the audit committee on 12 March 2024 and in the balance sheet meeting on 13 March 2024. The auditor reported in detail on the material results of the audit and answered all questions of the Supervisory Board comprehensively.\n\n[See Declaration of Conformity,](https://www.bechtle.com/corporate-governance) [bechtle.com/](https://www.bechtle.com/corporate-governance) [corporate-governance](https://www.bechtle.com/corporate-governance)\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing its own review of the annual financial statements, the consolidated financial statements and the consolidated management report, the Supervisory Board approved the results of the audit conducted by the auditor. According to the final result of its audit, there were no objections. At the balance sheet meeting on 13 March 2024, the Supervisory Board thus approved the annual financial statements and the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the recommendation of the audit committee, thereby adopting the annual financial statements pursuant to Section 172 (1) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The Supervisory Board agreed to the Executive Board's proposal for the appropriation of the net profit and payment of a dividend of €0.70 per share. We approve the consolidated management report of the Executive Board and consider the proposal for the appropriation of profits to be appropriate.\n\nThe Executive Board and the Supervisory Board have prepared the compensation report in accordance with Section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The auditor has audited the compensation report pursuant to Section 162 (3) sentence 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) as to whether it contains the disclosures pursuant to Section 162 (1) and (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).\n\nThe Supervisory Board also audited and comprehensively discussed the non-financial group statement of Bechtle AG, which was prepared by the Executive Board, at the balance sheet meeting on 13 March 2024. The non-financial group statement was included in the management report as part of the Annual Report within the scope of the integrated reporting. The Executive Board explained the non-financial group report and answered the questions of the members of the Supervisory Board. The review conducted by the Supervisory Board did not give rise to any objections to the non-financial group report. The Supervisory Board agrees with the non-financial group report.\n\nAt the start of 2024, the basic economic conditions are still challenging. Nevertheless, we are optimistic with regard to the future, and we believe that the Bechtle Group will continue to develop well. This success is supported by our business model and, above all, by the people at Bechtle. The Supervisory Board would therefore like to express its sincere gratitude to all employees of the Bechtle Group in all 14 countries. The Supervisory Board will continue to accompany the development of Bechtle with great commitment in an advisory and controlling capacity.\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board\n\nKlaus Wiebe\n\nKlaus Winkler Chairman\n\nNeckarsulm, 13 March 2024\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-23-0\"></span>**SHARE**\n\nThe 2023 stock market year was surprisingly positive despite economic and geopolitical uncertainties and the resulting high volatility. All leading German indices recorded significant gains at the end of the year. The DAX even reached a new all-time high meanwhile. For the Bechtle shares the year was unsettled as well, but ultimately pleasing. A positive start was followed by price losses in the summer. As the year progressed, however, the share price rose again and even outperformed the benchmark indices. Our share closed the year up 37.3 per cent. Market capitalisation stood at €5.7 billion at the end of the year.\n\n#### STOCK MARKET\n\n**Successful stock market year with highs and lows.** Economic concerns, a high inflation rate, rising interest rates and geopolitical crises characterised the 2023 financial year. After a hopeful start to the new stock market year, a banking crisis caused turbulences in the spring. The DAX fell to 14,600 points. However, the leading index subsequently recovered and, after some fluctuations, climbed above the 16,000-point mark by the summer. The stock markets experienced their weakest phase of the year between August and the end of October. Economic and interest rate concerns persisted, and the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, and the consequences of this, put additional pressure on the market. The prospect of an interest rate reversal in the first half of 2024 brought about a turnaround from October. The leading German indices experienced a veritable year-end rally in the last two months of the reporting period. Meanwhile, the DAX reached a new all-time high and ended the year up 20.3 per cent. The TecDAX rose by 14.3 per cent over the course of the year, while the MDAX recorded an increase of 8.0 per cent.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n23.02.2024 **48,85 €**\n\n#### SHARE PERFORMANCE\n\n50,00\n\n45,00\n\n40,00\n\n**Bechtle share sees strong performance.** Despite a degree of volatility, the price of the Bechtle share developed extremely positively in the course of the reporting period. On 2 January 2023, our share started the new stock market year with a closing price of €32.68, the low for the reporting period. Like the leading indices, the share price initially climbed steadily and even outperformed its peers from February onwards. Our share price then fell in the spring, with prices returning to the level **22 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD** of the benchmark indices.

The Bechtle share ended the stock market year at €45.39, up 37.3 per cent on the previous year's closing price. Our shares therefore performed significantly better than the benchmark indices. At the end of the year, market capitalisation stood at €5,719.1 million. In the MDAX ranking of Deutsche Börse, Bechtle occupied the 55th place (prior year: 61st place). In the TecDAX, our company was on the 9th place (prior year: 10th place). 35,00 30,00\n\nDIE BECHTLE AKTIE – KURSENTWICKLUNG JANUAR 2023 BIS FEBRUAR 2024 in €\n\nImage /page/24/Figure/3 description: This line graph shows the performance of the bechtle share from January 2023 to February 2024.

Dezember 2023\n\n**Long-term anchor shareholder.** With an interest of 35.02 per cent, the Schick family remains the largest shareholder of Bechtle AG. This figure also comprises the shares of Schick GmbH, of which Karin Schick is a partner, and shares belonging to her son. This also includes the shares of the Gerhard and Ilse Schick Foundation, which was established by Karin Schick in May 2022. We regard the Schick family as an anchor shareholder that holds its shares on a very long-term basis, thereby effectively ensuring high stability. As of the end of the reporting period, the free float amounted to 64.98 per cent. These shares are held by a wide spectrum of private and institutional investors in Germany and abroad.\n\nAKTIONÄRSSTRUKTUR in %\n\n35,02 Familie Schick davon Gerhard und Ilse Schick Stiftung 3,57 %  5,15 Flossbach v.

The reliability of the profit distribution policy is also evident from the continuous dividend increase.\n\nDespite the very challenging economic circumstances that persisted in 2023, Bechtle AG recorded pleasant results. Earnings after tax, which form the basis for the dividend distribution, increased by 5.7 per cent. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board have therefore agreed to propose a dividend of €0.70 per share to the Annual General Meeting for the 2023 fiscal year (previous year: €0.65). This would be the 14th increase in a row. Subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting, the dividend proposal corresponds to an increase in the dividend of 7.7 per cent. This means an increase in dividends that is slightly above the increase of the earnings after taxes. In this way, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board want to continue the shareholder-friendly dividend policy of Bechtle AG. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board also regard this increase as a sign of their confidence with regard to the further economic performance of Bechtle AG, especially in uncertain times.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the number of shares entitled to dividends was 126,000,000. This results in a total dividend payout of €88.2 million for the 2023 fiscal year. The dividend payout ratio would therefore amount to 33.2 per cent of consolidated earnings after taxes (previous year: 32.6 per cent). The dividend yield would be 1.5 per cent based on the year-end price of our share (previous year: 2.0 per cent).\n\n#### EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\n**Earnings per share 5.7 per cent above previous year.** The improvement of the operating earnings was accompanied by a corresponding rise in the earnings per share (EPS). With 126 million shares and earnings after tax of €265.5 million, EPS amounted to €2.11, some 5.7 per cent more than in the prior year (prior year: €1.99).\n\n#### SHARE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\nImage /page/27/Picture/5 description: The image shows a simple line drawing of an open book.

The aim of the capital measure was to finance further growth of the Bechtle Group in Germany and abroad, including through acquisitions. The basis for the use of this financing instrument was the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 15 June 2021 to issue convertible bonds and to exclude the subscription rights of existing shareholders. The convertible bond was offered exclusively to institutional investors outside the United States of America as part of an accelerated book-building process. UniCredit Bank and Commerzbank acted as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners for the transaction.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-28-0\"></span>ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\n\n**On-site again.** The 23rd Annual General Meeting of Bechtle AG took place on 25 May 2023 at the Harmonie conference centre, in Heilbronn. It was held as an in-person event for the first time since the pandemic. Registered shareholders also had the opportunity to follow the Annual General Meeting live via an online portal and exercise their voting rights there. Around 80 per cent of the share capital participated in the voting. All agenda items were adopted with the required majority.\n\n#### CAPITAL MARKET\n\n**Close dialogue with the capital market.** We regard Bechtle's success as the result of a joint effort and trusting cooperation with our stakeholders. This cooperation takes place in accordance with the principles of openness and transparency and is shaped by the fundamental values anchored in our corporate culture. In their capacity as owners, our shareholders are among the most important stakeholders of our company. Therefore, one of the most important tasks of the financial communication is to include the stakeholders and engage in dialogue with them.\n\nIn the reporting period, 17 institutions were reporting on Bechtle in detailed studies and ad hoc anal-Xetra closing price data\n¹ As of the end of the year yses: AlsterResearch, Baader Bank, Bank of America, Berenberg, BNP Paribas Exane, Deutsche [bechtle.com/](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en/about-bechtle/investors/bechtle-share) Metzler, Oddo BHF, Quirin Privatbank, Stifel, UBS and Warburg Research. Bechtle pursues regular constructive dialogue with all institutions. Citi had to discontinue its coverage in July 2023 due to a lack of resources. In February 2024, Barclays initiated coverage, meaning that 18 banks are reporting on Bechtle at the time of publication of this Annual Report.\n\nVisits to the company's headquarters and participation in numerous conferences and roadshows allow both analysts and investors as well as us to engage in intensive dialogue. This underpins our open and continuous communication with our stakeholders. At a total of 16 roadshows and investor conferences held throughout 2023, we provided information about our company's economic situation, business strategy and outlook in individual and group discussions.\n\nbechtle.com/\nanalysts-recommendations\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonal contact with private investors is also very important to us. In 2023, we once again welcomed around 125 shareholders to the group headquarters in Neckarsulm for the shareholder days that have been very popular for many years. The evening events in the \"Bechtle Meets\" series, which is aimed in particular at young people interested in finance, were also very well received. Two events were organised in cooperation with finfluencers at the Bechtle Group headquarters in the reporting period. The communities had the opportunity to get to know our company, submit questions to both the IR team and to the finfluencers, and network among themselves.\n\n[See Imprint,](#page-293-0) [page 294](#page-293-0) We always endeavour to inform all capital market players in a transparent, comprehensive and timely manner about all significant events that take place in our company.

In particular, the aim here is to avoid repetitions in both reports and to increase workflow efficiency.\n\nIn this document, we also link our financial reporting with the key non-financial information. In this way, we illustrate the interrelationships between economic, ecological and social factors and their influence on our long-term corporate success. The combined management report in the Bechtle Annual Report 2023 also contains the combined non-financial statement (NFR) in accordance with Section § 315b (1) sentence 2 in conjunction with § 289 (2) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). In this way, Bechtle complies with its statutory obligation to disclose non-financial information pursuant to the German CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG). The non-financial Group statement was not part of the assessment carried out in the context of the audit of the annual and Group financial statements by Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft. Passages referring exclusively to the NFR have been placed in green brackets. Passages forming part of the NFR which are also simultaneously disclosures typical for a management report have been placed in blue brackets. This is the last non-financial report in accordance with CSR-RUG; from the coming fiscal year, Bechtle will publish the legally required sustainability information in accordance with CSRD. The company is already preparing for this.\n\n**Use of frameworks.** In accordance with Section 289d HGB, Bechtle has been using the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework, \"Core\" option, for sustainability reporting since the 2019 reporting period. For the 2023 fiscal year, we have been using the GRI Standards valid since 1 January 2023.\n\n[See Materiality,](#page-52-0) [page 53f](#page-52-0)\n\nMarking NFR\n\nMarking NFR/ typical for a management report\n\n> **Content, reporting period and limits.** The topics reported on are aligned with the principle of materiality in accordance with the GRI standards and Section 289c of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The NFR comprises disclosures about the topics required pursuant to Section 289c (2) of the German Commercial Code (HGB), as far as this information is essential to understanding the business development, the business results, the group's position and the consequences of the business development (Section 289c (3) of the German Commercial Code (HGB)).\n\n> This report comprises the period from 1 January to 31 December 2023.

IT is an integral and indispensable part of every business – whether private or commercial. This goes hand in hand with the great importance of modern and future-proof IT infrastructures – and a competent partner who supports and advises on the creation and operation of these complex infrastructures. This is precisely Bechtle's business model: As a vendor-independent solution provider with a comprehensive IT portfolio, we are the preferred IT partner for industry and the Public Sector.\n\n#### BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**One-stop shop.** With more than 100 system houses and IT E-Commerce companies in 14 countries, Bechtle is close to its customers and is one of Europe's leading IT companies. We also have a worldwide network of partners that fulfils the requirements of globally active customers. In its 40th year of existence, the IT company with headquarters in Neckarsulm still combines the strength and resilience of a financially sound international group with the proximity, personal care and flexibility of a regional service provider. A total of about 7,150 service employees, including certified specialists, system engineers and consultants, as well as around 4,200 sales employees work together on the business success of the Bechtle Group. We support more than 70,000 customers from trade and industry, the Public Sector and the financial market on their digital transformation journey and offer a comprehensive, cross-vendor portfolio of IT infrastructure and IT operation solutions.\n\n#### BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\n**Combined power.** Bechtle's business activity comprises two segments: the IT System House & Managed Services segment covers a range of services from the sale of hardware and software solutions, IT strategy consulting, IT infrastructure consulting, application solutions, project planning and implementation, system integration, maintenance and training to the provision of cloud and managed services, IT security services and artificial intelligence. We also offer all \"as-a-service\" models or the complete operation of customer IT.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe have bundled our trading business in IT E-Commerce, the second business segment. We offer our customers hardware and standard software as well as accompanying logistics services via telephone and Internet. In total, our product portfolio in this segment comprises around 36,000 products.\n\n#### IT SYSTEM HOUSE & MANAGED SERVICES\n\n**One-stop IT provider and system integrator.** With our service business, we are represented in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Spain and the United Kingdom. Bechtle's range of services in this segment covers the entire IT value chain. By individually compiling an offer comprising various interlinked services and freely configurable service levels, Bechtle is able to develop a bespoke solution for every customer. The service and solution portfolio is subject to ongoing review and adaptation to market and customer requirements.\n\nImage /page/35/Picture/6 description: The image shows the text \"Personal contact on-site\" with a sun icon above it.\n\nFor our customers, most of whom have regional roots, it has always been important to have a personal contact person close by in order to overcome increasingly complex IT challenges. Our more than 100 regional system houses and their sales employees provide this personal connection. In the decentralised structure of Bechtle, proximity is a key criterion. Direct, usually long-term contact with customers helps sales staff to develop a trusting customer relationship. In this context, the ongoing training of our sales team plays a key role.\n\nOur service employees and certified specialists, system engineers and consultants offer customers specialist knowledge, a high level of detailed expertise, many years of IT project experience and rapid implementation of individual requirements in the realisation of services. IT business architects also provide support with customised concepts and IT road maps, laying the foundations for future-proof IT architectures. Bechtle has bundled specialist know-how on complex IT solution topics in almost 90 nationwide competence centres and passes this knowledge on in training courses. Numerous certifications from all renowned vendors guarantee the premium qualification of our services. The goal of our Service Factory is to achieve economies of scale through standardised services.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\nDriven by ever-increasing digitalisation, the market for IT solutions and services is subject to constant change. In addition to the traditional business areas, consumption-based and cloud-based procure- Partner for digitalisation ment models continue to gain in importance. These options for procuring IT infrastructure, platforms, software and applications as a subscription-based service are being utilised by a growing number of customers and are gradually becoming the standard. The use of these models depends on a functional multi-cloud architecture. In this domain, Bechtle offers its customers comprehensive care from the consulting and design stages to the implementation and operation. Our offering also includes additional services for the network infrastructure and security. Accordingly, we are consistently expanding our portfolio of \"as-a-service\" offerings, managed cloud services and multi-cloud services.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is one of the topics of the future in the entire IT industry and therefore also at Bechtle. Although the technology is still at the beginning of its development in many respects, [ip.ai](http://ip.ai) Bechtle sees itself already well positioned here with the investment in PLANET AI and its involvement in the AI ecosystem Ipai. Other Bechtle Group companies also already offer various services with AI components. In the medium and long term, AI will further increase the demand for IT solution partners such as Bechtle.\n\nImage /page/36/Picture/3 description: Two women are sitting on a modular seating arrangement in a well-lit room.

With its house brand, Bechtle is currently represented in 14 European countries and has achieved a strong competitive position in all markets. The Bechtle Group is also active with the brands Inmac Wstore and Bechtle Comsoft in France and with ARP in the Netherlands. A new addition in the reporting period was Tangible Benefit in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe business in the IT E-Commerce segment is guided by two basic principles: On the one hand, there is the direct personal contact between the sales staff and the customer, which is ensured through active contact by telephone or videoconferencing. Sales plays a key role in realising business volumes by acquiring new customers and expanding business with existing customers. Especially customers with complex requirements benefit from the personal contacts, who offer individual solutions that are tailored to customer needs.\n\nLean processes Fulfilment principle On the other hand, the segment has established highly process-controlled, lean order processing workflows that are crucial to the success of the E-Commerce segment. To a certain extent, the underlying processes are even part of the actual service. For example, a large number of orders in IT E-Commerce are processed according to the fulfilment principle: Bechtle forwards incoming purchase orders directly to vendors or distributors, who then ship the goods to the customers on behalf of Bechtle. Bechtle ensures the quality of dispatch, which is also determined by speed, through agreements with partners and daily quality checks. The customer benefits in numerous respects: the networking of the online shops with the stocks of vendors and distributors enables high availability and up-to-date information. The delivery time, too, is aligned with customer needs: orders are usually delivered within 24 to 48 hours. Lean processes also ensure low process costs. The customer thus benefits from competitive prices, while Bechtle is still able to earn an attractive margin. We also keep stock levels low on the basis of the fulfilment principle, thereby reducing the risk of devaluations of IT products, which are characterised by very short innovation cycles. During the first half of 2023, the last remaining delivery difficulties, which had posed major challenges for the IT market in the previous two years, were finally overcome. This means that supply availability has returned to the high level seen before the outbreak of the pandemic and is therefore in line with the long-term average.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-38-0\"></span>CROSS-SEGMENT ACTIVITIES\n\n**Growing international presence.** In the past, Bechtle was present with both its operating segments only in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In 2022, the company crossed the borders of the DACH region for the first time with the IT System House & Managed Services segment and expanded its presence to other European countries, namely the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. France and Spain were added by acquisitions in the reporting period. In these countries, Bechtle addresses the market in both segments in order to increase the market penetration and the market share. Our extended acquisition strategy envisages a future presence with system house activities and services in other European countries in addition to the existing e-commerce companies.\n\nMany customers attach great importance to homogeneous IT landscapes across their own international locations. Therefore, internal Bechtle units focus on ensuring a global roll-out that is tailored to the customer's needs and preferences. With its uniform, central processes and service levels, Bechtle is well prepared for this task. Personal contacts of Bechtle are available in all 14 European countries in which Bechtle is present. We also work with the professional IT partners of our Global IT Alliance (GITA) worldwide.\n\n**Public Sector clients.** For many years, Bechtle has been intensively focusing on Public Sector clients. A special characteristic of this business lies in the special requirements of the tendering procedures. To ensure professional processing of these tenders, we have established the central Public Sector division as an internal service unit. This division supports the international local units in processing public tenders. For some time now, we have observed an increasing market consolidation trend among these clients, i.e. individual clients are forming joint buying centres. As a result, the tender volumes are going up, a development that benefits Bechtle – as one of Europe's leading market players with dedicated teams for the successful processing of even larger tenders – more than many of its competitors.\n\n**#OneBechtle.** Apart from the internal promise to function as a jointly operating unit, this concept also embodies the strategic intention of intensifying cooperation between the two segments by means Synergy effects of a multichannel approach, thus further interlocking them for synergy effects. On 1 January 2024, the pilot project \"OneBechtle AT\" that started in 2022 was implemented following a successful pilot phase. The merger of the Austrian Bechtle IT system houses with the sister company Bechtle direct Austria was finalised under the name Bechtle Austria GmbH. The two specialists in the aforementioned country market were also merged, thereby pooling their expertise. The aim is to serve customers holistically, regardless of the segment, thereby realising synergy effects and increasing customer penetration. In the medium term, the idea behind this combination could also be applied in the German and Swiss national markets.\n\n[See chapter](#page-48-0)  [Corporate culture,](#page-48-0)  [strategy and](#page-48-0)  [governance,](#page-48-0)  [page 49](#page-48-0)\n\n[gita.com](http://gita.com)\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-39-0\"></span>**Belgium United.** Similarly, the \"Belgium United\" project aims to enable closer collaboration between the existing units under a joint management. As of 31 December 2023, various departments, such as sales and marketing, were already managed centrally. This measure has made it possible to reduce complexity, make better use of resources, optimise cooperation and increase market presence vis-àvis both customers and suppliers.\n\n[bechtle.com](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en/)\n\n**Bechtle.com.** At this address, we present our customers with a cross-segment digital business platform that covers the entire range of our service and solution portfolio. We are now able to address every prospective and existing customer holistically and systematically offer additional solutions. Bechtle.com will be continuously expanded over the next few years in order to underpin Bechtle's multichannel approach. The digital business platform stands for the efficient procurement of IT infrastructure and IT services from a single source. In addition, bechtle.com offers customers and all other stakeholders information on all aspects of IT and thus serves as a knowledge platform. Digital Business Services – a unit that bundles business competencies and strategies – is responsible for the establishment and further development of the business. The unit's task is to connect customers and Bechtle digitally.\n\n#### [bechtle.com/remarketing](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en/it-services/bechtle-remarketing)\n\n**Remarketing.** Product life cycles for IT products are becoming ever shorter, especially due to innovations and further developments. This is why our company established Bechtle Remarketing GmbH back in 2012 – a business unit dedicated to topics related to the end of a product life cycle. In this context, information security, data protection and the responsible use of resources are key aspects. Our specialists take care of the secure deletion of company data and the resale of old devices or environmentally friendly disposal. Bechtle thus offers complete life-cycle support for IT hardware at two of its own locations.\n\nechtle.com/articona\n\n**Own brand ARTICONA.** The custom brand ARTICONA supplements Bechtle's product portfolio, especially with peripheral products. The product range includes IT accessories and extends from [bechtle.com/articona](https://www.bechtle.com/marken/articona) input devices such as keyboards and mice to various cables and adapters, storage devices, printer cartridges and even e-car accessories. The products are often offered as cross-selling products or as an alternative to comparable branded products.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### P R O C U R E M E N T **refurbishing/**\n\n**produktion endprodukt** \n\nWERTSCHÖPFUNGSKETTE IM BEREICH HARDWARE\n\n**Schmelze**\n\n**hersteller/ Distributor**\n\nAs a reliable and responsible IT partner, it is particularly important to us that basic labour, social and environmental standards are observed in the manufacture and transport of the IT hardware and software sold by Bechtle and in the provision of IT services. We are committed to the universal principles of the UN Global Compact and other internationally recognised environmental and human rights [globalcompact.de/en](https://www.globalcompact.de/en) standards. We fulfil this responsibility at our own locations and expect the same from our business partners.

Around 36,000 hardware and software products are available via IT system houses, the online shop and customised procurement platforms. We generate the largest share of our business volume through hardware, which is why we are focusing on this area when presenting the value chain.\n\nImage /page/40/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram of a production process. The process starts with \"Mine\", then goes to \"Smelter\", \"Metal processing\", and \"Component production\". From \"Component production\", the process goes to \"Bechtle\" and \"Customer/use\". From \"Customer/use\", the process goes to \"Reuse of the recycled raw materials\" and \"Refurbishing/reuse\". From \"Refurbishing/reuse\", the process goes to \"Recycling and disposal of components that cannot be used\". The process also includes \"Production of the final product\" and \"Manufacturer/distributor\".\n\n#### VALUE CHAIN IN THE HARDWARE SECTOR\n\ndelivery route\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nrecycled and any residual waste is disposed of appropriately.\n\n<span id=\"page-41-0\"></span>Raw materials such as rare-earth elements, copper, gold and lithium are mined and then processed in smelters. Raw materials and metals are processed in such a way that they can be used for the production of individual components. In production, the components are manufactured into the end product, which is delivered to Bechtle by one of our approximately 270 manufacturing partners or via distributors. In one of Bechtle's warehouses, orders are bundled according to customer requirements or devices are equipped with software ready for use. Some products are shipped directly to customers. The utilisation of products by our customers represents the longest phase of the value chain. After hardware has been used by customers, a large portion of it can be refurbished and placed back\n\n**Close cooperation with our partners.** As a trading partner, our influence on the upstream and downstream supply chain is limited, but we work closely and trustfully with our direct suppliers (Tier 1) on the topic of sustainability. During the reporting period, a \"Manufacturer's Sustainability Day\" was held at the Group headquarters for the first time, at which ten selected manufacturing part-\n\nners presented sustainable IT products – from PC mice to conference systems.\n\ninto the use cycle via Bechtle Remarketing.

Bechtle Germany, Italy and the Czech Republic have maintained their 4-Star status. Previously, the Bechtle units had successfully participated in an assessment in relation to the sustainability programme HP Amplify Impact. In subsequent workshops, the teams worked together on new project ideas. More than 100 employees took part in the sustainability training offered by HP on-site and digitally. Other Bechtle companies have also qualified for the programme.\n\n[corporate-governance](http://bechtle.com/corporate-governance)\n\n**Responsible purchasing.** In 2022, we revised the key points of the international standards on the environment and human rights that are important to us and integrated them into the Bechtle Supplier [bechtle.com/](http://bechtle.com/corporate-governance) Code of Conduct. We expect our suppliers to sign it. The new edition of the code also fulfils the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG). We began rolling out this updated version in the reporting period. It is to be signed successively by all partners.\n\n> As of 31 December 2023, 199 suppliers and manufacturers had signed the previous version of the Bechtle Supplier Code of Conduct. A total of 40 partners have presented their own policies, which overlap with our own code in all essential respects. In total, this accounts for 94.9 per cent of the purchasing volume.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                                          | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Number of suppliers and manufacturers                                    | 199  | 190  | 189  | 150  | 121  |\n| Number of suppliers and manufacturers<br>that submitted comparable codes | 40   | 59   | 39   | 51   | 23   |\n| Percentage of codes signed and submitted<br>in % of purchasing volume    | 94.9 | 94   | 93   | 93.1 | 90.6 |\n\n#### <span id=\"page-42-0\"></span>SIGNING THE BECHTLE SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT (PREVIOUS VERSION)\n\nSince 2022, we have been working with the EcoVadis supplier assessment tool, which enables us to track our suppliers' compliance with social and environmental standards using a document-based audit. By the end of 2023, the Sustainable Procurement team in the Vendor Management department was able to include suppliers that account for over 92 per cent of our purchasing volume in the assessment.\n\nBechtle's own brand ARTICONA offers a broad portfolio of IT accessories such as keyboards, cables, plugs and safety protection films for monitors. Based on the previous version of the Bechtle Supplier Code of Conduct, ARTICONA also presented its suppliers with a code, which all suppliers had signed by the reporting date of 31 December 2023.\n\nIn addition, over 200 ARTICONA products, such as notebook cases, backpacks, sleeves, smartphone cases and patch cables, now bear the Global Recycled Standard (GRS) seal. Products that are GRS certified contain recycled materials that have been independently verified at every stage of the supply chain – from the source to the end product. All certified ARTICONA products are made entirely from recycled materials.\n\n#### MARKETS\n\n**Broad positioning in terms of customer sizes and sectors.** We endeavour to identify the best possible IT solution to address the needs of each and every customer. And we have gained a very high level of expertise when it comes to servicing different customer groups. Even though our core target group is the upper SME market, we are also increasingly successful in the large company sector. Usually, we define our customers on the basis of the number of PC workspaces (or seats). And our customer group generally ranges from 50 to upwards of 10,000 PC workspaces.\n\nBechtle does not usually focus on individual industries. Our customers, therefore, include companies from all branches of industry, and we address each customer group in a different way. In view of the special requirements of the tendering procedures of Public Sector customers, we have introduced a more focused and hence individual approach to these customers. In this role, the central Public Sector division, as an internal service unit, supports the local entities when it comes to processing public invitations to tender.\n\nImage /page/42/Picture/9 description: The image shows a sun icon above the text \"Broad customer base\".\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-43-0\"></span>Stand: 31.

Moreover, our extended acquisition strategy envisages a future presence with system integration activities and services in other European countries in which we are already active with our trading business. With our own central Bechtle units, and with the support of partner companies of the Global IT Alliance (GITA) launched in 2014, we also support customers outside Europe.\n\n#### COMPETITIVE POSITION\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/6 description: The image contains the text \"bitkom.org/EN\" and a simple graphic above it that resembles a rounded rectangle with a vertical line extending from its top.\n\n**Germany's largest system house.** The IT market in Germany is highly fragmented. According to the German Federal Statistical Office, almost 93,000 IT companies in Germany offer products and services in the areas of IT hardware, software and IT services. These IT companies vary greatly with regard to their size, service spectrum and specialisation. Just over 80,000 of these IT companies only operate locally, and they generate revenue of no more than €1 million. Almost 12,000 companies generate annual revenue of up to €50 million. According to the German Federal Statistical Office, the group of medium-sized IT companies generating annual revenues of €50 to €250 million includes less than 300 companies. Only 55 companies, including Bechtle, are on the list of the largest companies active in Germany.\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/8 description: The image shows the text \"Sustainable leadership\" in a bold, sans-serif font. To the right of the text is a simple line drawing of a sun.\n\nIn Germany, Bechtle enjoys an excellent market position. In the ranking of the largest system houses, which was prepared by the professional publisher \"ChannelPartner\", our company was once again the number one in 2023, measured by domestic revenue.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-44-0\"></span>According to the industry association bitkom, the total volume of the German IT market (IT hardware, software and IT services) in 2023 amounted to €142.9 billion (prior year: €139.8 billion). With its reported annual business volume of around €4.7 billion in Germany in 2023, Bechtle's market share amounts to more than 3 per cent. Germany's ten largest system houses, which the professional publisher \"ChannelPartner\" assesses every year, jointly account for a market share of about 12 per cent. These figures show how fragmented the German IT market continues to be. As a group, small and medium-sized companies still account for the largest market share by far. Despite the ongoing consolidation pressure, this situation is unlikely to change in the medium term.\n\n#### RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n**Range of offers expanded with research into artificial intelligence.** As a pure service and trading company, Bechtle has previously only provided development services for software solutions and applications for its own purposes and as part of individual customer projects. The development costs incurred in the 2023 fiscal year were insignificant. The expenses for development amounted to approximately €11 million, about €4 million of which were capitalised. In the field of application solutions, we not only design, develop and implement software on behalf of customers, but also cover special industry requirements where required. Since the reporting period, Bechtle has also been active in the area of research for the first time. By acquiring a stake in PLANET AI, we are expanding our portfolio to include AI solutions in the area of intelligent document analysis. This acquisition means that more than 40 research and development specialists now complement our workforce.\n\n**MODUS Consult.** MODUS Consult GmbH is involved in development activities that are somewhat more significant. Among other things, it develops ERP solutions based on Microsoft Dynamics 365 for the food and beverage industry, mechanical and plant engineering, the plastics and metal industry and the furniture industry, as well as for wholesale companies. In customer projects, solutions are also implemented in the areas of Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Enterprise Content Management (ECM) and Business Intelligence (BI).\n\nIn addition to individual development work in customer projects, we have also carried out development work to update various industry solutions. To safeguard our ability to supply in future, these solutions have been converted for the next generation of Microsoft's cloud ERP suites. Thanks to the expansion of our SharePoint portfolio and integration of the processes with the Microsoft Power Platform, we can now offer the entire Microsoft Platform, including Office 365 and Microsoft Teams, to medium-sized companies.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the ECM projects, we use ELO and SharePoint products. In this area, MODUS Consult has also developed its own standard modules, which are deployed or customised in customer projects. This includes, above all, a universal document connector that ensures more interoperability.\n\nFurthermore, MODUS Consult assists customers in pure CRM projects, which are already highly cloud-oriented. The CRM portfolio includes marketing solutions as well as sales, service, user portal and support functions. MODUS Consult covers the area of business intelligence with Power BI.\n\n**PLANET AI.** In addition to providing other development services, PLANET AI GmbH focuses on intensive research in the area of artificial intelligence. At the core of this research is PLANETBRAIN. This is an AI platform with patented core technology, which forms the basis for the development of IDA (Intelligent Document Analysis). Another integral component of PLANETBRAIN is the perceptionmatrix technology, which enables the high-precision analysis of text, images and speech and, therefore, fundamentally changes data acquisition and processing. For example, handwritten and typewritten documents, receipts and texts can be processed automatically, document types classified and information extracted. Intelligent document analysis is already being used in various areas. These include logistics, traffic monitoring, banking, insurance, healthcare and archives.\n\nPLANET AI's international research collaborations with universities and research institutions are a key element of these activities. Joint research, close collaboration and the continuous exchange of knowledge and technological advances make a significant contribution towards strengthening the research and development of artificial intelligence.\n\n**In the future, artificial intelligence will make our operations even more efficient, leaving more time for personal exchange. Bechtle already provides plenty of opportunities in this area.** \n\nSigrid Gebhardt, HR Coordinator – Administration/Organisation, System House Stuttgart\n\nSteffen Kleindienst, Global Account Manager, System House Stuttgart\n\nAntje Keller, Communications & Change Office – Management Assistant, System House Stuttgart\n\nEmre Beydogan, Service Owner – Service Desk, System House Stuttgart\n\nfrom left to right\n\nImage /page/45/Picture/12 description: In an indoor shot, three people are standing and one person is sitting inside a small office space.

As such, our corporate culture plays an important role in the performance and motivation of each individual. The applied values at Bechtle provide all employees with a high degree of freedom, along with business responsibility. The long-term orientation of the strategy, underpinned by our vision, also brings with it a high degree of reliability. This is essential for employees, but also for customers, partners and the capital market. Because of this, our business is managed in the short, medium and long term using established systems and processes.\n\n### VISION AND STRATEGY\n\n**Corporate culture forms the basis.** The basic values of the Bechtle Group have remained unchanged for years. They are mentioned in the corporate philosophy, which is part of every employment contract. The four defining values are:\n\n- � Integrity\n- � Perseverance\n- � Reliability\n- � Enthusiasm\n\nThese basic values constitute a central element of our corporate culture. In conjunction with our internal management principles, our Code of Conduct, Vision 2030 and the Bechtle Sustainability and Climate Protection Strategy 2030, they underpin our long-term strategic objectives. They provide all employees and other stakeholders with guidance on efficient and sustainable corporate management and control. Entrepreneurial thinking and behaviour are also a fundamental part of our culture: Employees at Bechtle are given entrepreneurial responsibility at a very early stage – this is both a promise and an obligation.\n\n**Long-term orientation ensures sustainable success.** On the basis of the firmly established corporate culture, Bechtle has formulated its long-term goals in a vision every ten years or so since [bechtle.com/de-en/](http://bechtle.com/de-en/vision2030) the company was founded. The Vision 2030 was published in 2018 and is entitled \"Bechtle: Integrate IT. Architect the future\". It determines goals in the following areas:\n\n� customer orientation, measured on the basis of the customer's success;\n\n� our expertise, professionalism and passion in handling IT, combined with the promise to\n\n- the workforce that at Bechtle, everything can be achieved;\n- � the quest for market leadership; and\n\n� the necessity to achieve profitable growth in order to be able to invest in Bechtle's future.\n\nOur fundamental values provide orientation\n\n[vision2030](http://bechtle.com/de-en/vision2030)\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\nWir übernehmen Verantwortung entlang unserer Wertschöpfungskette und achten auf die Einhaltung\n\nUnser Team ist begeistert, exzellent ausgebildet und\n\nSelbstverständnis.\n\nder Menschenrechte.

The content of Vision 2030 is dealt with meaningfully in the context of sustainability. The sustainability strategy combines economic, ecological and social aspects and contains strategic goals that are underpinned by specific measures. It therefore creates orientation and transparency at the same time. The Bechtle Sustainability Strategy 2030 focuses on four strategic fields of action, each of which is associated with three key topics and long-term goals. Additionally, we have developed a sustainability programme that defines milestones and determines suitable operating measures. We are therefore able to measure our progress transparently and take any necessary corrective action. 1. Arbeitgeberattraktivität 2.

It is another building block in our sustainability activities that contributes to the goals of the Paris Climate Protection Agreement. The avoidance and reduction of CO₂ emissions form the core of the climate protection strategy.\n\nThe reduction targets for the greenhouse gas CO₂ relate to the areas we can influence and are distributed across the various emission categories along the value chain according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the so-called scopes. The aim is to reduce emissions according to Scope 1 (company facilities and vehicle fleet) and Scope 2 (purchased energy for own use) by 60 per cent by 2030. The reduction in Scope 3 emissions, which relates to the upstream and downstream value chain, should be 30 per cent (base year 2019). The ambitious road map is based on the science-based reduction targets of the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi).\n\n**Employer branding strengthens competitiveness.** The shortage of specialists and managers throughout the IT sector and demographic trends emphasise the importance of HR work and employer branding. Training and staff development are critical success factors for the implementation of our strategy and the pursuit of our long-term growth targets. Bechtle's HR work has always focused on the training of young people and on further training measures for existing employees. Our aim is to provide innovative, solution-orientated and efficient concepts for customers' IT using highly qualified personnel. In this way, we endeavour to secure a competitive position in an environment marked by rapid change.\n\n**Acquisitions are part of the growth strategy.** We plan to reach the goals of Vision 2030 both through organic growth and by means of acquisitions. As far as organic growth is concerned, we can build on some 40 years of experience in the IT market and our high market penetration. From the outset, takeovers have been part of Bechtle's growth strategy. Since the company was founded, Bechtle has successfully completed 113 acquisitions. In the past, growth through acquisitions was achieved mainly by acquiring small to medium-sized system integrators. However, in our search for suitable acquisition candidates, we often also look at larger businesses. From a geographical perspective, the declared aim of the expanded 2021 M&A strategy is to expand our range of services to all 14 countries in which we already have a trading presence, in the medium term. In all acquisitions, it is primarily important to us that the target company strengthens the market position of the Bechtle Group regionally and in terms of customers and/or performance. Therefore, we aim to supplement our IT-specific expertise and intensive processing of strategically important markets and customer groups in order to gain market share.\n\n[For an overview](#page-77-0)  [of the Scope 1–3 emissions,](#page-77-0)  [see Environment,](#page-77-0)  [page 78f](#page-77-0)\n\n[See People,](#page-61-0)  [page 62ff](#page-61-0)\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Digital future for our customers.** Bechtle has been active in the IT market for 40 years. This market is characterised by rapid technological development, resulting in constantly changing market requirements. One of the main pillars of our success is our ability to adapt our portfolio and business model to the latest market requirements. This is also the case right now: the IT market is currently undergoing a paradigm shift. In the past, most of our customers used to operate their own IT landscape, and IT partners such as Bechtle were merely involved on a project-specific basis. Though this model will not disappear entirely, the digital transformation and the growing complexity of IT will drive the demand for subscription- and consumption-based IT service models, which will be accompanied by a higher demand for solution-oriented IT consulting. In recent years, Bechtle has focussed its strategy on actively shaping this change and expanding the share of business volume in these consumption-based IT solutions. However, we will not lose sight of our traditional business and, above all, will continue to strengthen our most important asset – customer proximity.\n\n**In addition to advising customers, our experts increasingly coach them on a long-term basis. Suitable acquisitions strengthen the skillset in order to accommodate this change even more effectively.**\n\nVerena Boll, Digital Service Consultant, Bechtle AG\n\nKarl-Heinz Kramer, Head of Mergers & Acquisitions /Corporate Development, Bechtle AG\n\nTeresa Limbrunner, Digital Business Management Consultant, Bechtle AG\n\nfrom left to right\n\nImage /page/49/Picture/9 description: In an indoor shot, three smiling professionals are posing in a modern office setting.

The main objective of the company development is to sustainably increase the value of the company through profitable growth.\n\nThe short- and medium-term planning for controlling the operational units and the resulting measures are derived from the long-term corporate planning. At the same time, they are geared towards the development of the competitive and market environment. The company endeavours to boost its growth and returns through successful customers and attainment of market leadership at the respective location.\n\nBusiness volume, revenue, revenue growth, gross margin or contribution margin, earnings before taxes (EBT) and the EBT margin are relevant key performance indicators for the defined economic targets. Individual profit-sharing motivates the majority of employees to pursue the agreed targets with commitment.\n\nVarious reporting systems ensure that all units always have an overview of the performance indicators relevant to them and can manage the business operations accordingly. At group level, this data is then aggregated and used for the coordination of investment and financing decisions, the early identification of target/actual variances and the initiation of suitable measures. The cash flow cockpit has become increasingly important in recent years. It regularly provides all individual companies with a detailed view of their cash flows. A new controlling system is also currently being installed in order to meet the requirements of the growing size of the Bechtle Group in the future. Non-financial targets are also continuously recorded and evaluated in sustainability controlling.\n\nBechtle has defined important non-financial targets as part of the Sustainability Strategy 2030 and the Climate Protection Strategy published in 2022. In line with the decentralised structure of the Bechtle Group, the issue of sustainability is anchored within the Group in an agile manner via the relevant specialist departments and companies and therefore forms an integral part of the operating business.\n\n[See below and in the](#page-151-0)  [Sustainability Programme,](#page-151-0)  [Development of the Group,](#page-151-0)  [page 152ff](#page-151-0)\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT\n\nClimate protection and environmental protection are among the greatest challenges of our age. Furthermore, topics such as the protection of human rights throughout the value chain are gaining in importance. Sustainability in all of its facets is therefore a subject area that is increasingly attracting public attention. This is accompanied by further regulatory requirements from legislators, both nationally and at European level. This, in turn, results in new requirements for sustainability reporting and governance in companies. Governance, environmental and social aspects have been a fixture of our corporate processes and structures for a long time now and are subject to ongoing adjustment.\n\nSince June 2021, Bechtle's Sustainability Management department has been responsible for the implementation and further development of the sustainability and climate protection strategy throughout the group. In the reporting period, it reported directly to the Chairman of the Executive Board, Dr Thomas Olemotz, as a staff unit and is also the central point of contact within the Bechtle Group. This allows us to increase the transparency and controllability of our sustainability activities. From 1 February 2024, Sustainability Management will report to the Executive Board member Antje Leminsky, who will take over the department. At the operational level, a decentralised, agile \"Core Team Sustainability\" works on specific subjects in close coordination with Sustainability Management. The core team includes sustainability controlling, sustainable purchasing, central logistics and sustainability communication and reporting. Other central departments, such as Human Resources, Quality Management or Legal provide advice as specialised departments as and when required. In addition, there is a sustainability community in which more than 150 people from more than 100 Bechtle companies in Germany and abroad are now networked with one another. At least once a year, the entire Executive Board comes together in order to make decisions concerning further orientation, measures and investments. To assess our sustainability performance, we focus on the analyses of the sustainability rating agency EcoVadis, which are also managed by Sustainability Management. In January 2024, we received the EcoVadis gold medal for the first time with 73 out of 100 points.\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT IN THE BECHTLE GROUP\n\nNACHHALTIGKEITSMANAGEMENT BECHTLE GRUPPE\n\n<span id=\"page-52-0\"></span>**Nachhaltigkeitskommunikation und -berichterstattung**\n\nImage /page/52/Figure/2 description: The image shows an organizational chart for sustainability within the Bechtle Group.

The NFR Index provides an overview.\n\n**Stakeholder integration.** By means of a detailed analysis, we have identified Bechtle's main stakeholder groups as follows:\n\n- � Owners/shareholders\n- � Employees\n- � Customers (companies and public clients)\n- � Suppliers/partners\n- � General public\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\nEach stakeholder group has its very own interests, expectations of the company and objectives that could also be contradictory. We therefore balance stakeholder perspectives with our own interests and goals in order to find the best possible path for all parties.\n\nThe following table presents an overview of the most important sustainability topics for our stakeholders:\n\n| Stakeholder group                            | Expectations of Bechtle / material topics                                                                                                                      |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Owners/shareholders1                         | ■ Profitable growth<br>■ Customer satisfaction<br>■ Expertise in new technologies                                                                              |\n| Customers (companies and<br>public clients)1 | ■ Information security and data protection/confidentiality<br>■ Customer satisfaction / sustainable customer relationships<br>■ Training and further education |\n| Employees1                                   | ■ Climate and environmental protection2<br>■ Occupational health and safety2<br>■ Diversity and equal opportunities2<br>■ Corporate culture and values2        |\n| Suppliers/partners1                          | ■ Information security and data protection/confidentiality<br>■ Fair competition<br>■ Profitable growth                                                        |\n| Public3                                      | ■ Social responsibility / social commitments in the region<br>■ Transparent reporting<br>■ Climate and environmental protection                                |\n\n#### KEY TOPICS OF THE BECHTLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\n1 The prioritisation of sustainability aspects is based on the results of the 2015 stakeholder survey and the scoring model used there. For the scoring model cf. Kühnapfel, J. B. (2014): Nutzwertanalysen (Benefit analyses); and Nöllke, M. (2015): Entscheidungen (Decisions).\n\n² All aspects mentioned were designated as “very important”.\n\n<sup>2</sup> All aspects mentioned were designated as \"very important\". <sup>3</sup> The topics were prioritised on the basis of a qualitative evaluation using the Sustainability Code database (deutscher-nachhaltigkeitskodex.de) and the results of the survey of specialist managers on the key non-financial topics.\n\nThe Annual Report (and the Sustainability Report between 2015 and 2021) plays an important role in communicating with our stakeholders. In it, we describe our economic, social and ecological performance and impact based on qualitative and quantitative performance indicators. By way of the reporting, we also provide insight into the processes and structures of the Bechtle Group.\n\nWe also use other publications to keep our stakeholders up to date. These include, for example, the customer magazine Bechtle update, the Bechtle website, social media and press releases. Employ- <bechtle.com/de-en/newsroom> ees are also informed via the Bechtle intranet and e-mail. Staff enter into personal dialogue with management via internal events, feedback formats or regular discussions with line managers.\n\nPersonal discussions or customer trade fairs, such as the Bechtle CDays, determine the dialogue with our customers, manufacturers and partners. We also organise student workshops and university events on sustainability.\n\nImage /page/54/Picture/11 description: The image shows a simple line drawing of an open book.

For 40 years, we have stood for IT expertise, partnership and being future-readiness. Bechtle has 100 system house locations in seven European countries and trading companies in 14 countries in Western and Central Europe. Our success is based on the principle of networked decentralisation. Each individual company in the Bechtle Group operates independently and maintains the vital direct contact with our more than 70,000 customers. The holding, in turn, performs central services for all group companies in a cost-efficient manner and coordinates cooperation between the local units.\n\n#### LEGAL STRUCTURE\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/6 description: The image shows the text \"Autonomous operations of subsidiaries\" on the left and a sun icon on the upper right.\n\n**Customer orientation even in the legal structure.** The networked decentralisation model provides the more than 120 regional and international subsidiaries with plenty of leeway to arrange their operations, thereby enabling them to focus on their core business. At the same time, they benefit from the central functions as well as the competence and organisation of a European group of companies. This is also reflected in our legal structure: The Bechtle Group has a conventional holding structure. As the parent and holding company for the entire group of companies, Bechtle AG is responsible for all overarching tasks such as digital business services, finance and taxes, human resources and personnel development, platform strategy, investor relations, group controlling, marketing, mergers & acquisitions, sustainability management, legal and compliance, risk management, corporate communications and central IT.\n\nBechtle Logistik & Service GmbH is also allocated to the holding. The group's competencies in the fields of address management, purchasing, logistics, warehousing and shipping, sales and partner marketing, price management, product management and software product management, as well as public and major accounts, are bundled here.\n\nA layer of various holding companies has been implemented directly under Bechtle AG. The business segments and brands of the two segments IT System House & Managed Services and IT E-Commerce are bundled at this level, which is involved mainly in business development.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### HOLDING STRUCTURE OF THE BECHTLE GROUP\n\nHOLDINGSTRUKTUR DES BECHTLE KONZERNS\n\n**Bechtle Managed Services holding AG**\n\n**Bechtle Systemhaus holding AG**\n\n**Bechtle Systemhaus holding AG**\n\n**Bechtle Managed Services holding AG** **Bechtle holding Schweiz AG**\n\n**Bechtle holding Schweiz AG**\n\n> **Bechtle e-commerce holding AG**\n\n> **Bechtle e-commerce holding AG**\n\nThe legally independent subsidiaries are allocated to the second holding level. Almost all subsidiaries are wholly owned by Bechtle AG, either directly or via investment companies.\n\nObjectives of this two-level holding structure:\n\n- � To relieve the decentralised subsidiaries of administrative and cross-company work, thereby ensuring focus on the core business\n- � To bundle competencies and resources in order to generate synergies, e.g. by achieving economies of scale in purchasing and logistics, thereby enabling more sustainable operations\n- � To centrally provide outsourcing and cloud services, in particular, in order to optimise the capacity utilisation throughout the group and to provide specialised services on a supra-regional basis\n- � To outline clearly aligned lean leadership responsibilities and competencies, which are vital in view of the size of the Bechtle Group\n\nIn the reporting period, the Executive Board did not significantly change the existing legal structure of the Bechtle Group.\n\nBechtle AG operates according to the traditional dualistic principle. The Executive Board is the statutory body that decides on the management of the company and represents it externally. Additionally, Bechtle has a Supervisory Board, half of which is elected by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and the other half by the German employees of the Bechtle Group. The Supervisory Board serves as a controlling body, appoints the Executive Board and monitors its work.\n\n[For an overview](#page-261-0)  [of the subsidiaries](#page-261-0) [see Notes,](#page-261-0) [page 262 ff](#page-261-0)\n\nResource savings\n\n[See Report of the](#page-16-0)  [Supervisory Board,](#page-16-0)  [page 17 ff](#page-16-0)\n\nImage /page/56/Picture/17 description: The image shows a book icon with text below it that says \"For an overvi\".\n\nSee Report of the\nSupervisory Board\npage 17 ff.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-57-0\"></span>MANAGEMENT\n\n**Networked decentralisation stands for corporate success.** The hierarchical separation of the strategic group management, for which the Executive Board is responsible, from the leadership of the operational units and from the direct customer contact is the most prominent feature of the management structure. In this way, Bechtle underlines the principle of networked decentralisation, which is rooted in the business model. At the same time, this concept enables us to stay abreast of the extensive and continually growing management tasks as well as the highly dynamic development of the business environment.\n\n[bechtle.com/](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en/about-bechtle/company/management) [management](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en/about-bechtle/company/management) The Executive Vice Presidents serve as links between the group's Executive Board and the operational units:\n\n- � Three group-wide Executive Vice Presidents: for the Public Sector division, for the Central Finance department as well as a Chief Technology Officer, who is responsible for all platform activities of the Bechtle Group,\n- � Two Executive Vice Presidents in the IT E-Commerce segment: for Germany, Austria and Switzerland and for the regions of Ireland, Southern Europe and Eastern Europe,\n- � Eight Executive Vice Presidents in the IT System House & Managed Services segment: for the German north/east, west, centre and south regions as well as the International Sales division, the Managed Services division, Application Solutions, PLM/Engineering & Manufacturing, the system house activities in Switzerland as well as the German south-west region and Austria.\n\nThe position of Vice President was filled for the first time at the beginning of 2024. Marijke Kasius assumed cross-segment responsibility in one country market and is responsible for all companies of the Bechtle Group in the Netherlands. Another Vice President will be responsible for all activities of the Bechtle Group in France from April 2024. As a result, the position of Executive Vice President, who was responsible for France, Benelux and the UK until 31 December 2023, was no longer filled.\n\nImage /page/57/Picture/9 description: The image shows the text \"Responsible business\" in bold font, with a sun icon above the word \"business\".\n\nAt the locations of the Bechtle Group, the Managing Directors alone are responsible for the success of their companies. By way of their strictly earnings-oriented variable compensation, each Managing Director directly participates in the success of the respective company. Bechtle thus promotes and supports the entrepreneurial spirit and business responsibility at all locations in order to ensure successful business performance on a long-term basis.\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-58-0\"></span>LOCATIONS\n\n**Largest location: Headquarters in Neckarsulm.** The Bechtle Group is headquartered in Neckarsulm, Germany. Apart from Bechtle AG and the Neckarsulm IT System House, Logistik & Service GmbH and the German intermediate holding companies are also based here. With 2,445 employees, Neckarsulm is our group's largest location. In total, the Bechtle Group has more than 100 operating companies. The majority of the IT system houses and service and trading companies are located in Germany, which is also Bechtle's most important national market. However, Bechtle generates around 39 per cent of its business volume internationally. In terms of business volume, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland are the most important markets there.\n\n[For an overview of the](#page-261-0)  [subsidiaries,](#page-261-0) [see Notes,](#page-261-0) [page 262 ff](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/58/Figure/4 description: This image shows a map of Europe with country codes.

In order to ensure the important regional presence, we have a comprehensive international network of more than 100 IT system houses. In this structure, the Managing Directors of the operating subsidiaries act in the capacity of independent entrepreneurs with a high level of personal responsibility in their local markets. In the course of the realignment of the acquisition strategy, the expansion of our service business beyond Germany, Austria and Switzerland was continued through several acquisitions in the 2023 reporting period. The network of system houses thus extends across Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and, since this reporting period, also France and Spain. The objective of the internationalisation strategy is to further expand system house activities outside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, in order to strengthen Bechtle's market and competitive position in the national markets already covered by the IT E-Commerce segment.\n\n**Seven acquisitions in six European countries.** In the reporting period, Bechtle acquired seven companies in six European countries: the UK, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France, Spain and Germany. The UK-based value-added reseller Tangible Benefit Ltd. has been part of the Bechtle Group since March 2023. Founded in 1997, this IT company is based in the City of London. In the 2021/22 fiscal year, Tangible Benefit's business volume totalled around €70 million. In April, Bechtle acquired the VMware and software specialist Fondo ICT Professionals B.V., thereby strengthening its market presence in the Netherlands. With 42 employees, Fondo generated a business volume of around €41 million in the 2022 fiscal year. In the area of 3D printing, the Bechtle Group strengthened its position in May with the acquisition of SGSolution AG. Founded in 2008, the company is based in Wallisellen, near Zurich, and generated a business volume of CHF 4.1 million in the 2022 fiscal year. In August, Bechtle acquired Prosol Ingeniería S.L. and Prosol Iscat S.L., thereby supplementing its portfolio in Spain with IT services for the first time. Prosol employs 50 people and achieved a business volume of around €15 million in 2022. The company's two sites are located near Madrid and Barcelona. Prosol has been active as a system integrator for industrial enterprises in the Spanish market since 1996. The IT consulting company sastema GmbH, a specialist in identity & access management (IAM), governance, risk & compliance management and information security, also joined Bechtle in August. The company was founded in 2018, is based near Frankfurt am Main, employs 21 people and achieved a business\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\nvolume of €2.2 million in the 2022 fiscal year. With its investment in PLANET AI, Bechtle brought an AI specialist in-house in October 2023. Bechtle acquired a 51 per cent stake in this Rostock-based company. PLANET AI, which is active in the field of deep learning, is a spin-off of PLANET intelligent systems GmbH and has been developing its own technological solutions for intelligent document analysis and process automation since 2015. With effect from 5 October 2023, Bechtle completed the acquisition of the French cybersecurity and IT infrastructure service provider APIXIT, thereby expanding its existing portfolio to include IT services in an additional European country. With APIXIT, we have a well-established IT service provider that is rooted with ten locations in the French market. Around 340 employees generated a business volume of €85 million in the 2021/22 fiscal year. APIXIT has a clear portfolio focus on cybersecurity, accounting for over 45 per cent of business volume, and also has a security operations centre for all security-related IT services.\n\nImage /page/60/Picture/2 description: Three people are posing for a picture.

Bechtle benefits from the great diversity of various cultures and nationalities, different genders and a wide age structure of its workforce. Bechtle offers a respectful and appreciative working environment, a wide range of training and development opportunities and plenty of scope for individual ideas and talents. Rising application figures and the positive result of a Group-wide satisfaction survey among all employees are proof of our company's attractiveness as an employer. **11.487 12.180 12.880** 9.383 8.955 3.225 3.497\n\n10.083 3.963\n\n**10.603 4.556**\n\n**14.046**\n\n**15.159 (+ 7,9 %)**\n\n#### DEVELOPMENT OF THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES\n\n**Number of employees grows by 7.9 per cent.** As of 31 December 2023, Bechtle employed 15,159 people across the Group. Compared to the previous year (14,046 employees), the workforce grew by 1,113 people or 7.9 per cent. Around half of these, 554 people, joined Bechtle through acquisitions in the course of the reporting period. The purely organic growth amounted to 4.0 per cent, a relatively small increase compared to that of previous years. This was due to the challenging situation currently prevailing in Bechtle's main sales markets. Expressed in full-time equivalents (FTE), an average of 14,135 employees worked for Bechtle (prior year: 12,898), which represents an increase of 1,237 people or 9.6 per cent. As an internationally active IT enterprise, Bechtle's workforce is marked by a great diversity of cultures and nationalities. In 2023, our company had employees from 110 different nations (prior year: 101).\n\nYear on year, our headcount in Germany went up by 520, an increase of 5.2 per cent. Internationally, 593 more people were employed by Bechtle, an increase of 15.0 per cent. Besides other factors, this was due to the acquisitions that took place in the year ended in France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Spain and the UK. At 30.1 per cent, almost a third of all employees were working internationally for Bechtle at the end of 2023 (previous year 28.2 per cent).\n\n| EMPLOYEES BY REGIONS |   |       |       |       |        |        |        |        |        | as of 31 December |  |\n|----------------------|---|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------------|--|\n|                      | 0 | 2,000 | 4,000 | 6,000 | 8,000  | 10,000 | 12,000 | 14,000 | 16,000 | Total             |  |\n| 2019                 |   |       |       |       | 8,424  |        | 3,063  |        |        | 11,487            |  |\n| 2020                 |   |       |       |       | 8,955  |        | 3,225  |        |        | 12,180            |  |\n| 2021                 |   |       |       |       | 9,383  |        | 3,497  |        |        | 12,880            |  |\n| 2022                 |   |       |       |       | 10,083 |        | 3,963  |        |        | 14,046            |  |\n| 2023                 |   |       |       |       | 10,603 |        | 4,556  |        |        | 15,159 (+7.9%)    |  |\n\nGermany International\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n**11.223**\n\n**11.853** \n\n**12.529** \n\n**13.661** \n\n**11.487 12.180**\n\n**14.773 (+ 8,1 %)**\n\nBroken down by function, the number of employees in the service sector rose by 588 people or 9.2 per cent.

The personnel expense ratio increased from 16.3 per cent to 17.0 per cent. The personnel intensity grew slightly to 60.3 per cent (prior year: 60.0 per cent) in relation to the gross profit.\n\n#### PERSONNEL EXPENSES\n\n|                                                   | 2023    | 2022  | 2021  |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------|-------|-------|\n| Personnel and social expenses                     | 1,091.1 | 983.1 | 879.1 |\n| Personnel and social expenses per employee (FTE)* | 79.2    | 78.3  | 74.6  |\n| Personnel expense ratio                           | 17.0    | 16.3  | 16.6  |\n| €m                                                |         |       |       |\n| €k                                                |         |       |       |\n| %                                                 |         |       |       |\n\n\\* Excluding absent employees\n\nOur compensation policy is based on market-oriented pay. We create individual performance incentives in the form of variable salary components, aligning them with business interdependencies. Whether or not a variable salary component is granted usually depends on the function and on the salary amount.\n\n#### EDUCATION AND TRAINING\n\n**Facing the shortage of skilled workers with training.** Our goal is to increasingly meet the growing need for experts and executives from our own ranks. Therefore, Bechtle attaches great importance to training, the development of employees and executives and knowledge management. The Staff Development department designs and organises development programmes centrally for experts and executives for the companies in Germany and abroad, and accompanying programmes for apprentices and students on integrated degree programmes and the trainee programme. The Bechtle Academy supplements the offering with a broad training portfolio for the employees of all hierarchy levels.\n\nWe endeavour to attract interested, talented applicants to Bechtle. A transparent, fair and streamlined application process and fast decisions are of particular importance to us. We support young people in choosing a career and create opportunities for them to discover jobs in IT through internships and various events. In the reporting period, Bechtle was again awarded the employer label \"MINT Minded Company\" in recognition of its special interest in students, graduates and talents in the fields of maths, IT, science and technology.\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n842 trainees\n\nBechtle has always attached importance to the training of young people in order to meet the need for qualified junior staff. We view training as an investment in the future for the purpose of actively forestalling a shortage of qualified staff. We have been training apprentices for 38 years now, and have established ourselves as a sought-after training company for numerous commercial and technical professions. We also offer integrated degree programmes in various economic and technical subjects. All in all, we have training offerings in 23 professions and degree programmes.\n\n| DISTRIBUTION OF TRAINING PROFESSIONS AND DEGREE PROGRAMMES<br>as of 31 December |      |      |      |      |      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                                                                                 | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Administrative trainees                                                         | 307  | 288  | 226  | 235  | 248  |\n| Technical trainees                                                              | 426  | 401  | 371  | 363  | 370  |\n| Administrative students                                                         | 69   | 67   | 53   | 54   | 50   |\n| Technical students                                                              | 40   | 37   | 41   | 35   | 35   |\n| Total                                                                           | 842  | 793  | 691  | 687  | 703  |\n\nIn 2023, a total of 299 young people embarked on their training or integrated degree programme with our company. That's more than ever before. A total of 842 young people were in training at the end of the reporting period, 118 of whom were international. Year on year, the number of apprentices and students and integrated degree programmes thus went up by 6.2 per cent. At the head office in Neckarsulm, the training ratio was 8.2 per cent (previous year: 8.1 per cent). In Germany, it amounted to 6.8 per cent, also slightly more than in the prior year (6.6 per cent). We have set ourselves the goal of increasing the proportion of trainees in Germany to about 10 per cent by 2030.\n\n| TRAINING RATIO IN GERMANY |   | as of 31 December |      |      |      |      |      |\n|---------------------------|---|-------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                           |   | Target            | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Training ratio            | % | 10                | 6.8  | 6.6  | 6.5  | 6.7  | 7.3  |\n\nUpon successful completion of the training, we are able to offer almost all trainees and students on dual study programmes permanent employment contracts.\n\n**The focus is on employee qualification.** Our goal is to continuously improve the quality of our training offers and thus the competencies of all employees. The Bechtle Academy, which was established by the company back in 1999, backs the individual training at the group locations, offering all employees a comprehensive qualification programme. From an organisational perspective, the academy's activities take place under the umbrella of the staff development department. The department's task is to support the achievement of the growth targets of the Bechtle Group by means of suitable strategic staff development measures. The academy's offering ranges from ongoing training measures to the acquisition of special skills to personal development seminars. Since 2023, the Bechtle Academy has also been responsible for the \"Release your Potential\" support programme for women, which was first implemented in 2022.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### BECHTLE ACADEMY OFFERING: ONLINE AND CLASSROOM SEMINARS\n\n|                                         | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  | 2019  |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Number of participants                  | 9,871 | 9,428 | 7,668 | 4,991 | 7,425 |\n| Number of persons who completed courses | 787   | 754   | 625   | 401   | 540   |\n\nAdditionally, our learning platform, Learning Campus, features numerous e-learning courses for a wide spectrum of subjects. Our target group-specific training offering addresses both newcomers and professionals. Courses are available in German and English. All Bechtle employees have access to this system. The objective of this platform is to ensure uniform, state-of-the-art knowledge at all locations, thereby further expanding our competitiveness.\n\nMoreover, the learning platform helps us to achieve flexibility in terms of place and time and increases the satisfaction of the participants, who are able to learn at their own pace. What is more, we reduce emissions and expenses for training-related business trips.\n\n#### BECHTLE E-LEARNING CAMPUS OFFERING\n\n|                                         | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of e-learning courses*           | 308    | 264    | 207    | 246    | 138    |\n| Number of persons who completed courses | 84,210 | 58,150 | 68,611 | 35,459 | 10,308 |\n\n\\* Including occupational safety, health protection and information security training\n\nThe Bechtle Academy is also responsible for the monthly introductory events for new colleagues. Moreover, all employees can take courses at the Bechtle training centres or participate in external training measures.\n\n**Diverse development opportunities.** In 2020, we provided managers with binding guidelines by publishing the new Bechtle Leadership Principles. The Group-wide leadership initiative launched at the same time was also continued in 2023, as was the Bechtle leadership feedback programme. The objective of all measures is to further improve leadership skills in order to boost employee satisfaction and make an important contribution to the realisation of the Vision 2030.\n\nFurthermore, we have two programmes for the development of executives from our own ranks. The Bechtle Junior Management Programme (JuMP) has the orientation \"Leader\". It is aimed at employees without or with only initial management experience and prepares them for taking on more advanced executive roles. The Bechtle General Management Programme (GMP) focuses on corporate management and prepares managers to take on management tasks.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nIntroduced in 2022, the Bechtle JuMP Expert Programme, a development programme for proven experts who explicitly do not wish to take on disciplinary management responsibility, is now offered on a regular basis following a very positive pilot phase.\n\nBesides leadership development, the Bechtle IT Business Architects Programme (IT BA) offers employees with outstanding professional skills attractive development options.\n\n#### PARTICIPANTS IN BECHTLE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES\n\n|                                                   | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Bechtle Junior Management Programme (JuMP) Leader | 106  | 120  | 85   | 109  |\n| Bechtle Junior Management Programme (JuMP) Expert | 59   | 21   | –    | –    |\n| Bechtle General Management Programme (GMP)        | 13   | 11   | 11   | 19   |\n| Bechtle IT Business Architect Programme (IT BA)   | 16   | 17   | 12   | 12   |\n\nAll staff-development programmes promote intensive interchange among the participants and within the entire company, in order to share knowledge and experience and to learn from each other.\n\nTo make it easier for university graduates to start their careers, we offer them a wide range of attractive entry-level and qualification programmes. For example, this includes the Bechtle trainee programme. Over a period of nine months, the trainees are prepared for taking over a specialist position. The programme is a combination of theoretical and practical training tailored to the candidates' intended career path. Two training courses have taken place every year since 2019. In 2023, 24 people attended the trainee programme.\n\n**Career jumpers programme successfully continued.** In September 2022, Bechtle launched a career jumpers programme in cooperation with the Provadis University of Applied Sciences in Frankfurt am Main to counter the shortage of skilled workers. In a custom-developed certificate course, we offer people without any previous IT experience access to jobs in IT sales and further specialisation in the fields of cloud, IT security, modern workplace and network solutions. In addition to the training courses at the Bechtle Academy, custom-tailored courses are offered through the private, nationally accredited Provadis School of International Management and Technology AG in Frankfurt am Main. At more than 100 national and European Bechtle locations, the participants gain hands-on skills. In the reporting period, 42 participants (previous year: 18 participants) completed this programme and started their career at Bechtle.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### EMPLOYER ATTRACTIVENESS\n\n**Work culture – Work@Bechtle.** As a forward-looking employer, we offer entrepreneurial freedom with clear goals, appreciation and solidarity in a strong team, as well as many opportunities to adapt the work-life balance. Flat hierarchies enable all employees to take on responsibility at an early stage and develop an entrepreneurial mindset. Employee satisfaction and a secure and appreciative work environment are essential components of our work culture.\n\nWe want our employees to have sufficient room in their professional lives for their respective personal situation. This is guided by our Work@Bechtle concept introduced throughout the group in the summer of 2021. This describes the amalgamation of workplace and working time flexibility and modern communications technology to create a productive working environment. Work@Bechtle is an important strategic component of our employer branding and designed to elevate both our inbound and outbound employer communication. Modern work concepts optimally balance our employees' professional and private lives, and the guidelines help us create an attractive working environment. A great deal of flexibility allows us to conciliate specific job and project requirements.\n\nChildcare often poses great challenges for families. For this reason, many Bechtle employees in Germany make use of the option of taking parental leave.\n\n#### PARENTAL LEAVE BECHTLE GROUP IN GERMANY\n\n|                             | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|-----------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Employees on parental leave | 505  | 518  | 462  | 391  | 363  |\n| Proportion of women %       | 55.0 | 51.0 | 48.5 | 50.0 | 52.9 |\n| Proportion of men %         | 45.0 | 49.0 | 51.5 | 50.0 | 47.1 |\n\n#### DURATION OF PARENTAL LEAVE BECHTLE GROUP IN GERMANY\\*\n\n|       | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|-------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Women | 20.3 | 21.2 | 21.0 | 21.9 | 24.5 |\n| Men   | 1.5  | 1.6  | 1.7  | 1.5  | 1.7  |\n\n\\*Average number in months\n\nFlexible working hours contribute to a good work-life balance.

In 2023, Bechtle increased its employer contribution by up to 100 per cent on the invested amount, depending on the years of service. This is an offer that goes far beyond the usual employer contributions and is, therefore, an important building block in our employer branding. The issue of retirement provision also plays a major role for younger applicants in particular. It is also possible to take out occupational disability insurance through the employer.\n\nAll Bechtle employees have the opportunity to lease a company bicycle on special terms. In 2023, we had 1,136 company bicycles in our fleet across the Group (previous year: 1,113).\n\nOnce again this year, many employees took advantage of the holiday programme offered at Group headquarters for their children aged between five and twelve. This enabled parents to bridge the often childcare-free period during the summer holidays for a minimum of one and a maximum of three weeks.\n\n**High employer attractiveness.** Attracting qualified people to our company and retaining them in the long term is of great strategic and economic importance to us. In the reporting period, various recruiting measures were held at different locations. The recruitment of junior staff was a focal point. For example, Bechtle presented itself as an employer to students at strategically selected universities on a Germany-wide campus tour. Other events were organised for school pupils and, in particular, for young women. We have also taken measures to recruit professionals. Over a period of nine months, for example, a major national IT security campaign was organised on various channels. We are also increasingly focusing on social media.\n\nThe shortage of skilled labour and demographic change will make the search for new workers increasingly difficult. There is also the risk of an increasing willingness to change jobs on the part of the company's own employees. We are working hard to counteract this trend with our targeted measures.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe turnover rate, calculated on the basis of a moving average of the last twelve months, totalled 9.1 per cent in the reporting period (previous year: 10.9 per cent). This means that we have achieved our goal of keeping the ratio below 10 per cent in 2023. The average length of service rose slightly and now stands at 5.9 years (previous year: 5.8 years).\n\n| TURNOVER RATE* as of 31 December |   |      |      |      |      |      |\n|----------------------------------|---|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                                  |   | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Turnover rate women              | % | 9.1  | 10.1 | 7.5  |      |      |\n| Turnover rate men                | % | 9.1  | 11.2 | 9.8  |      |      |\n| Total turnover rate              | % | 9.1  | 10.9 | 9.1  | 7.2  | 9.4  |\n\n\\*The breakdown of the turnover rate by gender has been available since 2021.\n\n| AVERAGE PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT AT BECHTLE<br>as of 31 December |      |      |      |      |      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                                                              | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Average period of employment                                 | 5.9  | 5.8  | 5.8  | 5.8  | 5.5  |\n\nThe \"Top Employers Institute\" recognised Bechtle as a Top Employer for the first time in 2023. In order to prove that we offer outstanding working conditions, we had to undergo an extensive certification process. The certificate was renewed at the beginning of 2024. New application records in 2023 can be seen as a reward for our efforts to further increase our attractiveness as an employer.\n\n**Employee job satisfaction improved.** In October 2023, we completed the second Group-wide satisfaction survey among all employees in a total of 92 Bechtle companies and divisions. Every two years, we ask our employees about their satisfaction in these categories:\n\n- � Activity\n- � Working conditions\n- � Communication and information\n- � Cooperation\n- � Further training and development opportunities\n- � Employment conditions\n- � Leadership behaviour\n\nFollowing the first survey, a large number of projects and measures to improve job satisfaction were initiated at company and division level. The positive result of the second survey shows the great success of these measures.\n\nEspecially in the categories of Further Training and Development Opportunities, and Management Behaviour, the satisfaction values have risen significantly compared to the previous survey. The broad and consistently business-oriented training programme offered by the Bechtle Academy, as well as the development programmes for managers and experts described above, have had an extremely positive effect here.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY\n\n**Diversity as an important goal.** Diversity is a key factor for successful teams, for customer and market excellence, and ultimately for the sustainability of the business going forward. Bechtle is firmly in favour of equal opportunities and against discrimination – be it on the basis of gender and [charta-der-vielfalt.de](http://charta-der-vielfalt.de) gender identity, sexual orientation, age, religious affiliation and ideology, social or ethnic origin, nationality, or illness and disability. This important principle is codified in the Bechtle Code of Conduct. We have documented this self-perception externally by signing Charta der Vielfalt (Diversity [unglobalcompact.org](http://unglobalcompact.org) Charta) and the UN Global Compact.\n\ncharta-der-vielfalt.de\n\nunglobalcompact.org\n\nIn practice, this can be seen from the various measures that have been in place for many years, especially to promote women. For example, this includes the annual Girls' Day, the Future Days and the mentor programmes. In addition, numerous strategic decisions were made and new initiatives launched back in 2022 that will bring us closer to our goal of greater diversity and equal opportunities.\n\nIn order to provide a structured framework for the important topic of diversity at Bechtle, a Head of Diversity has been in place at our company since 1 March 2024. This person's task is to build on the many activities that have been initiated in recent years and to develop a diversity strategy.\n\n**Diversity team and diversity community.** In collaboration with the Human Resources, Staff Development and Corporate Communications departments, an interdisciplinary diversity team appointed by Bechtle assessed the current status by means of a structured analysis. The focus was on gender equality. A number of actions have already been derived on the basis of the initial insight gained: In 2022, a Women@Bechtle community and a Pride@Bechtle community were established across all locations to network employees and offer them the opportunity to share experiences and develop measures on their own initiative. Along a centrally defined road map, employees and, in particular, managers were made more aware of the issue in various fields of action. Among other things, two e-learning courses \"Diversity & Inclusion\" and \"Unconscious Bias – Recognising and Reducing Prejudices and Stereotypes\" were launched in the reporting period and are available to all employees.\n\n**Let's connect.** In cooperation with our manufacturing partners Dell Technologies and Google, the \"Let's connect\" workshop series was set up and integrated into the Bechtle Academy for all employees. Interested people of all genders now have the opportunity to expand their knowledge and skills in the areas of personal branding, self-marketing, resilience and networking.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n**2023**\n\n2022\n\nImage /page/71/Picture/1 description: The image displays the text \"PEOPLE AT BECHTLE\" in white against a gradient background that transitions from blue to gray.

As of 31 December 2023, the Group Management Board and Executive Vice Presidents only had male representatives; women are currently under-represented at higher management levels. However, Bechtle has set itself the goal of increasing the proportion of women, particularly in management positions.\n\nThe Supervisory Board had already set a target for the proportion of women on the Executive Board in December 2020. A woman should be a member of the Group Executive Board by 30 June 2025. Bechtle met this target on 1 February 2024. With Antje Leminsky, who will be responsible for logistics, procurement and partner management, as well as financial services and sustainability management, the Executive Board has been expanded to four members.\n\nThe Group Executive Board also redefined the targets for the proportion of women in supervisory bodies and management functions ahead of schedule. The target for the first management level below the Executive Board is 22 per cent or two positions with a deadline of 31 January 2025. With the appointment of a Vice President in the Netherlands on 1 January 2024 and in France from 1 April 2024, there will be two women at this management level.\n\nThe second executive level under the Executive Board comprises the decision makers in managerial positions as well as other executives throughout the group that report directly to a member of the Executive Board. For this executive level, the Executive Board has determined a target quota of 25 per cent or 31 persons.

For this, we need to assume our responsibility as an employer towards our employees and make sure that the workplaces are designed to be safe and conducive to good health. We place great emphasis on compliance with statutory regulations and attach great importance to occupational safety and health protection. In 2021, Bechtle AG in Neckarsulm and Gaildorf achieved EN ISO 45001 certification in occupational health and safety management.\n\nA central coordination unit for occupational safety supports all German companies of the Bechtle Group. It maintains contact with the occupational health service, instructs the managing directors throughout Germany about their duties in cooperation with the occupational health service and provides e-learning material for employees. Furthermore, the central coordination unit prepares occupational safety, health protection and fire protection guidelines. All employees in Germany regularly receive occupational safety instructions and have access to the German Occupational Safety Act (ASiG) via the Internet. The international subsidiaries organise their guidelines, training and instructions independently in accordance with the relevant national law. In 2023, Bechtle was honoured with the \"Healthy Employer\" award for the Neckarsulm location. The award, bestowed by the international market research institute EUPD, certifies exemplary occupational health services and helps job seekers select a suitable future employer.\n\n|                                                 | 2023  | 2022   | 2021   | 2020  |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|--------|-------|\n| Occupational health and safety training courses | 26    | 24*    | 73     | 29    |\n| Participants                                    | 4,434 | 4,828* | 5,959  | 2,604 |\n| Training of fire prevention assistants          | 49    | 31     | 23     | 8     |\n| Participants                                    | 117   | 111    | 63     | 46    |\n| SARS-CoV-2 training                             | –     | 2      | 2      | 1     |\n| Participants                                    | –     | 1,051  | 11,456 | 7,175 |\n|                                                 |       |        |        |       |\n\n#### OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY TRAINING COURSES BECHTLE GROUP GERMANY\n\n\\* Number adjusted\n\nIn 2023, the group recorded 37 notifiable work accidents in Germany, while the number of work-related injuries was 41.

CHM takes a holistic approach to the subject of health and is a part of the central Human Resources department. Apart from planning and coordinating health measures at Group headquarters, Company Health Management regularly communicates with the HR managers of other Bechtle locations in Germany and internationally in order to exchange experience and roll out CHM measures there as well. Employees throughout the Group can also take part in the majority of the sports and health courses offered at the fitness centre at Group headquarters online.\n\n**For the past 38 years, we have been fulfilling our social responsibility by training people. We also gain talented people by means of our various qualification and training programmes. Since 2023, Bechtle has been a certified \"Top Employer\".**\n\n**76**\n\nThuy Hien Cao, Administrative Trainee, System House Stuttgart\n\nJeremy Fraß, Internal Sales Department, System House Stuttgart\n\nfrom left to right\n\nImage /page/75/Picture/9 description: Two young adults are sitting on an orange couch. The woman on the left has long brown hair and is wearing a light blue button-down shirt and a dark skirt. She is sitting with her legs crossed and has white sneakers on. The man on the right has short brown hair and is wearing a light gray t-shirt and gray striped pants. He is holding a laptop. There is a small black table to the left of the couch with two glasses of water on it. There is a plant in a black pot to the right of the couch. The background is a modern office space with large windows.\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-76-0\"></span>**ENVIRONMENT**\n\n\"Environment\" is one of the four strategic action fields of the Bechtle Sustainability Strategy 2030. In line with the strategy, we focus on the subject areas we have identified as being of material significance, namely climate and energy, sustainable logistics and the circular economy. By optimising our business processes and initiating systematic climate protection measures, we are able to reduce emissions, save resources and minimise our impact on the environment. Moreover, corporate digital responsibility plays a key role both for Bechtle and for our customers. We assist our customers in their digital transformation and in achieving their climate protection goals.\n\nThe Climate Protection Strategy 2030 that was published in August 2022 supplements the Sustainability Strategy and describes how we intend to reach our climate goals. Our actions are aligned with the 1.5-degree target defined at the Climate Change Conference held in Paris in 2015. The focus is on our reduction targets in the field of direct and indirect carbon dioxide equivalents emissions along the value chain on the basis of the scientifically established reduction targets of the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi). In the reporting period, Bechtle also signed the Commitment Letter of the SBTi. Upon submission of our targets, the validation by the SBTi will take place in the course of 2024.\n\nThe central sustainability management is responsible for, and coordinates the implementation of, the sustainability targets within the Bechtle Group and tracks the yearly progress. The strategic responsibility for the Climate Protection Strategy 2030 as a fixed element of the Sustainability Strategy in the action field \"environment\" lies with the sustainability controlling. Here, the needed indicators are collected, the corporate carbon footprint is calculated, and reduction targets are tracked. The progress of the measures is assessed and, if necessary, adjusted in close coordination with the individual units and locations. At the locations of the Bechtle Group, the Managing Directors are responsible for the achievement of the environment and climate goals.\n\n#### ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND EMISSIONS\n\nTo reach our reduction targets in the areas we can influence, we endeavour to avoid and reduce carbon emissions. In our operations, our vehicle fleet plays a major role, and we also use energy for the upkeep of office buildings, warehouses and data centres. In the upstream and downstream value chain, energy is consumed for the transport and use of the products sold by us. In our carbon dioxide equivalents emissions reporting, we follow the approaches of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-77-0\"></span>**Scope 1 and 2 emissions.** A year-end overview of the power consumption, heating energy and district heating can only be provided in the form of a forecast.

The Bechtle account managers, consultants and IT service engineers therefore need to be mobile in order to take care of the customers on-site. For this reason, the vehicle fleet of the Bechtle Group, which currently comprises 5,249 cars, accounts for a major share of the carbon emissions caused by Bechtle. Accordingly, making more use of e-mobility could help us to reduce our emissions greatly.\n\nAs expected, the number of business trips increased after the COVID-19 measures were lifted. Moreover, the increasing number of employees in the group resulted in an expansion of the fleet. Despite these two factors, however, the number of business trips in 2023 remained under that of 2019. We attribute this to the increased use of virtual meetings, whose number again went up considerably.\n\n#### NUMBER OF VIDEO MEETINGS BECHTLE GROUP\n\n|                          | 2023      | 2022      | 2021      | 2020    | 2019    |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|\n| Number of video meetings | 2,162,808 | 1,621,699 | 1,112,768 | 605,834 | 177,118 |\n\n#### KILOMETRES DRIVEN BECHTLE GROUP\n\n|                             | 2023       | 20221      | 20211      | 20201      | 2019       |\n|-----------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Kilometres/year             | 96,451,986 | 84,785,140 | 66,081,352 | 69,532,076 | 98,721,551 |\n| Total number of vehicles    | 5,249      | 4,846      | 4,197      | 4,183      | 3,924      |\n| Kilometres/year per vehicle | 18,375     | 17,496     | 15,745     | 16,623     | 25,158     |\n\n¹ Due to the correction of the data of prior years within the Swiss vehicle fleet, the retroactive figures from 2022 differ.\n\n#### ENERGY CONSUMPTION BECHTLE GROUP FLEET BY SOURCES (SCOPE 1) in l\n\n|             | 2023       | 2022      | 2021      | 2020      | 2019      |\n|-------------|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Diesel¹     | 4,383,955  | 4,678,100 | 4,219,874 | 4,843,667 | 6,465,121 |\n| Biodiesel   | 881        | 813       | 0         | 0         | 0         |\n| Petrol¹     | 2,280,251  | 1,624,027 | 948,302   | 720,327   | 1,000,824 |\n| LPG         | 0          | 0         | 0         | 324       | 1,450     |\n| Natural gas | 952        | 606       | 1,490     | 187       | 70        |\n| Total fuels | 6,666,039² | 6,303,546 | 5,169,665 | 5,564,505 | 7,467,466 |\n\n¹ Due to the correction of the data of prior years within the Swiss vehicle fleet, the retroactive figures from 2022 differ.\n\n² Without hydrogen consumption in the Netherlands\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/80/Figure/1 description: This line graph shows the share of combustion vehicles, electrified drives, and all-electric vehicles from 2019 to 2023. In 2019, the share of combustion vehicles was 93.71, electrified drives was 6.07, and all-electric vehicles was 1.1. In 2020, the share of combustion vehicles was 84.04, electrified drives was 15.96, and all-electric vehicles was 2.34. In 2021, the share of combustion vehicles was 75.32, electrified drives was 24.61, and all-electric vehicles was 3.22. In 2022, the share of combustion vehicles was 65.17, electrified drives was 34.81, and all-electric vehicles was 6.73.

In the reporting period, 40.8 per cent of all company vehicles in the Bechtle Group were either plug-in hybrids or all-electric. Year on year, the share of e-cars throughout the group more than doubled to 14.4 per cent (prior year: 6.7 per cent).\n\n**Expansion of e-mobility in Germany.** Currently, 29.9 per cent of the Bechtle company cars in Germany are hybrid vehicles, and 11.5 per cent are all-electric. According to the latest KfW Climate Barometer, Bechtle is therefore significantly above the German average, which is 5 per cent for all-electric company vehicles in large companies and 14 per cent including hybrid vehicles. At Bechtle, the share in Germany totals 41.4 per cent.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, 492 employees in Germany drove e-cars. In 2023 alone, 327 all-electric vehicles joined the fleet in Germany. Additional vehicles will be needed as the number of employees grows – another reason to promote e-mobility.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Charging infrastructure.** The charging infrastructure at the Bechtle locations needs to be expanded on a large scale in order to enable employees to charge their vehicles, thereby increasing the acceptance of the measures taken. By the end of 2023, a total of 733 charging points were available at 51 Bechtle locations throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland, a year-on-year increase of 222. The Group headquarters in Neckarsulm alone offers 166 charging points that are fed from the PV system on the roof of the car park.\n\n**Use of regenerative energy.** Bechtle intends to increase the share of regenerative energy in the total consumption and, where possible, to generate energy. In recent years, for example, photovoltaic and geothermal systems were installed in newly constructed buildings at various locations of the Bechtle Group. The largest installations are located at group headquarters in Neckarsulm, where all available roof areas have been covered with modules. In the reporting period, two further geothermal plants were commissioned, one in Mägenwil (Switzerland) and the other in Ettlingen (Germany).\n\n#### PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS BECHTLE GROUP\n\n|                     |     | 2023                |               | 2022                |               | 2021                |               | 2020                |               |\n|---------------------|-----|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|\n|                     |     | Group headquarters¹ | Bechtle Group | Group headquarters¹ | Bechtle Group | Group headquarters¹ | Bechtle Group | Group headquarters¹ | Bechtle Group |\n| Power               | kWp | 1,392               | 2,305         | 1,391               | 1,977         | 1,348               | 1,960         | 1,348               | 1,736         |\n| Number of modules   |     | 7,121               | 9,950         | 5,495               | 7,316         | 5,377               | 7,074         | 5,377               | 6,592         |\n| Area                | m²  | 11,634              | 17,252        | 8,985               | 12,527        | 8,770               | 12,328        | 8,770               | 10,769        |\n| Number of locations |     | 2                   | 17            | 2                   | 13            | 1                   | 12            | 1                   | 8             |\n\n¹ Group headquarters including the Gaildorf location from 2022; before that date, the system in Gaildorf was not yet operational.\n\n#### GEOTHERMAL SYSTEMS BECHTLE GROUP\n\n|                                    |     | 2023                |               | 2022                |               | 2021                |               | 2020                |               |\n|------------------------------------|-----|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|\n|                                    |     | Group headquarters1 | Bechtle Group | Group headquarters1 | Bechtle Group | Group headquarters1 | Bechtle Group | Group headquarters1 | Bechtle Group |\n| Power                              | kWp | 680                 | 1,2822        | 680                 | 1,080         | 680                 | 995           | 680                 | 710           |\n| Number of downhole heat exchangers |     | 257                 | 3513          | 257                 | 341           | 257                 | 333           | 257                 | 333           |\n| Number of locations                |     | 2                   | 74            | 2                   | 6             | 2                   | 5             | 2                   | 5             |\n\n¹ Group headquarters including the Gaildorf location\n\n<sup>1</sup> Group headquarters including the Gaildorf location <sup>2</sup> Data for the Bechtle location Ettlingen without downhole heat exchangers due to use of streaming water,\n\nsuction wells and absorption wells; water volume: 21 m<sup>3</sup>/h <sup>3</sup> Includes expansion in Mägenwil (Switzerland)\n\n⁴ Neckarsulm, Gaildorf, Freiburg i.

The Bechtle logistics hubs in Neckarsulm and Hamburg serve as the central hubs for the flow of goods. Products that are not sent directly to the customer by the vendor or distributor largely arrive there, are consolidated by project, stored for later fulfilment or configured according to customer specifications. Apart from the logistics hub in Neckarsulm, the Bechtle Group operates a second logistics hub in Hamburg and additional warehouses in Bielefeld, Wesel (Bechtle Remarketing GmbH), Rotkreuz (Switzerland), Paris (France) as well as smaller satellite warehouses. In the reporting period, a total of 3,083,123 parcels and 68,850 pallets were sent out from the warehouses in Neckarsulm, Hamburg and Bielefeld.\n\n**Optimised packaging solutions.** Both the original product packaging and the outer packaging or transport packaging generate waste and therefore contribute to the consumption of raw materials. Moreover, the transportation of goods causes further carbon emissions. We are only able to influence the transportation of goods indirectly. Products are ordered via the central Purchasing department and shipped to our warehouses or directly to the customers by distributors or vendors. Usually, the distributors and vendors decide how the products are packaged and shipped.\n\nOn a project-specific basis, we implement individual transport solutions in collaboration with partners and customers, e.g. low-emission delivery throughout Europe by train or ship as well as so-called \"last green mile\" solutions. For example, the Bechtle IT system house in Hamburg delivers goods with electric cargo bikes to about 29 customer locations within a radius of 15 km within the framework of a customer project. Other sustainability measures include the consolidation of shipments.\n\nAll questions related to packaging are handled by the logistics hub in Neckarsulm, including the procurement of packaging material, the optimisation of the packaging, the reduction of transport volumes and the leveraging of new, innovative concepts.\n\nFollowing extensive application tests, only stretch films made from 30 per cent recycled material have been used to enclose pallets since 2023. The test results showed that stretch films with a higher share of recycled material lack the required tear resistance. To secure the load and to prevent theft, use of stretch film is essential. All purchased cardboard comes from FSC®-certified sources.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n[see](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en/about-bechtle/sustainability) [bechtle.com/](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en/about-bechtle/sustainability) [sustainability](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en/about-bechtle/sustainability)\n\nIn 2023, customers used the Bechtle Box<sup>®</sup> – an innovative shipping solution – much more often. The number of uses increased from 418 to 1,098 in the reporting period.\n\n#### CONSUMPTION OF PACKAGING MATERIAL¹\n\n|                     | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|---------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Cardboard           |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Total in kg         | 255,020 | 270,426 | 255,227 | 206,404 | 185,835 |\n| Share in %          | 51.31   | 55.39   | 49.21   | 50.17   | 50.46   |\n| CO₂e in kg          | 205,546 | 217,963 | 205,713 | 166,362 | 149,783 |\n| Paper               |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Total in kg         | 47,090  | 40,280  | 82,267  | 80,641  | 72,783  |\n| Share in %          | 9.47    | 8.25    | 15.86   | 19.60   | 19.76   |\n| CO₂e in kg          | 1,648   | 1,410   | 2,879   | 2,822   | 2,547   |\n| Plastic except film |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Total in kg         | 936     | 3,808   | 1,540   | 931     | 827     |\n| Share in %          | 0.19    | 0.78    | 0.30    | 0.23    | 0.22    |\n| CO₂e in kg          | 2,696   | 10,966  | 4,435   | 2,681   | 2,382   |\n| Film                |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Total in kg         | 21,064  | 28,781  | 25,862  | 16,215  | 16,666  |\n| Share in %          | 4.24    | 5.90    | 4.99    | 3.94    | 4.52    |\n| CO₂e in kg          | 54,976  | 75,120  | 67,499  | 42,321  | 43,498  |\n| Wood                |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Total in kg         | 172,914 | 144,911 | 153,740 | 107,192 | 92,204  |\n| Share in %          | 34.79   | 29.68   | 29.64   | 26.06   | 25.03   |\n| CO₂e in kg          | 2,075   | 1,739   | 1,845   | 1,286   | 1,106   |\n| Total               |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Total in kg         | 497,024 | 488,206 | 518,636 | 411,382 | 368,315 |\n| Share in %          | 100     | 100     | 100     | 100     | 100     |\n| CO₂e in kg          | 266,942 | 307,491 | 282,371 | 215,473 | 199,317 |\n\n<sup>1</sup> Purchased packaging by material in kg and carbon equivalent at Bechtle's logistics hub in Neckarsulm.

The returns management at the logistics hub is responsible for key tasks relating to returns logistics for group headquarters and for the warehouses in Bielefeld and Hamburg. OneTrack – a shipment tracking program of EURO-LOG – enables the complaints management to take the initiative to reduce the kilometres travelled by carriers and improve the customer service. This is made possible through continuous transparency in the logistics chain. In 2023, the number of return orders was slightly lower than in the prior year.\n\n#### RETURNS¹\n\n|                         | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Return rate<br>in %     | 0.76   | 0.72   | 0.65   | 0.77   | 0.68   |\n| Number of return orders | 43,989 | 45,084 | 42,742 | 39,232 | 38,491 |\n| Return value<br>in €    | 577    | 492    | 393    | 476    | 392    |\n\n¹ Returns of the German warehouses in Neckarsulm, Bielefeld and Hamburg that are processed via the returns management of group headquarters\n\n#### WASTE AND RECYCLABLES\n\nIn addition to the warehouses, the Bechtle Group has administration buildings where municipal and paper waste, electronic scrap and spent toner cartridges accumulate. When disposing of waste, we are required to respect both EU law and local law. Data about the accumulated waste is collected by the locations owned by Bechtle and recorded in their accounts. Most of the office facilities are located in rental properties whose waste concept is managed by the landlords. Due to the local differences in the relevance and regulation of waste management, these topics are handled by the individual companies.\n\nThe topic of waste and recyclables at group headquarters in Neckarsulm is based on a disposal concept created in the context of Bechtle AG's DIN EN ISO 14001 certification which encompasses the entire location including logistics. In 2024, a new recycling centre will be established at group headquarters.\n\nDue to the different billing periods of the waste disposal providers and landlords, not all waste figures were available as at the end of 2023.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n| WASTE BY TYPE AND DISPOSAL METHOD                      |       |       |       | in t  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|                                                        | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  | 2019  |\n| Total waste Bechtle Group¹                             | 2,864 | 2,485 | 2,354 | 2,606 |\n| Total waste group headquarters Neckarsulm              | 708   | 694   | 579   | 657   |\n| of which actual activity data broken down by category: |       |       |       |       |\n| Hazardous waste (recycled)²                            | 50    | 7     | 49    | 6     |\n| Hazardous waste (disposed of)                          | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     |\n| Non-hazardous waste (recycled)                         | 659   | 688   | 530   | 651   |\n| Non-hazardous waste (disposed of)                      | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     |\n\n¹ Calculation of the accumulated waste: data according to the waste invoice or, if not available,\n\nauxiliary calculation based on the area in square metres\n\n² The great difference between recycled hazardous waste in 2019 and 2020 and between 2021 and 2022 reflects the extensive building and renovation work done at group headquarters in 2020 und 2022.\n\n**Circular economy.** As an IT company, we are always looking for ways to extend the value-added of hardware, in particular. Bechtle Remarketing GmbH, headquartered in Wesel, Germany, is the Bechtle Group's specialist in sustainable IT life-cycle management. Apart from the purchase and sale of IT hardware, Bechtle Remarketing calculates a residual value for returned hardware, ensures secure erasure of the data, and recycles or disposes of unusable parts in cooperation with a local waste management company. Devices that are still operable are given a new lease of life so they can either be resold or leased. Through the sale of used IT hardware alone, 93,150 devices were reintroduced into the cycle in the reporting period, compared to 59,719 in 2022. If requested by the customer, Bechtle Remarketing coordinates the related logistics, the rollback of retired devices plus the roll-out of new equipment in cooperation with other Bechtle units. The DIN EN ISO 9001, 14001 and 27001 audits at Bechtle Remarketing regularly re-evaluate security levels as well as the quality requirements, processes and environmental standards within the company.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### DIGITAL FUTURE\n\nFrom the outset, we identified green IT, i.e. energy-efficient IT, as a relevant sustainability aspect of our business operations. In recent years, the social, ecological and economic factors associated with sustainable development have increasingly found an umbrella in the term corporate digital responsibility (CDR). Though digital transformation affects all industries, CDR is particularly important for an IT company such as Bechtle. On the one hand, this directly impacts our own business operations; on the other, we also play an active, responsible role in the digital transformation of our customers. Our aim is to support them to the best of our abilities in implementing their CDR and achieving their climate protection goals.\n\n**Internal digitisation.** Within the scope of our IT strategy, we pursue the goal of making our own enterprise architecture resource-saving, efficient and user-friendly. We do so under consideration of criteria such as consumer behaviour, modularity, reusability, redundancy and scalability. The management takes place via a matrix organisation: Bechtle's centralised Sustainability Management coordinates and monitors the implementation of the Bechtle Sustainability Strategy 2030, collaborating closely with Bechtle IT.\n\nInternally, Bechtle IT has developed sustainability criteria to evaluate processes and applications under economic, social and ecological considerations. The strategy integrates process optimisation and changes as well as matters pertaining to the retirement and rollback of applications and IT infrastructure. Apart from increasing employee satisfaction, the rollback saves carbon emissions.\n\n**Sustainable technologies, solutions and services.** Across all industries, digitisation is transforming the way we live and work and is the key to a successful future. This entails new expectations placed on companies and public bodies as well as on their employees. From the economic perspective as well, it is vital that we take an active and responsible role in our customers' digital transformation, to help them optimally implement their digitalisation strategy, their CDR and their climate targets. For Bechtle as an IT organisation, sustainable technologies, solutions and services are the very essence of the business model and a topic that permeates the entire Bechtle Group.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe engage closely with our vendor partners, who in turn advance the production of sustainable IT hardware, and we continue to develop our portfolio and integrate new products that meet a variety of sustainability criteria. For instance, certification labels such as TCO Certified or Blue Angel represent an important instrument to evaluate the energy consumption of hardware.\n\nThe data centre in Mutterstadt, Germany, where we cooperate with the co-location provider Pfalzkom, has already implemented key criteria of the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact. Our data centres at NTT in the Frankfurt am Main region have also joined the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact and intend to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030. In 2023, we were able to switch some of the units to eco-power via NTT. The PUE value at NTT was at 1.6, the same level as in the prior year (referring to the locations Fra1 and Fra2).\n\n**Smart digital solutions play a key role in enabling the achievement of upcoming climate protection goals. Bechtle supports numerous companies and public-sector divisions on this path.**\n\nGünter Job, member of the management/Head of Services, System House Stuttgart\n\nNicolas Fröhlich, Manager Smart City Solutions, System House Stuttgart\n\nfrom left to right\n\nImage /page/87/Picture/7 description: Two men are walking down a hallway and talking to each other.

At the same time, these are also indispensable prerequisites for sustainable corporate management. It therefore goes without saying that at Bechtle, the associated maxims have always formed the basis of our entrepreneurial activities. We want to fulfil the interests of the various stakeholder groups, such as shareholders, employees, customers and suppliers, as well as our responsibility to society as a whole, in the best possible way.\n\nIn its reporting on corporate governance, Bechtle generally follows the recommendations and suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) and, in the context of integrated reporting, the GRI standards.\n\nResponsibility for corporate governance at Bechtle lies primarily with the Supervisory Board as the highest body within the stock corporation together with the Executive Board of Bechtle AG. The cen- [bechtle.com/investors/](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en/about-bechtle/investors/corporate-governance) tral document of the corporate governance report at Bechtle is the Corporate Governance Statement, which we publish on our website. All key information on corporate governance, such as the declaration of compliance in accordance with Section 161 AktG, is available there.\n\n[corporate-governance](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en/about-bechtle/investors/corporate-governance)\n\nWithin the scope of the integrated reporting, the following sections explicitly touch on topics of relevance to us and provide takeover-related disclosures.\n\n#### COMPLIANCE AND ANTI-CORRUPTION\n\nBechtle pays great attention to ethically correct and lawful behaviour. In addition to the loss of business and the heavy fines that the respective Bechtle company could incur due to deficiencies and violations in this area, the reputation of the entire Bechtle Group could suffer severe damage. Special attention is therefore paid to prevention in order to raise awareness of the issue among all employees. The processes and measures integrated in the compliance system are of material significance to the measures taken to prevent corruption and mitigate related risks. Bechtle is determined to comply fully with the Bechtle Code of Conduct, the defined guidelines and compliance instruments as well as all relevant laws and regulations. All Managing Directors are obliged to report potential risks and suspected incidents to the central Risk Management, which is part of the Group Controlling of Bechtle AG.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe compliance system is based on the Bechtle Code of Conduct, which entered into force in 2010 and was comprehensively revised in 2021. It sets out a binding commitment to integrity for all employees of the Bechtle Group. The general compliance requirements are continually concretised on a caseand department-specific basis. For example, guidelines on how to handle gifts from business partners have been in force throughout the group since 2011. Additionally, easy-to-apply instructions are available to help employees decide how to handle any benefits to be received or granted, especially in the Public Sector, where stricter rules apply in many cases. The guidelines are to be revised in 2024.\n\nThe current 2021 version of the Bechtle Code of Conduct has been made available to all employees of the Bechtle Group and is also brought to the attention of all new employees as part of the onboarding process. In addition, since 2022 all employees have been required to take part in an annual online training course with two modules: compliance and anti-corruption. In 2023, 12,719 people – almost all Bechtle employees – successfully completed the course.\n\nThere is a special procedure for whistleblowers. Bechtle employees can contact the Compliance Board – consisting of the Executive Board of Bechtle AG and a permanent representative of the central legal department – confidentially to report relevant compliance violations via a telephone hotline or alternatively via a separate e-mail account. The processes for the internal reporting procedure were modified in 2022/23 on the occasion of the Whistleblower Protection Act; this is intended to make it more user-friendly for third parties, in particular. Since the reporting period, violations of applicable human rights along the supply chain can also be reported via the central address published on the company's website. To ensure the effectiveness of the Bechtle compliance system, all Managing Directors of the Group companies and all heads of the 18 central departments act as compliance officers on-site and in their areas. They are obliged to report any violations of the Bechtle Code of Conduct or applicable law to the Compliance Board in the form of an annual compliance report. Compliance reporting (submitted in 2023 for the year 2022) covered all operational and legally independent companies of the Bechtle Group as well as all central divisions, totalling 128 units.\n\nFurthermore, a background check is conducted for all Bechtle business partners, including the employees, via our central SAP system in accordance with relevant EU directives, to prevent the use of the financial system for money laundering and terrorism financing purposes. The compliance handbook is currently being revised; its planned completion had to be postponed by one year to the end of 2024 due to internal processes. The compliance management system is based on DIN EN ISO 37301.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### INFORMATION SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION\n\nInformation security, data protection and confidentiality are of utmost importance in Bechtle's business operations. As these subject areas intersect, we consider them as a whole. Compliance with statutory requirements (EU General Data Protection Regulation, EU GDPR) is a matter of course to Bechtle. Since information security and data protection concern the core of Bechtle's business model, security incidents involve a high reputation risk. Therefore, we attach great importance to preventive measures.\n\nDocuments accessible throughout the group help sensitise all Bechtle employees to the principles of data protection, information security, protection of confidentiality and other important requirements, and ensure compliance with statutory requirements. This includes the Bechtle Code of Conduct, the globally applicable training material for the EU GDPR and the Privacy Policy. Documents relevant to information security include, in particular, the central Information Security Guidelines, the central \"IT Compliance\" Policy and the \"Information Security\" Policy for employees. As part of the certification of the information security management system (ISMS) in accordance with DIN EN ISO 27001 (certified companies, see GRI Index), the annual preparation and updating of the ISMS Management Review required by the standard guarantees that the topic is always on the agenda of the company's management. Bechtle has also implemented an incident reporting process. In the field of security, governance, risk & compliance, we concentrate on the data processing, information flow, communication channels, customer data and Bechtle data in our data centres. Furthermore, we keep track of important new laws in order to be able to prepare for them at an early stage.\n\n[See GRI index,](#page-285-0) [page 286 ff](#page-285-0)\n\nAdditionally, we have adapted our protective systems to changing cyberattack scenarios and thus to the current risk situation. In the field of data protection, we mainly concentrate on the requirements of the EU GDPR. To ensure compliance, our Data Protection Officer conducts data protection audits in all Bechtle companies. Any open items are identified and suitable actions are derived. Moreover, mandatory e-learning formats on the topic of data protection are available in German and English. In 2023, 15,973 course completions for \"Data protection in the workplace\" training and 11,340 course completions for information security training were recorded across the Group in Germany.\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### SOCIAL COMMITMENT\n\nWith donations and social sponsoring, Bechtle supports projects that benefit society in a variety of ways. Decisions are based on the donation guidelines updated in the reporting period, which also underlines the fact that Bechtle regards social commitment as part of its corporate responsibility and is particularly committed to projects that fit in with the company's values and corporate culture.\n\nThe Bechtle Group supports selected projects as a reliable partner over a longer period of at least three years. Since 2014, this commitment has focused on three areas of activity: education, children/ youth and popular sports. This triad translates the framework of Bechtle's corporate culture, values, Vision for 2030 and brand understanding into specific areas of potential involvement: Education and youth development are the basis for \"bright minds\" and sport is the dynamic, team-orientated component that represents our corporate goals well. In addition, popular sport fits in very well with the internal measures of the company's health management programme and suits the wide range of sporting events involving Bechtle employees.\n\nWe are also involved in major humanitarian disasters in addition to firmly agreed cooperation programmes. Whenever people are affected and comprehensive solidarity and a willingness to help are required to alleviate hardship and suffering, we examine in detail how, and to what extent, we can contribute. In so doing, we also ask ourselves whether we should donate exclusively as a company or organise additional employee donation campaigns so that colleagues of the Bechtle Group can participate quickly and without excessive bureaucracy. Our largest single commitment in the reporting period was a donation of €200,000 to Aktion Deutschland Hilft e.V. for earthquake relief in Turkey and Syria.\n\nIn light of the flood disaster in the Ahr valley, Bechtle set up its own relief fund in 2021 and provided a one-off sum of €500,000. We intend to increase these funds whenever necessary, in order to be able to act quickly whenever social responsibility is particularly in demand and rapid assistance is required. Recipients are employees and their immediate families.\n\nThe decentralised nature of our business model is also reflected in our social commitment. With its more than 100 individual companies, Bechtle interacts with the respective local communities in various ways, both as an employer and contracting entity and as a business partner. An important principle is therefore to fulfil our social responsibility locally. In this way, the above-mentioned triad and the regional responsibility complement each other. The respective local managing directors are responsible for the local commitments.\n\nGroup-wide, Bechtle raised donations totalling €599,132 in 2023 (previous year: €693,817) and €716,060 (previous year: €454,448) for social sponsorships.\n\nMany of our employees are also personally involved in voluntary work for the common good. Wherever possible, Bechtle endeavours to support these efforts beyond the leave granted for charitable work pursuant to law.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\n### TAKEOVER-RELATED DISCLOSURES\n\nThe disclosures required pursuant to Section 289a, 315a of the German Commercial Code (HGB) are presented below:\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the issued capital of Bechtle AG amounted to €126 million, divided into 126,000,000 no-par bearer shares (ordinary shares). The pro-rata amount of the issued capital that is allocated to each share is €1.00. All shares have voting rights and are entitled to dividends. The rights and obligations associated with the ordinary shares are as specified in the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).\n\nThe Executive Board is not aware of any restrictions relating to voting rights or the transfer of shares.\n\nThe company is aware of the following direct or indirect capital interests exceeding 10 per cent of the voting rights as of the balance sheet date:\n\nKarin Schick, Gaildorf, Germany: 33.40 per cent, of which 25.25 per cent was direct and 8.14 per cent indirect. No changes occurred up to 11 March 2024, the reporting date.\n\nThere are no shares with special rights granting powers of control.\n\nThere are no share ownership plans or similar schemes under which employees hold interests in the capital without directly exercising their control rights.\n\nThe appointment and dismissal of members of the Executive Board is governed by Sections 84 et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and Section 31 of the German Co-determination Act (Mit- [bechtle.com/](https://bechtle.com/satzung) bestG). The regulations of the Articles of Incorporation do not deviate from these statutory provisions. In accordance with Article 6.1 of the Articles of Incorporation, the Executive Board consists of one or several persons. The number of Executive Board members is determined by the Supervisory Board. According to Article 6.4 of the Articles of Incorporation, the Supervisory Board may appoint a member of the Executive Board as Chairperson or Spokesperson of the Executive Board.\n\nThe conditions for amendments to the Articles of Incorporation are outlined in Sections 179 to 181 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The Annual General Meeting of Bechtle AG has delegated the authority to make amendments that merely concern the wording of the Articles of Incorporation to the Supervisory Board (see Article 10.4 of the Articles of Incorporation).\n\nPursuant to Sections 202 et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Executive Board is authorised, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the company's issued capital by a total of up to €18.9 million by issuing new bearer shares against cash contributions and/or contributions in kind until 14 June 2026 (authorised capital according to Article 4.3 of the Articles of Incorporation).

AktG. The Executive Board was authorised, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue bearer convertible bonds, bonds with warrants, profit participation rights, income bonds or combinations of these instruments with or without a fixed term to maturity in a total nominal amount of up to €350 million by 14 June 2026 and to grant the holders or creditors of convertible bonds or bonds with warrants conversion or option rights to new no-par value bearer shares in the company with a proportionate amount of the share capital totalling up to €6.3 million (contingent capital in accordance with Article 4.4 of the Articles of Incorporation). On 1 December 2023, Bechtle made use of this authorisation and announced the successful placement of unsecured and non-subordinated bonds with a total nominal value of €300 million (convertible bonds) with conversion rights into new and/or existing no-par value shares of Bechtle AG. The Executive Board of Bechtle AG has decided, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the subscription rights of the existing shareholders of Bechtle AG. The term of the convertible bonds is seven years. Further details can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe purchase of treasury shares is only permissible according to the provisions of Section 71 (1) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). Based on the resolution of the Annual General Meeting of 27 May 2020, the Executive Board is authorised to purchase treasury shares pursuant to Section 71 (1) no. 8 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). This authorisation is valid until 26 May 2025. Treasury shares must be purchased via the stock exchange or within the framework of a public purchase bid sent to all shareholders or via a public invitation to the shareholders to submit offers for sale. The price the company pays per share shall, in the case of purchase via the stock exchange, not exceed or fall below the price of the company's share on the Xetra trading of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (or a similar successor system), which is determined by the opening auction, or, in the case a public purchase bid sent to all shareholders or a public invitation to the shareholders to submit offers for sale, shall not exceed or fall below the average closing prices of the company's share on the three stock exchange trading days prior to the publication of the public purchase bid or the publication of the invitation to submit offers for sale by more than 10 per cent (in each case without transaction costs). The scope of the authorisation is limited to a maximum of 10 per cent of the issued capital. Other shares of the company that it has already purchased and still possesses or that are attributable to it pursuant to Sections 71 et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) shall be taken into consideration. The buy-back authorisation has been granted for any purpose permitted by law.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe company has no significant agreements that would apply in the event of a change of control due to a takeover bid.\n\nIn the service contract with the Chairman of the Management Board, the upper limit of the severance payment to be granted in the event of premature termination of the employment relationship due to a change of control was set at three times the total annual remuneration. The agreement was amended in February 2024 and the previous severance payment in the event of a change of control was cancelled with effect from 1 January 2024. The company has not concluded any other compensation agreements with members of the Executive Board or employees in the event of a takeover bid.\n\nImage /page/94/Picture/3 description: Three people are posing for a picture in an office setting.

Russia's war of aggression on Ukraine went on, and the conflict in the Middle East flared up again. Domestic political tensions further aggravated the situation, especially in Germany, but also in other countries such as France. In Germany, this resulted in a declining gross domestic product and, therefore, in the second recession in the last five years. Most national economies in the EU nevertheless achieved positive growth rates, although at a low level. The IT market delivered a more positive performance, but was unable to reach the high growth rates of recent years. In these once again challenging conditions, Bechtle performed well. The company grew at a higher rate than the macroeconomy and IT industry and gained further market shares.\n\n#### MACROECONOMY\n\nec.europa.eu\n\n**Macroeconomic growth considerably slower.** The year 2023 continued to be overshadowed by the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, which flared up again. The continued high infla- [ec.europa.eu](https://ec.europa.eu) tion and the higher interest rates also had an effect. According to the latest figures published by the European Commission, the gross domestic product (GDP) in the EU achieved minimal growth of 0.5 per cent in 2023. The first two quarters each closed with a marginal growth rate of 0.1 per cent over the prior quarter. In the third quarter, the rate dropped by 0.1 per cent. In the final quarter, economic performance stagnated at 0.0 per cent. The performance differed in the various Bechtle markets in the EU. In the reporting period, Spain reported the best performance of them all, with growth of 2.5 per cent, followed by Portugal with 2.3 per cent. Ireland came in last, with a significant decline in economic performance of 1.9 per cent.\n\nIn 2023, the German economy fell into recession. As reported by the German Federal Statistical Office, GDP underwent a slight decline of 0.3 per cent (prior year: +1.8 per cent). The performance in the [destatis.de](https://www.destatis.de/) individual quarters followed an even more pronounced downward trend than in the EU as a whole. In the first quarter, GDP managed to achieve a marginal increase of 0.1 per cent over the prior quarter, but growth stagnated at 0.0 per cent in the second and third quarters. In the fourth quarter, GDP dropped by 0.3 per cent. On the other hand, investments in equipment performed well, achieving growth of 3.8 per cent in the year as a whole. In contrast, government investments went down by 2.5 per cent.\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe ifo Business Climate Index for Germany also declined in 2023, from 90.1 points in January to 86.3 points at the end of the year. In the first four months of the year, the index went up, reaching its high [ifo.de/en](https://www.ifo.de/en) of the year of 93.1 points in April. From then on, however, the index continually dropped, falling to 85.9 points in August and September. From this low, the index only recovered slightly towards the end of the year. 6 4 3 2 **2,2**\n\n**1,3**\n\nWACHSTUM IT-MARKT IN DEUTSCHLAND in %\n\n**8,7 9,1**\n\n#### INDUSTRY 0 2019 2020 2021 2022 **2023**\n\n1\n\n**German IT market picks up.** According to figures presented by the industry association bitkom, the IT market in Germany achieved growth of 2.2 per cent despite the difficult framework conditions. [bitkom.org](https://www.bitkom.org/) Although the growth rate was much lower than in previous years, the IT industry once again stood out with its remarkable resilience. Due to the weakness of the PC market and many customers' reluctance to buy, the hardware business volume fell by 5.4 per cent. However, service revenue increased by 5.1 per cent. In the year ended, the software revenue once again served as the growth driver, with significant growth of 9.6 per cent. According to the French industry association numeum, much higher growth of 6.5 per cent was achieved in France, our largest international market, than in Germany.\n\nThe ifo index for IT service providers reflects the macroeconomic mood. In the course of 2023, the balance value of the index declined from 25.9 to 16.3 points. The annual low of 12.9 points was reached in November. Although the assessment of the current business situation remained at a low level, the outlook for the coming months at least improved in December.\n\n#### IT MARKET GROWTH IN GERMANY in %\n\nImage /page/96/Figure/6 description: This image is a bar chart with the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 on the x-axis and values from 0 to 10 on the y-axis.

However, the impact of the war was no longer being felt to its full extent. Energy prices as well as inflation receded. Nevertheless, the mood in the economy as well as the actual economic data remained at a low level. The situation in the IT market was better, with high demand for services and software. The situation in the supply chains improved as well in the course of the year. However, noticeable reluctance to purchase was evident in the hardware segment, especially with regard to PC sales, particularly among medium-sized customers.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Bechtle Group performed well. In line with our forecast for the 2023 fiscal year, we recorded growth in the upper single-digit range. All in all, our company once again outperformed the IT market in the reporting period in terms of business volume and revenue growth. We were therefore also able to further expand our market share.\n\nApart from the challenges indicated, the Bechtle markets did not witness any significant events outside the company that had a noteworthy impact on the business performance.\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-98-0\"></span>**EARNINGS POSITION**\n\nThe economic framework conditions continued to be challenging in 2023. Especially in Germany, the mood and economic performance were encumbered. As a result, the willingness to invest – especially in larger and complex IT infrastructure projects – lagged behind expectations. Nevertheless, Bechtle was able to increase its business volume and revenue significantly. Particularly in our service business, we saw continually high demand. At the same time, the cost base went up in 2023 due to inflation. As well as in personnel expenses, there were also increases in energy expenses, vehicle expenses and travel expenses. We are proud to report that, despite these factors, we were able to improve our earnings significantly and keep the EBT margin at exactly the same level as in the prior year.\n\n#### ORDER POSITION\n\n**New basis for calculating the order backlog.** In the reporting period, Bechtle changed the way it calculates the order backlog. This change is associated with the introduction of a new group-wide standard input portal for incoming orders. This portal enables us to enter more comprehensive and more detailed data for the various transaction types, especially also for contracts with longer terms, some of which extend over several years. As a result, the order backlog is significantly higher than in prior years. Since the change to the new portal was within the course of the year, we are only going to publish the new incoming orders in our report for the first quarter of 2025. The new calculated order backlog will be reported starting with this annual report.\n\n**High order backlog.** For the sale of IT products and the provision of services, Bechtle concludes both short-term and long-term contractual relationships. The IT E-Commerce segment is characterised almost entirely by the conclusion of pure trading deals, usually with short order and delivery times. In the IT System House & Managed Services segment, project deals can take anywhere from several weeks to one year. Especially in the fields of managed services and cloud computing, the master and operating agreements that Bechtle concludes with customers often have terms of several years. Contract terms for as-a-service models, e.g. for the procurement of software, can also be longer than one year.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-99-0\"></span>GESCHÄFTSVOLUMEN in Mio. €\n\n5.374,5\n\n5.819,2\n\n0 1.000 2.000 3.000 4.000 5.000 6.000 7.000 8.000\n\nIn the reporting period, incoming orders amounted to €7,488 million, about 6.7 per cent more than the prior-year figure of €7,017 million. This figure comprises an increase in incoming orders by 9.6 per cent from €4,587 million to €5,027 million in the IT System House & Managed Services segment and by 1.3 per cent from €2,430 million to €2,460 million in the IT E-Commerce segment. 2022\n\nThe order backlog was reduced substantially in the reporting period. Based on the new calculation, it amounted to €2,146 million as of the end of the year, after €2,452 million in the prior year. Of this amount, the IT System House & Managed Services segment accounted for €1,913 million (prior year: €2,117 million), and the IT E-Commerce segment for €305 million (prior year: €407 million). The order backlog is about four and a half months in the IT System House & Managed Services segment and less than two months in the E-Commerce segment.\n\n#### BUSINESS VOLUME\n\n**Higher business volume.** The business volume is an alternative performance indicator which Bechtle introduced in the context of the change in the presentation of the revenue pursuant to IFRS 15. This indicator describes the recorded revenue on a gross basis, i.e. without a reduction for software revenues as an agent in accordance with IFRS 15.\n\nIn the fiscal year, the business volume amounted to €7,793.6 million, 7.0 per cent more than in the prior year (€7,285.7 million).\n\nImage /page/99/Figure/8 description: This image shows a horizontal bar chart titled \"BUSINESS VOLUME\" in euros millions. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 8,000. The y-axis shows the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. The business volume for 2019 is 5,374.5. The business volume for 2020 is 5,819.2. The business volume for 2021 is 6,245.8. The business volume for 2022 is 7,285.7. The business volume for 2023 is 7,793.6, which is an increase of 7.0%.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\n**(+ 6,5 %)**\n\n#### REVENUE PERFORMANCE\n\n**Significant revenue growth.** Despite the very challenging framework conditions, revenue increased by 6.5 per cent from €6,028.2 million to €6,422.7 million in the 2023 reporting period. The organic revenue growth amounted to 3.7 per cent.\n\nUMSATZ in Mio. €\n\n4.712,0\n\n5.050,3\n\n5.305,5\n\n6.028,2\n\n**6.422,7**\n\n<span id=\"page-100-0\"></span>0 1.000 2.000 3.000 4.000 5.000 6.000 7.000 8.000\n\n[See Notes,](#page-198-0) [Revenues,](#page-198-0) [page 199 f](#page-198-0)\n\nImage /page/100/Figure/4 description: This image shows a horizontal bar chart of revenue in millions of Euros from 2019 to 2023. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 8,000. The revenue for 2019 is 4,712.0. The revenue for 2020 is 5,050.3. The revenue for 2021 is 5,305.5. The revenue for 2022 is 6,028.2. The revenue for 2023 is 6,422.7, which is an increase of 6.5%.\n\n**Segment allocation of acquisitions abroad.** In the last two fiscal years, Bechtle has acquired system-integration service providers outside Germany, Austria and Switzerland in accordance with its expanded M&A strategy. In line with the new regional leadership responsibilities, most of these companies are allocated to the IT E-Commerce segment. In particular, this affects the company ACS Systems UK Ltd. in the UK, acquired in 2022, as well as the companies Tangible Benefit Ltd. in the UK, Prosol IngenierÍa S.L. and Prosol Iscat S.L. in Spain, and Apixit S.A.S. in France, which were acquired in 2023.\n\nThe two segments developed differently. While the revenue growth in the IT System House & Managed Services segment amounted to 13.5 per cent1, revenue in the IT E-Commerce segment receded by 5.1 per cent1. The growth rates of the German companies and of the international companies were closer to each other, at 7.1 per cent and 5.7 per cent, respectively, with Germany achieving slightly stronger growth.\n\nIn line with our acquisition strategy that is more focused on other European countries, we acquired five companies outside of Germany in the reporting period. Therefore, the organic revenue growth abroad amounted to –1.8 per cent. In Germany, we achieved organic growth of 7.1 per cent. In relation to the total revenue, the international companies accounted for a share of 37.8 per cent (prior year: 38.1 per cent). Accordingly, the domestic share amounted to 62.2 per cent (prior year: 61.9 per cent). Germany thus remains Bechtle's largest market.\n\nThe average number of full-time equivalents (FTE; without absentees and trainees) increased by 9.7 per cent, a rate higher than that of the revenue growth. Based on 13,026 full-time equivalents (prior year: 11,878), the revenue per employee thus amounted to €493 thousand, after €508 thousand in the prior year.\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### COST AND EARNINGS PERFORMANCE\n\n#### **Significant EBT increase.**\n\n[See Notes,](#page-199-0) [Expense structure,](#page-199-0) [page 200 f](#page-199-0)\n\n**Cost of sales.** In 2023, gross earnings went up by 6.5 per cent from €1,053.4 million in the prior year to €1,121.9 million in the year under review, growth similar to that of revenue. Compared to revenue, the cost of sales went up at a slightly higher rate of 6.6 per cent. Material costs increased by 5.4 per cent, a rate significantly lower than that of the revenue growth. This disproportionately low increase was able to largely compensate for the significantly disproportionaly large increases of the other expense positions. Personnel expenses, which are included in the cost of sales, increased by 15.4 per cent. Other operating expenses also underwent an increase of 12.8 per cent. In the reporting period, the gross margin thus amounted to 17.5 per cent, a level that corresponds to that of the prior year.\n\n#### COST OF SALES/GROSS EARNINGS\n\n|                |    | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|----------------|----|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Cost of sales  | €m | 5,300.8 | 4,974.8 | 4,385.5 | 4,193.8 | 3,944.2 |\n| Gross earnings | €m | 1,121.9 | 1,053.4 | 920.0   | 856.6   | 767.8   |\n| Gross margin   | %  | 17.5    | 17.5    | 17.3    | 17.0    | 16.3    |\n\n[See People at Bechtle,](#page-63-0) [page 64](#page-63-0) **Distribution costs and administrative expenses.** The expenses in the two functional areas of sales and administration developed differently. In the fiscal year, distribution costs underwent above-average growth of 11.1 per cent to €436.7 million, after €393.0 million in the prior year. The distribution cost ratio was 6.8 per cent, after 6.5 per cent in the prior year. Administrative expenses increased at a disproportionately low rate of 4.7 per cent from €340.8 million to €356.8 million, especially as a result of the disproportionately low increase in personnel expenses. The administrative expense ratio was 5.6 per cent, after 5.7 per cent in the prior year. Other operating expenses underwent a very substantial increase in both functional areas. This was due especially to the higher travel expenses, vehicle expenses, higher building expenses due to the rise in energy costs, as well as marketing expenses. In the reporting period, other operating income went up by 50.3 per cent from €35.9 million to €53.9 million. The almost exclusive reason for this surge was the increase in additional vendor grants for marketing measures for the roll-out of the digital transformation in the context of new IT infrastructures and technologies. However, we do not expect payments in the same amount in this fiscal year.\n\n#### DISTRIBUTION COSTS/ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n\n|                                | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  | 2019  |\n|--------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Distribution costs €m          | 436.7 | 393.0 | 345.2 | 319.2 | 306.6 |\n| Distribution cost ratio %      | 6.8   | 6.5   | 6.5   | 6.3   | 6.5   |\n| Administrative expenses €m     | 356.8 | 340.8 | 282.6 | 286.5 | 249.6 |\n| Administrative expense ratio % | 5.6   | 5.7   | 5.3   | 5.7   | 5.3   |\n\n**Earnings.** EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.

This was due to factors such as the seven acquisitions that took place in the reporting period, which resulted in an increase of 41.7 per cent in amortisation of customer bases. However, the depreciation of property, plant and equipment again accounted for the bulk of the depreciation and amortisation figure, amounting to €93.4 million, after €80.7 million<sup>1</sup> in the prior year. 2019 **104 SEGMENT REPORT** \n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500\n\n236,3\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) improved by 7.6 per cent to €382.3 million, after €355.4 million in the prior year.

In the reporting period, seven acquisitions and the first-time issue of a convertible bond caused some significant shifts in individual positions. Overall, however, the structure of the balance sheet and the key indicators remain largely unchanged. Bechtle shows financial strength and is a rock-solid partner for customers and for the financial market, especially in these times of uncertainty. This is also underlined by our strong equity ratio and our extremely comfortable liquidity situation.\n\nWhere we provide structural indicators in connection with the assets position or the working capital, we do so on the basis of the business volume.\n\nImage /page/107/Picture/7 description: The image shows the text \"For the assets position of the segments, see Notes, page 243 f\" along with a small icon of a book in the upper right corner.\n\n**Strong, sound balance sheet.** In the reporting period, the balance sheet total of the Bechtle Group climbed to €3,803.2 million, an increase of 10.3 per cent.\n\n| CONDENSED BALANCE SHEET |         |         |         |         |         | €m |\n|-------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----|\n|                         | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |    |\n| Assets                  |         |         |         |         |         |    |\n| Non-current assets      | 1,427.3 | 1,115.2 | 984.2   | 958.9   | 846.4   |    |\n| Current assets          | 2,375.9 | 2,332.7 | 2,035.6 | 1,728.2 | 1,548.3 |    |\n| Equity and liabilities  |         |         |         |         |         |    |\n| Equity                  | 1,742.6 | 1,538.3 | 1,353.1 | 1,162.0 | 1,014.8 |    |\n| Non-current liabilities | 784.9   | 464.9   | 499.5   | 599.9   | 566.7   |    |\n| Current liabilities     | 1,275.7 | 1,444.6 | 1,167.1 | 925.2   | 813.1   |    |\n| Balance sheet total     | 3,803.2 | 3,447.9 | 3,019.8 | 2,687.1 | 2,394.7 |    |\n\nOn the assets side, non-current assets increased by 28.0 per cent to €1,427.3 million as of the reporting date. Goodwill accounted for the bulk of non-current assets. Also due to acquisitions, this item underwent an increase of 32.1 per cent or €178.1 million to €732.3 million in the reporting period. As a result of acquisitions and investments, property, plant and equipment climbed by €76.3 million or 20.9 per cent to €441.8 million. Other intangible assets, too, went up by 17.8 per cent to €117.5 million, largely as a result of acquisitions. The item \"investments accounted for using the equity method\" in the amount of €32.5 million was newly added as of the investment in PLANET AI.\n\nAt €95.2 million, the amount spent on investments was higher than the prior-year figure of €82.0 million. The investment ratio increased from 26.0 per cent to 27.0 per cent. However, conventional investments merely amounted to approximately €75 million, i.e. the bottom end of our forecast (€75 million to €85 million). About €20 million accounted for capitalised leasing items that we had to include in our balance sheet in accordance with IFRS for sales financing.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs of the reporting date of 31 December 2023, the capitalisation ratio increased to 37.5 per cent (prior year: 32.3 per cent). The coverage of the non-current assets by the equity amounted to 122.1 per cent, after 137.9 per cent in the prior year.\n\n**Liquidity for further growth.** Current assets increased slightly by 1.9 per cent to €2,375.9 million. As expected, inventories were reduced considerably, namely 27.6 per cent to €439.8 million (prior year: €607.7 million). Accordingly, the share of the inventories in the balance sheet total went down from 17.6 per cent to 11.6 per cent. Due to the implementation of central receivables management, but also due to the weaker year-end business, trade receivables declined by 4.0 per cent to €1,157.6 million. In the reporting period, receivables (DSO – days sales outstanding) decreased slightly from 41.1 to 40.9 days. Other assets increased by 40.3 per cent or €83.7 million. This development reflects the higher bonus payments from suppliers. Due to, amongst other things, the issue of convertible bonds, cash and cash equivalents surged by €206.2 million.\n\nBechtle's liquidity including time deposits and securities is at a very comfortable level of €465.8 million. Bechtle thus has sufficient funds to finance both organic growth and growth through acquisitions.\n\nThe working capital underwent a significant decline of 18.1 per cent to €800.1 million. In relation to the business volume, the figure went down by 13.4 per cent to 10.3 per cent. This item was affected positively especially by the reduction of inventories as well as the decline in trade receivables.\n\n#### WORKING CAPITAL\n\n|                       | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  | 2019  |\n|-----------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Working capital<br>€m | 800.1 | 976.6 | 725.9 | 652.5 | 647.7 |\n| % of business volume  | 10.3  | 13.4  | 11.6  | 11.2  | 12.1  |\n\nOn the liabilities side, non-current liabilities increased from €464.9 million in the prior year to €784.9 million as of the reporting date. This change is attributable especially to the financial liabilities, which underwent a surge from €261.9 million to €524.1 million as a result of the issue of convertible bonds. The share of non-current liabilities in the balance sheet total thus increased from 13.5 per cent to 20.6 per cent.\n\nCurrent liabilities went down by 11.7 per cent from €1,444.6 million to €1,275.7 million. This development reflects the slump in current financial liabilities from €111.4 million to €16.4 million, due to the repayment of short-term loans as well as the decline in trade payables by €69.8 million to €629.2 million.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Image: book icon               |\n|--------------------------------|\n| See Notes,                     |\n| page 193 ff and<br>page 231 ff |\n\n|                           | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019  |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|\n| Cash flow from            |        |        |        |        |       |\n| operating activities      | 459.0  | 116.7  | 284.5  | 317.5  | 186.0 |\n| investing activities      | -282.6 | -224.3 | -42.9  | -146.5 | -72.1 |\n| financing activities      | 28.2   | -100.2 | -179.4 | -78.7  | -89.7 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | 435.8  | 229.6  | 431.8  | 363.2  | 272.2 |\n| Free cash flow            | 151.2  | -29.8  | 218.6  | 204.1  | 109.5 |\n\nThe main conditions of the financial liabilities are explained in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Due to the secondary importance of financial earnings to the Bechtle Group, a change in interest rates would not have any major impact on the financial position.\n\nAt Bechtle group, off-balance-sheet financing instruments primarily concern operating leases. Details are presented in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nCurrently, the Executive Board of Bechtle AG does not see any signs of liquidity bottlenecks for the group. There are sufficient financial resources for further organic growth and growth through acquisitions.\n\n### FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES\n\n**Financial independence.** The objective of Bechtle's financial policy is to keep the group's financial power at a high level, thereby retaining the company's financial independence by ensuring adequate liquidity. At the same time, risks are to be avoided as far as possible or hedged effectively. For example, the Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board prohibit any kind of speculative forward transactions. This applies especially to currencies, goods and securities as well as forward transactions associated with these, unless they serve the hedging of ongoing business operations.\n\nAs a matter of principle, Bechtle uses derivative financial instruments exclusively for hedging its operating activities. In the reporting period, the company mainly made use of currency futures. Through the hedging of purchase and sale transactions in non-group currencies, the exchange rate risk from the cash flows is minimised in the income statement. One of the main areas the finance management concentrates on is the hedging of net investments in foreign operations. The hedging compensates for exchange rate fluctuations against the Swiss franc, the British pound, the Polish złoty, the Czech koruna and the Hungarian forint from the translation of the equity of the foreign subsidiaries in the group equity.\n\nCASH FLOW €m\n\nImage /page/114/Picture/11 description: The image shows a simple line drawing of an open book. The book is oriented vertically, with the spine on the left. The pages are slightly fanned open, revealing several lines of text on each page. The lines of text are represented by short, horizontal lines stacked on top of each other.\n\n[See Notes,](#page-225-0)  [page 226](#page-225-0)\n\n[See Notes,](#page-253-0)  [Operating leases,](#page-253-0)  [page 254](#page-253-0)\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-115-0\"></span>In the investment of excess liquidity, quick availability is more important than maximum yield, e.g. in order to be able to access available cash and cash equivalents in the event of acquisitions or major project pre-financing measures. Thus, purely financial goals – such as the optimisation of the financial income – are subordinate to the acquisition strategy and the company growth. This financial flexibility forms the basis for Bechtle's success in a highly consolidating market. The liquidity situation is centrally managed and monitored by the treasury.\n\nInvestment business is only conducted with investment-grade debtors. For time deposits within the European Union, investments with a deposit guarantee are preferred. As such a guarantee only exists to a limited extent in Switzerland, we only make investments in this country with banks with an excellent credit rating.\n\n### **STRATEGIC FINANCING MEASURES**\n\n**High equity ratio.** In 2023, the current business and necessary replacement investments were financed with cash and cash equivalents and the operating cash flow. The funds required for the acquisitions in the fiscal year ended were covered partly by cash and cash equivalents and partly debt-financed. The acquisitions made as well as future acquisitions were financed successfully by means of the issue of a convertible bond in the amount of €300 million.\n\nAt 45.8 per cent, the equity ratio remained at a very high level (prior year: 44.6 per cent). It forms the basis for our financial flexibility and independence. For instance, it enables us to make use of any acquisition opportunities that arise at short notice. Moreover, it enables us to respond to current circumstances in a timely and flexible manner. Apart from time deposits and securities worth €30.0 million, Bechtle therefore holds funds in the amount of €435.8 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nMoreover, there are a confirmed bilateral credit lines with eight banks totalling about €400 million. Thus, Bechtle has secured adequate liquidity by means of various financing sources.\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-116-0\"></span>**OVERALL ASSESSMENT**\n\n**Forecast fulfilled.** As previously, the Executive Board of Bechtle AG considers the company's economic position as of the reporting date to be good. Despite the known challenging framework conditions and the difficult mood especially in Germany, the figures of the 2023 reporting period underline the vigour and crisis resilience of Bechtle's business model. Once again, this proves the company's economic strength and reliability. In 2023, Bechtle fulfilled all forecasts made on the basis of the 2022 fiscal year, although macroeconomic development was deteriorating in the course of the year.\n\n#### COMPARISON OF THE ACTUAL AND PROJECTED BUSINESS PERFORMANCE\n\n|                              | Forecast AR 2022                                                              | Actual 2023                      | Comparison |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------|\n| Business volume              | Significant increase<br>over 2022                                             | Growth: 7.0%                     | Fulfilled  |\n| Revenue                      | Significant increase<br>over 2022                                             | Growth: 6.5%                     | Fulfilled  |\n| Cost of sales                | Increase more or<br>less in line with<br>revenue increase                     | Growth: 6.6%                     | Fulfilled  |\n| Gross margin                 | > 17%                                                                         | 17.5%                            | Fulfilled  |\n| Distribution cost ratio      | < 7%                                                                          | 6.8%                             | Fulfilled  |\n| Administrative expense ratio | < 6%                                                                          | 5.6%                             | Fulfilled  |\n| EBT                          | Increase more or<br>less in line with<br>revenue increase                     | Growth: 6.8%                     | Fulfilled  |\n| EBT margin                   | More or less at<br>prior-year level                                           | 5.8%                             | Fulfilled  |\n| Dividend                     | Dividend payout<br>ratio of about one<br>third of the earnings<br>after taxes | Dividend payout<br>ratio: 33.2%* | Fulfilled  |\n\n\\* Subject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-117-0\"></span>**OPPORTUNITY AND RISK REPORT**\n\nOpportunities and risks are inextricably linked in entrepreneurial activity. The courageous seizing of opportunities is inevitably accompanied by risks, while missing or overlooking opportunities also represents a risk. Opportunity and risk management at Bechtle forms the basis for identifying and utilising the opportunities for profitable growth that present themselves to us, while at the same time, recognising and appropriately assessing the associated risks at an early stage. We are not currently aware of any risks that could jeopardise the continued existence of the company, either alone or in combination.\n\n### **OPPORTUNITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT**\n\nMore than ever, our industry is in a phase of drastic change. Accordingly, to engage in business operations and make use of opportunities, it is necessary to take risks. To ensure Bechtle's success, we have taken the needed precautions by establishing efficient opportunity and risk management. We already record and assess many opportunities in the context of the risk management system. Thus, all statements made below concerning risk management largely apply to opportunity management as well. However, opportunities that are not linked to any risk are also identified. The leaner opportunity management of Bechtle that has been established for this purpose is derived mainly from the strategy of the business segments, from their goals and from the Vision 2030. Direct responsibility for the early and continuous identification, measurement and management of opportunities lies primarily with the Group Executive Board and the operational management level in the respective business segments and holding companies with the Executive Vice Presidents, Vice Presidents and Managing Directors. Like the risk management, these tasks are an integral part of the corporate planning and control system. The management of the Bechtle Group puts a lot of emphasis on detailed evaluations and comprehensive scenarios concerning the market and competitive position as well as critical success factors for the company's performance. From this information, it derives the potential for specific opportunities for the individual business segments. These are discussed in planning meetings between the Executive Board and the executives with operating responsibility, and suitable measures and targets are agreed in order to make use of this potential.\n\n[See Vision, strategy](#page-46-0) [and governance,](#page-46-0)\n\n[page 47 ff](#page-46-0)\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\nBechtle defines risk management as the entirety of all organisational arrangements and measures to identify risks and manage them. The main objective of risk management is to effectively and proactively ensure the company's going concern on a long-term basis. This is achieved by means of the timely identification of risks, their measurement and the initiation of suitable risk control measures. In this way, the company endeavours to avoid risks or to avert or minimise harmful consequences of the occurrence of a particular risk for the company. The measurements range from minor risks to material and existential risks.\n\n#### ORGANISATION\n\nIn line with the organisational structure of the Bechtle Group, risk management clearly distinguishes between duties and responsibilities of the group holding/intermediate holdings and of the operational subsidiaries and individual management areas. Group controlling has established a reporting system that enables early identification of developments that threaten the company's success. Apart from the provision of various analysis tools for the operational units, the insights gained from periodic analyses and statistics support effective risk management in the individual areas. The Managing Directors and Business Unit Leaders thus bear a substantial part of the responsibility for the active risk management. This basic principle also corresponds with the decentralised business model and the management philosophy of Bechtle. Compared to the prior year, the risk management organisation did not undergo any material changes.\n\nThe risk management organisation of the Bechtle Group primarily performs two functions:\n\n�**The early detection system:** Early detection systems are instruments that identify risks and opportunities of an enterprise early enough to enable reactions to ward off the risks and make use of opportunities. Early detection indicators enable the detection and analysis of latent risks over time. This requires systematic risk identification, risk measurement and risk communication. In this area, Bechtle benefits from the robust interaction of various supporting systems and instruments. The auditor within the context of the annual financial statements also assesses whether the Executive Board has, in a suitable manner, taken the steps required in accordance with Section 91 (2) AktG and whether the monitoring system to be established thereunder can fulfil the tasks for which it was created.\n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\n**risikomanagementsystem**\n\n**risikofrüherkennungssystem**\n\nRisikosteuerung\n\nRisikokommunikation Risikosteuerung\n\nRisikokommunikation\n\n**risikobewältigung**\n\n**120**\n\n� **The monitoring system:** At Bechtle, the internal monitoring system is responsible for monitoring the risk management system. It consists of process-independent and process-specific monitoring Unabhängige measures. Process-independent means that the respective monitoring entity is not integrated in Über-Kontrollen to rische the risk management process and is not responsible for its outcome. On the other hand, there are wachungsprocess-specific monitoring entities that are integrated in the risk management process. The process-independent monitoring entity audits the risk management system, is informed about significant changes, plans and regulations and may, if necessary, request additional information. The system audit takes place once a year. The risk management system is audited for correctness, appropriateness and efficiency on the basis of samples. At Bechtle, the process-dependent monitoring measures are subdivided into organisational security measures, such as the separation of functions and access restrictions as well as controls. The latter are taken care of by the individual operational areas and the person responsible for risk management. funktion Maßnahmen Organisa-\n\nRisikobewertung\n\nImage /page/119/Figure/3 description: This image is a flowchart that describes a risk management system. The flowchart starts with a box at the top labeled \"Risk management system\". This box has three branches: \"Internal monitoring system\", \"Early risk detection system\", and \"Risk handling\". The \"Internal monitoring system\" branch has two sub-branches: \"Process-independent monitoring measures\" and \"Process-specific monitoring measures\". The \"Process-independent monitoring measures\" branch has a sub-branch labeled \"Independent monitoring function\". The \"Process-specific monitoring measures\" branch has two sub-branches: \"Controls\" and \"Organizational measures\". The \"Early risk detection system\" branch has four sub-branches: \"Risk identification\", \"Risk assessment\", \"Risk control\", and \"Risk communication\". The \"Risk handling\" branch has two sub-branches: \"Risk control\" and \"Risk communication\".\n\n#### RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OF THE BECHTLE GROUP\n\nRISIKOMANAGEMENTSYSTEM DES BECHTLE KONZERNS\n\nProzessabhängige Überwachungsmaßnahmen\n\nRisikoidentifikation\n\n**internes Überwachungssystem**\n\nProzessunabhängige Überwachungsmaßnahmen\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\nWithin the context of risk management, effective continuous communication across all hierarchical levels is crucial for the systemic connection with the operating business. Important instruments for organising and controlling the necessary flow of information are therefore the committees and the various teamwork formats at different management levels. At the top level of the Bechtle Group, this comprises the Supervisory Board, Executive Board and risk management meetings. At management level, these are primarily the meetings of the Executive Vice Presidents, Vice Presidents and management and strategy meetings, planning and individual discussions as well as more informal management meetings with the Executive Board.\n\n#### INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nIn accordance with Section 315 (4) of the German Commercial Code (HGB), capital market-oriented companies must address the key features of the internal control and risk management system (ICS) with regard to the Group accounting process in the Group management report. In this regard, Bechtle uses the definition of the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW). According to this definition, an [idw.de](https://idw.de) ICS consists of the principles, procedures and measures that management introduces in the company for the organisational implementation of the decisions of the management. The tasks and goals of the ICS are as follows:\n\nidw.de\n\n- � To ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the business activity. This also includes the protection of tangible and intangible assets as well as the prevention and/or detection of financial losses that may be caused by own employees or third parties;\n- � To ensure the correctness and reliability of the internal and external accounting;\n- � To comply with the legal regulations applicable to the company.\n\nThe principles, the structural and process organisation and the processes of the accounting-related ICS are outlined in policies and organisational instructions that are continually adjusted in line with the latest external and internal developments. The controls defined throughout the group are outlined in a group accounting manual. The requirements in the guidelines and organisational instructions are based on statutory standards as well as on voluntarily defined corporate standards.\n\nWith respect to the financial accounting, this ensures that business transactions and facts are fully and duly identified, processed and reflected in the accounts, thereby ensuring correct accounting.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-121-0\"></span>E F F E C T I V E N E S S O F T H E I N T E R N A L C O N T R O L A N D RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\\*\n\nThe internal control system and the risk management system are dynamic systems that are continuously adapted to changes in the business model, the type and scope of business transactions or responsibilities. As a result, internal and external audits can reveal potential for improvement in individual cases with regard to the appropriateness and effectiveness of controls, e.g. in the reporting year in the field of general IT controls. With regard to the measurement of these management systems, the Executive Board has no evidence that they are inadequate or ineffective in their entirety.\n\n#### RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT\n\nTo pinpoint all risks relevant to Bechtle as comprehensively as possible, the company uses a risk pool. The risk pool describes all potential risks that the Bechtle Group is able to identify. Within the scope of a CSR risk assessment, this also includes any non-financial risks identified. To identify risks correctly, Bechtle makes use of risk measurement forms. These are used to structure various risk types in the form of a checklist. The content of this list can be adapted and supplemented by the stakeholders involved in risk identification and measurement, in order to take any peculiarities of individual business areas into consideration.\n\nThe risk measurement form, which contains risks from the risk pool and whose purpose is to map possible risks as comprehensively as possible, serves as the basis for the risk assessment: each risk is assessed for probability of occurrence and expected damage amount (risk potential) and, within the risk analysis, is positioned in a risk matrix indicating the significance (A, B and C risks). The result is an additive presentation of all identified risks in the form of qualified overviews, both for Bechtle as a group and for each of its business segments. Within the context of the risk assessment, the Bechtle Group performs a net measurement of certain risks (risk measurement after initiation of specific measures). For this process, lump-sum figures are used for main and individual risks. The gross measurement serves as the basis for calculating the risk-bearing capacity. The risk capacity describes the financial potential of the Bechtle Group to absorb any losses that may result from the occurrence of the identified business risks. The result of this calculation for the query from the fourth quarter of 2023 was that the share of the total risk position in the risk-bearing capacity is a comfortable 43.3 per cent.\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### RISK CONTROL\n\nAs a matter of principle, the individual operational units are responsible for the risk control. The company responds to identified risks on a case-by-case basis and with different strategies.\n\n� **Risk avoidance:** refraining from activities involving risks may mean that opportunities cannot be used either\n\n- � **Risk reduction:** reduction of the average probability of occurrence and/or of the amount of the loss\n- � **Risk transfer:** transfer of the risk to another (insurance) company\n- � **Risk acceptance:** acceptance of the risk without taking countermeasures\n\n#### RISK REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION\n\nThe management of the Bechtle Group holds risk management meetings at least once a year, the formal requirements of which are constantly reviewed and supplemented by the risk situation of new subject areas. In addition to the risk management meetings of the Bechtle Group, separate meetings at which the risks are explicitly discussed and continuously reassessed with the responsible individuals are held for each segment and executive division. The members of the Executive Board attend the meetings of the essential operative units as well as the group's meeting completely. The Executive Vice Presidents, Vice Presidents and individual employees entrusted with controlling and risk management tasks also take part in the meetings. Thus, all areas and responsibilities that are important for the company's success are involved in the risk management process. At quarterly intervals, this group receives a status query in which the previous measurement of risks is reviewed and any new risks are queried. In addition to the standard reporting and measurement of risks at these meetings, there is an arrangement for ad hoc reporting. This ensures that critical issues are communicated immediately to the Executive Board and subsequently to the responsible committees (Audit Committee, Supervisory Board) and the other persons involved in the risk management process.\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-123-0\"></span>SUSTAINABILITY RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nIn the 2022 fiscal year, Bechtle expanded the processes for identifying and measuring sustainability risks. Compliance with new legal obligations and other requirements, such as the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC), played a central role here.\n\nBechtle defines sustainability risks as risks for the company associated with social and environmental factors (outside-in perspective) as well as possible ecological and social effects of the company's own business activities that have a negative impact on the environment (inside-out perspective). The company defines sustainability opportunities as the potentially positive ecological and social effects of its own business activities on the outside.\n\nThe survey for sustainability risk management is carried out in a separate questionnaire, but on a quarterly basis, analogous to the classic risk surveys. For the identification of sustainability risks, Bechtle makes use of a separate sustainability risk pool that consists of two parts: � Outside-in perspective of sustainability risks;\n\n� Inside-out perspective of sustainability risks – these result from the four thematic areas of our Sustainability Strategy 2030: ethical business, environment, people and digital future.\n\nFor the two perspectives shown, the sustainability risks are measured differently. While the measurement of sustainability risks from the outside-in perspective is based on the measurement of traditional risk management, the measurement of sustainability risks from the inside-out perspective only follows this in part. From an inside-out perspective, sustainability risks are generally assessed according to the two known dimensions: the probability of occurrence and the risk impact (\"loss amount\"). The definition of the classes of probability of occurrence takes place in the same way as in the conventional risk management system. However, a separate measurement logic referred to as the \"severity\" of the risk is employed for assessing the risk impact (\"loss amount\"). This severity is made up of measurements of the extent, scope and irreversibility of a potential risk materialising. All identified sustainability risks are summarised in a risk matrix.\n\nThe individual units are responsible for monitoring the sustainability risks and controlling any actions to address these risks. The sustainability risk reporting is presented in a separate section under \"Risks\".\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-124-0\"></span>**OPPORTUNITIES**\n\n### MARKET AND COMPETITION\n\nLike every company, Bechtle is subject to developments in the industry and the economy as a whole. Obviously, a positive economic development presents opportunities for further successful company growth. But even if the overall economy or the industry stagnates or declines, Bechtle has the opportunity to grow faster than the market and thus expand its relative market share. Bechtle once again proved to be very resilient in the reporting period, particularly in view of the weak macroeconomic development. Although the reluctance of medium-sized customers, in particular, also had an impact on us, Bechtle was able to develop positively overall in an extremely difficult environment. The general demand for IT driven by the digital transformation, our international presence in 14 European country markets, our broad solution expertise and the diversity of customer groups and sizes were the basis for this. Demand for IT solutions was high across Europe, driven in particular by the Public Sector division in the reporting period and, in terms of technology, by strong demand for network solutions.\n\nThe IT market is characterised by rapid technological innovation and relatively short product cycles. Due to the digitisation, information technology is becoming increasingly important. IT is therefore an integral part of operational value creation and a decisive success factor for all companies and public institutions. This has been shown, in particular, by the experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, due to the complexity of IT, many enterprises need competent partners for the successful and secure operation of their IT infrastructures, increasingly also in the field of high-quality services such as managed or cloud services. Most customers also rely on the expertise of an experienced partner for questions relating to the use of artificial intelligence (AI), the implications of which are not yet fully foreseeable. Therefore, the markets addressed by Bechtle in Western and Central Europe still offer significant, increasing growth potential. Our product and service portfolio covers almost all major current and foreseeable needs of industrial customers and Public Sector clients. With this comprehensive offer, Bechtle distinguishes itself from most direct competitors. In terms of strategic and structural positioning, our company is well prepared to make use of any newly emerging growth potential.\n\nIT markets in the individual European countries – especially in German-speaking regions – have been in a phase of intensive consolidation for several years, which Bechtle is making good use of. Thanks to our robust financial resources and good reputation, we have been able to complete 113 acquisitions since our company was founded, continuously strengthening our market position. In view of the progressive consolidation of the industry and the Bechtle Group's persistently excellent financial situation and funding, the company will have further opportunities to fortify its competitive position, e.g. by\n\nImage /page/124/Picture/6 description: The image shows a simple line drawing of an open book.

Against this background, Bechtle made seven acquisitions in six countries in the reporting period. We have further improved our funding by means of the successful issue of a convertible bond, opening the way for further growth through acquisitions throughout Europe. By linking the existing trading business in the respective countries with system-integration services, we are improving our market position and increasing our growth potential.\n\nThe Bechtle Group occupies a leading competitive position in Germany and Europe. This size creates opportunities on the customer side, as Bechtle can set itself apart from many of its competitors with a comprehensive portfolio of solutions and a holistic view of the customer's IT. High availabilities and therefore fast delivery times are also of great importance when selecting an IT partner. The very good and intensive relationships with our suppliers are of paramount importance here. Bechtle is one of the preferred partners of all well-known IT manufacturers and distributors in Europe. Despite its size, Bechtle's decentralised structure enables it to quickly and flexibly leverage any weaknesses of its competitors for the purpose of increasing the regional market penetration. The group has the size and financial strength of an international business combined with the agility and customer proximity of a local mid-sized enterprise.\n\n#### CUSTOMERS\n\nImage /page/125/Figure/12 description: The image shows a book icon above the text \"See chart\".\n\n[Industry segmentation,](#page-43-0) [page 44](#page-43-0)\n\nBechtle has a broadly diversified customer structure – from smaller customers to large corporations – which we serve via various channels. We have historically developed a particularly high level of expertise in business with SME customers. Due to this broad diversification, industry-specific economic trends and special investment-related framework conditions are only of a high relevance for the company from a location perspective. The success of the Bechtle Group as a whole is not endangered, as Bechtle has the opportunity to balance and compensate for the weaknesses of individual sectors or regions. This is another reason why Bechtle plans to offer the entire portfolio, including services, in all 14 European countries where Bechtle has a presence in the medium term. Apart from the unique aspect of regional customer proximity, the ability to serve customers on an international scale is thus growing in importance. As Bechtle is the only system house in Europe with a presence throughout Western and Central Europe, this unique selling point in turn creates opportunities for us.\n\n[See Business Actitivy,](#page-38-0) [Public sector clients,](#page-38-0) [page 39](#page-38-0)\n\nPublic Sector clients are an important customer segment for Bechtle. In the past, we used to generate about a third of the business volume with these customers, and the share has become even higher over the last four years. Bechtle has always considered the specialisation with regard to the requirements of Public Sector clients and the focus on special aspects of the contract-awarding practice in this customer segment to be a great opportunity. The developments in recent years have confirmed the notion that the investment behaviour of this customer group is less susceptible to the influence of economic trends and is often even anti-cyclical.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-126-0\"></span>It is therefore conceivable that clients from the Public Sector may even increase their demand in times of crisis. The digitisation trend – which was only triggered or which was heightened by the pandemic in many areas – is associated with further opportunities for further successful business in this customer segment. Moreover, the need for digitisation is also driven by the corresponding legal requirements, which could trigger further demand on the part of these customers.\n\nBechtle's long-standing presence in the IT market, and in particular in the customer group of small to medium-sized companies, represents a high barrier to market entry for potential competitors. A strong competitive position in the SME segment thus enables our company to expand its market leadership in this area. At the same time, we also want to further intensify our business with large customers.\n\nIn the trading business, we are active in 14 European countries. We want to further expand our market share in all 14 countries, irrespective of acquisitions. This is to be promoted by means of marketing measures that address a wider spectrum of customers and by further internationalising the business. For cross-border transactions in particular, Bechtle offers a comprehensive range of services with its own group units, which is supported by global delivery capability via the Global IT Alliance (GITA) established in 2014.\n\nAt bechtle.com, Bechtle merges the trading business of its online shops with the service offering of the system houses on a single digital platform. Driven by our Digital Business Services, this holistic [See Business activity,](#page-39-0) online platform is to be further expanded in the coming years. This provides the opportunity to offer customers Bechtle's entire portfolio, to better utilise existing potential and to exploit synergies. Additionally, bechtle.com will be further expanded in order to increasinlgy advance digitisation in cus-[bechtle.com](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en) tomer contact and order behaviour. This will also help us to increase our productivity and improve our efficiency.\n\n#### M A N U FA C T U R E R S A N D D I S T R I B U T O R S\n\nThe Bechtle Group maintains close partnerships with all major vendors and distributors in the IT industry, and the majority of the certifications have the highest partner status. In line with our sustainability strategy and the Bechtle Code of Conduct, we treat our suppliers and vendors in a respectful and cooperative manner. We maintain close contact with our strategic partners, coordinate our alignment with them on a regular basis and continue to develop our business model. Intensive cooperation with partner companies enables us to offer technology solutions that meet our customers' growing demands at all times. Thus, we are expanding our growth opportunities especially by means of an extensive range of individual service solutions for corporate customers and Public Sector clients.\n\n[See Business activity,](#page-37-0) [IT E-Commerce,](#page-37-0) [page 38](#page-37-0)\n\n[page 40](#page-39-0)\n\nbechtle.com\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\nBechtle has very close and trusting relationships with its suppliers. Cooperation with Bechtle is extremely important for suppliers, as we are one of the largest providers in the European IT market and can therefore reach many potential customers. Due to the close integration and the high relevance of Bechtle for its partners, we have the opportunity to benefit more than many competitors from the bonus programmes of vendors and distributors.\n\nTo promote the strategic collaboration with key vendors, Bechtle employs Vendor Integrated Product Managers (VIPM), who know and promote the interests of the vendors as well as those of Bechtle. The advantage of VIPMs is that vendor information is forwarded to procurement, sales and service staff without delay in a centralised and target-oriented manner. This enables Bechtle to offer its customers a portfolio of services that always reflects the state of the art. At the same time, this increases the quality of sales activities, and customers benefit immediately from innovative products from the respective vendors. In return, the vendors promptly receive largely unfiltered user feedbacks about existing products and requirements for future products.\n\nAdditional synergies are achieved through the standardisation of logistics processes and synchronisation of the ERP systems between Bechtle and its partners. This expands the product offer, increases the availability of the goods and enhances the attractiveness of Bechtle among other distributors and vendors. In addition, it gives our company the opportunity to further increase its efficiency and optimise its costs. Furthermore, improvements in logistical processes, and thus the avoidance of unnecessary transport, also offer opportunities to reduce CO2 emissions.\n\n**Events establish strong bridges between the employees and to customers. Bechtle has numerous events on its calendar. The events are held online, in person or hybrid, and are highly specialised or of general interest. All events attract a broad audience.**\n\nMelanie Dollmann, Event Management, Bechtle AG\n\nFabian Grau, Event Management, Bechtle AG\n\nMarie Durst, Event Management, Bechtle AG\n\nfrom left to right\n\nImage /page/127/Picture/10 description: In an indoor shot, a man and a woman are posing in an office setting.

The man is standing next to the desk, wearing a blue suit, a white shirt, brown shoes, and orange socks. In the background, there is a seating area with two women sitting on yellow chairs. The office has a modern design with white walls and dark gray carpet.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### S E R V I C E S P E C T R U M\n\nIT is becoming increasingly complex. Enterprise customers are therefore dependent on IT consulting and often expect their service provider to provide holistic solutions for their IT requirements from a [See Business segments,](#page-34-0) single source. Bechtle offers its customers an extremely broad portfolio that covers all IT-related requirements. We are therefore ideally placed to benefit from this trend. Moreover, Bechtle has duly positioned itself through acquisitions, strategic alliances and competence centres especially tuned to market demand and trends, and by hiring and retaining qualified staff. We intend to continue to develop along these lines in future.\n\nIn connection with the procurement and operation of IT, many companies usually focus on several features, such as competitiveness, efficiency gain and modernisation. To meet these diverse demands, Bechtle analyses the customer's existing corporate processes in order to systematically offer solutions and IT management models, such as outsourcing or cloud computing. Our broad portfolio enables us to devise optimal solutions that are tailored to each customer's specific needs. As a one-stop provider, we have great advantages over smaller and niche providers. Furthermore, due to the high and increasing relevance of IT to all business processes and increased security concerns, customers attach great importance to the reliability of their service provider when selecting their IT partner. In addition to its 40 years of experience and advanced solution expertise, Bechtle also enjoys a strong, solid financial position. These factors directly influence the choice of service provider, prices, and how and from whom external services are procured. As a financially robust and reliable partner with an excellent reputation, Bechtle will continue to enjoy attractive growth opportunities. Especially customer relationships in the so-called \"as-a-service\" business can benefit from this. These relationships are usually of a long-term nature, which facilitates business development planning. Also, this area generally enables higher margins than the conventional trading or project business. While, during the pandemic, our customers ordered mainly conventional hardware, especially home office equipment, they are now investing more heavily in comprehensive infrastructures once again. At this point, Bechtle has the opportunity to provide customers with suitable as-a-service models, thereby benefiting from this longer-term, projectable higher-margin business.\n\nFor many years, we have been selling own-brand peripheral products under the name ARTICONA. For this purpose, the Bechtle Group has its own purchasing company in Taiwan. The portfolio comprises IT accessories and connectivity products. ARTICONA is available to all companies of the Bechtle Group. In this way, all our customers benefit from the excellent value for money of the ARTICONA products, which also results in higher profitability.\n\nCloud computing is still an area with great growth potential. Cloud computing is widely used in large corporations, and the demand for cloud solutions is on the rise among small and medium-sized customers as well. In cloud computing, processing performance, storage, applications and IT services are obtained in real time via data networks. The fees for the individual services are based on actual usage. Bechtle is active in the cloud computing market, both in cooperation with renowned partners and with a proprietary solution portfolio. Bechtle has a broad portfolio of virtualisation and server technologies, infrastructure solutions and security-relevant applications. Accordingly, we are able to\n\nImage /page/128/Picture/6 description: The image contains a book icon and the text \"See Business se\".\n\n[page 35 ff](#page-34-0)\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\nmeet specific customer needs relating to the provision and operation of cloud IT services. The offer is supplemented with consulting and integration services for cloud computing, as the specific services often need to be integrated and networked with existing systems.\n\nBechtle Clouds represents another key aspect of our cloud offering. Under this name, Bechtle bundles public and business cloud services. As a multi-cloud service provider, Bechtle Clouds offers custom-produced cloud services as well as numerous public cloud solutions. This allows us to benefit from the growing demand for cloud services. Overall, Bechtle wants to strengthen the platform business. Our CTO, who holds the position of Executive Vice President, is responsible for all platform activities at Bechtle: the Bechtle Service Factory with its managed service offerings, the further development of the central web platform bechtle.com, the Bechtle Clouds platform and the operation of the Bechtle data centres in Frankfurt am Main, Rüsselsheim and Mutterstadt.\n\nDigitalisation and the trending topic of artificial intelligence (AI) also offer opportunities for the Bechtle Group. The complexity of the industrial IT landscape as well as the relevance of IT to corporate workflows and production processes will continue to grow. The integration of IT in production processes and the incorporation of AI, in particular, requires holistic thinking and competencies, both in the field of IT and in the field of engineering. In recent years, Bechtle has prepared for these challenges through systematic training measures as well as acquisitions and is thus able to address the demand in this area.\n\n#### COMPANY ORGANISATION\n\nImage /page/129/Picture/7 description: The image shows a simple line drawing of a book. The book is open, with two pages visible. The pages are filled with lines, suggesting text. The book is upright and centered in the image. Below the book is the word \"Management\".\n\n[See Management](#page-57-0) [structure, page](#page-57-0) 58\n\nWith more than 100 system houses, Bechtle has a strong presence in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as in France, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. The decentralised structure of the Bechtle Group is of great significance, as every location is a separate legal entity with a Managing Director responsible for the business performance in their respective territory. The decentralisation principle creates opportunities by promoting a sense of responsibility and entrepreneurial drive at the individual locations. Moreover, locally and regionally positioned system houses enable Bechtle to address the often small and medium-sized customers at eye level and at the same time – at the aggregate group level and via the e-commerce companies that operate on a nationwide basis – supra-regional companies and groups that need a large IT service provider as a trusted partner. The Bechtle Group thus benefits from decentralised responsibility and decision-making structures, on the one hand and, due to its size, from economies of scale with respect to centralised administrative tasks as well as the purchasing and logistics processes that are combined under Bechtle AG, on the other hand. Additionally, competence centres, specialised product management teams and segment heads bundle expertise that is made available centrally to all locations and segments.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-130-0\"></span>With the expansion of the system integration activities to all 14 European countries in which Bechtle is already represented by trading companies, the same opportunities also arise in the respective countries as well as additional growth potential for the Bechtle Group.\n\nThe organised interaction between central support and a decentralised market approach by the units on location yields improved opportunities for growth in the respective market, e.g. in the Public Sector division, in the application solutions segment as well as in the fields of managed services and cloud services. Bechtle recognises clear opportunities in supporting the provision of services centrally, where possible, or in taking them over completely in order to achieve efficiency gains and economies of scale.\n\n#### HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nEmployees are a key part of the Bechtle business model. Retaining employees on a long-term basis, maintaining high motivation and fostering a positive corporate culture are therefore essential to our business success. Further increasing the attractiveness of Bechtle as an employer represents both a challenge and an opportunity. Bechtle conducts systematic employer branding to position itself as an attractive employer and uses its strong employer brand to recruit new staff to the company and to retain existing staff in the long term. We want to further expand our employer branding in order to remain successful in this area in future.\n\nWhen it comes to recruiting new employees, the shortage of qualified staff poses a challenge for Bechtle. However, the limited availability of qualified people could also create opportunities, e.g. if the company manages to train a sufficient number of skilled employees and thus meet its needs by means of its own initiatives. Apprenticeships are therefore a key focus of Bechtle's HR work. We plan on stepping up our training ratio in Germany to about 10 per cent by 2030. Furthermore, we also invest intensively in the further training of our staff. This active career-development offering enhances the satisfaction of our employees, which translates into long-term loyalty. Our headcount is constantly growing, and our turnover rate of 9.1 per cent is below the industry average, indicating that Bechtle is successfully taking advantage of opportunities to recruit and retain employees.\n\nIn 2022, Bechtle introduced a special programme for career shifters in order to address even people who do not have any IT experience. In this way, Bechtle not only addresses the shortage of skilled workers – the participants in the programme often bring diverse cultural backgrounds, different specialist knowledge and a wealth of experience from a wide range of industries. This, in turn, increases Bechtle's diversity.\n\nIn the reporting period, Bechtle completed a group-wide satisfaction survey among all employees. Compared to the previous study, employee satisfaction at Bechtle has increased. The results are to be taken into consideration in future HR work and in the further development of the employer branding. The survey is to be conducted every two years.\n\n[See People at Bechtle,](#page-61-0) [page 62 ff](#page-61-0)\n\n[bechtle.com/de-en/career](http://bechtle.com/de-en/career)\n\nSee Forecast report,\n\npage 147 ff\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\n### SUSTAINABILITY\n\nSustainable business is a must in order to face the great challenges of our age, from environmental and climate protection to IT security, resilient supply chains and the protection of human rights along the value chain. As a responsible company, we want to tackle these challenges in close cooperation with the business world, civil society and politics, and we regard our sustainable operations as an opportunity to make a contribution to general welfare.\n\nAround the globe, the digital and ecological transformation of society and the economy is resulting in changing business models. This trend benefits companies that offer technologies and services for the successful design of these transformation processes. Digitisation and investments in sustainability are making companies more innovative and crisis-proof.\n\nWe are seeing a rapid rise in demand, both on the part of our customers and on the part of the financial market, not only for a sustainable product portfolio, but also with regard to our company's corporate governance. We are convinced that the establishment of the sustainability management structure, the Bechtle Sustainability Strategy 2030 and the associated goals and actions will open up great opportunities for positioning Bechtle as an innovative IT company on a long-term basis.\n\nIn the area in which we operate, there is great potential in the fields of resource efficiency, recycling and IT security. With our portfolio of sustainable technologies, solutions and services, we are actively supporting our customers in the digital transformation and the fulfilment of their corporate digital responsibility.\n\nSustainable management is also an important criterion for attracting and retaining staff. Young people especially want to work for an employer who does sustainable business. We clearly sense this in interviews with applicants, apprentices and students.\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-132-0\"></span>**RISKS**\n\nThe management believes that the risks described below could have a detrimental effect on the company's earnings, assets and financial position, its reputation and its valuation on the capital market. This does not apply to the sustainability risks described in the inside-out perspective. Nevertheless, this list does not include all risks the Bechtle Group might be exposed to. Risks that are not yet known or risks that are currently considered to be of little significance could also impair the company's performance.\n\nThe 2023 reporting period was characterised by major uncertainties. The very tense macroeconomic situation that took centre stage was, in turn, influenced by various geopolitical events: the ongoing war in Ukraine, the crisis in the Middle East exacerbated by Hamas' attack on Israel, inflationary tendencies and the associated uncertainty in large parts of the economy. Due to these general conditions, risks have materialised in some cases and new risk scenarios have also emerged. However, Bechtle has obviously not suffered any direct effects, and the indirect effects have only affected the company to a limited extent. Nevertheless, the high level of uncertainty associated with the aforementioned general environment has caused some of our customers to postpone planned investments in IT. Overall, however, the IT market and Bechtle are showing strong resilience to the overall economic situation. In this respect, we can state that some of the macroeconomic risks at Bechtle have materialised only in mitigated form or not at all. Accordingly, this risk report merely describes any remaining direct risks that the Bechtle Group was exposed to as of the reporting date.\n\n#### RISK ASSESSMENT\n\nTo introduce suitable risk control measures, identified risks are assessed on the basis of their estimated probability of materialising and the loss amount expected upon materialisation with respect to the earnings, assets and financial position of the Bechtle Group, and subsequently classified as \"high\", \"medium\" or \"low\" in a matrix. To ensure uniform understanding, the definitions used for the measurement are described below.\n\nSee Risk identifi\nand assessment,\n\n| Probability of occurrence | Description                                                                                                      | Per cent |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| High                      | The risk is very likely to occur.

Additionally, the trust that companies put in a positive economic development plays a major role. The Bechtle Group generates over 60 per cent of its business volume in Germany and just under 40 per cent in the international markets. Thus, the development of the European economy as a whole and of the German economy in particular has a key impact on our company's growth. Weaker, or worse, decreasing economic activity involves risks to the earnings, assets and financial position of the Bechtle Group.\n\nIn the reporting period, the macroeconomic environment continued to be influenced by the global crises and their direct and indirect effects. High inflation, discussions about energy supply and the associated uncertainties had a negative impact on the economy as a whole. As a result, gross domestic product shrank in the 2023 reporting period. The IT market also experienced weaker growth due to the general conditions described above, but still showed positive rates compared to other sectors. IT is now an essential factor in value creation for all companies and Public Sector clients. IT expenditure therefore tends to remain stable or even increase, even in times of high uncertainty. In this respect, it is also a positive sign that incoming orders rose more strongly again in the second half of 2023. We must continue to monitor both the effects of the global crises and the uncertainties affecting society as a whole, as an unexpectedly long continuation of the current situation could lead to a further overall economic slowdown, which could also have a greater impact on the IT market and consequently also on Bechtle.\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe consider the probability of occurrence of macroeconomic and industry performance risks to be high. This could involve substantial detrimental effects on our earnings, assets and financial position. We consider this risk to be high.\n\n#### BUSINESS ACTIVITY\n\n**Cost structure.** The cost structure of the Bechtle Group is characterised by a high proportion of personnel expenses, which can only be adjusted with some delay in case of changes in capacity utilisation. In phases of a weaker economy or curbed investment affinity of customers, the company can only reduce functional costs to a certain extent in the medium run without significantly modifying the employment situation, e.g. by means of short-time work or by making use of the natural fluctuation. All measures affecting the personnel expenses must always take the existing or possible future personnel risk (lack of qualified staff) into consideration. Therefore, Bechtle endeavours to retain employees on a long-term basis and wants the labour market to perceive the company as a highly attractive, reliable employer. The often rather short-term risk of lower earnings is countered by the long-term [See](#page-130-0) opportunity of successful employer branding and bonding of qualified staff. In the reporting period, Bechtle's organic headcount increase was not as dynamic as in other years. On the one hand, this was a deliberate strategic decision in order to keep the cost pressure in check in the face of the extremely challenging framework conditions. On the other hand, however, Bechtle is also becoming increasingly successful in achieving growth in business volume with a disproportionately low increase in personnel. One reason for this is that we are digitalising an increasing number of processes internally. Secondly, we can make our work more efficient and productive. In this way, we counteract the risk of a disproportionately high increase in personnel expenses to a certain extent.\n\nFor the Bechtle Group to retain its earning power, the salary level of all employees as a whole should not rise excessively. However, in view of the shortage of skilled personnel and the demographic change, it will become increasingly difficult to staff all vacancies with qualified people. To attract applicants, Bechtle could be forced to raise the salary level. Bechtle endeavours to counteract this risk by strengthening the employer branding, by perpetuating its long-standing emphasis on training measures and by focusing more intensively on the employees and their qualifications in the context of acquisitions. The risk of a disproportionate increase in salary levels has gained additional weight in the past two years due to inflation. In the 2023 reporting period, Bechtle was able to keep the increase in organic personnel costs at a moderate level. The inflation adjustment payment made to the majority of employees also had a positive effect on the development of personnel costs. Although the employees received this payment in the first half of 2023, the relevant provision was recognised in the [See](#page-63-0) [Personnel expenses,](#page-63-0) [page 64](#page-63-0)\n\nImage /page/134/Figure/6 description: The image shows a book icon. The book is open, and there are several horizontal lines on each page, representing text. Below the book icon, the word \"See\" is written in a sans-serif font.\n\n[Opportunities,](#page-130-0)  [Personnel,](#page-130-0)  [page](#page-130-0) 131\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nincome statement in the fourth quarter of 2022. As salary negotiations with employees are generally conducted at the beginning of the year, the risk did not increase specifically during the course of the reporting period. The risk described above cannot be seen without the associated risk of an increasing fluctuation rate. As in the previous year, the focus of salary negotiations should therefore be on lower salary levels. At higher salary levels, Bechtle endeavours to respond by increasing the focus on variable salary components.\n\nDespite the aforesaid, we consider the occurrence of the risks associated with the development of personnel expenses and salaries to be highly probable. This could result in substantial detrimental effects on the earnings, assets and financial position of the Bechtle Group. We consider this risks to be high.\n\n[See](#page-126-0) [Opportunities, Manufacturers](#page-126-0) [and distributors](#page-126-0) [page 127 f](#page-126-0)\n\n**Procurement.** Bechtle buys its products from all renowned IT vendors and distributors. Across Europe, there are around 270 vendors and over 2,000 distributors. In every national market in which Bechtle is represented, the company has established a close network with vendors and distributors. As the Bechtle Group continues to grow, vendors could increasingly start supplying directly without going through distributors. As a result, the bonus payments received from distributors could be discontinued or reduced. This, in turn, could impair the earnings and margin of Bechtle.\n\nWe consider the occurrence of risks from the direct supply by vendors to be highly probable. This could result in some detrimental effects on the earnings, assets and financial position. We consider this risk to be high.\n\nTraditionally, the vendors on the IT market have always cooperated with partner companies such as Bechtle in order to boost their market share. This cooperation involves the yearly determination of individual targets for the business with the respective vendor's products and services. The vendor incentivises the achievement of targets by means of bonus payments, refunds or marketing grants. These programmes can be modified by the vendors, e.g. to realign the incentives with the vendors' new business segments. A weaker positioning of Bechtle in these fields could result in a reduction of the funds provided by the vendors. Bechtle counters this risk by closely collaborating with all major vendors. In this way, Bechtle learns of the vendors' new developments at an early stage and is able duly to respond.\n\nWe classify the risks from the vendors' terms of sale as a high risk. We consider the occurrence of this risk to be probable. In the event of the occurrence of these risks, we would expect substantial detrimental effects on the earnings, assets and financial position.\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\nDifficulties in the global supply chains led to a significant increase in inventories at Bechtle in 2021 and 2022. This was necessary especially with regard to the project business, in which a solution often includes various different products. Where individual components of an overall project are unavailable or difficult to obtain, Bechtle is forced to store the components already procured. Thus, there is a risk in connection with the costs for additional storage capacities, higher logistics management expenses or an increased capital commitment. There is also the risk of possible write-downs on inventories. As a result, the Group has already taken measures to reduce inventories again in 2022. These measures have had a positive effect – in addition to the easing of supply chains – so that inventories and the associated capital commitment could already be reduced in the reporting period. In general, availability continues to be an important criterion in customers' purchasing decisions. In this respect, this risk is always accompanied by the opportunity of benefiting from the market situation.\n\nDue to the positive development described above, we were able to downgrade the probability of occurrence. We estimate that the risks from the increase in inventories are likely to materialise and would have a substantial detrimental impact on earnings, assets and financial position. We consider this risk to be high.\n\nThe dynamic IT market inherently displays a strong focus on certain vendors, which entails the risk of an excessive dependence on these. This dependence can lead to cost increases and put the margin aspired to at risk. To counter this challenge, we cooperate with a broad spectrum of around 270 vendors.\n\nWe nevertheless consider the risks arising from dependencies on individual vendors as high. We consider the occurrence of this risk as highly probable and would expect substantial effects on our earnings, assets and financial position.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/1 description: The image contains the words \"OPPORTUNITY AND RISK REPORT\" in white text on a blue background, followed by the word \"RISK\" in white text on a gray background.\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/2 description: The image shows a simple line drawing of an open book. The book is depicted with several horizontal lines representing the pages, and the spine is visible on the right side.\n\n[See](#page-43-0) [Competitive position,](#page-43-0) [page 44 f](#page-43-0)\n\n**Service range.** On the IT market, Bechtle competes with numerous providers. Besides other conventional system houses and e-commerce providers, some vendors also engage in direct sales, thus becoming competitors. Large customers, in particular, are already cared for directly by some vendors. Some distributors also endeavour to do direct business with end customers, thereby becoming competitors of Bechtle. Especially in the cloud business, but also in the field of managed services, some large multinationals offer their services and try to sell their offerings directly to customers. Moreover, providers who used to operate exclusively in the private customer business are increasingly making efforts to gain a foothold in the business customer segment. Therefore, competition might intensify in future. We therefore see a risk that individual sales units cannot achieve the expected business volume due to the increased competition. However, due to its strong presence in many European regions and its international presence in 14 European countries, Bechtle has an advantage in terms of customer approach and loyalty, as well as with respect to delivery and the provision of services. No other competitor has such a strong presence in such a widespread area. Moreover, vendors cannot offer independent consulting services, and distributors have a more limited portfolio bandwidth. Through its consistent focus on efficient sales teams, Bechtle intends to maintain its competitive edge, thereby reducing the risk of entry of new competitors in Bechtle's customer base.\n\nWe consider the occurrence of general competitive risks to be probable and would expect substantial detrimental effects on our earnings, assets and financial position. These risks are classified as high.\n\n**Customers.** Bechtle's range of customers includes companies and public institutions of all sizes, with a certain focus on larger medium-sized enterprises. In total, Bechtle has over 70,000 customers. Therefore, the company does not depend on any individual customers. Nevertheless, loss of a larger customer could affect not only the individual local Bechtle company, but also the Bechtle Group as a whole. Bechtle counteracts this risk by applying the principle of close personal customer care and optimum performance in all customer relationships. In the segment of Public Sector clients, we see a consolidation trend in the form of bundling of the purchase volume of multiple clients (in so-called buying centres). Should a larger tender that comes about in this way be lost, Bechtle could lose market shares in this segment. In recent years, Bechtle has also been more successful in the large customer business and with regard to the conclusion of framework agreements. However, the loss of such a major order also harbours commensurate risks.\n\nAs a result, we have increased the risk assessment and rate the probability of occurrence as highly probable. If risks materialise, we expect substantial detrimental effects on our earnings, assets and financial position. The risks are therefore classified as high.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nDespite our efforts to maintain a secure business operation, the danger of falling victim to fraudulent activities is real. To effectively counter this threat, we have implemented robust internal security measures to protect our system from fraudulent transactions. In addition, we have taken intensive measures to raise our employees' awareness towards potential fraud.\n\nWe nevertheless consider these risks to be high. We consider the probability of their occurrence to be high, and they could result in some detrimental effects on our earnings, assets and financial position.\n\n**IT.** Nowadays, all companies depend on information technology. Due to the advanced digitalisation, all material business processes at Bechtle are closely linked to IT systems and applications. The use of IT involves various risks in areas such as e-commerce shop systems, order processing, ERP, controlling, financial accounting as well as collaboration and telephony applications. For example, a smooth process ranging from the enquiry and order placement to the delivery and invoicing could face an availability risk if the operability of the required IT systems and applications were to be endangered. Potential causes include the malfunction of infrastructure components, energy or telecommunications outages, disruptions or faults at partners or software providers and operating errors.\n\nWithin the internal IT, Bechtle continually endeavours to establish the preconditions to curb the risks associated with the operation of IT. Apart from measures such as the continued recruitment of personnel, this includes ongoing investments to make sure the platforms are secure and up to date.\n\nNevertheless, we consider it highly probable that these risks will materialise and that they would have a substantial detrimental impact on our earnings, assets and financial position. These risks are classified as high risks.\n\nThe increase in cybercrime is another risk. The probability and extent of damage from external attacks is very difficult to estimate. Attackers could exploit potential vulnerabilities of software products used. The intrusion of unauthorised parties into the IT system could result in a confidentiality risk, or the systems could lose their smooth operability after an attack. Furthermore, there is a risk of falling victim to a ransom attack.\n\nTo be prepared for potential emergency scenarios, the company's existing crisis plans need to be continually updated, and new ones need to be created, e.g. for new scenarios. For this purpose, Bechtle has appointed an interdisciplinary workgroup. Nevertheless, a new scenario could arise before a new emergency plan is elaborated.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\nDespite advanced protective mechanisms and security standards, we consider the occurrence of IT security risks to be highly probable. This could result in substantial detrimental effects on our earnings, assets and financial position. These risks are classified as high risks.\n\n**Personnel.** As a trading service provider, the employees as well as their training and education, motivation and commitment are key success factors for Bechtle. For the company's ongoing growth path, it is also important to be able to attract new personnel to Bechtle and retain them on a longterm basis. Therefore – also in view of the demographic change – the inability to recruit the required number of qualified people is one of the greatest HR risks. Moreover, risks exist in connection with the retention of employees in the company. This could result in a loss of expertise due to an above-average fluctuation in qualified personnel or customer satisfaction could suffer due to a lack of qualifications and a lack of performance orientation on the part of employees. Apart from further developing Bechtle's employer branding, the HR work therefore focuses on creating a positive work environment, providing operational training and promoting junior executives by means of internal development programmes. The second Group-wide employee satisfaction survey was completed in the reporting period. Overall satisfaction has increased compared to the previous survey. Investments in employer branding also had a positive effect. Both aspects are ultimately reflected in the lower fluctuation rate. As part of the growing international presence of the Bechtle Group, one of the objectives of HR work is to reduce the workload of the operating companies in Germany and abroad and leverage the efficiency potential by means of a uniform alignment.\n\nThe risk assessment was downgraded due to the positive developments resulting from higher employee satisfaction, the positive effects of employer branding and the resulting reduction in the fluctuation rate. The occurrence of fluctuation risks is considered probable. This could cause some detrimental effects on the earnings, assets and financial position. We categorise the risk as medium risk. We classify the recruitment risk as high, as it is very likely to occur and some detrimental effects on the earnings, assets and financial position cannot be ruled out.\n\n[See Training and](#page-63-0) [further education,](#page-63-0) [page](#page-63-0) 64 ff\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-140-0\"></span>**Sustainability.** In 2022, the processes relating to sustainability were expanded to identify and assess the associated risks. We differentiate between the outside-in perspective and the inside-out perspective. All in all, thanks to the early approach to the subject of sustainability, the risks of the Bechtle Group in this area are rather limited. Nevertheless, we have identified a number of risks that are relevant to a certain extent.\n\n**Outside-in perspective.** Sustainability topics are also gaining relevance on the financial markets. ESG ratings therefore increasingly serve as an instrument that investors or analysts consult with respect to the subject area of sustainability when deciding to buy or sell the Bechtle share. The various ESG ratings of the different rating agencies are often not comparable and are not adapted to sector-specific circumstances. Bechtle maintains ongoing dialogue with the rating agencies. Nevertheless, there is a risk that a poor assessment of individual criteria could lead to a poorer ESG rating overall. This could, in turn, lead to sell recommendations by analysts and sell decisions by investors. The recommendations resulting from the ESG ratings to be voted on in the Annual General Meeting may also be worse than in the past, which could result in lower approval rates.\n\nThe risk is therefore classified as high. The probability of occurrence of the risk is high and if it materialises, it could have some detrimental effects on earnings, assets and financial position.\n\n**Inside-out perspective.** Bechtle considers the greatest risk in the area of sustainability to be the risk of a lack of information security, which has already been described partially in the IT risks section. Bechtle has established the highest standards and is subject to the highest qualifications. At the same time, the risk of loss of company-relevant data cannot be ruled out completely when working with highly sensitive information on a daily basis.\n\nThe risk presented is to be classified as high. The probability of occurrence is high and the level of damage, i.e. the severity, is classified as high.\n\nOne of the key competitive advantages is proximity to the customer, which also requires a local presence. Our increasing internationality and the maintenance of the existing networked decentralised structure also leads to increased employee travel between locations. As a trading company, we are also dependent on the transport of goods, which also causes a certain amount of CO₂ emissions.\n\nWe consider the risk in relation to CO₂ emissions and the associated impact on climate change to be a medium risk. We consider the risk to be highly probable to occur. The level of damage of the risk, i.e. the severity, is to be regarded as medium.\n\n[For the measurement logic,](#page-123-0)  [see Opportunity and](#page-123-0) \n\n[risk management,](#page-123-0)  page [124 ff](#page-123-0)\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n[of the risks, see Notes,](#page-234-0) [page 235 ff](#page-234-0)\n\n<span id=\"page-141-0\"></span>**Risk management.** Currency, interest rate and liquidity risks are subject to active management on For quantification the basis of guidelines that apply to the entire group. In this context, the specific requirements for the organisational separation of the operations and auditing of the functional divisions are observed.\n\n> Derivative financial instruments are used exclusively for the purpose of hedging operational underlying transactions and mission-critical financial transactions in the form of currency futures, currency options and currency and interest swaps.\n\n> The financial risk management is characterised by clear allocation of responsibilities, central rules for the fundamental limitation of financial risks, purposeful alignment of the employed instruments to the requirements of the business activity and separate monitoring by a centrally controlled treasury.\n\n> **Receivables.** The solvency of our business customers plays an important role in the assessment of the future risk situation. Bechtle could be exposed to bad-debt risks if customers can no longer meet their payment obligations in due time or in full due to inadequate financial means or unfavourable economic developments. However, this risk is manageable in most fiscal years, as detailed monitoring of customer relationships including ongoing solvency checks and proactive receivables management help counteract this risk and eliminate the need for taking out trade credit insurance. Nevertheless, the situation of some industrial enterprises remained tense in the reporting period even after the COVID-19 pandemic, due especially to the inflationary framework conditions and the associated uncertain economic situation. Thus, this risk has also become clearer for Bechtle. However, the stable development of the DSO and the consistently low level of bad debts in the reporting period gave no cause for concern. Nevertheless, we regard the occurrence of bad-debt risks as highly probable and would expect substantial detrimental effects on our earnings, assets and financial position. These risks are classified as high risks.\n\n> Potential risks in connection with the investment of cash equivalents are limited by exclusively executing investments with banks with an excellent rating and within the scope of defined limits. Payment transactions, too, are largely handled via banks with a top rating.\n\nImage /page/141/Picture/9 description: The image shows a simple line drawing of an open book. The book is seen from the front, with the spine not visible. The pages are slightly fanned open, revealing several horizontal lines on each page, suggesting text or content within the book.\n\nSee [Assets position,](#page-107-0) [page 108 ff,](#page-107-0) and [Notes, Interest rate risk,](#page-236-0) [page 237 f](#page-236-0) **Interest rates.** Financial assets and liabilities with maturities of more than one year generally involve an interest rate risk. The ongoing inflationary conditions in the reporting period led to increases in the key interest rate by the European Central Bank. To counteract persistently high inflation rates, the key interest rate could be further raised. This, in turn, would trigger adjustments of the interest rates charged by banks and thus significantly higher interest expenses, resulting in a higher risk for Bechtle. The interest rate risks of the Bechtle Group are centrally analysed, and the resulting measures are actively managed by the central finance department. The approach to this area is subject to regular review as determined by management.\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-142-0\"></span>Nevertheless, the occurrence of risks from changes in interest rates is considered to be highly probable. We would expect some detrimental effects on our earnings, assets and financial position. These risks are classified as high risks.\n\n**Foreign currencies.** Currency risks are incurred in particular in areas where receivables, liabilities, cash and planned transactions exist or will accrue in currencies other than the local currency of the parent company. The foreign currency risk is mainly limited to Swiss francs, as a considerable portion of the international business is generated in Switzerland. Except for Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, transactions take place mainly in euro countries and in euros. In some cases, goods are purchased in US dollars or other currencies in order to take advantage of better prices. The Bechtle Group hedges the currency risk with currency futures. Since the 2018 fiscal year, the hedging of net assets held by international subsidiaries in foreign currencies has comprised all non-euro countries. Currency futures are used in individual cases to hedge the currency risk associated with other currencies when purchasing goods or when customers pay in foreign currency. In the case of one-time amounts with terms to maturity that are usually short, these economic hedges are not accounted for as hedges. For projects that run over a longer period and generally have several associated hedges, the hedge accounting regulations of IFRS 9 are applied. Open currency transactions and the respective receivables and liabilities are analysed on a monthly basis and tested for effectiveness. There are neither any significant individual risks in this area, nor has an assessment been conducted.\n\n**Liquidity.** To ensure unlimited solvency, the company must have sufficient liquidity at all times. The liquidity situation is managed and monitored by the treasury. The financial position of the Bechtle Group as at the end of 2023 is very sound and extremely comfortable, with cash and cash equivalents and time deposits and securities totalling €465.8 million (previous year: €289.6 million) as well as a positive cash flow from operating activities of €459.0 million (previous year: €116.7 million). The probability of a liquidity risk materialising is limited.\n\nThe treasury department of the Bechtle Group ensures the liquidity supply for the group divisions and subsidiaries by means of cash pooling or inter-company loans. Furthermore, it controls the interest rate risk and is responsible for the assessment, analysis and monitoring of positions subject to market risks. The materialisation of liquidity risks is considered to be improbable. Weak detrimental effects on our earnings, assets and financial position cannot be fully excluded. The risk is classified as a low risk.\n\n[See Notes,](#page-235-0) [currency risk,](#page-235-0) [page 236 ff](#page-235-0) \n\n[See Financial position,](#page-113-0) [page 114 ff](#page-113-0) \n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### OTHERS\n\n[See Locations,](#page-58-0) [page 59 ff](#page-58-0)\n\n**Acquisitions.** Since its foundation, the Bechtle Group has acquired 113 companies. Takeovers are an essential part of the corporate strategy, which is designed with long-term profitable growth in mind. Bechtle intends to continue to strengthen and expand its market position by means of systematic acquisitions. At the same time, however, the decision to purchase a company and integrate it in the group always involves an entrepreneurial risk. It is always possible that the expectations placed on the acquired company may not fully materialise. Bechtle addresses this risk by conducting extensive due diligence audits in advance. The preparation, implementation and audit of acquisitions take place in line with defined competence arrangements and approval processes. Moreover, Bechtle has many years of experience in integrating companies. We have established the structures and processes that are necessary for this and pursue a post-merger concept that meets the group's needs in connection with the integration of newly acquired companies in the best way possible. For Bechtle, the opportunities that acquisitions offer therefore clearly outweigh the risks.\n\nWe believe that risks from acquisitions are likely to occur and would expect some detrimental effects on our earnings, assets and financial position. The risk is classified as a medium risk.\n\n**Legal environment.** Being active at an international level, the Bechtle Group is subject to various national laws. This may involve legal transaction risks – e.g. in connection with the wording of contracts – which Bechtle counters by engaging the internal legal department or an external legal consultancy at an early stage whenever necessary.\n\nAt present, the company is not involved in any legal disputes that we would expect to result in a noticeable detrimental effect on the consolidated earnings. Bechtle will create provisions for any future legal disputes in connection with the group's business if liabilities are likely to result and the amount of the liabilities can be determined with reasonable certainty.\n\nIn principle, however, there are always potential risks in the legal environment. The increase in general regulation and in legal requirements could result in such rules being overlooked. As the company placing such products on the market, Bechtle could also be subjected to product liability risks. We therefore consider the risks in the legal environment to be high. Their probability of occurrence is high, and we would expect significant effects on our earnings, assets and financial position.\n\n**Insurances.** Bechtle endeavours to cover risks that cannot be avoided by taking out insurance. For certain risks, it has become more difficult to find suitable insurances. Especially for IT risks, many insurance companies are no longer willing to provide coverage. Accordingly, there is a risk that Bechtle could be unable to duly insure material risks.\n\nDue to their specifics and character, we consider these risks to be high. The probability of occurrence is medium, and we consider the impact on our earnings, assets and financial position to be substantial.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\n• • • •\n\n### **OVERALL EXAMINATION OF OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS**\n\n• • • •\n\nCRIF (früher Bürgel) (Skala 1,0 bis 6,0) Creditreform (Skala 100 bis 600) Creditsafe (Skala 1,0 bis 6,0)\n\n• • • •\n\nThe evaluation of the group's overall opportunity and risk situation by the Executive Board is based on an examination of all major compound and individual risks under consideration of any opportunities that may arise.

Apart from the company's own internal risk assessment, Bechtle's credit rating and aggregate credit risk are regularly appraised and monitored by banks and rating agencies. Due to the sound capital structure and firstclass funding of the company, Bechtle has received excellent ratings for many years. There is no reason why this should change in the future.\n\nExcellent credit rating\n\n| Excellent creditworthiness 1.0/100<br>Very good creditworthiness 1.5/150<br>Good creditworthiness 2.0/200<br>Medium creditworthiness<br>Strained creditworthiness<br>Very low creditworthiness<br>Poor creditworthiness<br>Default 6.0/600 | 1.2<br>109<br>1.4<br>•<br>•<br>•<br>• | 1.2<br>106<br>1.4<br>•<br>•<br>•<br>• | 1.1<br>100<br>1.4<br>•<br>•<br>•<br>• | 1.2<br>100<br>1.4<br>•<br>•<br>•<br>• | 1.2<br>100<br>1.4<br>•<br>•<br>•<br>• |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 2019                                  | 2020                                  | 2021                                  | 2022                                  | 2023                                  |\n\n#### CREDIT RATINGS OF THE BECHTLE GROUP\n\nBONITÄTSBEWERTUNGEN BECHTLE KONZERN\n\n<span id=\"page-144-0\"></span> ausgezeichnete Bonität 1,0 / 100 sehr gute Bonität 1,5 / 150 gute Bonität 2,0 / 200 mittlere Bonität angespannte Bonität sehr schwache Bonität mangelhafte Bonität Ausfall 6,0 / 600\n\nTo date, the creditworthiness of the Bechtle Group has not been assessed by the rating agencies S&P Global Ratings, Moody's Investors Service, Fitch Ratings and DBRS Morningstar.\n\nThe Bechtle Group is aware of its own risk and opportunity profile for its business activities.

All in all, the Bechtle Group is not aware of any risks that – either alone or in combination with other risks – could endanger the going concern. The Executive Board is convinced that it will be able to make use of future challenges and opportunities without taking undue risks.\n\nImage /page/145/Picture/4 description: Three people are in a modern office space.

The ongoing internationalisation and the associated acquisitions provide plenty of leeway for further growth. In this process, our employees represent an important integrating force.**\n\nDoreen Gerstenlauer, Team Leader Accounting – Business Services, Bechtle International Sales Division\n\n> Edgardo Cáceres, Installation Technician, Bechtle Installation Centre\n\nVanessa-Laura Niemczyk, Human Resources Business Partner, Bechtle AG\n\nfrom left to right\n\n{146}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-146-0\"></span>**FORECAST REPORT**\n\nThe economic and geopolitical environment remained challenging at the beginning of 2024. At the beginning of the year, some of the economic growth forecasts for 2024 have been reduced considerably, and the uncertainties with regard to the coming months remain very high. Nevertheless, the IT market is expected to recover in the course of the year, again escaping certain developments that affect the economy in general. We at Bechtle are convinced that the outlook for the further development of the Bechtle Group continues to be bright in the 2024 fiscal year. We expect that the demand might pick up gradually, especially in the second half of the year.\n\n### **FRAMEWORK CONDITIONS**\n\n**Slight economic upturn anticipated.** According to its forecast of February 2024, the European Commission expects a slight increase in economic growth in the EU. In 2024, the gross domestic product (GDP) is to grow 0.9 per cent, after only moderate growth of 0.5 per cent in the reporting period. Further into the year, growth rates are expected to increase in small steps from quarter to quarter. At 0.2 per cent, the first quarter is already projected to see higher growth than the quarters of the reporting period. Further slightly higher economic growth of 0.3 per cent is predicted for the second quarter. The growth rate is expected to amount to 0.4 per cent both in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. The generally positive growth expectation for the entire EU is also reflected in some of Bechtle's markets. Germany with an expected growth rate of 0.3 per cent, the Netherlands with 0.4 per cent and Austria with 0.6 per cent are at the bottom of the scale. The highest growth rates are projected in Poland with 2.7 per cent and in Hungary with 2.4 per cent. Higher dynamics are expected for 2025, with economic growth of 1.7 per cent in the EU.\n\nIn contrast to the reporting period, the economic performance in Germany is expected to return to slightly positive figures in 2024. The European Commission predicts GDP growth of 0.3 per cent for the current year, after –0.3 per cent in the reporting period. However, this estimate is below the figure published in autumn. In 2024, investments in equipment are expected to grow by 2.7 per cent, a lower rate than in the reporting period (3.8 per cent). Following the decline of 2.5 per cent recorded in 2023, government investments are predicted to grow by 1.0 per cent. For 2025, the European Commission \n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\n**FRAMEWORK CONDITIONS**\n\nexpects GDP growth of 1.2 per cent, which means an increase over 2024. Investments in equipment are to increase by 2.7 per cent in 2025, a rate higher than that of the GDP growth.\n\n**Stronger growth predicted for global IT market.** The market research institute Gartner predicts 6.8 per cent growth in global IT expenditure in 2024. Even higher growth of 9.3 per cent is expected in Europe. Software sales are even predicted to grow by 14.5 per cent, due especially to the ongoing increase in the demand for cloud services. In 2024, the demand for IT services, too, is to undergo a disproportionately high increase of 11.8 per cent, says Gartner.\n\nitkom or\n\n[See Risks,](#page-132-0) [page 133 ff](#page-132-0)\n\nBitkom predicts stronger growth in the German IT market in 2024 again. The expected growth rate is [bitkom.org](https://www.bitkom.org/) 6.1 per cent, a rate much higher than that of the reporting period (2.2 per cent). Hardware sales are projected to recover and undergo growth of 4.6 per cent (reporting period: –5.4 per cent). Growth in the field of services is to amount to 4.8 per cent, slightly less than in the reporting period (5.1 per cent). Thus the software segment is again expected to record the highest increase of 9.4 per cent. Though this figure is marginally smaller than that of the reporting period (9.6 per cent), the segment is expected to be the growth driver in the German IT market.\n\nIn France – a national market that is important for Bechtle – IT revenue is to increase significantly in 2024. The industry association numeum again projects a significant increase of 5.8 per cent.\n\n**Macroeconomic challenges.** With respect to the predicted future economic situation in the relevant national markets, the Bechtle Group does not expect any major impact on demand due to changes in legal framework conditions or the implementation of policy measures. However, the macroeconomic situation in Europe is marked by great tension. The war in Ukraine, but also the conflict in the Middle East and associated potential macroeconomic effects burden the macroeconomic development. All these factors can indirectly influence the business performance of the Bechtle Group. However, it is impossible to reliably ascertain and assess the probability of occurrence, the extent and the duration of these events. The exchange rate development does not play a major role in most countries in which Bechtle is present, as these belong to the euro area and therefore, purchases and billing mostly take place in euros.\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-148-0\"></span>**GROUP PERFORMANCE**\n\n#### PRODUCTS AND MARKETS\n\n**Digitalisation drives demand for sustainable IT solutions.** Digitalisation remains the predominant trend in IT. This development has further intensified due to the experience gained during the COVID-19 pandemic, which made it necessary for many to work from their homes. A high degree of digitalisation is required for high availabilities, access by the employees who work remotely or flexibility in the use of IT. The subject area of security will also increase in significance. An EU directive (NIS 2) that entered into force in the reporting period requires numerous companies in the EU to ensure certain IT security standards. In 2024, this directive is to be adopted in national law. This might result in even higher awareness of IT security aspects and a higher demand in this area. With a team of more than 400 employees, Bechtle is already very strong in the business field of security. In the reporting period, some of our customers also started looking into the trending topic of artificial intelligence (AI). AI-related requirements will make the operation of IT infrastructures even more complex, pushing the demand for competent partners. In this area, we see clear impulses for our business in the medium term. In the reporting period, we noticed a reluctance to invest in conventional PC projects, especially among our medium-sized customers. This was due to the macroeconomic situation and the substantial uncertainties caused by this situation. The macroeconomic situation was largely unchanged in early 2024. Therefore, we believe that at least the first half of 2024 will continue to be marked by the said reluctance. Nevertheless, it is obvious that there is no going back as far as the need for digitalisation is concerned. Thus, Bechtle expects the high demand for sustainable IT solutions to continue in the coming years.\n\nIn the coming years, Bechtle will expand the range of special IT solutions in the IT System House & Managed Services segment. In this context, we regard subjects such as cloud solutions, as-a-service models, security, network solutions, mobility, storage, modern workplace and AI as market drivers. Bechtle boasts an excellent position in all these areas and is always able to offer customers state-ofthe-art solutions. In general, we plan to continually expand the share of higher-margin services and the share of recurring revenue.\n\nBechtle is confident that the demand for individual solutions as well as for standardised processes will grow. With our multi-cloud portal Bechtle Clouds and our website bechtle.com, we offer all our customers, whatever their size, the opportunity to procure IT solutions quickly and easily. We intend to continue to expand in this area. Our efforts also included the expansion of our Service Factory with \n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\nits managed service offerings for the standardised performance of services, which will help us to leverage additional synergies and economies of scale within our company. Our platform strategy is supplemented by the operation of our three Bechtle data centres.\n\n**Digitalisation also an internal lever.** The continued digitalisation at Bechtle itself is a key element of the said platform strategy. Since 2017, Bechtle has been systematically developing bechtle.com into a digital marketplace. On this website, our customers can see the entire bandwidth of Bechtle's service and solution portfolio at a glance. Regardless of a customer's original concern and the segment in which the respective customer's contact is based, Bechtle is able to address their needs comprehensively and offer them further solutions. At the same time, this approach helps us to boost the customer satisfaction and penetration. Additionally, it is possible to address smaller customers that Bechtle has not focused on so far without any personal sales activities. Moreover, cooperation between the segments and across national borders is being further promoted under the \"One Bechtle\" motto. This would be hardly possible without virtual collaboration platforms. By increasing the degree of digitalisation, we will also be able to make our own processes more productive and efficient. Apart from having a positive effect on the profitability, this will help us to achieve significant growth in the future without increasing the headcount to the same extent. In view of the demographic factor, this is an invaluable advantage. For the future successful positioning of Bechtle, we therefore believe that digitising many of our (internal) processes is vital.\n\n**Bechtle takes profit from consolidation.** The consolidation of the German and European IT markets, which has been ongoing for several years, will continue in the years to come. Smaller providers, in particular, will find it increasingly difficult to offer their customers services in the needed breadth and depth and ensure competitive availabilities for the products offered. After the coronavirus years, which were full of economic hardships for many providers, and the subsequent shortage of many products due to the issues in the supply chain, it is generally assumed that the consolidation pace has picked up slightly. However, the high degree of fragmentation of the European IT market and especially of the German-speaking IT market has not changed fundamentally. This structure is likely to remain unchanged even if, in the coming years, the consolidation were to intensify as expected. The Bechtle Group can benefit from this development thanks to its financial strength, its leading competitive position, its decentralised positioning as well as its outstanding reputation in the M&A market and among all relevant customer groups. Therefore, we are confident that we will be able to continue to expand our market share at a disproportionately high rate.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-150-0\"></span>The Bechtle Group will carry on with its efforts to reinforce its market position by expanding existing companies and business fields and through acquisitions. We have already expanded our M&A strategy accordingly in 2021. Previously, we had focused on acquisitions in the service segment in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as our system houses were located only in these countries. Our expanded acquisition strategy now also provides for acquisitions outside German-speaking countries. Thus, we are going to expand our presence and extend our range of system-integration services to countries in which we had previously only engaged in trading. With the acquisitions realised in the reporting period, we are now also represented with our service portfolio in seven European countries. In this way, we not only increase the growth potential in the respective countries by expanding our portfolio, we also step up our existing activities in the individual markets and increase the customer bonding. The expanded M&A strategy continues to concentrate on the national markets in Benelux, France, Spain and the United Kingdom, as well as on Italy and Poland starting from this year. Of course, we will also continue to consider acquisitions in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\n\n#### HUMAN RESOURCES\n\n**Focus on training.** Staff development, training as well as further education will continue to play an extremely important role in our company. With an established range of training measures and consistent continuation of the internal management programmes, Bechtle intends to continue to invest in the development of junior and executive staff. As in the reporting period, the Executive Board plans to continue to raise the headcount in 2024, regardless of whether or not acquisitions are going to take place, though at a lower rate than the business volume growth. As already mentioned, the advancing internal digitalisation enables us to keep the headcount increase below the growth of the business volume.\n\nBechtle's HR policy has always focused on training young people. To safeguard its future, Bechtle's goal is to increase the training ratio in Germany to approximately 10 per cent by 2030.\n\nAnother central goal of our HR strategy is to further upgrade Bechtle as an employer brand. Bechtle has not lost its ability to attract attention and stimulate enthusiasm. The further development of the employer branding is not an entirely cost-neutral process. However, the investments made in this area are future-oriented and effectively secure Bechtle's success in the coming years.\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-151-0\"></span>SUSTAINABILITY GOALS AND ACTIONS\n\n**Sustainability programme defines actions and goals.** The sustainability programme comprises specific actions and goals for all key topics from the four strategic action fields of the Sustainability Strategy 2030. It documents measures that serve the achievement of our goals. In this way, we are able to observe and measure our progress in a structured, transparent manner and make any needed adjustments. Below, you can find an overview of the sustainability programme, starting from the 2023 fiscal year. Measures already implemented in the fiscal year are reported on in the respective chapters.\n\n#### SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAMME – ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES\n\n| Key topic                             |

PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n**Business volume.** For many years, Bechtle has grown faster than the market. Since 2013, we have increased our business volume greatly at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 13 per cent, thereby outperforming the IT market. Over the years, the strong growth has been driven mainly organically. As a result of the intensive M&A activities in the reporting period (seven acquisitions in total), the share of the acquired companies in the growth of the business volume amounted to 2.7 percentage points. We believe that in the future, the group's growth rates will continue to be largely organic. In the reporting period, we achieved good overall growth of 7.0 per cent. The macroeconomic framework conditions for 2024 are not much better than for the reporting period, but not worse either. Because of that, we again project significant growth of five to ten per cent for 2024 (including acquisitions), although we suspect that it might be at the lower end of the range of the guidance.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Revenue.** In principal, the development of revenue follows the same framework parameters as the development of business volume. As a result of solid growth in our software business in recent years, it typically remained somewhat below the growth rates of the business volume. In the reporting period, however, the values of these two indicators had converged again. At 6.5 per cent, the revenue growth was only slightly below the growth rate of the business volume. This was also due to the high reference figures of the software business from the prior year. In view of the continued dynamic development of our software business, we expect the revenue growth in 2024 to remain further below the business volume growth. Nevertheless, we again expect significant revenue growth in 2024.\n\nMinor differences can often be observed between the segments and regions. Overall, the revenue split is expected to remain more or less the same in the 2024 fiscal year, with Germany accounting for about 60 per cent of the revenue and the companies abroad for about 40 per cent. In the medium term, however, the pursuit of the M&A strategy and the further internationalisation of our business might result in an increased revenue share of the international companies. We do not expect any major shifts between the segments.\n\n**Costs.** In recent years, the cost of sales increased largely in line with revenue. In years marked by significant growth rates – which are usually associated with a higher proportion of hardware – we often see a disproportionately high increase in material costs, resulting in pressure on gross margins. We can mitigate this in years with high single-digit growth rates and an often higher share of service revenue and solution business. We again witnessed such a development in the reporting period. Due to the high demand for services and the curbed demand for hardware, especially for PCs, material costs did not grow as much as the revenue. As a result of inflation and other reasons, personnel expenses – which are included in the cost of sales – underwent a stronger increase. All in all, the cost of sales thus developed at almost the same rate as the revenue. Bechtle thus succeeded in keeping the gross margin stable at 17.5 per cent. An increased demand for higher-volume client projects in the course of 2024 should result in a disproportionately high growth in material costs, causing pressure on the gross margin. Our bottom-line goal is to keep the gross margin over 17 per cent. Therefore, we intend to keep the increase in cost of sales in 2024 largely in line with revenue growth.\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\nBeing a service provider, personnel expenses play a prominent role at the Bechtle Group. These expenses represent the bulk of the costs, accounting for approximately 80 per cent of the distribution costs and more than 60 per cent of the administrative expenses. Due to Bechtle's increasingly consulting-intensive business model, the decentralised broad positioning of the system houses and the shortage of qualified staff in some areas, flexible adjustment of personnel expenses is not feasible. Moreover, especially in view of the shortage of experts, Bechtle considers employee bonding and a reputation as a reliable employer to be far more important than short-term cost-optimisation measures. Often, the expenses are also directly linked to the revenue performance, since the growth should also be reflected in the headcount. However, this connection is no longer as strong as in prior years. Due to the advancing digitalisation and automation of internal processes, on the one hand, and the fact that we make work processes more efficient and productive, on the other hand, we are getting better at handling the high revenue growth with a disproportionately lower increase in the number of employees. In the 2024 fiscal year, we expect personnel expenses to experience an organic increase that will remain below the inflation-driven high level of the reporting period. However, we also need to accommodate employee interests, thereby keeping their satisfaction high and the employee turnover rate low. All in all, the Executive Board expects the absolute expenses for the two functional areas sales and administration to further increase in 2024. However, as we endeavour to prevent above-average growth of personnel expenses, the ratios of these two items will remain at least at the levels of the reporting period, i.e. at below 7 per cent and below 6 per cent of the revenue, respectively.\n\n**Earnings.** The earnings performance in recent years was also very good. Since the 2013 fiscal year, the CAGR for the EBT has been above 15 per cent. On a long-term average, EBT has thus performed better than the revenue. This was also the case in the reporting period, driven by factors such as the highly positive performance of the other operating income. The cost base will continue to go up in 2024, though we expect its growth to remain at the level of the revenue growth. But most probably, we will not be able to perpetuate the high level of other operating income. However, we believe that we will be able to compensate this effect with productivity and efficiency gains. Therefore, our overall goal for 2024 is to keep earnings growth largely in line with revenue growth. The EBT margin is expected to reach approximately the same level as in the prior year (5.8 per cent).\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the medium to long term, we want to further increase the share of higher-margin services and recurring revenue in the IT System House & Managed Services segment. This growth is to be accompanied by a sustainable increase in the EBT margin. In E-Commerce, the main objective is to maintain the high margin level, which has been achieved especially through efficient processes and modern logistics.\n\nBechtle AG plans to continue to share its entrepreneurial success with its shareholders in the form of an attractive dividend. The dividend policy is mainly aligned with the group's earnings and liquidity position and provides for a dividend payout ratio of about one third of the earnings after taxes. The current dividend proposal for the 2023 fiscal year of €0.70 per share represents a ratio of 33.2 per cent. This is in line with our long-standing dividend strategy and also higher than in the prior year (32.6 per cent). There are no plans for any fundamental changes to the company's dividend policy.\n\nImage /page/156/Picture/3 description: Three people are standing behind a wooden counter in a well-lit room.

As previously, Bechtle boasted an excellent liquidity situation and a very sound equity ratio. Thanks to the first-time issue of convertible bonds, the liquidity situation has even improved, at least in the short term. Financial strength is a vital precondition that enables Bechtle to continuously grow under its own steam and respond flexibly to the requirements of the markets. The high liquidity represents a competitive advantage. The financial position and stability of the IT partner is a key decision-making criterion from the customer perspective, especially in connection with the award of long-term projects. Therefore, Bechtle will continue to attach special importance to cash management. In view of the good balance sheet ratios, Bechtle AG has substantial \"rating-neutral\" borrowing potential, in addition to free liquidity of €465.8 million. Combined with the continued positive development of the operating cash flow, Bechtle thus has the leeway needed for attaining its goals and financing the targeted above-average growth – even under its own steam. Also in view of the internal cash flow optimisation measures successfully implemented in the reporting period, we are confident that we will be able to continue to generate positive cash flows in 2024 and beyond.\n\n**Financing.** Traditionally, Bechtle's financial liabilities have always remained at manageable levels. Though the issue of convertible bonds has doubled financial liabilities, a considerable increase was seen in cash and cash equivalents and, due to acquisitions, in goodwill. At the bottom line, therefore, the balance sheet structure of Bechtle remains largely unchanged. This is also evident from the net debt position. In the reporting period, this position amounted to €74.8 million, even less than in the prior year (€83.7 million), a small amount compared to the balance sheet total. The basic positions will not undergo any material changes in 2024, unless major acquisitions take place. In 2024, smaller acquisitions could be financed from the existing liquidity and the current cash flow, as previously. Owing to its good creditworthiness, Bechtle could also raise debt capital whenever necessary. The takeover of larger companies could result in a more drastic cash outflow, though in such a case, financing with further debt capital or other external financing options would be more likely, at least to a certain extent. The company could also resort to the equity financing options according to the adopted Annual General Meeting resolutions. Until June 2026, the Executive Board is authorised to increase the share capital by issuing up to 18.9 million shares against cash or in-kind contributions. Bechtle already used the option to issue convertible bonds (conditional capital) in 2023.\n\nProvided that no major takeovers occur in 2024, the balance sheet structure will most likely not undergo any significant changes compared to the reporting date of 31 December 2023.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Investments.** The business of Bechtle AG, which comprises IT product trading and IT services, does not involve any major investments. The investment ratio in 2023 was about 27 per cent, a figure higher than the long-term average. The total amount of investments in 2023 was €95.2 million, more than we had planned. However, conventional investments merely amounted to approximately €75 million, i.e. the bottom end of our forecast (€75 million to €85 million). Capitalised leasing items that we had to include in our balance sheet for sales financing in accordance with IFRS accounted for about €20 million. This year, Bechtle will continue to invest in the company's future. Though we do not plan any major individual investments, we will continue to invest in the buildings at our locations and in our digitalisation, our own IT systems and our Clouds Platform as well as the adaptation of a new ERP system. We expect conventional investments in 2024 to total €80 million to €90 million.\n\nAcquisitions will remain an integral element of our growth strategy in all business fields.\n\nImage /page/158/Picture/3 description: Two smiling people, a woman and a man, are posing in an office setting.

[ifo.de/en](https://www.ifo.de/en) The initially more optimistic forecasts for the current year have already been withdrawn. While gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to edge up slightly after the decline in the reporting period, substantial uncertainties remain in terms of the economic outlook for Germany and Europe. Still, the forecasts anticipate an improvement of the macroeconomic situation further into the year. However, the sentiment in Germany was still very gloomy at the beginning of the year. In January 2024, the ifo Business Climate Index dropped to 85.2 points, from 86.3 points in the preceding month. This is the lowest value since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020.\n\nImage /page/159/Figure/6 description: This image shows a line graph comparing business climate, business situation, and business expectations from 2019 to 2024. The y-axis ranges from 70 to 110. In 2019, business climate starts around 98, business situation starts around 102, and business expectations starts around 94. All three lines drop sharply in 2020, with business expectations reaching the lowest point. From 2021 to 2022, all three lines increase, with business climate and business situation peaking around 102. After 2022, all three lines decrease again, with business expectations showing the most significant drop. By 2024, business climate is around 86, business situation is around 84, and business expectations is around 82.\n\n#### IFO BUSINESS CLIMATE GERMANY\n\nThe mood in the IT industry was slightly better at the beginning of the year. In January 2024, the ifo index for IT service providers climbed to 17.9 points, after 16.3 points in the preceding month. Here, the expectations for the next six months improved considerably and thus propelled the rise.\n\nDespite the uncertainties, the Executive Board is confident that the company will deliver positive business performance above the industry average. Bechtle has already furnished evidence of its ability to achieve profitable growth with its competitive business model even in times of economic hardship.\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### OVERVIEW OF FORECASTS ON THE EARNINGS POSITION FOR 2024\n\n**OVERALL ASSESSMENT**\n\n|                              | Group                                                                  | IT System House<br>& Managed Services               | IT E-Commerce                                       |\n|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Business volume              | Significant increase<br>over 2023                                      |                                                     |                                                     |\n| Revenue                      | Significant increase<br>over 2023                                      | Significant increase                                | Significant increase                                |\n| Cost of sales                | Increase more or less<br>parallels revenue increase                    |                                                     |                                                     |\n| Gross margin                 | >17%                                                                   |                                                     |                                                     |\n| Distribution cost ratio      | <7%                                                                    |                                                     |                                                     |\n| Administrative expense ratio | <6%                                                                    |                                                     |                                                     |\n| EBT                          | Increase more or less<br>parallels revenue increase                    | Increase more or less<br>parallels revenue increase | Increase more or less<br>parallels revenue increase |\n| EBT margin                   | More or less at<br>prior-year level                                    | More or less at<br>prior-year level                 | More or less at<br>prior-year level                 |\n| Dividend                     | Dividend payout ratio of<br>about one third of<br>earnings after taxes |                                                     |                                                     |\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-161-0\"></span>**INFORMATION ON BECHTLE AG (ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCORDING TO THE GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE [HGB])**\n\nWithin the conventional holding structure of the Bechtle Group, Bechtle AG as an individual company is responsible, as the parent company, for all overarching tasks for the whole group. In addition to the operating business, the result of Bechtle AG is shaped, to a significant extent, by the investment earnings which are influenced by the performance of the Bechtle Group companies. The economic framework conditions of Bechtle AG are essentially identical with those of the Bechtle Group. The explanations below refer to the annual financial statements in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB) of Bechtle AG for the 2023 financial year.\n\nSee [Forecast report,](#page-146-0) [page 147 ff](#page-146-0) and see [Opportunity and risk report,](#page-117-0) [page 118 ff](#page-117-0)\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-162-0\"></span>**EARNINGS, ASSETS AND FINANCIAL POSITION**\n\n### **EARNINGS POSITION**\n\nAll percentages are calculated on the basis of figures in € thousand. This can result in rounding differences.\n\nOwing to its function as a financial holding, the earnings position of Bechtle AG largely depends on the financial performance of its operating subsidiaries. Apart from a few exceptions, the earnings of all major domestic subsidiaries are synchronised taken over by Bechtle AG as the top parent company on the basis of existing profit transfer agreements or regulations in their charters.\n\nThe investment earnings (incl. income from profit transfer agreements and expenses from the assumption of losses) increased by €27.6 million to €222.8 million in comparison to the prior year.\n\nAll in all, revenue climbed from €284.4 million to €447.2 million. The increase was due to higher income from merchandise and third-party services.\n\n|         |       |       |       |       | €m    |\n|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|         | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  | 2019  |\n| Revenue | 447.2 | 284.4 | 245.4 | 259.2 | 209.6 |\n\nIn 2023, other operating income dropped by 2.95 per cent to €7.1 million, after €7.3 million in the prior year. This item mainly comprises income from the reversal of provisions in the amount of €3.4 million (prior year: €1.7 million), income from brand licences in the amount of €1.8 million (prior year: €0 million) and extraordinary income in the amount of €0.6 million (prior year: €0.7 million).\n\n|                        |      | €m   |      |      |      |\n|------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                        | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Other operating income | 7.1  | 7.3  | 5.1  | 10.4 | 3.5  |\n\nThe cost of materials increased by €138.3 million in comparison to the prior year to €334.1 million (prior year: €195.8 million), which is largely the result of the increase in costs of goods purchased for resale, in particular merchandise, in the amount of €225.6 million (prior year: €114.7 million).\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\nDue especially to new recruitment, personnel expenses increased by 10.1 per cent from €50.4 million to €55.5 million.\n\n|                    |      |      |      | €m   |      |\n|--------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                    | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Personnel expenses | 55.5 | 50.4 | 43.8 | 42.8 | 36.6 |\n\nOther operating expenses included mainly software licences amounting to €15.6 million (prior year: €11.6 million), legal and consulting costs amounting to €11.1 million (prior year: €15.6 million), extraordinary expenses amounting to €10.8 million (prior year: €19.6 million), maintenance fees amounting to €5.4 million (prior year: €5.9 million) and building expenses amounting to €5.2 million (prior year: €5.3 million).\n\n|                          | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | €m | 2019 |\n|--------------------------|------|------|------|------|----|------|\n| Other operating expenses | 67.4 | 65.5 | 58.1 | 36.6 |    | 35.6 |\n\nThe investment earnings presented below comprises the income from profit transfer agreements and investments as well as expenses from the assumption of losses. In total, investment earnings increased by 14.1 per cent from €195.2 million to €222.8 million. Interest expenses and income vis-àvis affiliated companies increased in comparison to the prior year and resulted essentially from interest increases from cash pooling with the affiliated companies. The increase in interest expenses visà-vis third parties is a result of the commitment interest and interest expenses which arose in connection with the convertible bond.\n\n|                     | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  | 2019  | €m |\n|---------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|----|\n| Investment earnings | 222.8 | 195.2 | 178.7 | 180.0 | 145.6 |    |\n\nIncome tax expenses went up from €30.7 million to €34.8 million.\n\n|               | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  | 2019 | €m |\n|---------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------|----|\n| Annual profit | 171.2 | 131.0 | 110.8 | 132.3 | 98.2 |    |\n\nThe annual profit went up by €40.2 million to €171.2 million. After allocation to provisions pursuant to Section 58 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in the amount of €83 million, the net profit was €88.2 million. An amount of €88.2 million is to be paid out. The planned dividend per share amounts to €0.70 (prior year: €0.65). As a matter of principle, Bechtle AG pursues a shareholder-friendly dividend policy which is geared towards continuity. A dividend payout ratio of about one third of group earnings as well as continual dividend increases are manifestations of a reliable dividend policy.\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-164-0\"></span>**ASSETS POSITION**\n\nThe structure of the assets reflects the field of activity of Bechtle AG as a financial holding: Financial assets accounted for 41.6 per cent or €802.7 million and receivables from affiliated companies – which are largely related to the financing of the subsidiaries – accounted for 38.4 per cent or €739.8 million of the balance sheet total.\n\nYear on year, the balance sheet total underwent an increase of €293.1 million or 17.8 per cent. On the assets side, the increase is largely the result of the increase in financial investment assets due to capital increases at subsidiaries and the acquisition of PLANET AI GmbH. The increase in current assets is largely attributable to an increase in bank balances, due primarily to the issue of the convertible bond. On the equity and liabilities side, the increase is due largely to the increase in equity. The increase in liabilities, analogous to the increase in bank balances, results from the placement of the convertible bond. This was offset, to some extent, by the repayment of existing loans.\n\nAs of the balance sheet date, Bechtle AG held cash and cash equivalents worth €235.0 million (prior year: €99.0 million). Together with unused credit lines amounting to €523.4 million (prior year: €453.2 million), the company thus has sufficient liquidity for future expansions and acquisitions.\n\n|                                                        | 2023      | 2022      | 2021      | 2020      | 2019      | € |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---|\n| Assets                                                 |           |           |           |           |           |   |\n| Fixed assets                                           | 836,268   | 664,828   | 590,086   | 578,440   | 517,090   |   |\n| Inventories                                            | 34,295    | 9,511     | 19,036    | 8,652     | 4,797     |   |\n| Receivables                                            | 798,084   | 849,552   | 522,662   | 451,279   | 463,617   |   |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                              | 234,978   | 98,956    | 205,889   | 242,644   | 156,441   |   |\n| Other assets                                           | 23,715    | 12,659    | 6,719     | 14,974    | 7,718     |   |\n| Equity and liabilities                                 |           |           |           |           |           |   |\n| Equity                                                 | 826,504   | 737,243   | 675,569   | 621,537   | 539,655   |   |\n| Non-current liabilities<br>and deferred income         | 531,175   | 234,086   | 316,928   | 441,376   | 318,750   |   |\n| Current liabilities, provisions and<br>deferred income | 569,661   | 664,177   | 351,580   | 233,076   | 295,628   |   |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                               | 0         | 0         | 315       | 0         | 0         |   |\n| Balance sheet total                                    | 1,927,340 | 1,635,506 | 1,344,392 | 1,295,989 | 1,154,033 |   |\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-165-0\"></span>**FINANCIAL POSITION**\n\n#### FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe objective of Bechtle's financial policy is to keep the group's financial power at a high level, thereby retaining the company's financial independence by ensuring adequate liquidity. At the same time, risks are to be avoided as far as possible or hedged effectively. For example, the Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board prohibit all kinds of speculative forward transactions. This applies especially to currencies, goods and securities, as well as the respective forward transactions, unless they serve the hedging of the business operations.\n\nAs a matter of principle, Bechtle uses derivative financial instruments exclusively for hedging its operating activities. With regard to the investment of excess liquidity, quick availability is more important than maximum yield. Investment business was only conducted with investment-grade debtors. Moreover, investments in the banking sector are only made in the form of protected deposits.\n\n#### CASH FLOW STATEMENT\n\nCash and cash equivalents amounted to €99.0 million at the start of the period and to €235.0 million at the end of the period, with a resulting change in cash and cash equivalents of €136 million.\n\nThe net cash outflow from operating activities was €9.5 million (prior year: €195.0 million). The cash flow from operating activities increased significantly in comparison to the prior year, due to an improved working capital management.\n\nIn the reporting period, there were investments in intangible assets in the amount of €10.7 million (prior year: €12.7 million) and in property, plant and equipment in the amount of €4.3 million (prior year: €6.3 million). The main investments concern the capital increases of subsidiaries and the acquisition of PLANET AI GmbH. The cash inflow from investment activities was €40.1 million (prior year: €107.3 million) and also resulted from increased investment earnings.\n\nThe dividend payment of €81.9 million, the cash inflow from borrowing in the amount of €1,190 million, the cash outflow from the repayment of financial loans in the amount of €1,291.7 million and interest payments of €11.0 million, as well as a cash inflow from the issue of a convertible bond (issue proceeds: €300 million), together led to cash inflows from financing activities in the amount €105.4 million (prior year: cash outflows of €19.3 million).\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-166-0\"></span>**OPPORTUNITY AND RISK REPORT**\n\nBecause of its function as the holding company for the group, the performance of Bechtle AG, in principle, is subject to the same opportunities and risks as that of the Bechtle Group. Bechtle AG participates in the opportunities and risks of the indirect and direct subsidiaries. In this respect, the opportunities and risks and the risk management as described in the opportunity and risk report of the group also apply to Bechtle AG.\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-167-0\"></span>**FORECAST REPORT**\n\nThe future performance of Bechtle AG is closely linked to the operating performance of the group. Due to its ties with the group companies and their importance for the group, the expectations here are largely reflected in the forecast report of the group. In light of the planned earnings position of the group companies, we expect a small increase in investment earnings and thus also in the annual profit of Bechtle AG.\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/169/Picture/0 description: The image is an abstract design featuring a green background with curved lines in the lower left and upper right corners.

Any deviations are explicitly indicated.\n\n#### NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\n**New/amended standards and interpretations applied for the first time.** In the reporting period, Bechtle applied the following new and revised standards and interpretations of the following [efrag.org](https://efrag.org) new accounting pronouncements, which had been published by the IFRS IC and adopted by the EU.\n\n| Pronouncement                                                                                                          | Publication by<br>IASB/IFRS IC         |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Amendments to IAS 12 International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules                                                 | 23 May 2023                            |\n| Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising<br>from a Single Transaction               | 7 May 2021                             |\n| Amendments to IAS 1 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current,<br>Non-current Liabilities with Covenants | 23 January 2020<br>and 31 October 2022 |\n| Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS practice statement 2 Disclosure of Accounting Policies                                    | 12 February 2021                       |\n| Amendments to IAS 8 Definitions of Accounting Estimates                                                                | 12 February 2021                       |\n\nBechtle is subject to the regulations on Global Minimum Tax (GloBE/Pillar II), which is generally applicable from 2024 and has already been adopted in the national law of some jurisdictions in which Bechtle is represented. According to the law, if no local minimum tax is charged, the parent company in Germany is required to pay an additional tax on the profits of its subsidiaries that are taxed at an effective tax rate of less than 15 per cent. The jurisdictions relevant to Bechtle, in which this tax can be charged, include Switzerland, Ireland and Hungary. Based on analyses conducted, we do not expect Bechtle to suffer major increases of the current taxes in connection with Pillar II.\n\n{179}------------------------------------------------\n\n**New/amended standards and interpretations not yet applied.** IASB and IFRS IC have adopted further standards and interpretations, which are not yet mandatory (\"effective date\") or have not yet been endorsed by the EU. Where the endorsement has yet to take place, the date for the mandatory adoption is derived from the respective pronouncements of IASB/IFRS IC. If endorsed later on, the EU directive may specify a different date for mandatory application.\n\n| Pronouncement                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Publication by IASB/IFRS IC | Endorsement      | Effective date1 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Published pronouncements not yet adopted                                                                                                                                                                                               |                             |                  |                 |\n| Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Investment<br>Entities (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and<br>IAS 27), Sale or Contribution of Assets between<br>an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture<br>(Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28) | 11 September 2014           | open             | open            |\n| Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Lease Liability<br>in a Sale and Leaseback                                                                                                                                                               | 22 September 2022           | 20 November 2023 | 1 January 2024  |\n| Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 Supplier Finance<br>Arrangements                                                                                                                                                                        | 25 May 2023                 | open             | 1 January 2024  |\n| Amendments to IAS 21 Lack of Exchangeability                                                                                                                                                                                           | 15 August 2023              | open             | 1 January 2025  |\n\n1 Must be adopted at the latest at the beginning of the first fiscal year commencing on or after the said date.\n\nCurrently, we do not expect these standards to have any significant impact on the financial statements of the Bechtle Group.\n\n#### CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are based on the financial statements of Bechtle AG and its direct and indirect subsidiaries prepared using uniform group accounting policies. Subsidiaries are companies directly or indirectly controlled by Bechtle AG. Capital consolidation is carried out by offsetting the carrying amount of the shareholding against the pro-rata re-measured equity of the subsidiaries at the time of acquisition. Any positive differences are recognised as goodwill pursuant to IFRS 3.32. Any negative differences are to be recognised in the income statement through profit or loss pursuant to IFRS 3.34 ff. The consolidated income statement takes into account the earnings of the acquired companies from the acquisition date, i.e. from the date the group attains control. Inclusion in the Consolidated Financial Statements ends as soon as the parent company relinquishes control.\n\nIf the investment company is not controlled and the investment company is an associate, it is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method.\n\nBechtle AG Annual Report 2023\n\n{180}------------------------------------------------\n\nAll intra-group gains and losses, revenue, expenses, income, receivables and liabilities are eliminated. The required tax deferrals are applied to the consolidation processes.\n\n#### SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe scope of consolidation comprises Bechtle AG in Neckarsulm and all subsidiaries in which it holds a controlling interest. Bechtle AG directly or indirectly holds all interests and voting rights in all consolidated companies (except for Planet AI GmbH).\n\n[See Appendix A,](#page-261-0)  [Subsidiaries and](#page-261-0)  [joint ventures](#page-261-0) [page 262 ff](#page-261-0)\n\nThe following companies were included in the scope of consolidation for the first time in this reporting period:\n\n| Company                                             | Headquarters             | Time of initial acquisition/<br>consolidation | Acquisition/<br>founding |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Tangible Benefit Ltd.                               | London, United Kingdom   | 15 March 2023                                 | Acquisition              |\n| Fondo ICT Professionals B.V.                        | Utrecht, Netherlands     | 5 April 2023                                  | Acquisition              |\n| SGSolution AG                                       | Wallisellen, Switzerland | 4 May 2023                                    | Acquisition              |\n| Bechtle Managed Services ApS                        | Copenhagen, Denmark      | 10 May 2023                                   | Founding                 |\n| Bechtle Management s.r.o.                           | Prague, Czech Republic   | 19 June 2023                                  | Founding                 |\n| Prosol Ingenieria S.L.                              | Madrid, Spain            | 2 August 2023                                 | Acquisition              |\n| Prosol Iscat S.L.                                   | Terrassa, Spain          | 2 August 2023                                 | Acquisition              |\n| sastema GmbH                                        | Hünfelden, Germany       | 3 August 2023                                 | Acquisition              |\n| Executive IT SAS<br>and the following subsidiaries: | Les Ulis, France         | 5 October 2023                                | Acquisition              |\n| Apixit SAS                                          | Les Ulis, France         | 5 October 2023                                | Acquisition              |\n| NMS Distribution SAS                                | Les Ulis, France         | 5 October 2023                                | Acquisition              |\n| Orsenna SAS                                         | Les Ulis, France         | 5 October 2023                                | Acquisition              |\n| Ortello SAS                                         | Les Ulis, France         | 5 October 2023                                | Acquisition              |\n| SCI Cartier                                         | Les Ulis, France         | 5 October 2023                                | Acquisition              |\n| STCI SAS                                            | Les Ulis, France         | 5 October 2023                                | Acquisition              |\n\nBalancing of business combinations takes place according to the purchase method.\n\nOn 2 October, 51 per cent of the interests in Planet AI GmbH, Raben Steinfeld, were purchased. The company is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a joint venture using the equity method, since the parties involved hold the rights in the net assets and decisions on important activities require the parties' unanimous approval. The joint venture is based on the agreement between the partners (Bechtle AG and the company's continued management and founding team) to combine application-oriented AI research with the sales competencies of the largest German IT system house. Another objective of the agreement is to strengthen the AI ecosystem in Europe and to assume a leading role in future innovation.\n\n{181}------------------------------------------------\n\nSee [page 206 f](#page-205-0) and [page 245 ff](#page-244-0) Further disclosures concerning the companies acquired are presented in section VIII. \"Acquisitions and purchase price allocation\" and section IV. \"Further explanatory notes on the balance sheet\", (8) \"Goodwill\".\n\n#### C U R R E N C Y T R A N S L AT I O N\n\nThe subsidiaries of Bechtle keep their books in local currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are converted at the closing rate on the date of the transaction. On the closing date, monetary assets and liabilities are measured at the closing rate, while non-monetary balance sheet items are translated at the rate on the day of the transaction. Gains and losses resulting from exchange rate fluctuations in foreign currency transactions are recognised through profit or loss. By contrast, currency translation differences based on net investments in foreign operations of a subsidiary are recognised in equity through other comprehensive income.\n\nWithin the framework of the consolidation, assets and liabilities are translated into euros, the group's presentation currency, at the closing rate. The revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average rate during the reporting period. Equity is determined on the basis of historical rates. Any resulting translation differences are recognised in a separate item in the equity.\n\nChanges in exchange rates of currencies important to the Bechtle Group in relation to the euro:\n\n|                | Currency | Closing rate |        | Average exchange rate |        |\n|----------------|----------|--------------|--------|-----------------------|--------|\n|                |          | 2023         | 2022   | 2023                  | 2022   |\n| Switzerland    | CHF      | 0.93         | 0.99   | 0.97                  | 1.00   |\n| UK             | GBP      | 0.87         | 0.89   | 0.87                  | 0.85   |\n| USA            | USD      | 1.11         | 1.07   | 1.08                  | 1.05   |\n| Poland         | PLN      | 4.35         | 4.69   | 4.54                  | 4.69   |\n| Hungary        | HUF      | 382.78       | 400.25 | 381.95                | 391.33 |\n| Czech Republic | CZK      | 24.73        | 24.12  | 24.01                 | 24.57  |\n\nFor our subsidiary in Argentina, we apply the accounting for high-inflation countries by adjusting the financial statements of this subsidiary for the current period under consideration of the change in the general purchasing power of the local currency on the basis of the relevant price indices as of the reporting date. The effects on the consolidated earnings are of minor importance and are not significant.\n\n{182}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n**Revenue recognition.** The gross revenue comprises all income resulting from Bechtle's ordinary business operations from contracts with customers. Gross revenue is presented without value-added tax and other taxes collected from the customers and paid to the tax authorities.\n\nBechtle does not reduce its promised consideration by a financing component if the term of the receivable is no more than one year. Where the term of the receivable is more than one year, the revenue is discounted to the fair value.\n\nBechtle recognises revenue as follows: When selling hardware and software, the revenue is recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied. The performance obligation is satisfied when the customer obtains control of the good or service. In Bechtle's business environment, the most significant indicators for the transfer of control are the purchase by the customer and the transfer of the ownership-related opportunities and risks of the asset. Depending on the underlying business transaction, the recognition of the revenue takes place in the amount of the consideration that Bechtle expects to receive for these goods (accounting as principal) or in the amount of the gross margin (accounting as agent).\n\n**Principal/agent.** In its **hardware selling** business, Bechtle recognises the revenue as principal. Bechtle acts as the principal as it has the control over the determined claim to transfer of the goods before they are transferred to the customer. Bechtle obtains the control over the claim to transfer of the goods after concluding the contract with the customer but before the goods are transferred to the customer. The terms and conditions of the contract with the customer permit Bechtle to decide whether to ship directly from its own warehouse or via the vendor or distributor. If the shipment takes place directly via the manufacturer or distributor, the manufacturer or distributor acts on behalf of and for the account of Bechtle (drop shipping).\n\nWith regard to the **sale of software licences,** Bechtle distinguishes several types of software licences. These types reflect Bechtle's business model and thus help to clarify this issue:\n\n#### � Standard software without customising\n\nIn the field of sales of standard software without customising, Bechtle makes distinction between two types:\n\n� Direct business: as an authorised sales partner, Bechtle places standard software products that are delivered by software vendors to end customers. Bechtle's only obligation from these agreements consists of asking another company to grant the standard software licence to the end customer. Bechtle thus acts as an agent and recognises the income at the net amount it receives from the agency services.\n\n{183}------------------------------------------------\n\n� Indirect business: within the scope of the sale of customer-specific solutions on the basis of standard software licences, Bechtle acts as a value-added software reseller and performs pre-sales consulting services in connection with the sale. This especially includes aspects of strategic and operational software procurement and consulting services with respect to the contract and compliance. Under consideration of all relevant factors (see Discretionary Decisions, Estimates and Assumptions), Bechtle is of the opinion that in the context of the pure sale of standard software, Bechtle acts as an agent. In the indirect business, Bechtle thus records the revenue in the amount of the gross margin. This assessment also applies to the sale of standard software licences with basic installation services. These installation services are generally not very extensive or complex, so that the standard software or the interfaces do not need to be customised (no customisation of the existing interfaces and no new development). Based on this analysis, Bechtle is of the opinion that it transfers two separately specified goods or services to the customer. Under consideration of all factors, Bechtle is thus of the opinion that when selling standard software licences with basic installation services, it acts as an agent. The classification as principal or agent does not depend on the provisioning model, i.e. it applies both to on-premise models and to SaaS models from the cloud, which\n\nare sold in the context of the indirect business model.\n\n� Standard software including customising and/or customer-specific integration of the standard software: on the one hand, Bechtle performs basic adjustments to the function scope of the standard software in order to meet the individual requirements of an end customer in connection with the sale of the standard software. In this connection, Bechtle has noticed that the customising for customer-specific requirements is so extensive that the standard software is changed or adapted significantly by means of this customising. On the other hand, Bechtle also performs integration services that are aligned with the needs of the end customer in order to integrate the standard software licence in the existing system of the end customer. Bechtle thus uses the standard software licence and the customer-specific integration service for the purpose of achieving the combined end result (= functional and integrated software system) as defined in the contract with the end customer. Accordingly, Bechtle comes to the conclusion that the services cannot be separated from each other, and a single performance obligation is owed to the customer. As Bechtle is responsible for fulfilling this promise, Bechtle acts as the principal in these agreements. This is backed by the fact that Bechtle can freely determine its selling prices. In this business, Bechtle thus recognises the revenue in the amount of the consideration that Bechtle expects to receive for these goods and services.\n\nAt Bechtle, **warranty obligations** usually do not meet the requirements for a separate performance obligation, as they do not exceed the statutory scope. They are presented as provisions.\n\nHowever, if third-party warranty obligations are sold, Bechtle sees itself as an agent and recognises the resulting revenue in the amount of the gross margin.\n\n[See page 197 f](#page-196-0)\n\n{184}------------------------------------------------\n\nRevenue from the **performance of IT services** is recognised over time, as the units rendered by Bechtle cannot be used otherwise and Bechtle is entitled to payment for the services already performed. The revenue is recognised on the basis of input-based methods to measure the progress of the performance. Until the invoice is issued to the customer, the revenue is presented in the contract assets.\n\nBechtle recognises the revenue from the performance of IT services as principal, as the group transfers the control over the service directly to its customers or makes it available directly to its customers.\n\n**Multiple-element contracts** for the shipment of several products or the performance of several services need to be separated into individual performance obligations for each of which a separate income is to be determined and recognised upon fulfilment of the obligation towards the customer. In addition to the combination of various hardware and software products, this especially concerns Bechtle's managed service contracts. The total transaction price of the combined contract is divided to the individual performance obligations on the basis of the pro-rata individual selling prices, i.e. the individual selling price of each element is put in relation to the total of the individual selling prices of the contractual performance obligations.\n\nThe evaluation whether the revenue needs to be recognised over time or on a point-in-time basis is performed separately for each performance obligation.\n\nPursuant to IFRS 15, **contract costs** that arise in connection with the fulfilment of managed service contracts need to be capitalised and amortised over the contract term, provided they are directly connected to the contract, result in enhanced use of resources and are recoverable. As in the previous year, these costs played only a minor role in the reporting period.\n\nPursuant to IFRS 15.91, **sales commissions** in connection with long-term managed service contracts needs to be capitalised if the time of accrual does not coincide with recognition of the revenue. This would be the case if the sales commission were to be due upon conclusion of the contract. Bechtle recognises sales commission on trading business and services as expenses at the time of delivery or performance, i.e. at the same time as the revenue recognition.\n\n**Research and development costs.** Apart from the development costs incurred in connection with the production of software designated for internal use or for sale, no significant research and development costs were incurred. Please refer to our statement on internally developed software.\n\n[See Company,](#page-44-0)  [page 45 f](#page-44-0)\n\n{185}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Leases. Bechtle as lessee.** Accordingly, all contracts in the Bechtle Group that constitute a lease or leases that are included in another contract must be measured as a lease liability at the present value of the lease payments when they are first recognised at the time of provision. This includes variable lease payments that are linked to an index or (interest) rate and whose initial measurement is made using the index or (interest) rate valid on the provision date. The discounting takes place on the basis of Bechtle's incremental borrowing rate of interest at the same time and in the same currency. On the assets side, a right-of-use asset is recognised for the underlying asset under property, plant and equipment as of the time of initial accounting. This right-of-use asset is depreciated according to schedule over the lease term. If no term is determined in an agreement or the agreement can be terminated on a monthly basis, a term of five years is used. Furthermore, extension and termination options contained in rental agreements and leases are taken into consideration in the measurement of the lease liability and thus included in the evaluation of the right-of-use asset, provided that the exercise of these options is reasonably certain. Bechtle does not account for a right-of-use asset and the corresponding lease liability for leases that are classified as short-term leases with a term of up to twelve months or as leases for low-value assets (up to €5 thousand).\n\nAt Bechtle, the application of IFRS 16 resulted in the capitalisation of right-of-use assets, especially for rental property and leased company vehicles. Additionally, there are leases for office equipment, furniture, fixtures and fittings, job bicycles and customer equipment, which, however, are of minor significance.\n\nWith the application of IFRS 16, the expenses for leases do not affect EBIT in the full amount in the income statement. Rather, only the expense from the depreciation of the capitalised right-of-use asset is recognised in EBIT; the interest costs for the lease liability are posted to the financial earnings.\n\nIn the cash flow statement, the lease payments in the amount of the interest and repayment share are included in the cash flow from financing activities.\n\n**Leases. Bechtle as lessor.** Bechtle also acts as a lessor. From this perspective, leases are classified as operating leases and finance leases. Payments from operating leases are recognised as income over the lease term through profit and loss. Assets in operating leases are carried at amortised cost in property, plant and equipment.\n\nIf all material opportunities and risks associated with the ownership have passed to the lessee, the lease shall be recognised as a finance lease. In this context, a receivable is accounted for from the finance lease in the amount of the net investment value from the lease. In this connection, Bechtle regularly engages in vendor leasing on the market and recognises revenue in the amount of the present value of future lease payments. On the other hand, expenses associated with the lease are recognised in the income statement, and the amount of the present value of future payments is accounted for as a lease liability.\n\n{186}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Goodwill** from a business combination is initially recognised at cost of purchase in the form of the surplus of the cost of purchase of the business combination over the share of net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised by the buyer pursuant to IFRS 3. The goodwill identified in the context of a business combination corresponds to the expectation of future economic benefit from assets that cannot be individually identified or presented separately.\n\nPursuant to IFRS 3, goodwill is not amortised. Instead, it is tested for impairment at least once a year pursuant to IAS 36.\n\n**Other intangible assets** in the Bechtle Group include brands, customer bases, purchased software, internally developed software and customer service agreements. Depreciation and amortisation of other intangible assets is allocated to the respective functional areas.\n\nBrands acquired in the context of company acquisitions are measured at the fair value of the brand right. Except for the Inmac Wstore brand purchased in the 2018 fiscal year, the useful life used to be assumed to be unlimited, as an analysis of all relevant factors does not reveal any foreseeable limitation of the period in which these brand rights can prospectively generate net cash flows for the Bechtle Group. Consequently, in accordance with IAS 38, brand rights may not be amortised, but shall be tested for impairment at least once a year pursuant to IAS 36.\n\nCustomer relationships acquired in the context of company acquisitions are measured in accordance with the economic benefit resulting from the customer relationships. Customer relationships are amortised on a straight-line basis over a period that depends on the expected benefit for the company. As a matter of principle, it is assumed that customer relationships are of a long-term nature. The expected useful life is five to ten years.\n\nPurchased software is measured at cost of purchase and amortised on a straight-line basis over a useful life of one to ten years.\n\nInternally developed software is capitalised under the conditions of IAS 38 provided that both the technical feasibility and the marketability of the newly developed products are ensured, the group derives an economic benefit, and internal use or sale is planned. Capitalisation takes place at cost, including all attributable costs. Costs incurred in the period prior to the technical feasibility are immediately recognised as research costs. Straight-line depreciation of the capitalised costs takes place from the date of commercial use of the asset over a useful life of three to five years.\n\n{187}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor goodwill and other intangible assets with an unlimited useful life, an impairment test is performed at least once a year for the cash-generating unit that these assets are allocated to. In the case of intangible assets with limited useful lives and property, plant and equipment, an impairment test is performed if events or changes occur that suggest impairment. In the Bechtle Group, impairment tests are always conducted on the basis of the value in use determined by means of the discounted cash flow method. The basis for this is the current plan drawn up by the management for the next three fiscal years. The planning assumptions are duly adjusted to the current state of knowledge based on internal and external information available. In the process, appropriate assumptions on macroeconomic trends and historical developments are taken into account. As a matter of principle, the expected growth rates in the relevant markets are used as the basis for the calculation of cash flows.\n\nThe need for depreciation and amortisation corresponds to the amount by which the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit exceeds the value in use. For the goodwill impairment test, the goodwill is allocated to its corresponding cash-generating units. Assets that are no longer intended for use in business operations are classified as available for sale and are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell.\n\n**Property, plant and equipment.** Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost of purchase less scheduled amortisation. Most of the property, plant and equipment consists of land and buildings. These assets are held by a limited number of companies. Within the scope of the preparation of the annual financial statements of these companies, the existence of any indications or changed circumstances which might render it impossible to recover the carrying amount of an asset is checked. Scheduled amortisation takes place on a pro rata temporis basis, and mainly on a straight-line basis according to the expected useful life. Scheduled amortisation is based on the following useful lives:\n\n| Office equipment                 | 3–10 year |\n|----------------------------------|-----------|\n| Furniture, fixtures and fittings | 3–20 year |\n| Vehicle fleet                    | 3–6 year  |\n| Buildings                        | 5–33 year |\n\nLow-value assets of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost of purchase and depreciated on a straight-line basis over a useful life of three to eight years. Maintenance costs are recognised through profit or loss when incurred.\n\n{188}------------------------------------------------\n\nA **joint venture** is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement that exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nAccording to the equity method, interests in joint ventures are to be included in the consolidated balance sheet at cost of purchase and subsequently adjusted by changes in the group's interest in the profit or loss and in the other comprehensive income of the joint venture after the date of acquisition. Losses of a joint venture that exceed the group's share in the joint venture are not recorded. They are recorded only if the group has assumed legal or constructive obligations to take over the loss or makes payments on behalf of the joint venture.\n\nAn investment in a joint venture is accounted for as of the date on which the conditions for joint ventures are on hand. Any excess of the cost of purchase of the purchased interest over the interest gained in the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised as goodwill. According to the equity method, the goodwill is part of the carrying amount of the investment and is not separately tested for impairment.\n\nAt re-measurement, any excess interest of the group in the carrying fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities over the cost of purchase of the acquired interest (negative difference) is immediately recognised through profit or loss.\n\nTo determine whether the interests in joint ventures are subject to any impairment, the regulations of IAS 36 are applied. If an impairment test needs to be conducted, this is done for the carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) according to the regulations of IAS 36. For this, the recoverable amount – i.e. the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal of the investment – is compared with its carrying amount. The determined impairment loss on the assets included in the carrying amount of the interest including goodwill is not performed. If the recoverable amount increases in subsequent years, the impairment loss is reversed in accordance with IAS 36.\n\nThe group stops using the equity method from the date on which its investment no longer represents a joint venture.\n\n{189}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn accordance with IAS 12, **deferred taxes** are recognised for all temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the group's consolidated balance sheet and the tax base of assets and liabilities (liability method) as well as for unused tax losses.\n\nDeferred tax assets for accounting and valuation differences and for unused tax losses are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that these differences will lead to taxa-ble profit in future. As of the balance sheet date, the value of the deferred tax assets rec-ognised in previous periods is reviewed as to whether it is still sufficiently probable that a future benefit can be realised. Deferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities provided that a legally enforceable right of offsetting exists and the deferred tax assets and liabilities are raised by the same tax authority for the same taxable entity. The assessment is based on the tax rates applicable in the year of reversal. Changes in tax rates are taken into consideration if these have been adopted. Pursuant to the temporary exception to the requirements regarding deferred taxes in IAS 12 as published by the IASB in May 2023, tax effects that could result from the future application of the regulations on global minimum taxation (Pillar II) are not taken into consideration when determining deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\n**Inventories.** Commodities are measured at average cost of purchase pursuant to IAS 2 (weighted average cost method). If necessary, the commodities are written down to the net realisable value. Besides the loss-free measurement, these write-downs take all other inventory risks into consideration. If the reasons that led to a write-down of inventories no longer exist, the impairment loss is reversed.\n\n**Contract assets** are claims to consideration for goods or services that Bechtle transferred to a customer before he made a payment or before the conditions for issuing an invoice and recognising a receivable are on hand. With respect to possible impairment, contract assets – like trade receivables – are subject to the expected credit loss (ECL) model introduced according to IFRS 9.\n\nA **contract liability** is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the group has already received consideration from the customer (or an amount of the consideration is due). A contract liability is recognised when a customer pays the consideration before Bechtle fulfils its performance obligation by transferring goods or services to the customer. Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the performance is rendered under the contract. This especially applies to services invoiced in advance, maintenance agreements, warranty extensions and expansions and advance payments received from third parties.\n\n**190**\n\n{190}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Trade receivables and other assets** are measured at amortised cost taking into consideration due write-down for all identifiable individual risks pursuant to IFRS 9 Appendix A. Non-current receivables with a residual term of more than one year are discounted on the basis of the relevant interest rates on the balance sheet date. The general credit risk is, where verifiable, also taken into consideration by means of appropriate impairments. By way of exception, the derivative financial instruments contained in the other assets are accounted for at fair value.\n\nAs a matter of principle, impairments of trade receivables are performed by means of allowance accounts. The decision whether to take a credit risk into consideration through an allowance account or through direct impairment of the receivable depends on the degree of reliability of the assessment of the risk situation. The individual portfolio managers are responsible for this assessment. Moreover, the general credit risk is accommodated under consideration of Euler Hermes ratings and corresponding probabilities of default in the scope of the ECL model introduced pursuant to IFRS 9. For trade receivables, receivables from finance leases and contract assets, the simplified model of IFRS 9 is applied to assess impairment on the basis of lifetime expected losses. The group determines the expected losses from these items using an impairment matrix, which is calculated on the basis of the historical losses per overdue status of the debtors and, if necessary, adjusted to current conditions and expectations of future economic developments.\n\nIn the Bechtle Group, trade receivables exclusively comprise financial instruments. The other assets also include non-financial assets. For these, no measurement at amortised cost is performed pursuant to IFRS 9.\n\n**Time deposits and securities.** Time deposits are measured as financial assets at amortised cost. They comprise time deposits and similar investments with banks and other financial service institutions, as well as investments in insurance policies with original maturities of more than three months from the date of purchase.\n\n**Cash and cash equivalents.** Cash and cash equivalents are measured as financial assets at amortised cost. They include current bank balances and cash on hand as well as short-term time deposits with initial maturities of less than three months from the acquisition date.\n\n**Pension provisions.** Pension liabilities are accounted for and measured pursuant to IAS 19. In this context, a distinction is made between defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans.\n\n{191}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the case of defined contribution plans, the employer has no obligations apart from the regular payment of defined contributions. As no actuarial assumptions are required to measure the liabilities or expenses, actuarial gains or losses cannot arise. Bechtle does not have any significant number of defined contribution plans.\n\nIn contrast, the obligations arising from defined benefit plans are to be measured on the basis of actuarial assumptions and calculations taking into account biometric assumptions. In this connection, actuarial gains or losses may occur, which must be recognised directly in equity, taking into account deferred taxes.\n\n**Other provisions** are formed where there is a current obligation to third parties arising from a past event. It must be possible to estimate the amount reliably, and it must be more likely than unlikely that an outflow of future resources will take place. Provisions are only formed for legal and constructive obligations to third parties. Provisions are recognised at the amount that, on the balance sheet date, represents the best possible estimate of the expense that will probably be necessary to fulfil the current obligation.\n\nOther provisions for warranties are formed for prospective claims on the basis of company-specific experience and the revenue. Non-current provisions with a term of more than one year are discounted on the basis of the relevant interest rates on the balance sheet date, provided that the interest effect is material.\n\n**Deferred income** includes all deferred other operating earnings, as in the prior year. This especially affected marketing grants from suppliers as well as rent income.\n\n**Financial liabilities** are recognised as expenses at amortised cost. In the Bechtle Group, financial liabilities exclusively comprise financial instruments. According to its substance, the convertible bond issued in the fiscal year is recognised as a financial liability and an equity instrument. The fair value of the liability component is determined as of the date of issue on the basis of the market interest applicable to comparable non-convertible instruments. This amount is accounted for as financial liability at amortised acquisition cost, applying the effective interest method until the fulfilment or maturity of the instrument. The conversion right classified as equity is determined by deducting the liability component from the fair value of the entire instrument. The resulting value – less income tax effects and associated transaction costs – is recognised as part of the equity and is thus not subject to measurement. The conversion right classified as equity remains in the equity until the conversion right is exercised.\n\n{192}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-192-0\"></span>**Other liabilities** contain both financial and non-financial liabilities and are recognised as expenses at amortised cost. Non-current liabilities with a term of more than one year are discounted on the basis of the relevant interest rates on the balance sheet date.\n\nBy way of exception, liabilities from acquisitions are measured at fair value (IFRS 3.39). Liabilities from acquisitions always represent debt capital, as these liabilities always entail, or could entail, a payment obligation.\n\n**Trade payables** are recognised as expenses at amortised cost. This item exclusively contains financial instruments. Non-current liabilities with a term of more than one year are discounted on the basis of the relevant interest rates on the balance sheet date.\n\n**Financial instruments** are contracts that result simultaneously in a financial asset for one company and in a financial liability or equity instrument for another. This includes both primary financial instruments (e.g. trade receivables or payables) and derivative financial instruments (transactions to hedge risks of change in value). Pursuant to IAS 32.11, an equity instrument is a contract that substantiates a residual interest in the assets of a company after deducting all of its liabilities. If the financial instrument results in payment obligations (even if only conditional), this represents debt capital, not equity.\n\nThe initial recognition of financial instruments takes place at fair value, if necessary adjusted by transaction costs that are directly attributable to the purchase or issue of the financial instrument. This does not apply to trade receivables without significant financing components; these are measured at the transaction price. The subsequent measurement takes place according to their measurement category pursuant to IFRS 9:\n\nSubsequent measurement of financial assets:\n\n- � According to IFRS 9, financial assets are allocated to the classification categories at amortised cost or fair value and measured accordingly. Where financial assets are measured at fair value, the expenses and income can either be recognised through profit or loss or through other comprehensive income.\n- Subsequent measurement of financial liabilities:\n- � Pursuant to IFRS 9, financial liabilities are measured either at amortised cost or at the fair value. The change in value is recognised at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n{193}------------------------------------------------\n\nEquity instruments:\n\n� All equity instruments pursuant to IFRS 9 are to be measured at fair value in the balance sheet. Value changes are to be recognised in profit or loss. In the case of an equity instrument not held for trading, the company may at initial recognition irrevocably decide to measure it at fair value through other comprehensive income. In this case, reclassification of the amounts in other comprehensive income, e.g. upon sale of the instrument, is no longer possible.\n\nFor financial assets that are measured at amortised cost as well as for assets that are measured at fair value and whose change in value is recognised in other comprehensive income, it is checked as of every balance sheet date whether impairment is on hand. Pursuant to IFRS 9, a risk provision is recognised for this purpose on the basis of the expected credit losses (ECL model). The assessment whether future losses are expected is performed on the basis of a creditworthiness analysis of the accounts receivable with the help of Euler Hermes ratings. Accordingly, expected valuation losses will henceforth be taken into consideration in addition to the losses that have already occurred. Once the reasons for the posted impairments no longer exist, the respective write-ups are applied. Due to the very short terms and the creditworthiness of our contract partners, no impairment is determined according to the ECL model for financial assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents.\n\nSee page 231 ff\n\nThe categorisation of the individual financial instruments within the balance sheet items is pre-[See page 231 ff](#page-230-0) sented in chapter VI. \"Further disclosures on financial instruments in accordance with IFRS 7\".\n\n> **Derivative financial instruments** are accounted for as assets or liabilities. All derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value according to the accounting policy on the settlement date. Fair values are determined with the aid of standardised mathematical models (mark-to-model method). The fair value is determined taking into account future cash flows over the residual term of the contract on the basis of current market data (interest rates, yield curve, forward prices). The creditworthiness of the debtor is determined with the help of an overhead percentage method taking into account the amount, the probability of default and the recovery rate in the event of inability to pay.\n\n> The Bechtle Group uses forward exchange contracts and currency options to mitigate the currency risk resulting from future exchange rate fluctuations for receivables and liabilities. For transactions to be classified as effective cash flow hedges, the changes of fair value are posted outside profit or loss, taking into account the applicable deferred taxes. Changes of the fair value that are attributable to the ineffective hedging instrument are recognised through profit or loss.\n\n{194}------------------------------------------------\n\nHedges of net investments in group companies abroad hedge the foreign currency risk from subsidiaries using functional currencies other than the group currency euro. Gains or losses from the hedging transaction that are attributable to the effective part of the hedging transactions are recognised outside profit or loss. Gains or losses attributable to the ineffective part of the hedging instrument are recognised in the income statement.\n\nGains and losses from the change of the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are not accounted for within the scope of the hedge accounting pursuant to IAS 39 are immediately recognised at their fair value in the income statement.\n\n#### DISCRETIONARY DECISIONS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires estimates and assumptions on the part of the Executive Board that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses in the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the disclosure of other financial liabilities and contingent liabilities. The uncertainty associated with these assumptions and estimates may yield results that necessitate substantial adjustments of the carrying amount of the affected assets and liabilities in future periods. All estimates and assumptions are based on the current knowledge and are made in good faith in order to provide a true and fair picture of the group's earnings, assets and financial position.\n\nDue to Russia's ongoing war of aggression on Ukraine, the conflict that has again flared up in the Middle East and the high inflation, estimates and discretionary decision remain subject to greater uncertainty. The actual amounts can differ from the estimates and discretionary decisions. Any available information about the prospective economic development was taken into consideration in the update of the estimates and discretionary decisions.\n\n#### The most important issues that are affected are as follows:\n\nThe **impairment test for goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment** requires estimates of future cash flows from assets or from the cash-generating unit to deter- [See page 206 ff](#page-205-0) mine its value in use as well as the selection of an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of these cash flows. For estimates of future cash flows, long-term revenue forecasts have to be made in the context of the economic setting and the development of the industry.\n\nThe measurement for the initial recognition of **customer relationships, customer service contracts, order backlogs and brands** acquired within the scope of acquisitions also involves esti- [See page 207 f](#page-206-0) mates for the determination of the fair value.\n\nImage /page/194/Picture/9 description: The image shows a book icon above the text \"See page 206 f\".\n\nImage /page/194/Picture/10 description: The image shows a book icon with the text \"See page 20\" below it.\n\n{195}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/195/Picture/1 description: The image shows a document icon on the right side and the text \"See page 20\" below it. The background is a light gray color.\n\nThe scheduled amortisation of **intangible assets** and the scheduled depreciation of **property, plant and equipment** require estimates and assumptions when determining the standardised use- [See page 207 ff](#page-206-0) ful life of assets for the group as a whole.\n\nImage /page/195/Picture/3 description: The image shows a book icon and the text \"See page 231 ff\".\n\nThe **financial instruments** recognised at fair value are allocated to a fair value hierarchy per IFRS 13. Allocation to the various levels is based on the market proximity of the valuation parameters used [See page 231 ff](#page-230-0) to determine the fair values. To the greatest extent possible, the relevant market data observable on the reporting date (e.g. exchange rates or interest rates) as obtained from recognised external market data providers (Level 2) were used as valuation parameters. Additionally, an internally determined credit value adjustment was used for receivables and liabilities (Level 3). For the convertible bond issued in the reporting period, the fair value is determined as the present value of future cash flows under consideration of yield curves and the respective rating-dependent credit risk premium (credit spread).\n\nMajor measurements are required to measure the **deferred tax** assets and liabilities of the group. In particular, the deferred tax assets on unused tax losses require estimates of the amount and dates [See page 209 f](#page-208-0) of future taxable income as well as the future tax planning strategies. Uncertainties also exist with respect to future changes in tax law. If there is doubt that it will be possible to realise the unused tax losses, these are not recognised or impaired.\n\nImage /page/195/Picture/7 description: The image shows a book icon above the text \"See page 21\".\n\nThe **inventories** contain impairments to the lower net realisable value. The amount of the impairments requires estimates and assumptions concerning the prospective realisable sales revenue. [See page 211](#page-210-0)\n\nImage /page/195/Figure/9 description: The image shows a book icon and the text \"See page 211 f\".\n\nProvisions are formed for **debts** in order to account for expected losses resulting from customers' inability to pay. The structure of the maturity of receivables, experience in connection with the proba- [See page 211 ff](#page-210-0) bility of default of external customer ratings, an estimate of the customer's creditworthiness and changes in payment performance form the basis for the assessment of the appropriateness of the provisions for bad debts.\n\nImage /page/195/Picture/11 description: The image shows a book icon on the top right and the text 'See page 218' on the bottom left.\n\nThe measurement of **pension provisions** is based on assumptions about the future development of certain factors. These factors include, among other things, actuarial assumptions such as the dis- [See page 218 ff](#page-217-0) count rate, expected increases in the value of plan assets, expected salary and pension increases, mortality rates and the earliest retirement age. Due to the long-term nature of such plans, such estimates are subject to considerable uncertainties.\n\nImage /page/195/Picture/13 description: The image shows the text \"See page 225\" in a bold font, with a small icon of an open book above the text. The book icon is simple, with several horizontal lines representing the pages.\n\nThe recognition and measurement of **provisions** rely heavily on estimates. The assessment of the quantification of the possible amount of payment obligations is based on the respective situation and circumstances. Provisions are recognised for obligations where there is a risk of losses, these losses are probable and their amount can be reliably estimated.\n\n{196}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-196-0\"></span>The inclusion of **hedging instruments** in the hedge accounting requires assumptions and estimates with respect to the underlying probability of occurrence of future transactions with hedged currencies [See page 235 ff](#page-234-0) and interest rates.\n\nTo determine whether an agreement constitutes a **lease,** it is necessary to assess whether the fulfilment of the contractual agreement depends on the use of a certain asset or certain assets and on [See page 252 ff](#page-251-0) whether the agreement grants the right to use the asset. Bechtle determines the lease term under consideration of the basic lease term that cannot be terminated as well as extension and termination options, provided it is reasonably certain that these options will be exercised in the future. In the case of an unlimited lease term in real-estate rental agreements, a useful life of five years is assumed.\n\nSee page 235\n\nImage /page/196/Picture/4 description: The image shows a book icon above the text \"See page 252.\"\n\nThe assessment of leases on the lessor side largely takes place on the basis of the criteria of the useful life as specified in the standard as well as the present value of the lease payments at the beginning of the lease.\n\nIn the context of the **revenue recognition and the assessment whether Bechtle is the principal or agent** when selling standard software licences without customising in the indirect business, Bechtle has applied the following accounting methods.\n\n**Pre-Sales consulting services.** In keeping with the agenda decision of the IFRS IC, Bechtle is of the opinion that pre-sales consulting is more in the nature of a sales service and therefore, no separate performance obligation can be identified. This is justified for various reasons, including by the fact that at the time of conclusion of the contract, the value-added reseller has already performed the consulting services. Though the consulting could have influenced the customer's decision to order a certain type and number of software licences, no effective contract between the value-added reseller and the customer is on hand prior to an order. If no software licences are purchased, Bechtle will, therefore, not be entitled to any compensation for the consulting services.\n\nMoreover, this estimation is supported by the following aspects:\n\n- � Compared to the value of the standard software licence, the pre-sales consulting overhead usually accounts for a minor share.\n- � A customer who knows which contract model would be suitable and exactly how many standard software licences he or she needs would not gain any added value from the pre-sales consulting.\n\n**Differentiation between installation and integration services.** With the sale of standard software, including customising and/or customer-specific integration of standard software, substantial discretionary leeway remains especially with regard to the question whether the mere installation of a software or complex customising and/or a customer-specific integration is on hand.\n\n{197}------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing an evaluation under consideration of the additional insight derived from the agenda decision of the IFRS IC, Bechtle came to the conclusion that stricter criteria must be applied for customising and integration services. Substantial customising and/or customer-specific integration must thus either � contain a significant customisation of the software (modification of the source code) or\n\n- � the function scope of the standard software licence must have been modified significantly, e.g. through\n- � creation of new interfaces or\n- � expansion/customisation of the existing interfaces.\n\nIf the installation or integration service does not include this scope, it is classified as (basic ) installation and does not meet the criteria for qualification as principal.\n\n**Estimates and assumptions. Gross versus net presentation.** The evaluation as to whether Bechtle should recognise revenue either in the amount of the consideration that Bechtle expects to receive for these goods and services (accounting as principal) or in the amount of the gross margin (accounting as agent) requires an analysis both of the legal form and of the economic content of contracts. After considering all relevant facts and circumstances of the individual case, the decision often involves a certain measure of discretion even if a uniform review pattern is applied throughout the group.\n\nRevenue from standard software licences without customising and/or customer-specific integration of the standard software continue to be generally accounted for as an agent and is presented in the amount of the gross margin. On the other hand, the evaluation of a significant integration service in connection with the sale of software licences is a complex issue for which the above-mentioned criteria need to be used in order to establish a qualification as principal. Basically, Bechtle assumes a qualification as agent. If however, proof of customising and or customer-specific integration is on hand or the performance took place by specialised Bechtle system houses, Bechtle will account for this sale as principal, presenting the gross revenue.\n\nDepending on the evaluation, significant differences may arise with regard to the amount of the revenue and expenses of the respective periods. However, operating income is not affected.\n\n[Company, Environment,](#page-76-0)  [page 77 ff](#page-76-0)\n\n**Effects of the climate change.** In the fields of climate change and shortage of resources, Bechtle [See Management Report,](#page-76-0) has not identified any risks to its business model. Therefore, Bechtle currently does not expect any significant effects of such risks on its business model or on the presentation of its earnings, assets and financial position. Further information on the fields of climate change and sustainability is available in the Group Management Report in the chapter \"Environment\".\n\n{198}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-198-0\"></span>**III. FURTHER EXPLANATORY NOTES ON THE INCOME STATEMENT**\n\n#### **1** REVENUE\n\nThe revenue amounting to €6,422,743 thousand (prior year: €6,028,175 thousand) includes the considerations charged to customers for goods and services less rebates and discounts.\n\nBased on the business volume as of the end of the year, the transaction price of unfulfilled performance obligations amounted to €2,146 million, just slightly below the prior-year figure of €2,452 million¹. Of this amount, the IT System House & Managed Services segment ac-counted for €1,913 million (prior year: €2,117 million¹), and the IT E-Commerce segment for €305 million (prior year: €407 million¹). The IT E-Commerce segment is characterised almost entirely by the conclusion of pure trading deals, usually with short order and deliv-ery times. In the IT System House & Managed Services segment, project deals can take anywhere from several weeks to one year. Especially in the field of Managed Services, which accounts for about one third of the order backlog, Bechtle often concludes framework and operating agreements with terms of several years. About half of these agreements are recognised as revenue in the 2024 fiscal year, and the rest in subsequent years. Contract terms for as-a-service models, e.g. for the procurement of software, can also be longer than one year.\n\nThe company grants the periods of payment that are customary in the respective industry and country (usually 10 to 60 days).\n\n|                    |                                             |                  |           |                                             |                  | €         |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------|\n|                    | 01.01–31.12.2023                            |                  |           | 01.01–31.12.2022                            |                  |           |\n|                    | IT System<br>House &<br>Managed<br>Services | IT<br>E-Commerce | Group     | IT System<br>House &<br>Managed<br>Services | IT<br>E-Commerce | Group     |\n| IT trading revenue | 3,007,318                                   | 2,056,049        | 5,063,367 | 2,666,3412                                  | 2,204,0942       | 4,870,435 |\n| IT service revenue | 1,282,762                                   | 76,614           | 1,359,376 | 1,114,007                                   | 43,733           | 1,157,740 |\n| Total revenue      | 4,290,080                                   | 2,132,663        | 6,422,743 | 3,780,3482                                  | 2,247,8272       | 6,028,175 |\n\nThe following table shows the breakdown of the revenue:\n\n2 Adjustment prior year, due to adjustment of PvA netting €97,820 thousand\n\nIn this context, the IT E-Commerce business segment mainly generates IT trading revenue that is recognised at a point in time.

Including the trade tax and solidarity surcharge, the tax encumbrance amounted to 30.1 per cent (prior year: 29.7 per cent) on average. The current taxes of subsidiaries abroad are determined on the basis of the respective national tax law and at the tax rate applicable in the country of domicile. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be valid at the time of realisation of the asset or fulfilment of the liability.\n\n{203}------------------------------------------------\n\n€k\n\nThe deferred tax expense from valuation differences in terms of time decreased due mainly to the different depreciation of leased assets. As a matter of principle, they are depreciated on the basis of the term of the leasing agreements. For tax purposes, the useful life is determined on the basis of the official tables describing allowances for depreciation. The shorter useful life of computer hardware and software applied in 2021 amplify this effect.\n\nFor the reporting period, the reconciliation between the actual tax expenses and the amount that arises taking into account a weighted domestic and foreign tax rate of approximately 27.9 per cent (prior year: 27.6 per cent) on the profit before income taxes was as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                  | 2023    | 2022    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Earnings before taxes                                                                            | 374,477 | 350,487 |\n| Expected tax expense                                                                             | 104,642 | 96,588  |\n| Tax expense of earlier years                                                                     | 7,255   | 22      |\n| Non-deductible expenses                                                                          | 5,236   | 2,693   |\n| Tax increase due to controlled foreign corporation rules                                         | 29      | 7       |\n| Unrecognised deferred taxes on unused losses for the current year                                | 21      | 637     |\n| Deconsolidation and other consolidation effects                                                  | 10      | 238     |\n| Earn-out components                                                                              | 0       | 182     |\n| Devaluation of previously recognised deferred taxes on loss carryforwards                        | 0       | 80      |\n| Allocation/addition deferred tax assets to valuation differences in terms of time                | 0       | −53     |\n| Devaluation of previously recognised deferred taxes on valuation differences<br>in terms of time | −23     | 469     |\n| Tax rate change for deferred taxes                                                               | −43     | 15      |\n| Tax-free income                                                                                  | −810    | −721    |\n| Allocation/addition deferred tax assets to loss carryforwards                                    | −1,181  | −626    |\n| Use of previously unrecorded loss carryforwards                                                  | −1,199  | −36     |\n| Tax income of earlier years                                                                      | −4,593  | −105    |\n| Others                                                                                           | −379    | −21     |\n| Actual tax expense                                                                               | 108,965 | 99,369  |\n\n{204}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **7** EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\nThe following tables the calculation of the earnings after taxes that are due to the shareholders of Bechtle AG:\n\nThe following table shows the basic earnings per share:\n\n|                                             | 2023        | 2022        |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Earnings after taxes €k                     | 265,512     | 251,118     |\n| Average number of outstanding shares shares | 126,000,000 | 126,000,000 |\n| Basic earnings per share €                  | 2.11        | 1.99        |\n\nAccording to IAS 33, the earnings per share are determined on the basis of the earnings after taxes (attributable to shareholders of Bechtle AG) and the average number of shares in circulation in the year. Treasury shares reduce the number of outstanding shares accordingly.\n\nSo far, the convertible bond issued in the reporting period has not affected the earnings per share, as the exercise price for the conversion in the reporting period was above the average price of the shares of Bechtle AG. Therefore, the diluted earnings per share corresponded to the basic earnings per share.\n\n{205}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-205-0\"></span>**IV.

Within the framework of the preparation of the annual financial statements as of 31 December 2023, the assumptions with regard to the impairment test did not undergo any changes.\n\n{206}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-206-0\"></span>Bechtle determines the recoverable amounts of its cash-generating units with the help of the discounted cash flow method. The risk-adjusted discount rates are determined on the basis of peer group information for beta factors, borrowing costs and the debt ratio. As of 30 September 2023, the cash-generating units had a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 8.9 per cent (prior year: 8.1 per cent) after taxes (WACC before taxes 12.9 per cent, prior year: 11.3 per cent). The cash flow forecasts used are based on individual revenue and cost plans for the coming year as approved by the management, which are thus also taken into consideration in the variable compensation systems for the executives and are in line with external information sources and experience gained. For the planning, both the expected growth and the profitability of the products and services are made use of. The cash flows for 2024 and 2025 have been derived on the basis of the as-is data and the target data in accordance with the above-mentioned factors, and the cash flow for 2026 has been extrapolated with assumptions based on long-term growth rates of 1 per cent. Sensitivity analyses have revealed that even in the case of substantially divergent key assumptions within a realistic framework, there would be no need for impairment of the goodwill. For example, there would be no need for impairment in the event of a reduction of the yearly free cash flow of the cash-generating units by more than 10.0 per cent each or an increase of the WACC to 12.0 per cent if the other input parameters remained unchanged.\n\nThe development of the goodwill is presented in Appendices B and C to the Notes.\n\n[See Notes,](#page-265-0)  [Appendices B and C,](#page-265-0) [page 266 f](#page-265-0)\n\n€k\n\n#### 9 OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\n|                               | 31.12.2023 | 31.12.2022 |\n|-------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Brands/licences               | 9,448      | 11,837     |\n| Customer bases                | 63,305     | 47,687     |\n| Purchased software            | 28,508     | 18,985     |\n| Internally developed software | 11,714     | 11,085     |\n| Customer service agreements   | 4,493      | 10,107     |\n| Other intangible assets       | 117,468    | 99,701     |\n\nThe Modus brand (carrying amount €1,900 thousand) has an unlimited useful life. This unlimited useful life is due to the fact that Modus Consult GmbH will continue to constitute a key element of the Bechtle Group along with its respective brands and the legal protection of the brand can easily be perpetuated over an extended period. In the prior year, the ARP brand (carrying amount €1,542 thousand) was reduced from a previously unlimited useful life to three years due to the reorganisation in the IT E-Commerce segment. The Inmac WStore brand (carrying amount €4,807 thousand) has a useful life of ten years. The ARP and Inmac WStore brands are allocated to the cash-generating unit IT E-Commerce and the Modus brand to the cash-generating unit IT System House & Managed Services.\n\n207\n\nFor information on the planning process\n\nand expectations, see [Management Report,](#page-46-0)  [page 47 ff](#page-46-0) and [Forecast Report,](#page-146-0)  [page 147 ff](#page-146-0)\n\n{207}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe discount rate used to determine the value in use for the brands within the scope of the yearly impairment tests is based on input parameters derived from the market and was set at 8.9 per cent (prior year: 8.1 per cent). The cash flow forecasts used are based on the revenue and cost plans approved by the management. Further growth rates are only assumed in the amount necessary to compensate for inflation. In the reporting period, as in prior years, the value in use that was determined for the brand surpassed the value in the balance sheet. Sensitivity analyses revealed that even in the case of divergent key assumptions within a realistic framework, there would be no need for impairment of the brand. The change in the carrying amount compared to the prior year is attributable to the scheduled amortisation of the Inmac WStore and ARP brands and currency translation differences.\n\n|                                                              | €      |        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|                                                              | 2023   | 2022   |\n| Customer bases                                               |        |        |\n| Carrying amount (31.12)                                      | 63,305 | 47,687 |\n| Remaining useful life (weighted average) (years)             | 4.6    | 5.3    |\n| Accumulated scheduled amortisation                           | 41,711 | 32,802 |\n| Scheduled amortisation                                       | 12,946 | 9,136  |\n| Currency translation differences of accumulated amortisation | 51     | 26     |\n\nInmac WStore SAS, which had been acquired in 2018, accounted for the greatest share of capitalised customer bases, totalling €27,113 thousand (prior year: €32,923 thousand).

This depends on the generation of future taxable profits in connection with which the tax valuation differences are reversed and unused tax losses can be asserted.\n\nUnder current tax provisions, unused domestic tax losses are regarded as unlimited. The restricted use of loss offsetting possibilities (minimum taxation) under German tax law and time limits of foreign tax losses were taken into consideration in the assessment of the impairment of deferred tax assets on loss carryforwards.\n\nIf a tax entity has a loss history in the recent past, deferred tax assets from loss carryforwards of this entity will be recognised only if there are sufficient taxable temporary differences or substantial indications of the realisation of such.\n\nFor the determination of the amount of deferred tax assets that can be capitalised, material assumptions and estimates of the management are required concerning the expected time of occurrence and amount of income subject to future taxation, as well as the future tax planning strategies. The capitalised deferred taxes on loss carryforwards at various companies that recorded losses in 2022 and/ or 2023 and that were not offset by netted deferred tax liabilities amounted to €0 thousand (prior year: €0 thousand). There were no netted deferred tax liabilities at these companies. Based on the planning of the companies and their current earnings performance, we believe that the deferred tax assets will be realised by means of adequate taxable profits.\n\nUnused tax losses for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised in the balance sheet amounted to €291 thousand (prior year: €4,848 thousand) for corporation tax, €746 thousand (prior year: €8,248 thousand) for trade tax and €142 thousand (prior year: €3,505 thousand¹) for losses of companies abroad.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, deferred tax liabilities on profits of Bechtle subsidiaries not transferred were recognised in the amount of €336 thousand (prior year: €248 thousand).\n\nThe temporary differences in connection with interests in subsidiaries for which no tax liabilities were recognised amounted to a total of €50,670 thousand (prior year: €44,556 thousand).\n\nImage /page/209/Picture/14 description: The image shows a simple line drawing of an open book. The book is upright, with the spine visible. Each page has several horizontal lines representing text. The book is centered and takes up a significant portion of the image.\n\nOf the deferred taxes recognised in the balance sheet, a total of €7,169 thousand were added to the goodwill and €1,492 thousand were deducted from the equity (prior year: €3,360 thousand were added to the goodwill and €7,210 thousand were deducted from the equity) outside profit and loss.

In accordance with the revenue structure, most of the presented receivables are receivables from the delivery of goods. The company is thus exposed to the risk of default up to the carrying amount. In the past, Bechtle suffered minor defaults of individual customers and customer groups. To hedge the general credit risk, reasonable provisions for bad debts are made on the basis of probabilities of default of a rating agency in the context of the ECL model. So far, the difficult political and economic circumstances have not resulted in any increased defaults. However, it remains to be seen how the default rate will continue to develop against the backdrop of the ongoing difficult economic situation. For this reason, the assumptions regarding the allocation of rating classes in order to accommodate the deteriorated economic forecasts in connection with the interest rate increases, the energy price crisis and new credit risks, which were the main reasons for the high impairment level, were the same as in the prior year. Compared to the prior year, the rating classes did not undergo any changes. The decline in impairment was due to the improved rating of our customers in rating classes with a lower probability of default. Due to the very low probability of default and the very high creditworthiness, no impairment is applied to receivables from public-sector clients.

The company is thus exposed to the risk of default up to the carrying amount. Rental deposits have been furnished for rented business premises as collateral for the landlord. Furthermore, increased due to strong year-end business, contract assets, which belong to other assets, increased from €49,944 thousand in 2022 to €100,777 thousand in 2023. In accordance with IFRS 9, a risk provision in the amount of €506 thousand (prior year: €250 thousand) was recognised for expected credit risks under consideration of the probabilities of default as calculated by a rating agency.\n\nAs of the reporting date, there were no indications that the debtors of assets overdue would not meet their payment obligations.\n\nFor the disclosures according to IFRS 7, financial instruments included in other assets are allocated to � \"other financial assets\" in the amount of €211,565 thousand (prior year: €140,082 thousand) and � \"financial derivatives\" in the amount of €3,089 thousand (prior year: €1,824 thousand).\n\n#### **16** CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n\nThe cash and cash equivalents in the amount of €435,756 thousand (prior year: €229,590 thousand) include current balances with banks and cash on hand amounting to €349,171 thousand and time deposits (with a term to maturity of less than three months) amounting to €86,585 thousand and are fully allocated to \"cash and cash equivalents\" for the disclosures pursuant to IFRS 7. Due to the very short terms and the creditworthiness of our contracting partners, no impairment was performed on the basis of expected credit losses.\n\n#### **17** EQUITY\n\n[See Consolidated](#page-175-0) [Statement of](#page-175-0) [Changes in Equity,](#page-175-0) [page 176](#page-175-0)\n\nThe development of the group equity is presented in the consolidated statement of changes in equity as an explicit component of the financial statements before the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n#### ISSUED CAPITAL\n\nAs in the prior year, the company's share capital as of 31 December 2023 amounted to €126,000 thousand, divided into 126,000,000 (prior year: 126,000,000) ordinary shares of a calculated nominal value of €1.00 each. Each share has one vote. As of the balance sheet date, no shares had been utilised to service the convertible bond.\n\n**Authorised and contingent capital.** Pursuant to Article 4 (3) of the Articles of Incorporation of Bechtle AG, the Executive Board is authorised, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the company's issued capital by up to €18,900 thousand by issuing new bearer shares (author\n\n{214}------------------------------------------------\n\nised capital according to the resolution of the General Meeting of 15 June 2021) until 14 June 2026. In addition, the Executive Board is authorised in accordance with No. 4 (4) of the Articles of Incorporation of Bechtle AG to conditionally increase the company's issued capital by up to €6,300 thousand in order to issue convertible bonds in the amount of up to €350,000 thousand.\n\nCapital increases may occur against cash contributions and/or in-kind contributions. Subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board is authorised to exclude fractional amounts from the shareholders' subscription rights. Moreover, the Executive Board is authorised, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the subscription right if:\n\n� Case 1: the capital increase is performed against cash contributions, does not exceed €12,600 thousand at the time of the issue and the issue price is not significantly below the listed price or � Case 2: the capital increase is performed for the acquisition of companies or interests in companies.\n\nSubject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board is authorised to determine further details of the capital increases from the authorised capital.\n\n#### CAPITAL RESERVES\n\nCapital reserves mainly comprise the offering premium (agio) from capital increases and amounted to €66,913 thousand (prior year: €40,228 thousand). The change compared to the prior year reflects the equity component from the convertible bond.\n\n#### RETAINED EARNINGS\n\n**Accrued profits.** At the General Meeting on 25 May 2023, a resolution was adopted to pay a dividend of €0.65 per no-par share with dividend entitlement for the 2022 fiscal year (dividend total: €81,900 thousand). The dividend was paid out on 31 May 2023. In the prior year, a dividend total of €69,300 thousand had been paid out on 8 June 2022.\n\nDividends may only be paid from the net profit and the retained earnings of the company, as recognised in the Annual Financial Statements of Bechtle AG prepared in accordance with German commercial law. These amounts deviate from the total equity as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS. The resolution for the payment of future dividends is jointly proposed by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of the company and adopted by the General Meeting. The decisive factors are in particular profitability, the financial position, capital requirements, business prospects and the general economic framework conditions of the company. Since Bechtle's strategy is geared towards internal and external growth, investments will be necessary for this purpose, which should – where possible – be equity-financed. The Executive Board has decided to propose to the Supervisory Board and to the General Meeting to appropriate the net profit of €88,200 thousand for the 2023 fiscal year for the payment of a normal dividend of €0.70 per no-par share with dividend entitlement.\n\n{215}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-215-0\"></span>Apart from the dividend paid out for the 2022 fiscal year, the retained earnings in the reporting period also changed by the comprehensive income of €259,508 thousand, consisting of earnings after taxes (€265,512 thousand) and other comprehensive income (minus €6,004 thousand). Accordingly, the retained earnings as of 31 December 2023 amounted to €1,549,699 thousand (prior year: €1,372,091 thousand). Apart from the dividend payment, a change from the comprehensive income amounting to €254,505 thousand had taken place in the prior year.\n\n**Accumulated other comprehensive income.** In terms of its accumulated balance as of the balance sheet date and its change during the reporting period, the other comprehensive income that is to be recognised in equity outside profit or loss is composed as follows:\n\n|                                                  |                 |                       |                |                 |                       | €              |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------|----------------|\n|                                                  | 31.12.2023      |                       |                | 31.12.2022      |                       |                |\n|                                                  | Before<br>taxes | Income tax<br>effects | After<br>taxes | Before<br>taxes | Income tax<br>effects | After<br>taxes |\n| Actuarial gains and losses on pension provisions | 7,956           | -2,128                | 5,828          | 17,748          | -3,526                | 14,222         |\n| Unrealised gains and losses on hedges            | 326             | 76                    | 402            | 857             | -18                   | 839            |\n| Hedging of net investments in foreign operations | -56,317         | 17,127                | -39,190        | -45,496         | 13,821                | -31,675        |\n| Currency translation differences                 | 60,269          | 0                     | 60,269         | 49,927          | 0                     | 49,927         |\n| Other comprehensive income                       | 12,234          | 15,075                | 27,309         | 23,036          | 10,277                | 33,313         |\n\n|                                                                             | 01.01–31.12.2023 |                       |                | 01.01–31.12.2022 |                       |                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------------|----------------|\n|                                                                             | Before<br>taxes  | Income tax<br>effects | After<br>taxes | Before<br>taxes  | Income tax<br>effects | After<br>taxes |\n| Items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods |                  |                       |                |                  |                       |                |\n| Actuarial gains and losses on pension provisions                            | −9,792           | 1,398                 | −8,394         | 6,894            | −1,430                | 5,464          |\n| Items that will be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods     |                  |                       |                |                  |                       |                |\n| Unrealised gains and losses on hedges                                       | −531             | 94                    | −437           | −514             | 84                    | −430           |\n| Gains and losses that arose in the current period                           | −307             | 94                    | −213           | −290             | 84                    | −206           |\n| Reclassifications to profit                                                 | −224             | 0                     | −224           | −224             | 0                     | −224           |\n| Hedging of net investments in foreign operations                            | −10,821          | 3,306                 | −7,515         | −18,877          | 5,918                 | −12,959        |\n| Gains and losses that arose in the current period                           | −10,821          | 3,306                 | −7,515         | −18,877          | 5,918                 | −12,959        |\n| Reclassifications to profit and loss                                        | 0                | 0                     | 0              | 0                | 0                     | 0              |\n| Currency translation differences                                            | 10,342           | 0                     | 10,342         | 11,312           | 0                     | 11,312         |\n| Other comprehensive income                                                  | −10,802          | 4,798                 | −6,004         | −1,185           | 4,572                 | 3,387          |\n\n{216}------------------------------------------------\n\nThus, the other comprehensive income amounted to minus €6,004 thousand (prior year: €3,387 thousand) of the comprehensive income in the reporting period. As in the prior year, the amount reclassified to the consolidated income statement (minus €224 thousand) was reclassified to financial expenses. The other comprehensive income as well as the comprehensive income is due in full to the shareholders of Bechtle AG.\n\n#### TREASURY SHARES\n\nBy resolution of the General Meeting on 27 May 2020, the Executive Board had been authorised, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to purchase treasury shares pursuant to Section 71 (1) no. 8 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The purchase of treasury shares must comply with the content of the resolution of the General Meeting. This authorisation is valid until 26 May 2025.\n\nIn the reporting period, there were no transactions in treasury shares. Thus, as was the case on 31 December 2022, the company did not hold any treasury shares as of 31 December 2023.\n\n#### CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\nWithin the scope of the capital management (IAS 1.134 f), Bechtle focuses on a sound capital structure with a high equity ratio, a high return on assets and a comfortable liquidity situation, and, in this connection, on cash flow-based indicators such as working capital.\n\nAt €1,742,612 thousand, Bechtle's equity as of 31 December 2023 reached a high value that represented a year-on-year improvement (€1,538,319 thousand). In the reporting period, the equity (+13.3 per cent) grew at a higher rate than the debt capital (+7.9 per cent), which is reflected in a higher equity ratio of 45.8 per cent (prior year: 44.6 per cent). The increase in debt capital resulted especially from higher financial liabilities due to the convertible bond, higher contract liabilities well as other liabilities, which include liabilities to employees. In the reporting period, the existing loans were repaid according to schedule. The higher dividend payout in the reporting period resulted in a lower return on equity of 17.24 per cent (prior year: 18.56 per cent). The return on assets dropped slightly to 8.4 per cent (prior year: 8.5 per cent).\n\nThe unchanged goal of Bechtle's capital management is to retain a strong equity base in order to maintain the trust of investors, lenders and the market, and to facilitate future internal and external growth. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may also adjust the dividend payments to shareholders, issue new shares or buy back treasury shares, and even retire shares if necessary.\n\n{217}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-217-0\"></span>The group's sound capital structure also forms the basis for financial flexibility and extensive independence from outside creditors, which is very important for Bechtle. The objective is to have a comfortable liquidity situation to ensure full solvency at all times. As of 31 December 2023, Bechtle had cash and cash equivalents as well as time deposits and securities amounting to €465,756 thousand (prior year: €289,590 thousand). With respect to the structure of these assets, quick availability is more important than maximum yield, e.g. in order to have access to cash and cash equivalents whenever necessary for acquisitions or large project pre-financing measures, thereby being able to benefit from such opportunities. The liquidity situation is managed and monitored by the central treasury.\n\nAgainst this background, cash flow-based key indicators such as the working capital, DSO and other capital tie-up periods are highly significant. Bechtle controls these indicators in order to tie up as little capital and liquidity as possible in its operational service creation process. The revenue growth and the relaxation in the procurement market resulted in a slightly lower working capital of €800,131 thousand (prior year: €976,564 thousand) as of 31 December 2023. Bechtle defines working capital as the balance of certain balance sheet items (inventories, trade receivables and accrued income for customer maintenance agreements) on the assets side and certain balance sheet items (trade payables, contract liabilities and deferred income) on the equity and liabilities side.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, respectively, no fundamental changes had been made to the capital management goals, guidelines and procedures.\n\n#### **18** PENSION PROVISIONS\n\nExcept for the pension plans in Switzerland, in France and of Bechtle Managed Services GmbH in Germany, the Bechtle Group has no defined benefit plans. As a matter of principle, these benefit commitments are presented under consideration of country-specific regulations (e.g. local law). The amount of the provision presented in the Annual Report of Bechtle AG represents the value of the pension obligation less the respective plan assets.\n\nThe main obligations from benefits plans exist in Switzerland. They account for 94.4 per cent (prior year: 93.6 per cent) of the group-wide pension obligation and 98.1 per cent (prior year: 97.6 per cent) of the corresponding plan assets.\n\n{218}------------------------------------------------\n\nDefined contribution obligations primarily derive exclusively from the statutory pension obligation. In the reporting period, employer contributions to the statutory pension fund in Germany totalled €44,466 thousand (prior year: €40,788 thousand). In France, the contributions to the statutory pension fund totalled €3,362 thousand (prior year: €3,516 thousand).\n\n**Pension plans Switzerland.** Although the pension plans of Bechtle Holding Schweiz AG and its subsidiaries are contractually agreed as defined contribution plans, they must, however, be accounted for as defined benefit plans pursuant to IAS 19, as a financial participation by the companies in the event of a shortfall in cover cannot be excluded.\n\nSince 1 January 2006, the Bechtle Holding Schweiz AG companies headquartered in Switzerland have made use of the semi-autonomous \"Bechtle Pension Fund\" (\"Bechtle Pensionskasse\") in Rotkreuz, a foundation as defined in Art. 80 ff of the Swiss Civil Code that is independent from the group. The pension fund fulfils the regulations of the Swiss Code of Obligations and of Swiss Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors' and Disability Pensions (OPA). The transparency required for accounting for the pension plans as defined benefit plans, pursuant to IAS 19, has, therefore, existed since then. For this reason, actuarial opinions have been regularly prepared since 1 January 2006. Subsidiaries of Bechtle Holding Schweiz AG that are not headquartered in Switzerland are covered by defined contribution plans of external state pension funds of the respective countries. According to the financing agreement of the pension fund, 40 per cent of the contributions are paid by the employees and 60 per cent by the employer.\n\nAs a result of the acquisitions performed in Switzerland in the 2019 fiscal year, the pension obligations have also been transferred to Bechtle. According to the financing agreement of the joint foundation, 50 per cent of the contributions are paid by the employees and 50 per cent by the employer.\n\nIn the event of a recapitalisation, Bechtle must pay at least 50 per cent of the deficit for both plans. Upon retirement, the insured can choose between a monthly pension whose amount largely depends on the capital paid in plus interest, or a one-time payment of the capital. The minimum interest is prescribed by the government.\n\nDuring the reporting period, actuarial losses of €9,230 thousand accrued. Taking exchange rate differences amounting to plus €137 thousand into consideration, the actuarial gains recognised as retained earnings as of 31 December 2023 amounted to €6,077 thousand (prior year: gain of €15,171 thousand), less deferred tax assets amounting to €1,260 thousand (prior year: €2,494 thousand).\n\n{219}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the reporting period, employer contributions exceeded the net pension expenses to be recognised by €1,559 thousand. This amount was posted to personnel expenses through profit or loss.\n\nAfter factoring in the other exchange rate differences amounting to plus €295 thousand, the total net obligation and thus the pension provisions to be accounted for as of 31 December 2023 amounted to €7,575 thousand.\n\nWith respect to the pension obligation, poor capital market performance and a change in legislation by the government represent potential risks for Bechtle. Moreover, longevity of the insured persons and an imbalance of beneficiaries versus actively insured persons could have a negative financial effect for Bechtle. To minimise these risks, attention is paid to broad diversification of the asset classes. The risk management of the Bechtle pension fund also involves the equal distribution of employee and employer representatives on the foundation board and a separate management.\n\n**Pension plans Germany.** The pension obligations of Bechtle Managed Services GmbH, Neckarsulm, are a result of the takeover of a partial business unit as of 1 October 2005 and, based on an actuarial opinion, were accounted for in the Bechtle Group for the first time as of 31 December 2005. In prior years, further obligations were taken over within the scope of takeovers of partial business operations of IBM. The employer contributions depend on the gross salary of the insured. The employee contributions are voluntary. Commitments have been made with respect to the guaranteed return on the retirement account. The performance depends on the gross annual salary and the service time. In most cases, the retirement plans provide for capital payment in one amount or in eight yearly instalments. Any underfunding must be fully borne by Bechtle alone.\n\nIn 2013, Bechtle decided to take out reinsurance for the obligations. Prior to 2013, the obligations of this defined benefit plan had been processed as direct commitments without the transfer of reserves.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the pension provision went up by €750 thousand to €6,159 thousand. In the course of the reporting period, actuarial gains amounting to €82 thousand accrued; thus, the actuarial gains recognised in retained earnings as of 31 December 2023 amounted to €142 thousand (prior year: gain of €60 thousand) less deferred tax assets amounting to €43 thousand (prior year: €18 thousand).\n\n{220}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the reporting period, net pension expenses to be recognised through profit or loss exceeded the employer contributions paid by €926 thousand. Accordingly, this amount was recognised as an increase of personnel expenses through profit or loss.\n\nPoor performance on the capital markets could have a negative effect on Bechtle with respect to these pension commitments. If the reinsurance failed to generate the surplus in the amount of the assured yield on the market, Bechtle would incur additional financial expenses. Bechtle endeavours to fulfil its commitments or settle them ahead of time, provided that the employee agrees. New commitments will not be made.\n\n**Pension plans France.** The legislator in France determines a minimum compensation that depends on the employee's seniority and compensation upon retirement due to old age. Moreover, requirements of the respective collective labour agreement may be applicable. The amount of the compensation mainly depends on the employee's seniority. An entitlement accrues from a seniority of ten years.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the pension provision amounted to €3,547 thousand (prior year: €2,518 thousand). In the course of the reporting period, actuarial losses amounted to €780 thousand (prior year: gain of €1,417 thousand). As of 31 December 2023, the actuarial gains recognised in retained earnings thus amounted to €1,737 thousand (prior year: €2,517 thousand), less deferred assets amounting to €825 thousand (prior year: €1,014 thousand).\n\nIn the reporting period, net pension expenses to be recognised through profit or loss exceeded the employer contributions paid by €249 thousand. This amount was posted to personnel expenses through profit or loss.\n\nPoor performance on the capital markets could have a negative effect on Bechtle with respect to these pension commitments. If the reinsurance failed to generate the surplus in the amount of the assured yield on the market, Bechtle would incur additional financial expenses. Bechtle endeavours to fulfil its commitments or settle them ahead of time, provided that the employee agrees. New commitments will not be made.\n\n**Net obligation for the group.** In total, the pension obligations that were recognised as pension provision in the consolidated balance sheet as of 31 December 2023 amounted to €17,282 thousand (prior year: €7,927 thousand).\n\n{221}------------------------------------------------\n\n€k\n\n|

FURTHER EXPLANATORY NOTES ON THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT**\n\nThe cash flow statement for the 2023 reporting period and the prior year was prepared in accordance with IAS 7 and reports the development of cash flows broken down by cash inflows and outflows from operating, investing and financing activities. The cash flow from operating activities is determined using the indirect method.\n\nAs in the prior year, cash and cash equivalents included cash on hand, cheques and bank balances with an original term to maturity of no more than three months and correspond to the balance sheet item \"cash and cash equivalents\". Effects from the currency translation of cash and cash equivalents are shown separately in the calculation.\n\n#### **2 5** CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES\n\nThe cash flow from operating activities in the amount of €459,031 thousand (prior year: €116,651 thousand) was indirectly derived from the earnings before taxes. The indirect calculation takes into account the financial earnings, depreciation and amortisation and other non-cash expenses and income as well as the change in selected material balance sheet items and other net assets.\n\nAs in the prior year, other non-cash expenses and income include changes in provisions and impairments.\n\nThe changes in balance sheet items are adjusted for assets and liabilities taken over from acquisitions and for influences from currency translation.\n\n#### **2 6** CASH FLOW FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES\n\nIn 2023, net cash used for investments in the amount of €282,553 thousand (prior year: €224,323 thousand) primarily consisted of payments for investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment as well as for the acquisition of companies.

loss\n\n{231}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-231-0\"></span>Pursuant to IFRS 13, the material parameters on which the measurement is based must be disclosed for all financial instruments whose fair value is presented or that are accounted for at fair value. The assessment methods are divided into the following three levels:\n\nLevel 1: Measurement at prices (not adjusted) quoted on active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2: Measurement of the asset or liability takes place either directly or indirectly on the basis of observable input data, which do not represent quoted prices as stated in Level 1.\n\nLevel 3: Measurement is based on models using input parameters not observable on the market.\n\nThe cash flows of the **financial derivatives** accounted for as hedges will occur within a period of two months of the balance sheet date.\n\n**Convertible bond.** In the reporting period, an unsecured and non-subordinated bond of a total nominal value of €300 million with conversion rights was placed in new and/or existing no-par shares of Bechtle AG. The convertible bonds with a denomination of €100 thousand each are issued and repaid at 100 per cent of the nominal amount. The term to maturity is seven years. The initial conversion price of €54.99 was determined with a conversion premium of 30 per cent over the reference share price of €42.30. The convertible bonds are subject to a nominal interest rate of 2.0 per cent. Termination of the outstanding convertible bonds by Bechtle is possible after five years, at the earliest, if the share price has not reached 130 per cent of the applicable conversion price. Termination of the outstanding convertible bonds by Bechtle is possible at any time if the total nominal amount of the convertible bonds has dropped to 20 per cent or less of the total nominal amount originally issued. Holders of the convertible bonds have the right to demand premature repayment of their convertible bonds at the nominal amount after five years. The accounting took place using the effective interest method.\n\n**The liabilities resulting from acquisitions** are conditional, additional purchase price payments (earn-outs) for acquisitions (IFRS 3.58). The fair value was determined with the help of the DCF method. Apart from the planned business development of the unit taken over, a discount rate that is appropriate for the period was used. The creditworthiness of the debtor Bechtle (IFRS 13.42 ff) was taken into account via an overhead percentage method taking into account the amount, the probability of default and the recovery rate in the event of inability to pay. The difference between the fair value and the amount to be paid at maturity according to the contract is €4 thousand, which only contains an insignificant change of the credit risk. The factor that has the greatest impact on the fair value is the planned business development, which is based on earnings-oriented key indicators. In the event of a reduction of the target achievement to 90 per cent of the target achievement assumed at the acquisition, the liabilities from acquisitions would drop by about 100 per cent; in the event of an increase to 110 per cent of the target achievement assumed at the acquisition, the liabilities would not increase. In the event of a payout, the liabilities will be repaid by the end of 2024.\n\n{232}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe fair value of **time deposits, loans** and **non-current trade receivables** and **non-current trade payables** corresponds to the present value of the cash flows under consideration of the riskweighted interest rates appropriate for the periods plus creditworthiness impairment. The fair value of time deposits, loans and non-current trade receivables and non-current trade payables corresponds to the present value of the cash flows under consideration of the risk-weighted interest rates appropriate for the periods plus creditworthiness impairment. In the event of an increase (reduction) of the discount for the credit risk of the counterparty by 5 per cent, the fair value of the non-current trade receivables would be €23 thousand lower (€23 thousand higher), and the non-current lease receivables would be €66 thousand lower (€66 thousand higher). In the event of an increase (reduction) of the discount for the own credit risk by 5 per cent, the fair value of the non-current lease liabilities would be €5 thousand lower (€5 thousand higher), and the fair value of the loans would be €24 thousand lower (€24 thousand higher).\n\nFor all current financial assets and liabilities, the carrying amount corresponds to the fair value (IFRS 7.29). This comprises **current trade receivables, other financial assets, current trade payables, cash and cash equivalents, time deposits** and **other financial liabilities.** \n\nDuring the reporting period, there were no reclassifications between measurements at fair value of Level 1 and Level 2 and no reclassifications to or from measurements at fair value of Level 3.\n\nThe development of the financial instruments in Level 3 as measured at fair value is as follows:\n\n|                                                |            | Total gains and losses                 |

The trade payables contain receivables from suppliers in the amount of €9,907 thousand, and the receivables from suppliers contain liabilities in the amount of €11,395 thousand. Based on contractual agreements, these customers of Bechtle are entitled to net these items against each other. These items are principally bonus revenues that suppliers pay out to Bechtle and that Bechtle pays out to its customers.\n\n{234}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-234-0\"></span>DISCLOSURES ON RISK MANAGEMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n**Currency risk.** Receivables, liabilities and cash and cash equivalents that are not transacted in the functional (local) currency used by the companies are exposed to currency risks from financial instruments. In the Bechtle Group, currency risks from financial instruments denominated in foreign currency arise from the intercompany trade and, to a small extent, trade with external suppliers and customers.\n\nHedges serve to protect against exchange rate risks affecting receivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currency. The Bechtle Group uses forward exchange contracts, currency swaps and currency options as hedges.\n\nIn the Consolidated Financial Statements (EUR), exchange differences arose from the conversion of foreign currency financial statements of subsidiaries abroad. These differences are carried and recognised separately directly in equity. In the reporting period, Bechtle made use of the following currency futures in order to compensate most of these currency translation differences outside profit or loss and to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation (IAS 39, IFRIC 16):\n\n|                          | 2023                                       |                                           |                      | 2022                    |                                            |                                           |                      |                         |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Currency<br>relationship | Nominal<br>amount<br>hedging<br>instrument | Hedge<br>gain/loss<br>(entered<br>in OCI) | Income<br>tax effect | Average<br>hedging rate | Nominal<br>amount<br>hedging<br>instrument | Hedge<br>gain/loss<br>(entered<br>in OCI) | Income<br>tax effect | Average<br>hedging rate |\n| EUR/CHF                  | 277,960                                    | -8,618                                    | -2,633               | 0.97                    | 413,338                                    | -19,437                                   | -5,867               | 1.03                    |\n| EUR/GBP                  | 97,713                                     | -1,527                                    | -467                 | 0.88                    | 18,688                                     | 699                                       | 211                  | 0.85                    |\n| EUR/PLN                  | 4,076                                      | -534                                      | -163                 | 4.91                    | 3,595                                      | -135                                      | -41                  | 4.87                    |\n| EUR/HUF                  | 779                                        | -135                                      | -41                  | 449.03                  | 962                                        | 32                                        | 10                   | 391.34                  |\n| EUR/CZK                  | 442                                        | -7                                        | -2                   | 24.90                   | 503                                        | -36                                       | -11                  | 25.91                   |\n\nOn the other hand, the consolidated equity underwent a positive effect in the amount of €10,342 thousand (prior year: €11,312 thousand) from currency translation differences. These were largely caused by EUR/CHF conversion.\n\nAlongside the above-mentioned hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, Bechtle made use of other hedges to hedge its business operations. The loss of €248 thousand (prior year: gain of €59 thousand) that corresponds to the effective part of the currency hedges (cash flow hedge) was recognised in other comprehensive income outside profit or loss, taking into account deferred taxes (€76 thousand; prior year: €18 thousand). For this, an average EUR/USD rate of 1.09 was hedged (prior year: 1.07).\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-235-0\"></span>Apart from the said individual cases that are accounted for as hedges, hedges with terms of up to two years and individual volumes of up to €2 million, in most cases, are regularly concluded for operational purposes within the ordinary course of business.

The changes in the fair values of the financial assets and liabilities in foreign currency recognised as of the respective balance sheet date due to the changed exchange rate are taken into account. The hedges existing as of the balance sheet date are taken into consideration in the sensitivity analysis. Exchange rate differences from the translation of financial statements into the group's currency are not taken into account.\n\n{236}------------------------------------------------\n\n€k\n\n€k\n\n<span id=\"page-236-0\"></span>\n\n|                                                               | 2023   |          | 2022    |           |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|---------|-----------|\n| Effects of a 10% value loss (or increase) of the euro against |        |          |         |           |\n| USD                                                           | +6,266 | (-6,266) | +14,155 | (-14,155) |\n| CHF                                                           | -4,693 | (+4,693) | -3,111  | (+3,111)  |\n| SEK                                                           | +2,143 | (-2,143) | +1,592  | (-1,592)  |\n| NOK                                                           | +1,140 | (-1,140) | +175    | (-175)    |\n| CZK                                                           | -183   | (+183)   | -66     | (+66)     |\n| GBP                                                           | +160   | (-160)   | +219    | (-219)    |\n| HUF                                                           | -65    | (+65)    | -67     | (+67)     |\n| PLN                                                           | +24    | (-24)    | -294    | (+294)    |\n| TWD                                                           | +17    | (-17)    | +10     | (-10)     |\n| CAD                                                           | +1     | (-1)     | 0       | 0         |\n\nThe following sensitivity analysis illustrates the impact a decrease (or increase) in the euro exchange rate could have on other comprehensive income (outside profit or loss).

The interest rate risks of the Bechtle Group are centrally analysed, and the resulting measures are actively managed by the central finance department. The approach to this area is subject to regular review as determined by the management.\n\nApart from this, the group has only a minimal position – and thus an insignificant interest rate risk – in variable-rate financial instruments, which are exposed to cash flow risks from a possible deterioration in interest rates. There is also an insignificant interest rate risk for fixed-interest financial instruments with fair value risk due to the fluctuating fair values of non-current receivables and trade liabilities depending on interest rates.\n\n{237}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe sensitivity analysis was conducted for the Bechtle Group's cash and cash equivalents, and time deposits as of the balance sheet date, taking into account the relevant interest rates in the relevant currencies. A hypothetical decrease or increase in these interest rates from the beginning of the reporting period by 100 basis points or 1.0 per cent a year (assuming constant exchange rates) would have led to a decrease/increase in interest income by €4,658 thousand (prior year: €2,896 thousand).\n\n**Liquidity risk.** The liquidity risk from financial instruments results from future interest payments and redemption payments for financial liabilities and from derivative financial instruments. The tables below show the non-discounted payment obligations for the relevant balance sheet items as of the balance sheet date and the prior year's balance sheet date in accordance with IFRS 7. Bechtle has credit lines that can be used both for cash loans and for guarantee credit. Detailed information on this is presented in (20) Financial liabilities.\n\n€k\n\nLiquidity risk is managed and monitored weekly with the help of a 14-day liquidity preview.\n\n[For disclosures

In the case of bank deposits in the European Union, we make sure that the balance at a bank or group of banks with the [For further disclosures](#page-141-0) same deposit guarantee does not exceed the respective deposit guarantee cap. Approximately 38 per cent of the cash and cash equivalents are held with banks that belong to the liability association of the Savings Banks Finance Group. Thus, a risk could arise from the default of several banks belonging to this guarantee arrangement. The Swiss group companies hold about 30 per cent of the group's cash and cash equivalents at large Swiss banks, which only offer a low statutory deposit guarantee.\n\n**Credit Risk.** The carrying amounts of the financial assets correspond to the maximum credit risk. There are no hedges except for common liens for all trade receivables as well as country-specific deposit guarantee funds for all cash and cash equivalents and time deposits. Any credit risks identified in the financial assets are recognised in the form of impairments. Except for lenders in connection with buildings, Bechtle provides virtually none of its creditors with collateral.\n\nImage /page/238/Picture/4 description: The image shows a book icon above the text \"For further disclosures on the risk management, see page 142 f\".\n\n{239}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-239-0\"></span>With regard to the investment of excess liquidity, quick availability is more important than maximum yield, e.g. in order to be able to access available cash and cash equivalents in the event of acquisitions or major project pre-financing measures. Thus, purely financial goals – such as the optimisation of the financial income – are subordinate to the acquisition strategy and the company growth. This financial flexibility forms the basis for success in a highly consolidating market. The liquidity situation is centrally managed and monitored by the treasury.\n\nInvestment business was only conducted with investment-grade debtors. For time deposits within the European Union, investments with a deposit guarantee are preferred. As such a guarantee only exists to a limited extent in Switzerland, investments in this country are only made at banks with an excellent credit rating.\n\nTo avoid risk concentrations, customer-specific credit lines are determined by means of ongoing creditworthiness checks.\n\n### **VII. SEGMENT INFORMATION**\n\nSegment information is reported in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, as in the prior year.\n\nThe Bechtle Group is currently active in two business segments, the IT System House & Managed Services segment and the IT E-Commerce segment. The two segments differ in terms of the areas of activity involved as well as with regard to the processes applied for IT product trading purposes. The strategic alignment and expansion strategy pursued are also different.\n\nIn the **IT System House & Managed Services** segment, Bechtle's services cover the entire IT value chain ranging from IT strategy consulting services, hardware and software, project planning and implementation, system integration, IT services and training to complete IT operation. Bechtle prepares individual offers involving a range of different services in combination with hardware and software directly reflecting the needs and preferences of each and every customer. In this segment, Bechtle operates in Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and, since recently, in France, ensuring special customer proximity by means of its decentralised organisation with more than 100 locations for wide geographic coverage.\n\n{240}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe **IT E-Commerce** segment comprises the group's online shop and telesales trading activities. As an IT specialist with more than 36,000 products in the web shop – ranging from hardware and standard software products to peripherals and accessories – Bechtle covers all common IT areas. The Bechtle direct brand is currently established in 14 European countries and focuses on classic hardware and software from market-leading vendors. The Bechtle Comsoft and Inmac WStore brands are active in France only. In the Netherlands, Bechtle is also active with the ARP brand. The software licensing business of the Bechtle Comsoft brand is present in two European countries.\n\nCompanies of the Bechtle Group mainly exist in Germany. Group companies exist abroad in Argentina, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, UK and the USA.\n\nThe administration and the strategic management of the individual companies are centralised primarily at Gaildorf and Neckarsulm, where the parent company Bechtle AG and the group's Executive Board are based.\n\nAs a general rule, the same reporting methods and accounting policies are applied for the segment information as for the Consolidated Financial Statements. Internally, no transition to the changed principal versus agent (PvA) accounting is performed. Rather, the management takes place on the basis of the business volume (gross revenue). A combination of the business segments has not been drawn up.\n\nThe chief operating decision-maker (CODM) as defined in IFRS 8.7 is the Executive Board of Bechtle AG, which comprises the Chairman of the Executive Board, the Member of the Executive Board responsible for IT System House & Managed Services and the Member of the Executive Board responsible for IT E-Commerce. This CODM is responsible for the cross-departmental, group-wide monitoring and management of the group success and resource allocation. Strategic decisions concerning the allocation of resources to the two segments and the measurement of their earning power are made exclusively at Executive Board meetings of Bechtle AG in close coordination with the Supervisory Board. The Executive Board member responsible for IT System House & Managed Services and the Executive Board member responsible for IT E-Commerce serve individually as the segment managers (IFRS 8.9) for the respective business segment. In this capacity, they are in charge of the resource management and the assessment of the efficiency of the segments under their supervision. The segment manager also coaches the Executive Vice Presidents and Managing Directors in his segment. Vis-à-vis the CODM, the segment managers are responsible for their segments and maintain regular contact with the CODM, e.g. at Executive Board meetings, in order to report on and discuss the activities, results and plans of their segment.\n\n{241}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe segment information presented below is based on the same indicators as those employed for the internal reporting and controlling system that are used above all by the group management/CODM for success evaluation and resource allocation purposes. As previously, management is based on business volume. It contains all income and expenses as well as the assets and liabilities of the central units/functions of the Bechtle Group in accordance with the relevant services provided or used in the two IT System House & Managed Services and IT E-Commerce segments. The earnings before interest and taxes and before acquisition-related depreciation and amortisation represent the earnings-related key performance indicator for the segments. The depreciation and amortisation from acquisitions relate to customer bases, customer service agreements and brands resulting within the scope of acquisitions. Financial earnings are not consolidated as the segments are primarily funded via the central units where external interest expense and income are mainly incurred. For this reason, financial earnings and expenses are reported together as financial income merely at group level as shown below. This results in the earnings before taxes in the Bechtle Group and subsequently, taking into account the taxes at group level, the earnings after taxes in the Bechtle Group.\n\nThis results in asymmetric allocation (IFRS 8.27) insofar as the assets and liabilities reported for the segments include interest-bearing assets and liabilities as well as tax receivables and payables. In the case of symmetric allocation, segment assets and segment liabilities would be correspondingly lower and the earnings-related key performance indicator of the segments would include financial income, financial expenses and tax.\n\nTransactions are only conducted between the two segments to an insignificant extent. They are accounted for at market prices and, for the purposes of completeness and transparency, are shown below explicitly in respect of the business volume as well as receivables and payables. The consolidated revenue comprises the total revenue of both segments with parties outside the group. The same applies to the receivables and payables as well as the assets and liabilities of the two segments and of the Bechtle Group as a whole.\n\nThe investments, depreciation and amortisation reported relate to intangible assets as well as to property, plant and equipment.\n\nImage /page/241/Picture/5 description: This image contains text that reads: \"For disclosures on the composition of the revenue, see page 199 f\".\n\nIn the segment reporting by region (domestic or abroad), revenue is allocated to the country in which the subsidiary concerned has its registered office. From the perspective of the given subsidiary, revenue is generated exclusively in its own country. Only revenue via parties external to the group is reported. Accordingly, assets, liabilities and investments are allocated to the domestic market (Germany) or abroad on the basis of the location of the given company's registered office.\n\n{242}------------------------------------------------\n\n€k\n\n<span id=\"page-242-0\"></span>\n\n|                                                    | 2023

internal management does not take place on the basis of the changed PvP accounting, but rather continues to focus on the business volume (gross revenue). For this reason, a reconciliation with the external revenue is necessary for the presentation of the group as a whole. Depreciation and amortisation concern the ongoing depreciation and amortisation of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.\n\nNo unscheduled depreciation or amortisation was carried out in the two segments beyond the scheduled depreciation and amortisation.\n\n|                                                  |                                             |                  |           |                                             |                  | €k        |  |  |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------|--|--|\n|                                                  |                                             | 2023             |           |                                             |                  | 2022      |  |  |\n| By segments                                      | IT System<br>House &<br>Managed<br>Services | IT<br>E-Commerce | Group     | IT System<br>House &<br>Managed<br>Services | IT<br>E-Commerce | Group     |  |  |\n| Total segment assets                             | 2,504,475                                   | 1,306,577        |           | 2,388,251                                   | 1,070,055        |           |  |  |\n| less intersegment receivables                    | −7,186                                      | −677             |           | −9,344                                      | −1,090           |           |  |  |\n| Assets                                           | 2,497,289                                   | 1,305,900        | 3,803,189 | 2,378,907                                   | 1,068,965        | 3,447,872 |  |  |\n| Thereof shares in investments measured at equity | 32,497                                      | 0                | 32,497    | 0                                           | 0                | 0         |  |  |\n| Total segment liabilities                        | 1,437,051                                   | 631,389          |           | 1,351,081                                   | 568,906          |           |  |  |\n| less intersegment liabilities                    | −677                                        | −7,186           |           | −1,090                                      | −9,344           |           |  |  |\n| Liabilities                                      | 1,436,374                                   | 624,203          | 2,060,577 | 1,349,991                                   | 559,562          | 1,909,552 |  |  |\n|                                                  |                                             |                  |           |                                             |                  |           |  |  |\n\n{243}------------------------------------------------\n\n€k\n\n|  | By regions                       |  | 2023      |           |           | 2022      |           |           |\n|--|----------------------------------|--|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|  |                                  |  | Domestic  | Abroad    | Group     | Domestic  | Abroad    | Group     |\n|  | Revenue                          |  | 3,996,199 | 2,426,544 | 6,422,743 | 3,731,733 | 2,296,442 | 6,028,175 |\n|  | Investments                      |  | 164,509   | 35,323    | 199,832   | 94,138    | 49,230    | 143,368   |\n|  | Investments through acquisitions |  | 1,687     | 207,404   | 209,091   | 1,648     | 95,507    | 97,155    |\n\nOf the consolidated revenue generated abroad, France accounted for €690,754 thousand (prior year: €718,245 thousand), Switzerland for €378,755 thousand (prior year: €390,557 thousand) and the Netherlands for €558,117 thousand (prior year: €477,639 thousand).

Founded in 1997, the company enjoys an excellent reputation and is well known in the industry. Its core business comprises hardware procurement including plug-and-play services and software licensing. Security and network services as well as lifecycle management supplement the product portfolio. Together with Bechtle direct UK, major vendor partners will benefit from an even stronger interface to customers in the British B2B market.\n\nApart from the assets and liabilities already recognised by the acquired companies, whose carrying amounts corresponded to their fair value, customer relationships (€11,542 thousand) were newly recognised as identifiable assets with a useful life of five years and measured at fair value as of the acquisition date.

components of the consideration for Tangible Benefit Ltd. (€4,209 thousand), the consideration paid for the companies acquired in 2023 (€220,593 thousand) resulted in an outflow of cash and cash equivalents of €186,941 thousand.\n\nIn the course of the acquisitions, transaction costs amounting to €2,090 thousand were incurred and recognised in administrative expenses.\n\n{249}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-249-0\"></span>Since their acquisition, the companies have contributed a total of €102,431 thousand to the revenue (thereof Tangible Benefit Ltd. €51,506 thousand, Fondo ICT Professionals B.V. €15,515 thousand, SGSolution AG €2,822 thousand, Prosol Ingenieria S.L. €2,413 thousand, Prosol Iscat S.L. €722 thousand, sastema GmbH €756 thousand, Executive IT SAS Group €28,697 thousand) and €4,891 thousand to the earnings after taxes (thereof Tangible Benefit Ltd. €2,398 thousand, Fondo ICT Professionals B.V. €974 thousand, SGSolution AG €261 thousand, Prosol Ingenieria S.L. minus €82 thousand, Prosol Iscat S.L. €141 thousand, sastema GmbH minus €1 thousand, Executive IT SAS Group €1,200 thousand). Had the companies been acquired at the beginning of the reporting period, the revenue of the Bechtle Group for the reporting period would have amounted to €6,535,528 thousand (thereof Tangible Benefit Ltd. €68,986 thousand, Fondo ICT Professionals B.V. €27,329 thousand, SGSolution AG €3,330 thousand, Prosol Ingenieria S.L. €8,404 thousand, Prosol Iscat S.L. €2,083 thousand, sastema GmbH €1,864 thousand, Executive IT SAS Group €103,220 thousand).\n\n**Acquisition after the reporting date.** As of 22 February 2024, Bechtle acquired the Apple reseller iDoo Tech S.L., headquartered in Saragossa. iDoo Tech mainly focuses on the B2B sale of Apple products along with consulting, training and support. The plan is to handle Bechtle's entire Apple business in Spain via iDoo Tech. The objective is to gain Apple Authorised Enterprise Reseller status in order to be able to offer an even more extensive service and solution portfolio in the field of IT E-Commerce apart from the sale of products to business customers. The company has 13 employees. The consideration associated with the acquisition amounted to €2,488 thousand and resulted in an outflow of cash and cash equivalents in the amount of €448 thousand. The purchase agreement provides for conditional purchase price payments amounting to €2,040 thousand.\n\n### **IX.

The total remuneration paid to former members of the Supervisory Board amounted to €24 thousand (prior year: €0 thousand).\n\nAll disclosures concerning the Supervisory Board that are required due to statutory regulations are summarised in Appendix D to these Notes.\n\n### **X. OTHER DISCLOSURES**\n\n#### BECHTLE AS LESSEE\n\nAs a lessee, Bechtle accounts for leases for the following agreement types:\n\n- � Buildings\n- � Motor vehicles\n- � Job bicycles (head lease & sublease)\n- � Furniture, fixtures and fittings\n- � Office equipment\n- � Customer equipment (head lease & sublease)\n\nFor the agreement types buildings, motor vehicles, office machines and furniture, fixtures and fittings, right-of-use assets are accounted for and amortised over the individual useful life. The normal period for buildings ranges from three to ten years. Motor vehicle leasing agreements have a general term of two to three years. The agreement periods for furniture, fixtures and fittings are one to five years.\n\n{252}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the agreement types job bicycles and customer equipment, Bechtle acts both as lessee and as lessor in the context of finance leases. For this, no right-of-use assets are capitalised, but a lease receivable is recognised against the business partner. The lease receivable is measured on the basis of the present value of the lease payments and is repaid over the term. The following figure shows the right-of-use assets accounted for, which are allocated to the individual assets:\n\n|                                                                     |            | €          |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Assets with assigned rights of use in property, plant and equipment | 31.12.2023 | 31.12.2022 |\n| Buildings                                                           | 137,838    | 108,070    |\n| Furniture, fixtures and fittings                                    | 364        | 263        |\n| Vehicle fleet                                                       | 40,778     | 30,592     |\n\nThe amortisation amounts for the right-of-use assets that are attributable to the reporting period are presented in the following table:\n\n|                                     | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Amortisation of right-of-use assets |        | €      |\n| Buildings                           | 33,428 | 28,552 |\n| Furniture, fixtures and fittings    | 222    | 181    |\n| Vehicle fleet                       | 23,438 | 19,245 |\n\nWith regard to buildings, Bechtle mainly rents offices, storage space and parking places. Motor vehicle leases are concluded especially for the sales department.\n\nExtension and cancellation options were taken into consideration upon recognition and measurement of the lease liabilities if Bechtle was reasonably certain that these options would be exercised in the future. Thus, the depreciation takes place over the contractually agreed lease term or, if Bechtle exercises its lease extension option, over the contractually agreed lease term plus the period of the lease extension option. Lease liabilities in the amount of €57,190 thousand (prior year: €51,424 thousand) were recognised under other current liabilities and €136,336 thousand (prior year: €98,451 thousand) under other non-current liabilities.\n\nIn 2023, expenses for short-term and minor leases amounted to €949 thousand (prior year: €1,190 thousand). Renewal and termination options result in potential cash outflows of €68,721 thousand (prior year: €41,499 thousand).\n\n{253}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-253-0\"></span>BECHTLE AS LESSOR\n\n**Operating leases.** In connection with operating leases, Bechtle also acts as lessor. Most of the agreements concerned relate to the leasing of IT products. Generally, the leasing agreements are concluded for terms of three to five years. The respective minimum lease payments from these agreements are as follows:\n\n| €                      |        |        |  |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|--|\n|                        | 2023   | 2022   |  |\n| Due within one year    | 7,881  | 5,210  |  |\n| Due in 1 to 2 years    | 6,061  | 4,267  |  |\n| Due in 2 to 3 years    | 4,552  | 1,204  |  |\n| Due in 3 to 4 years    | 3,068  | 570    |  |\n| Due in 4 to 5 years    | 1,219  | 242    |  |\n| Minimum lease payments | 22,781 | 11,493 |  |\n\nIn the year under review, leasing income from operating leases amounted to €7,173 thousand (prior year: €4,840 thousand).\n\n**Finance leases.** In connection with finance leases, Bechtle also acts as lessor. Bechtle Financial Services AG operates as a group-internal sales financing provider for the end-customer business of the system houses. It offers rent and leasing models for direct leasing and refinancing of the system houses as well as hire purchases. The refinancing of the financing transactions takes place in the form of forfeiting (non-recourse factoring) via various external refinancing partners. For agreements newly concluded in the 2023 fiscal year, non-guaranteed residual values exist in the amount of €696 thousand (prior year: €2,925 thousand).\n\nAs of the closing date, the trade receivables contained leasing receivables amounting to €84,197 thousand (prior year: €77,021 thousand).

STATEMENTS AND OF THE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT\n\n**Audit opinions.** We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Bechtle Aktiengesellschaft, Neckarsulm, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which consist of the consolidated balance sheet as of 31 December 2023, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated cash flow statement for the fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, as well as notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of key accounting methods. In addition, we have audited the Group management report of Bechtle Aktiengesellschaft, Neckarsulm, for the fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, which is combined with the management report of the parent company. In accordance with the German statutory regulations, we did not audit the content of the summarised corporate governance statement referred to in the \"Corporate governance\" section of the combined management report, the summarised non-financial statement included in the combined management report, the \"Corporate governance\" and \"Effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system\" sections of the combined management report, cross-references in the combined management report to websites of the company and the information referred to by those cross-references.\n\nAccording to our assessment based on the findings gained in our audit,\n\n- � the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB (German Commercial Code) and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as of 31 December 2023 and of its financial performance for the fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and\n- � the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides a suitable view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the combined management report does not cover the content of the statements referred to above, the sections \"Corporate governance\" and \"Effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system\" of the combined management report, the cross-references referred to above or the information to which the cross-references relate.\n\nPursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\n\n{270}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Basis for the audit opinions.** We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") and under consideration of the accepted German accounting principles as set forth by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer, IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) Lit. f of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\n**Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements.** Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional discretionary judgement, were of the greatest significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nBelow, we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters:\n\n- 1. Impairment of goodwill\n- 2. Recognition of revenue\n\nWe have structured our presentation of these key audit matters as follows:\n\n- a) Description of the situation (including reference to the respective disclosures in the consolidated financial statements)\n- b) Audit procedure\n\n#### 1 . IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL\n\na) In the consolidated financial statements of Bechtle Aktiengesellschaft as of 31 December 2023, the balance sheet item \"Goodwill\" discloses EUR 732.3 million, which corresponds to 19.3 per cent of the consolidated balance sheet total.\n\nThe legal representatives of Bechtle Aktiengesellschaft subject the capitalised goodwill to impairment tests at least once a year or whenever necessary. The company has identified the reportable segments IT System House & Managed Services as well as IT E-Commerce as cash-generating units. The recoverable amount is determined on the basis of the value in use, using a discounted cash flow model. This is based on the present values of the expected future cash flows, which are based on the medium-term planning prepared by the legal representatives and extrapolated using assumptions about long-term growth rates. The discounting takes place via the weighted capital costs of the respective cash-generating unit.\n\n{271}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe result of this measurement greatly depends on the assessment of future cash inflows of the respective cash-generating unit by the legal representatives and the applied discount rate, the long-term growth rates used and thus involves uncertainties. Against this backdrop and due to the complexity of the applied measurement model, this matter was of special importance in the context of our audit.\n\nThe disclosures of the legal representatives concerning the impairment testing of the goodwill are presented in the sections \"II. Summary of Key Principles of Accounting and Consolidations\" and \"IV. Further Explanatory Notes on the Balance Sheet – (8) Goodwill\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nb) Within the scope of our audit, we reviewed the procedure of the company's legal representatives in conducting the impairment tests with the involvement of our internal measurement specialists as well as the determination of the weighted capital costs. On this basis, we evaluated the entire measurement model, especially its methodological and mathematical accuracy. Moreover, we evaluated to what extent the measurement can be influenced by subjectivity, complexity or other inherent risk factors, and we evaluated the methods, assumptions and data used.\n\nWe were convinced of the appropriateness of the future cash flows used in the measurement, among other things, in the course of our recording and critical assessment of the planning process. To evaluate the quality and reliability of the medium-term planning, we compared the planning of selected fiscal years with the earnings actually achieved and analysed individual material deviations (planning reliability).\n\nWe checked whether the planning on which the impairment tests were based was consistent with the medium-term planning approved by the legal representatives and whether the data derived from this were correctly transferred to the measurement model used. In addition, we asked the legal representatives or persons appointed by them about the material assumptions of the medium-term planning and checked their plausibility, taking into account external macroeconomic and sector-specific market expectations.\n\nBecause a significant portion of the respective value in use results from forecast cash flows for the period after the medium-term planning period, we critically assessed the sustainable growth rate recognised for this phase in particular on the basis of general and industry-specific market expectations. Furthermore, we validated the parameters used to determine the WACC rate used for discounting, questioned the appropriateness of the peer group and compared the market data used with external evidence.\n\nFurthermore, we audited the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as required by IAS 36.\n\n{272}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2 . RECOGNITION OF REVENUE\n\na) In the consolidated financial statements of Bechtle Aktiengesellschaft as of 31 December 2023, revenue of EUR 6,422.7 million is reported in the income statement.\n\nThe portfolio of Bechtle Aktiengesellschaft includes customer consulting services regarding the design of the IT infrastructure, the supply of the necessary hardware and software, related installation and integration services and handling of the complete operation of the customer's IT (managed services). The performance obligations are partially based on complex contractual arrangements with regard to the sale of IT products and the performance of further installation and integration services.\n\nIn the context of the accounting for the revenue, the legal representatives need to classify the performance obligations by assessing whether the performance obligations consist of delivering the goods or services as a principal or of arranging for the delivery or service by another party as an agent.\n\nThe classification of the performance obligation and the assessment of whether revenue is to be recognised as of a point in time or over time requires significant discretionary judgement on the part of the legal representatives with regard to the application of the relevant criteria of IFRS 15 and against the backdrop of the findings of the agenda decision of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC), which is why the recognition of revenue was classified as a particularly important audit matter. The disclosures of the legal representatives concerning the revenue are presented in the sections \"II. Summary of Key Principles of Accounting and Consolidations\" and \"III. Further Explanatory Notes on the Income Statement – (1) \"Revenue\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nb) We differentiated the revenue of Bechtle Aktiengesellschaft by their type (sale of hardware and software, performance of services) and their associated internal processes. On this basis, we first obtained an understanding of the design of the respective internal processes and controls for revenue recognition, including the accounting controls for the identification of performance obligations and the determination of individual sales prices. For this, we traced the respective process flow and performed analytical audit actions. Based on the process understanding we gained, we evaluated the design and setup of identified internal controls with a view to the revenue recognition. Where we wanted to rely on the effectiveness of identified controls, we additionally subjected them to a functional check. Moreover, we evaluated whether and to what extent the revenue recognition was influenced by subjectivity, complexity or other inherent risk factors, and we evaluated the methods, assumptions and data used.\n\n{273}------------------------------------------------\n\nWith regard to the revenue, we also audited individual cases with respect to statements made. We verified the revenue recognition at a point in time or over time on the basis of samples via value-weighted random selection. We also took the company's procedure for the classification of the performance as principle or agent on the basis of the criteria of IFRS 15 and the insights of the agenda decision of the IFRS IC into consideration in order to check whether the accounting policies have been complied with. In this context, we examined the contractual arrangements to check whether Bechtle Aktiengesellschaft acts as principal or agent and whether the resulting revenue has been recognised in the full amount (Bechtle as principal) or in the amount of the gross margin (Bechtle as agent).\n\nFinally, we audited the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as required by IFRS 15.\n\n#### O T H E R I N F O R M AT I O N\n\nThe legal representatives and/or the Supervisory Board are responsible for the other information.

In all other respects, the legal representatives are responsible for the other information.\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of audit conclusion regarding this information.\n\n{274}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information\n\n� demonstrates material inconsistencies with the consolidated financial statements, with the audited content of the combined management report or our knowledge obtained during the audit, or\n\n� otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\n### R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y O F T H E L E G A L R E P R E S E N TAT I V E S A N D T H E S U P E R V I S O R Y B O A R D F O R T H E C O N S O L I D AT E D F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S A N D T H E C O M B I N E D M A N A G E M E N T R E P O R T\n\nThe legal representatives are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with the IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German law pursuant to Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB), and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and earnings position of the group. In addition, the legal representatives are responsible for such internal controls as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e. manipulation of the accounting or damage to assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the legal representatives are responsible for assessing the group's going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to the going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, unless there is an intention to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative to do so.\n\nIn addition, the legal representatives are responsible for the preparation of the combined management report, which as a whole provides an appropriate view of the group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Furthermore, the legal representatives are responsible for the precautions and measures (systems) that they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a combined management report in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the combined management report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report.\n\n{275}------------------------------------------------\n\n### A U D I T O R ' S R E S P O N S I B I L I T I E S F O R T H E A U D I T O F T H E C O N S O L I D AT E D F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S A N D O F T H E C O M B I N E D M A N A G E M E N T R E P O R T\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee, that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or as a whole, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users made on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and combined management report.\n\nWe exercise professional discretionary judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. Furthermore,\n\n- � we identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the overriding of internal controls.\n- � we obtain an understanding of the internal control system relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the combined management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate for the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- � we evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the legal representatives and the reasonableness of estimates made by the legal representatives and related disclosures.\n\n{276}------------------------------------------------\n\n- � we draw conclusions on the appropriateness of the legal representatives' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention to the information concerned in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management report in the auditor's report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances could endanger the group as a going concern.\n- � we evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the group's assets, liabilities, financial position and earnings position in compliance with the IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German law pursuant to Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB).\n- � we obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the accounting information of the entities or business activities within the group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- � we evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the group's position it provides.\n- � we perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the legal representatives in the combined management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the legal representatives as a basis for the prospective information and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and, where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\n{277}------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine the matters that were of the greatest significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n#### OTHER STATUTORY AND OTHER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n### **Report on the audit of the electronic reproduction of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report prepared for publication purposes in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB**\n\n**Audit opinion.** We have performed an audit in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the reproduction of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report (hereinafter also referred to as \"ESEF documents\") contained in the file with the SHA-256 value a6a3569e47f67a0dcdcc0ec41bc1971932333ef966e3f5eb3e1d20b144528e8f and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB concerning the electronic reporting format (\"ESEF format\") in all material respects. In accordance with German legal requirements, this audit only extends to the conversion of the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report into the ESEF format and therefore does not extend to the information contained in these reproductions or any other information contained in the above-mentioned file.\n\nIn our opinion, the reproduction of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report contained in the above-mentioned file and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format.

Our responsibilities under that standard are further described in the \"Group auditor's responsibilities for the assurance work on the ESEF documents\" section.

We exercise professional discretionary judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. Furthermore,\n\n- � we identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n- � we obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the assurance on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the given circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.\n- � we evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e., whether the electronic file containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 in the version valid as of the reporting date on the technical specification for this electronic file.\n- � we evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable an XHTML reproduction with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report.\n- � we evaluate whether the labelling of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with Articles 4 and 6 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 in the version applicable at the reporting date provides an adequate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML reproduction.\n\n{279}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Other disclosures pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation.** We were appointed as group auditor by the Annual General Meeting on 25 May 2023.

The consolidated financial statements and combined management report converted into ESEF format - including the versions to be entered in the company register - are merely electronic reproductions of the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report and do not replace them. In particular, the ESEF report and our audit opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the assured ESEF documents made available in electronic form.\n\n**Responsible Auditor.** The auditor responsible for the audit is Marco Koch.\n\nStuttgart, 12 March 2024\n\nDeloitte GmbH, auditing firm\n\nAuditor Auditor\n\nMarco Koch Andreas Himmelsbach\n\n{280}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-280-0\"></span>**RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT BY THE EXECUTIVE BOARD**\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, and in accordance with the applicable reporting principles for financial reporting, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the earnings, asset and financial position of the group, and the Management Report of the group includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the group, together with a description of the principal opportunities and risks associated with the expected development of the group,\n\nNeckarsulm, 11 March 2024\n\nBechtle AG The Executive Board\n\nThues Ole of\n\nAntje Leminsky\n\nT.

We are looking at a long list of negative news reports, the dimensions of which are often shocking. At the same time, we are in the midst of a technological transformation on a scale not seen for a long time. These framework conditions are extremely challenging, without question also for companies operating in future-oriented industries such as IT. And thus also for your company, for Bechtle.\n\n#### However, being pessimistic will not help the situation.\n\nMore than ever, a hands-on mentality is needed. Every day, we do our best to continue to drive the necessary digital transformation with determination and creativity in order to support our customers' competitiveness and performance. In this context, our aim is to sustainably promote the success of our customers through IT. Over the past months, we have again succeeded in doing so.\n\n#### The 2023 fiscal year can be summarised in three words: resilient, successful and future-oriented.\n\nWe are very satisfied with the overall performance delivered by the Bechtle Group despite the challenging conditions in our key markets. In the course of the year, we managed to achieve a steady level above the prior year – a clear sign of strength in these times of turbulence and uncertainty, especially in connection with the good cash flow. What is more, Bechtle's earnings were in line with the forecast for the year as whole.\n\nWe are very pleased to report business volume growth of 7 per cent, revenue growth of 6.5 per cent and an improvement of earnings before taxes of 6.8 per cent. With its revenue increase of 13.5 per cent, the performance of our service and project-oriented system house segment was especially remarkable. Thus, we have greatly outperformed the market. Most importantly, we have achieved profitable growth despite the inflation and especially the increased personnel costs and high energy costs. This is a truly remarkable achievement by our leaders and all employees.\n\n#### As you can see, dear shareholders, your company fared remarkably well in 2023.\n\nIn an impressive manner, the fiscal year ended as well as the new fiscal year we have just entered show that for our customers, we are THE recognised IT partner for the future. Moreover, we have further expanded our lead as Germany's largest system house. We have again demonstrated the remarkable crisis resilience of our business model in a challenging setting, balancing any imbalances in individual country markets, customer segments and business segments as well as fluctuations in, and between, the segments.\n\n#### Companies as well as public administrations are well aware that digitalisation is a key factor for future sustainable success.\n\nTherefore, we look at the current 2024 fiscal year with optimism, knowing that our positioning is outstanding. We benefit from our long-standing experience and the proven success of our service offerings, which help our customers to drive digitalisation and achieve success through the systematic use of IT.\n\nBechtle Annual Report 2023\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2024, we again plan to outperform the market in addressing the high demand for projects and services related to the digital transformation of our customers and gain further market shares, both organically and inorganically. For about 30 years, acquisitions have been part of Bechtle's growth strategy. Last year, we again successfully gained a greater foothold in six European countries: Germany, France, the UK, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Spain. Thus, a total of seven highly successful companies became part of the Bechtle Group. These companies contribute to our progress in future-oriented business fields such as artificial intelligence and IT security, both in geographical terms and with regard to the subject areas covered.\n\n#### In conclusion, I would like to touch on the latest changes in the Executive Board:\n\nFor an unusually long stretch of 14 years, Bechtle did not see any changes in the Executive Board. This continuity is also an expression of stability, reliability and great attachment. We were very pleased to smoothly restaff the position of our esteemed colleague Jürgen Schäfer with Konstantin Ebert, a colleague from our own ranks. As of 1 January 2024, Konstantin Eber took over the responsibility for the IT E-Commerce segment. Only one month later, our new colleague Antje Leminsky was placed in charge of logistics, procurement, partner management, financial services and sustainability management. Accordingly, your company is now headed by four people who represent a very balanced mix of long-standing experience and a fresh perspective.\n\nTogether, we are ready to face this year's doubtlessly formidable challenges with zest and optimism. Trusting in Bechtle and its workforce, we are convinced that we will again be able to leverage existing growth impulses for above-market growth in 2024.\n\n### Knowing our strengths, our goal for 2024 is to again achieve significant growth, while keeping our group margin at least at the prior-year level.\n\nCurrently, we expect the first half of the year to be rather restrained, though we anticipate more economic tailwinds for our business starting from the middle of the year. In 2024, we will continue to pursue our European acquisition strategy. Factors such as our strong cash flow and the successful placement of a convertible bond in the fiscal year ended provide us with an excellent financial basis for further organic growth as well as growth through acquisitions.\n\nWe are proud of what we have achieved so far, and we are looking forward to the great achievements that lie ahead of us. As we move forward, the commitment and skills of our outstanding team imbue us with confidence.\n\nOn behalf of the entire Executive Board, I would like to thank you, dear shareholders, for your trust. I hope that you will stay with us and continue to be part of Bechtle's success story!\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRues Ole of\n\nDr. Thomas Olemotz Chairman of the Executive Board (CEO)\n\nNeckarsulm, 11 March 2024\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-11-0\"></span>DR.

However, with regard to Bechtle AG, we are pleased to confirm that we successfully mastered this difficult year. In 2023, the business volume, revenue and EBT each experienced growth of about 7 per cent. Bechtle AG therefore continued on its growth path despite the more challenging conditions. Once again, we saw evidence of the resilience of our business model and the strength of networked decentralisation, coupled with an ever more important level of internationalism. Moreover, we have benefited from the steady expansion of our range of target customer groups over the years. IT is a future-oriented market. Although our medium-sized customers, in particular, were somewhat more hesitant to invest in 2023, these investments were merely postponed – they are sure to come. After all, every enterprise and every public institution needs to invest in IT in order to be ready for the future. As an IT partner for tomorrow, Bechtle is well prepared for successful further development. Within the scope of its duties, the Supervisory Board will continue to help shape the company's successful development responsibly and systematically.\n\nIn 2023, the Supervisory Board again meticulously performed all its audit and controlling duties pursuant to law and the Articles of Incorporation. The Supervisory Board regularly provided the Executive Board with advice concerning the administration of the group and closely monitored and supported the company's management and development. In this context, the two boards always cooperated in an open and constructive manner.\n\nThe Executive Board regularly informed the Supervisory Board about all aspects significant to the company in a prompt and comprehensive manner. This included the status of the roll-out of the Vision 2030, the Sustainability Strategy, the further development of the Executive Board and management organisation, the group's business performance, possible acquisitions (especially also in relation to the expanded acquisition strategy), the financing of acquisitions and of the daily business, the tense macroeconomic situation and its effects on the realisation of business volume and revenue, future investments, location-related issues, opportunity and risk management, the risk situation as well as basic issues related to the corporate planning and management.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Chairman of the Executive Board, in particular, maintained close contact with individual Supervisory Board members, primarily with the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, even outside the regular meetings. Additionally, the Executive Board informed the Supervisory Board as a whole about key operational indicators, the implementation of business plans and the employment situation of the group, segments and all major subsidiaries on a monthly basis. At quarterly meetings, we also intensively elaborated on the respective past quarter and the short and medium-term perspectives.\n\nAt its meetings, the Supervisory Board regularly looked into the business performance of the group as well as the assets and financial position and the implementation of the corporate strategy. Moreover, we continually dealt with the risk situation – especially also in connection with the global hotspots and the related, tense macroeconomic situation – and actively participated in the further development of the control and risk management system of Bechtle AG.\n\nThanks to the timely and detailed information received from the Executive Board and its own audits, the Supervisory Board was able to comply fully with its monitoring and consulting duties. We confirm that the Executive Board has acted lawfully, correctly and economically in every respect. The Executive Board regularly consulted the legal and compliance department as well as group controlling and actively used the risk management system.\n\nBechtle AG supports the members of the Supervisory Board that have been elected by the shareholders or employees in fulfilling their duties and with respect to training measures. In the reporting period, the Supervisory Board received training on sustainability, on Executive Board compensation and on the reporting obligations in these areas. In the reporting period, some members of the Supervisory Board also took part in various training measures in the fields of corporate governance, ESG (environmental, social, governance), AI (artificial intelligence), risk management and employee share ownership plans.\n\n#### MEETINGS AND CENTRAL ISSUES\n\nIn the reporting period, the Supervisory Board held eight plenary sessions in person: on 2 February, 15 March (balance sheet meeting for the annual and consolidated financial statements for 2022), 20 April, 25 May, 26 July, 27 July, 27 October and 21 December 2023. Meeting attendance was as follows:\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                         | 02.02 | 15.03 | 20.04 | 25.05 | 26.07 | 27.07 | 27.10 | 21.12 | Meeting attendance |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------------------|\n| Shareholder representatives             |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |                    |\n| Kurt Dobitsch                           | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Dr. Lars Grünert                        | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     |       | 87.5%              |\n| Prof. Dr. Thomas Hess                   | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Elke Reichart                           | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Sandra Stegmann                         | •     |       | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Klaus Straub (since 25 May 2023)        |       |       |       | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Elmar König (since 25 May 2023)         |       |       |       | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Klaus Winkler                           | •     |       |       | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Employee representatives                |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |                    |\n| Julia Böttcher (since 25 May 2023)      |       |       |       | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Christian Deppisch (since 25 May 2023)  |       |       |       | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Uli Drautz                              | •     |       | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Daniela Eberle                          |       | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Christine Muhr (since 25 May 2023)      |       |       |       | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Anastasia Polidoros (until 25 May 2023) |       | •     | •     |       |       |       |       |       | 75%                |\n| Julia Randelshofer (since 25 May 2023)  |       |       |       | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Anton Samija                            | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | •     | 100%               |\n| Volker Strohfeld (until 25 May 2023)    | •     | •     | •     |       |       |       |       | •     | 100%               |\n| Michael Unser                           |       | •     | •     |       |       |       | •     | •     | 75%                |\n\nApart from the resolutions adopted at the meetings, the Supervisory Board or its committees also adopted resolutions via circular procedure where relevant, in particular in urgent cases. We discussed all measures and transactions that required the approval of the Supervisory Board or its committees in detail at Supervisory Board and committee meetings. At its balance sheet meeting on 15 March 2023, the Supervisory Board approved the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements of the prior year (thereby adopting the annual financial statements) and accepted the Executive Board's proposal concerning the appropriation of profits and the business planning for 2023.\n\nIn the past fiscal year, the most important subjects discussed included the following:\n\n- � The group's short-term strategy against the backdrop of the tense macroeconomic situation, its medium-to long-term strategy especially with a view to the clouds and managed services business, new business opportunities and the expansion of the M&A strategy in the course of consistent internationalisation as well as the targets achieved in relation to the strategy roll-out\n- � The economic development of the group, especially in the face of the challenging framework conditions\n- � The further development of the Executive Board organisation, the governance structure and the succession planning\n- � The Executive Board compensation system and the Executive Board compensation\n- � Progress in the reduction of the capital commitment\n- � Plans for specific acquisitions\n- � Financing matters in the group, especially the issuance of a convertible bond\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n- � The organisation of the Supervisory Board work, especially in relation to the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (DCGK)\n- � The implementation of the Sustainability and Climate Protection Strategy and of the non-financial group statement\n- � The internal audit and risk management system\n\nSuggestions of shareholder representatives and proxy advisors were actively made use of, and extensive work was done to implement them in the compensation system. This included the introduction of a fully share-based long-term compensation component as a new feature from 2024 and increased transparency of the reporting on the variable income components of the Executive Board. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board formed a nomination committee for the first time. The Supervisory Board is planning further development steps in the future.\n\n#### S TA F F I N G O F T H E S U P E R V I S O R Y B O A R D A N D E X E C U T I V E B O A R D\n\nAt the end of 2023 there was a staff change in the Executive Board of Bechtle AG. On 27 December 2023, Jürgen Schäfer stepped down from the Executive Board after more than 30 years of successful work for Bechtle. We are greatly indebted to Jürgen Schäfer for his outstanding performance and successful work. His responsibilities will be taken over by Konstantin Ebert, who previously served as Executive Vice President in the IT E-Commerce segment for France, Benelux and the United Kingdom.\n\nAs of 1 February 2024, the Supervisory Board appointed Antje Leminsky to the Executive Board. She will take over responsibility for logistics, procurement and partner management as well as financial services and sustainability management, which were previously taken care of by Dr. Thomas Olemotz. The Executive Board of Bechtle AG therefore now comprises four persons. Antje Leminsky most recently served as Vice Chairwoman of the Executive Board of the measuring technology manufacturer, Testo and previously for eight years as member of the Executive Board of the listed financial service provider, Grenke AG, first as CIO and then as Chairwoman of the Executive Board.\n\nIn 2023, Supervisory Board elections were due. As Bechtle had exceeded the threshold of 10,000 employees in Germany, the law required the Supervisory Board to be expanded from 12 to 16 members. On the shareholder side, the Annual General Meeting re-elected all six previous members. Klaus Straub, businessman and former CIO of BMW AG, and Elmar König, former Executive Vice President of Bechtle AG, were newly elected. Julia Böttcher, Christian Deppisch, Christine Muhr and Julia Randelshofer were newly elected on the employee side. Anastasia Polidoros and Volker Strohfeld departed from the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board thanks both of them for the good cooperation over the years.\n\n#### COMMITTEE WORK\n\nTo fulfil its duties, the Supervisory Board has formed three committees: the audit committee, the personnel committee and the arbitration committee. In its meeting on 21 December 2023, the Supervisory Board also decided to set up a nomination committee.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                 | 01.02 | 14.03 | 10.05 | 25.07 | 10.08 | 26.10 | 09.11 | 30.11 | 01.12 | Meeting attendance |\n|-----------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------------------|\n| Kurt Dobitsch   | ●     | ●     |       |       | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | 88.9%              |\n| Sandra Stegmann | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | 100%               |\n\nKlaus Winkler 100% Uli Drautz 100% Daniela Eberle 100%\n\nThe audit committee came together on 1 February, 14 March, 25 July, 26 October, 30 November and 1 December 2023. Additionally, it held telephone conferences prior to the interim reports of Bechtle AG on 10 May, 10 August and 9 November 2023. Meeting attendance was as follows:\n\nIn 2023, the audit committee dealt with transactions that require approval, especially acquisition plans, location-related issues, long-term contracts and the issuance of a convertible bond for the first time. Other subjects discussed included the interim financial reports, the revenue and earnings performance under the difficult framework conditions, the development of the cash flow and of the working capital as well as their further optimisation, the preliminary audits of the annual and consolidated financial statements, the non-financial group statement and the proposal for the appropriation of profits, the review of the internal control and risk management system and the expansion with the identification and assessment of the sustainability risks according to the requirements of the German Corporate Governance Code (DCGK) within the scope of the sustainability risk management. The meetings also focused on the monitoring of the auditor's independence, the definition of the main issues to be audited, the agreement of the audit fee, the corporate governance and the selection of the auditor for the annual and consolidated financial statements for 2023 and subsequent years.\n\nIn 2023, the personnel committee came together twelve times in person: on 30 January, 9 March, 13 March, 30 March, 23 May, 13 July, 18 September, 19 October, 9 November, 15 November, 13 December and 19 December. Meeting attendance was as follows:\n\n|                       | 30.01 | 09.03 | 13.03 | 30.03 | 23.05 | 13.07 | 18.09 | 19.10 | 09.11 | 15.11 | 13.12 | 19.12 | Meeting attendance |\n|-----------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------------------|\n| Prof. Dr. Thomas Hess | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | 100%               |\n| Klaus Winkler         | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | 100%               |\n| Uli Drautz            | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | ●     | 100%               |\n\nThe meetings of the personnel committee primarily focused on proposals to the Supervisory Board regarding the revision of the compensation system of the Executive Board, the compensation report, the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (DCGK), the restaffing of the Executive Board, the restaffing of some Executive Vice President and Vice President positions, the further development of the management organisation and the employment contracts with Executive Board members and Executive Vice Presidents.\n\nThe arbitration committee pursuant to Section 27 (3) of the German Co-determination Act (MitbestG) was not convened in 2023.\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly and meticulously conducts a self-assessment of its activity with the support of Deutsche Schutzvereinigung für Wertpapierbesitz e.V. The self-assessment was last conducted in 2022. Based on recommendations from the Supervisory Board, action recommendations are developed, presented at the plenary meeting and, after intensive review, included in the work of the Supervisory Board. We consistently monitor the implementation of these recommendations in our Supervisory Board. The basic results of past self-assessments revealed that the workflows and processes in the Supervisory Board are efficient and target-oriented.\n\n#### CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND DECLARATION OF CONFORMITY\n\nIn the reporting period, we intensively examined the set of rules of the German Corporate Governance Code (DCGK) and, in doing so, identified optimisation potential. To ensure compliance with DCGK, we checked the implementation of the recommendations. Together with the Executive Board, we issued the Declaration of Conformity pursuant to Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in January 2023 and again on 2 February 2024. Deviations from the recommendations of the Government Commission are explained in detail in the Declaration of Conformity. All Declarations of Conformity of the last five years and other documents concerning the corporate governance have been, and continue to be, made permanently available to the shareholders on the company's website. Bechtle's Corporate Governance Statement is the central document concerning the corporate governance. In the fiscal year ended, no conflicts of interest of Executive Board or Supervisory Board members arose that, according to the code, would have had to be disclosed to the plenum without delay and about which the Annual General Meeting would have had to be informed.\n\n#### AUDIT OF THE ANNUAL AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2023\n\nThe Annual General Meeting appointed Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Stuttgart, as auditor of the annual and consolidated financial statements for the 2023 fiscal year. Following the commissioning by the Supervisory Board, the auditor audited the annual financial statements of Bechtle AG, the consolidated financial statements and the consolidated management reports of Bechtle AG and of the Bechtle Group for the 2023 fiscal year, including the accounts as well as the risk management and early risk detection system, with unqualified auditor's opinions. The audit also included the implemented monitoring system for early identification of risks and the internal audit and risk management system with respect to the accounting process. The auditor has confirmed that the installed systems are suitable for identifying developments endangering the company's going concern at an early stage.\n\nThe documents related to the financial statements, the proposal of the Executive Board for the appropriation of profits and the auditor's audit reports (including the opinion on the compensation report) were duly sent to the members of the Supervisory Board and discussed in detail in the audit committee and in the board as a whole. The auditor of the annual and consolidated financial statements also participated in the meeting of the audit committee on 12 March 2024 and in the balance sheet meeting on 13 March 2024. The auditor reported in detail on the material results of the audit and answered all questions of the Supervisory Board comprehensively.\n\n[See Declaration of Conformity,](https://www.bechtle.com/corporate-governance) [bechtle.com/](https://www.bechtle.com/corporate-governance) [corporate-governance](https://www.bechtle.com/corporate-governance)\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing its own review of the annual financial statements, the consolidated financial statements and the consolidated management report, the Supervisory Board approved the results of the audit conducted by the auditor. According to the final result of its audit, there were no objections. At the balance sheet meeting on 13 March 2024, the Supervisory Board thus approved the annual financial statements and the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the recommendation of the audit committee, thereby adopting the annual financial statements pursuant to Section 172 (1) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The Supervisory Board agreed to the Executive Board's proposal for the appropriation of the net profit and payment of a dividend of €0.70 per share. We approve the consolidated management report of the Executive Board and consider the proposal for the appropriation of profits to be appropriate.\n\nThe Executive Board and the Supervisory Board have prepared the compensation report in accordance with Section 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The auditor has audited the compensation report pursuant to Section 162 (3) sentence 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) as to whether it contains the disclosures pursuant to Section 162 (1) and (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).\n\nThe Supervisory Board also audited and comprehensively discussed the non-financial group statement of Bechtle AG, which was prepared by the Executive Board, at the balance sheet meeting on 13 March 2024. The non-financial group statement was included in the management report as part of the Annual Report within the scope of the integrated reporting. The Executive Board explained the non-financial group report and answered the questions of the members of the Supervisory Board. The review conducted by the Supervisory Board did not give rise to any objections to the non-financial group report. The Supervisory Board agrees with the non-financial group report.\n\nAt the start of 2024, the basic economic conditions are still challenging. Nevertheless, we are optimistic with regard to the future, and we believe that the Bechtle Group will continue to develop well. This success is supported by our business model and, above all, by the people at Bechtle. The Supervisory Board would therefore like to express its sincere gratitude to all employees of the Bechtle Group in all 14 countries. The Supervisory Board will continue to accompany the development of Bechtle with great commitment in an advisory and controlling capacity.\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board\n\nKlaus Wiebe\n\nKlaus Winkler Chairman\n\nNeckarsulm, 13 March 2024\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-23-0\"></span>**SHARE**\n\nThe 2023 stock market year was surprisingly positive despite economic and geopolitical uncertainties and the resulting high volatility. All leading German indices recorded significant gains at the end of the year. The DAX even reached a new all-time high meanwhile. For the Bechtle shares the year was unsettled as well, but ultimately pleasing. A positive start was followed by price losses in the summer. As the year progressed, however, the share price rose again and even outperformed the benchmark indices. Our share closed the year up 37.3 per cent. Market capitalisation stood at €5.7 billion at the end of the year.\n\n#### STOCK MARKET\n\n**Successful stock market year with highs and lows.** Economic concerns, a high inflation rate, rising interest rates and geopolitical crises characterised the 2023 financial year. After a hopeful start to the new stock market year, a banking crisis caused turbulences in the spring. The DAX fell to 14,600 points. However, the leading index subsequently recovered and, after some fluctuations, climbed above the 16,000-point mark by the summer. The stock markets experienced their weakest phase of the year between August and the end of October. Economic and interest rate concerns persisted, and the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, and the consequences of this, put additional pressure on the market. The prospect of an interest rate reversal in the first half of 2024 brought about a turnaround from October. The leading German indices experienced a veritable year-end rally in the last two months of the reporting period. Meanwhile, the DAX reached a new all-time high and ended the year up 20.3 per cent. The TecDAX rose by 14.3 per cent over the course of the year, while the MDAX recorded an increase of 8.0 per cent.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n23.02.2024 **48,85 €**\n\n#### SHARE PERFORMANCE\n\n50,00\n\n45,00\n\n40,00\n\n**Bechtle share sees strong performance.** Despite a degree of volatility, the price of the Bechtle share developed extremely positively in the course of the reporting period. On 2 January 2023, our share started the new stock market year with a closing price of €32.68, the low for the reporting period. Like the leading indices, the share price initially climbed steadily and even outperformed its peers from February onwards. Our share price then fell in the spring, with prices returning to the level **22 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS REPORT OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD** of the benchmark indices. However, the Bechtle share was able to escape the negative development \nJan 23 Feb 23 Mär 23 Apr 23 Mai 23 Jun 23 Jul 23 Aug 23 Sep 23 Okt 23 Nov 23 Dez 23 Jan 24 Feb 24 annual high of €47.95 on 20 November 2023 in the wake of the year-end rally. The Bechtle share ended the stock market year at €45.39, up 37.3 per cent on the previous year's closing price. Our shares therefore performed significantly better than the benchmark indices. At the end of the year, market capitalisation stood at €5,719.1 million. In the MDAX ranking of Deutsche Börse, Bechtle occupied the 55th place (prior year: 61st place). In the TecDAX, our company was on the 9th place (prior year: 10th place). 35,00 30,00\n\nDIE BECHTLE AKTIE – KURSENTWICKLUNG JANUAR 2023 BIS FEBRUAR 2024 in €\n\nImage /page/24/Figure/3 description: This line graph shows the performance of the bechtle share from January 2023 to February 2024.

Dezember 2023\n\n**Long-term anchor shareholder.** With an interest of 35.02 per cent, the Schick family remains the largest shareholder of Bechtle AG. This figure also comprises the shares of Schick GmbH, of which Karin Schick is a partner, and shares belonging to her son. This also includes the shares of the Gerhard and Ilse Schick Foundation, which was established by Karin Schick in May 2022. We regard the Schick family as an anchor shareholder that holds its shares on a very long-term basis, thereby effectively ensuring high stability. As of the end of the reporting period, the free float amounted to 64.98 per cent. These shares are held by a wide spectrum of private and institutional investors in Germany and abroad.\n\nAKTIONÄRSSTRUKTUR in %\n\n35,02 Familie Schick davon Gerhard und Ilse Schick Stiftung 3,57 %  5,15 Flossbach v.

The reliability of the profit distribution policy is also evident from the continuous dividend increase.\n\nDespite the very challenging economic circumstances that persisted in 2023, Bechtle AG recorded pleasant results. Earnings after tax, which form the basis for the dividend distribution, increased by 5.7 per cent. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board have therefore agreed to propose a dividend of €0.70 per share to the Annual General Meeting for the 2023 fiscal year (previous year: €0.65). This would be the 14th increase in a row. Subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting, the dividend proposal corresponds to an increase in the dividend of 7.7 per cent. This means an increase in dividends that is slightly above the increase of the earnings after taxes. In this way, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board want to continue the shareholder-friendly dividend policy of Bechtle AG. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board also regard this increase as a sign of their confidence with regard to the further economic performance of Bechtle AG, especially in uncertain times.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the number of shares entitled to dividends was 126,000,000. This results in a total dividend payout of €88.2 million for the 2023 fiscal year. The dividend payout ratio would therefore amount to 33.2 per cent of consolidated earnings after taxes (previous year: 32.6 per cent). The dividend yield would be 1.5 per cent based on the year-end price of our share (previous year: 2.0 per cent).\n\n#### EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\n**Earnings per share 5.7 per cent above previous year.** The improvement of the operating earnings was accompanied by a corresponding rise in the earnings per share (EPS). With 126 million shares and earnings after tax of €265.5 million, EPS amounted to €2.11, some 5.7 per cent more than in the prior year (prior year: €1.99).\n\n#### SHARE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\nImage /page/27/Picture/5 description: The image shows a simple line drawing of an open book.

The aim of the capital measure was to finance further growth of the Bechtle Group in Germany and abroad, including through acquisitions. The basis for the use of this financing instrument was the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 15 June 2021 to issue convertible bonds and to exclude the subscription rights of existing shareholders. The convertible bond was offered exclusively to institutional investors outside the United States of America as part of an accelerated book-building process. UniCredit Bank and Commerzbank acted as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners for the transaction.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-28-0\"></span>ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING\n\n**On-site again.** The 23rd Annual General Meeting of Bechtle AG took place on 25 May 2023 at the Harmonie conference centre, in Heilbronn. It was held as an in-person event for the first time since the pandemic. Registered shareholders also had the opportunity to follow the Annual General Meeting live via an online portal and exercise their voting rights there. Around 80 per cent of the share capital participated in the voting. All agenda items were adopted with the required majority.\n\n#### CAPITAL MARKET\n\n**Close dialogue with the capital market.** We regard Bechtle's success as the result of a joint effort and trusting cooperation with our stakeholders. This cooperation takes place in accordance with the principles of openness and transparency and is shaped by the fundamental values anchored in our corporate culture. In their capacity as owners, our shareholders are among the most important stakeholders of our company. Therefore, one of the most important tasks of the financial communication is to include the stakeholders and engage in dialogue with them.\n\nIn the reporting period, 17 institutions were reporting on Bechtle in detailed studies and ad hoc anal-Xetra closing price data\n¹ As of the end of the year yses: AlsterResearch, Baader Bank, Bank of America, Berenberg, BNP Paribas Exane, Deutsche [bechtle.com/](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en/about-bechtle/investors/bechtle-share) Metzler, Oddo BHF, Quirin Privatbank, Stifel, UBS and Warburg Research. Bechtle pursues regular constructive dialogue with all institutions. Citi had to discontinue its coverage in July 2023 due to a lack of resources. In February 2024, Barclays initiated coverage, meaning that 18 banks are reporting on Bechtle at the time of publication of this Annual Report.\n\nVisits to the company's headquarters and participation in numerous conferences and roadshows allow both analysts and investors as well as us to engage in intensive dialogue. This underpins our open and continuous communication with our stakeholders. At a total of 16 roadshows and investor conferences held throughout 2023, we provided information about our company's economic situation, business strategy and outlook in individual and group discussions.\n\nbechtle.com/\nanalysts-recommendations\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonal contact with private investors is also very important to us. In 2023, we once again welcomed around 125 shareholders to the group headquarters in Neckarsulm for the shareholder days that have been very popular for many years. The evening events in the \"Bechtle Meets\" series, which is aimed in particular at young people interested in finance, were also very well received. Two events were organised in cooperation with finfluencers at the Bechtle Group headquarters in the reporting period. The communities had the opportunity to get to know our company, submit questions to both the IR team and to the finfluencers, and network among themselves.\n\n[See Imprint,](#page-293-0) [page 294](#page-293-0) We always endeavour to inform all capital market players in a transparent, comprehensive and timely manner about all significant events that take place in our company.

In particular, the aim here is to avoid repetitions in both reports and to increase workflow efficiency.\n\nIn this document, we also link our financial reporting with the key non-financial information. In this way, we illustrate the interrelationships between economic, ecological and social factors and their influence on our long-term corporate success. The combined management report in the Bechtle Annual Report 2023 also contains the combined non-financial statement (NFR) in accordance with Section § 315b (1) sentence 2 in conjunction with § 289 (2) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). In this way, Bechtle complies with its statutory obligation to disclose non-financial information pursuant to the German CSR Directive Implementation Act (CSR-RUG). The non-financial Group statement was not part of the assessment carried out in the context of the audit of the annual and Group financial statements by Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft. Passages referring exclusively to the NFR have been placed in green brackets. Passages forming part of the NFR which are also simultaneously disclosures typical for a management report have been placed in blue brackets. This is the last non-financial report in accordance with CSR-RUG; from the coming fiscal year, Bechtle will publish the legally required sustainability information in accordance with CSRD. The company is already preparing for this.\n\n**Use of frameworks.** In accordance with Section 289d HGB, Bechtle has been using the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework, \"Core\" option, for sustainability reporting since the 2019 reporting period. For the 2023 fiscal year, we have been using the GRI Standards valid since 1 January 2023.\n\n[See Materiality,](#page-52-0) [page 53f](#page-52-0)\n\nMarking NFR\n\nMarking NFR/ typical for a management report\n\n> **Content, reporting period and limits.** The topics reported on are aligned with the principle of materiality in accordance with the GRI standards and Section 289c of the German Commercial Code (HGB).

IT is an integral and indispensable part of every business – whether private or commercial. This goes hand in hand with the great importance of modern and future-proof IT infrastructures – and a competent partner who supports and advises on the creation and operation of these complex infrastructures. This is precisely Bechtle's business model: As a vendor-independent solution provider with a comprehensive IT portfolio, we are the preferred IT partner for industry and the Public Sector.\n\n#### BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**One-stop shop.** With more than 100 system houses and IT E-Commerce companies in 14 countries, Bechtle is close to its customers and is one of Europe's leading IT companies. We also have a worldwide network of partners that fulfils the requirements of globally active customers. In its 40th year of existence, the IT company with headquarters in Neckarsulm still combines the strength and resilience of a financially sound international group with the proximity, personal care and flexibility of a regional service provider. A total of about 7,150 service employees, including certified specialists, system engineers and consultants, as well as around 4,200 sales employees work together on the business success of the Bechtle Group. We support more than 70,000 customers from trade and industry, the Public Sector and the financial market on their digital transformation journey and offer a comprehensive, cross-vendor portfolio of IT infrastructure and IT operation solutions.\n\n#### BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\n**Combined power.** Bechtle's business activity comprises two segments: the IT System House & Managed Services segment covers a range of services from the sale of hardware and software solutions, IT strategy consulting, IT infrastructure consulting, application solutions, project planning and implementation, system integration, maintenance and training to the provision of cloud and managed services, IT security services and artificial intelligence. We also offer all \"as-a-service\" models or the complete operation of customer IT.\n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe have bundled our trading business in IT E-Commerce, the second business segment. We offer our customers hardware and standard software as well as accompanying logistics services via telephone and Internet. In total, our product portfolio in this segment comprises around 36,000 products.\n\n#### IT SYSTEM HOUSE & MANAGED SERVICES\n\n**One-stop IT provider and system integrator.** With our service business, we are represented in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, Spain and the United Kingdom. Bechtle's range of services in this segment covers the entire IT value chain. By individually compiling an offer comprising various interlinked services and freely configurable service levels, Bechtle is able to develop a bespoke solution for every customer. The service and solution portfolio is subject to ongoing review and adaptation to market and customer requirements.\n\nImage /page/35/Picture/6 description: The image shows the text \"Personal contact on-site\" with a sun icon above it.\n\nFor our customers, most of whom have regional roots, it has always been important to have a personal contact person close by in order to overcome increasingly complex IT challenges. Our more than 100 regional system houses and their sales employees provide this personal connection. In the decentralised structure of Bechtle, proximity is a key criterion. Direct, usually long-term contact with customers helps sales staff to develop a trusting customer relationship. In this context, the ongoing training of our sales team plays a key role.\n\nOur service employees and certified specialists, system engineers and consultants offer customers specialist knowledge, a high level of detailed expertise, many years of IT project experience and rapid implementation of individual requirements in the realisation of services. IT business architects also provide support with customised concepts and IT road maps, laying the foundations for future-proof IT architectures. Bechtle has bundled specialist know-how on complex IT solution topics in almost 90 nationwide competence centres and passes this knowledge on in training courses. Numerous certifications from all renowned vendors guarantee the premium qualification of our services. The goal of our Service Factory is to achieve economies of scale through standardised services.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\nDriven by ever-increasing digitalisation, the market for IT solutions and services is subject to constant change. In addition to the traditional business areas, consumption-based and cloud-based procure- Partner for digitalisation ment models continue to gain in importance. These options for procuring IT infrastructure, platforms, software and applications as a subscription-based service are being utilised by a growing number of customers and are gradually becoming the standard. The use of these models depends on a functional multi-cloud architecture. In this domain, Bechtle offers its customers comprehensive care from the consulting and design stages to the implementation and operation. Our offering also includes additional services for the network infrastructure and security. Accordingly, we are consistently expanding our portfolio of \"as-a-service\" offerings, managed cloud services and multi-cloud services.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is one of the topics of the future in the entire IT industry and therefore also at Bechtle. Although the technology is still at the beginning of its development in many respects, [ip.ai](http://ip.ai) Bechtle sees itself already well positioned here with the investment in PLANET AI and its involvement in the AI ecosystem Ipai. Other Bechtle Group companies also already offer various services with AI components. In the medium and long term, AI will further increase the demand for IT solution partners such as Bechtle.\n\nImage /page/36/Picture/3 description: Two women are sitting on a modular seating arrangement in a well-lit room.

With its house brand, Bechtle is currently represented in 14 European countries and has achieved a strong competitive position in all markets. The Bechtle Group is also active with the brands Inmac Wstore and Bechtle Comsoft in France and with ARP in the Netherlands. A new addition in the reporting period was Tangible Benefit in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe business in the IT E-Commerce segment is guided by two basic principles: On the one hand, there is the direct personal contact between the sales staff and the customer, which is ensured through active contact by telephone or videoconferencing. Sales plays a key role in realising business volumes by acquiring new customers and expanding business with existing customers. Especially customers with complex requirements benefit from the personal contacts, who offer individual solutions that are tailored to customer needs.\n\nLean processes Fulfilment principle On the other hand, the segment has established highly process-controlled, lean order processing workflows that are crucial to the success of the E-Commerce segment. To a certain extent, the underlying processes are even part of the actual service. For example, a large number of orders in IT E-Commerce are processed according to the fulfilment principle: Bechtle forwards incoming purchase orders directly to vendors or distributors, who then ship the goods to the customers on behalf of Bechtle. Bechtle ensures the quality of dispatch, which is also determined by speed, through agreements with partners and daily quality checks. The customer benefits in numerous respects: the networking of the online shops with the stocks of vendors and distributors enables high availability and up-to-date information. The delivery time, too, is aligned with customer needs: orders are usually delivered within 24 to 48 hours. Lean processes also ensure low process costs. The customer thus benefits from competitive prices, while Bechtle is still able to earn an attractive margin. We also keep stock levels low on the basis of the fulfilment principle, thereby reducing the risk of devaluations of IT products, which are characterised by very short innovation cycles. During the first half of 2023, the last remaining delivery difficulties, which had posed major challenges for the IT market in the previous two years, were finally overcome. This means that supply availability has returned to the high level seen before the outbreak of the pandemic and is therefore in line with the long-term average.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-38-0\"></span>CROSS-SEGMENT ACTIVITIES\n\n**Growing international presence.** In the past, Bechtle was present with both its operating segments only in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In 2022, the company crossed the borders of the DACH region for the first time with the IT System House & Managed Services segment and expanded its presence to other European countries, namely the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. France and Spain were added by acquisitions in the reporting period. In these countries, Bechtle addresses the market in both segments in order to increase the market penetration and the market share. Our extended acquisition strategy envisages a future presence with system house activities and services in other European countries in addition to the existing e-commerce companies.\n\nMany customers attach great importance to homogeneous IT landscapes across their own international locations. Therefore, internal Bechtle units focus on ensuring a global roll-out that is tailored to the customer's needs and preferences. With its uniform, central processes and service levels, Bechtle is well prepared for this task. Personal contacts of Bechtle are available in all 14 European countries in which Bechtle is present. We also work with the professional IT partners of our Global IT Alliance (GITA) worldwide.\n\n**Public Sector clients.** For many years, Bechtle has been intensively focusing on Public Sector clients. A special characteristic of this business lies in the special requirements of the tendering procedures. To ensure professional processing of these tenders, we have established the central Public Sector division as an internal service unit. This division supports the international local units in processing public tenders. For some time now, we have observed an increasing market consolidation trend among these clients, i.e. individual clients are forming joint buying centres. As a result, the tender volumes are going up, a development that benefits Bechtle – as one of Europe's leading market players with dedicated teams for the successful processing of even larger tenders – more than many of its competitors.\n\n**#OneBechtle.** Apart from the internal promise to function as a jointly operating unit, this concept also embodies the strategic intention of intensifying cooperation between the two segments by means Synergy effects of a multichannel approach, thus further interlocking them for synergy effects. On 1 January 2024, the pilot project \"OneBechtle AT\" that started in 2022 was implemented following a successful pilot phase. The merger of the Austrian Bechtle IT system houses with the sister company Bechtle direct Austria was finalised under the name Bechtle Austria GmbH. The two specialists in the aforementioned country market were also merged, thereby pooling their expertise. The aim is to serve customers holistically, regardless of the segment, thereby realising synergy effects and increasing customer penetration. In the medium term, the idea behind this combination could also be applied in the German and Swiss national markets.\n\n[See chapter](#page-48-0)  [Corporate culture,](#page-48-0)  [strategy and](#page-48-0)  [governance,](#page-48-0)  [page 49](#page-48-0)\n\n[gita.com](http://gita.com)\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-39-0\"></span>**Belgium United.** Similarly, the \"Belgium United\" project aims to enable closer collaboration between the existing units under a joint management. As of 31 December 2023, various departments, such as sales and marketing, were already managed centrally. This measure has made it possible to reduce complexity, make better use of resources, optimise cooperation and increase market presence vis-àvis both customers and suppliers.\n\n[bechtle.com](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en/)\n\n**Bechtle.com.** At this address, we present our customers with a cross-segment digital business platform that covers the entire range of our service and solution portfolio. We are now able to address every prospective and existing customer holistically and systematically offer additional solutions. Bechtle.com will be continuously expanded over the next few years in order to underpin Bechtle's multichannel approach. The digital business platform stands for the efficient procurement of IT infrastructure and IT services from a single source. In addition, bechtle.com offers customers and all other stakeholders information on all aspects of IT and thus serves as a knowledge platform. Digital Business Services – a unit that bundles business competencies and strategies – is responsible for the establishment and further development of the business. The unit's task is to connect customers and Bechtle digitally.\n\n#### [bechtle.com/remarketing](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en/it-services/bechtle-remarketing)\n\n**Remarketing.** Product life cycles for IT products are becoming ever shorter, especially due to innovations and further developments. This is why our company established Bechtle Remarketing GmbH back in 2012 – a business unit dedicated to topics related to the end of a product life cycle. In this context, information security, data protection and the responsible use of resources are key aspects. Our specialists take care of the secure deletion of company data and the resale of old devices or environmentally friendly disposal. Bechtle thus offers complete life-cycle support for IT hardware at two of its own locations.\n\nechtle.com/articona\n\n**Own brand ARTICONA.** The custom brand ARTICONA supplements Bechtle's product portfolio, especially with peripheral products. The product range includes IT accessories and extends from [bechtle.com/articona](https://www.bechtle.com/marken/articona) input devices such as keyboards and mice to various cables and adapters, storage devices, printer cartridges and even e-car accessories. The products are often offered as cross-selling products or as an alternative to comparable branded products.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### P R O C U R E M E N T **refurbishing/**\n\n**produktion endprodukt** \n\nWERTSCHÖPFUNGSKETTE IM BEREICH HARDWARE\n\n**Schmelze**\n\n**hersteller/ Distributor**\n\nAs a reliable and responsible IT partner, it is particularly important to us that basic labour, social and environmental standards are observed in the manufacture and transport of the IT hardware and software sold by Bechtle and in the provision of IT services. We are committed to the universal principles of the UN Global Compact and other internationally recognised environmental and human rights [globalcompact.de/en](https://www.globalcompact.de/en) standards. We fulfil this responsibility at our own locations and expect the same from our business partners.

Around 36,000 hardware and software products are available via IT system houses, the online shop and customised procurement platforms. We generate the largest share of our business volume through hardware, which is why we are focusing on this area when presenting the value chain.\n\nImage /page/40/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram of a production process. The process starts with \"Mine\", then goes to \"Smelter\", \"Metal processing\", and \"Component production\". From \"Component production\", the process goes to \"Bechtle\" and \"Customer/use\". From \"Customer/use\", the process goes to \"Reuse of the recycled raw materials\" and \"Refurbishing/reuse\". From \"Refurbishing/reuse\", the process goes to \"Recycling and disposal of components that cannot be used\". The process also includes \"Production of the final product\" and \"Manufacturer/distributor\".\n\n#### VALUE CHAIN IN THE HARDWARE SECTOR\n\ndelivery route\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nrecycled and any residual waste is disposed of appropriately.\n\n<span id=\"page-41-0\"></span>Raw materials such as rare-earth elements, copper, gold and lithium are mined and then processed in smelters. Raw materials and metals are processed in such a way that they can be used for the production of individual components. In production, the components are manufactured into the end product, which is delivered to Bechtle by one of our approximately 270 manufacturing partners or via distributors. In one of Bechtle's warehouses, orders are bundled according to customer requirements or devices are equipped with software ready for use. Some products are shipped directly to customers. The utilisation of products by our customers represents the longest phase of the value chain. After hardware has been used by customers, a large portion of it can be refurbished and placed back\n\n**Close cooperation with our partners.** As a trading partner, our influence on the upstream and downstream supply chain is limited, but we work closely and trustfully with our direct suppliers (Tier 1) on the topic of sustainability. During the reporting period, a \"Manufacturer's Sustainability Day\" was held at the Group headquarters for the first time, at which ten selected manufacturing part-\n\nners presented sustainable IT products – from PC mice to conference systems.\n\ninto the use cycle via Bechtle Remarketing. If hardware is no longer fit for use, useful components are\n\nDuring that same reporting period, the manufacturer HP awarded 5-Star Catalyst Partner status to Bechtle Poland. Bechtle Germany, Italy and the Czech Republic have maintained their 4-Star status. Previously, the Bechtle units had successfully participated in an assessment in relation to the sustainability programme HP Amplify Impact. In subsequent workshops, the teams worked together on new project ideas. More than 100 employees took part in the sustainability training offered by HP on-site and digitally. Other Bechtle companies have also qualified for the programme.\n\n[corporate-governance](http://bechtle.com/corporate-governance)\n\n**Responsible purchasing.** In 2022, we revised the key points of the international standards on the environment and human rights that are important to us and integrated them into the Bechtle Supplier [bechtle.com/](http://bechtle.com/corporate-governance) Code of Conduct. We expect our suppliers to sign it. The new edition of the code also fulfils the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (LkSG). We began rolling out this updated version in the reporting period. It is to be signed successively by all partners.\n\n> As of 31 December 2023, 199 suppliers and manufacturers had signed the previous version of the Bechtle Supplier Code of Conduct. A total of 40 partners have presented their own policies, which overlap with our own code in all essential respects. In total, this accounts for 94.9 per cent of the purchasing volume.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                                          | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Number of suppliers and manufacturers                                    | 199  | 190  | 189  | 150  | 121  |\n| Number of suppliers and manufacturers<br>that submitted comparable codes | 40   | 59   | 39   | 51   | 23   |\n| Percentage of codes signed and submitted<br>in % of purchasing volume    | 94.9 | 94   | 93   | 93.1 | 90.6 |\n\n#### <span id=\"page-42-0\"></span>SIGNING THE BECHTLE SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT (PREVIOUS VERSION)\n\nSince 2022, we have been working with the EcoVadis supplier assessment tool, which enables us to track our suppliers' compliance with social and environmental standards using a document-based audit. By the end of 2023, the Sustainable Procurement team in the Vendor Management department was able to include suppliers that account for over 92 per cent of our purchasing volume in the assessment.\n\nBechtle's own brand ARTICONA offers a broad portfolio of IT accessories such as keyboards, cables, plugs and safety protection films for monitors. Based on the previous version of the Bechtle Supplier Code of Conduct, ARTICONA also presented its suppliers with a code, which all suppliers had signed by the reporting date of 31 December 2023.\n\nIn addition, over 200 ARTICONA products, such as notebook cases, backpacks, sleeves, smartphone cases and patch cables, now bear the Global Recycled Standard (GRS) seal. Products that are GRS certified contain recycled materials that have been independently verified at every stage of the supply chain – from the source to the end product. All certified ARTICONA products are made entirely from recycled materials.\n\n#### MARKETS\n\n**Broad positioning in terms of customer sizes and sectors.** We endeavour to identify the best possible IT solution to address the needs of each and every customer. And we have gained a very high level of expertise when it comes to servicing different customer groups. Even though our core target group is the upper SME market, we are also increasingly successful in the large company sector. Usually, we define our customers on the basis of the number of PC workspaces (or seats). And our customer group generally ranges from 50 to upwards of 10,000 PC workspaces.\n\nBechtle does not usually focus on individual industries. Our customers, therefore, include companies from all branches of industry, and we address each customer group in a different way. In view of the special requirements of the tendering procedures of Public Sector customers, we have introduced a more focused and hence individual approach to these customers. In this role, the central Public Sector division, as an internal service unit, supports the local entities when it comes to processing public invitations to tender.\n\nImage /page/42/Picture/9 description: The image shows a sun icon above the text \"Broad customer base\".\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-43-0\"></span>Stand: 31.

Moreover, our extended acquisition strategy envisages a future presence with system integration activities and services in other European countries in which we are already active with our trading business. With our own central Bechtle units, and with the support of partner companies of the Global IT Alliance (GITA) launched in 2014, we also support customers outside Europe.\n\n#### COMPETITIVE POSITION\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/6 description: The image contains the text \"bitkom.org/EN\" and a simple graphic above it that resembles a rounded rectangle with a vertical line extending from its top.\n\n**Germany's largest system house.** The IT market in Germany is highly fragmented. According to the German Federal Statistical Office, almost 93,000 IT companies in Germany offer products and services in the areas of IT hardware, software and IT services. These IT companies vary greatly with regard to their size, service spectrum and specialisation. Just over 80,000 of these IT companies only operate locally, and they generate revenue of no more than €1 million. Almost 12,000 companies generate annual revenue of up to €50 million. According to the German Federal Statistical Office, the group of medium-sized IT companies generating annual revenues of €50 to €250 million includes less than 300 companies. Only 55 companies, including Bechtle, are on the list of the largest companies active in Germany.\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/8 description: The image shows the text \"Sustainable leadership\" in a bold, sans-serif font. To the right of the text is a simple line drawing of a sun.\n\nIn Germany, Bechtle enjoys an excellent market position. In the ranking of the largest system houses, which was prepared by the professional publisher \"ChannelPartner\", our company was once again the number one in 2023, measured by domestic revenue.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-44-0\"></span>According to the industry association bitkom, the total volume of the German IT market (IT hardware, software and IT services) in 2023 amounted to €142.9 billion (prior year: €139.8 billion). With its reported annual business volume of around €4.7 billion in Germany in 2023, Bechtle's market share amounts to more than 3 per cent. Germany's ten largest system houses, which the professional publisher \"ChannelPartner\" assesses every year, jointly account for a market share of about 12 per cent. These figures show how fragmented the German IT market continues to be. As a group, small and medium-sized companies still account for the largest market share by far. Despite the ongoing consolidation pressure, this situation is unlikely to change in the medium term.\n\n#### RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n**Range of offers expanded with research into artificial intelligence.** As a pure service and trading company, Bechtle has previously only provided development services for software solutions and applications for its own purposes and as part of individual customer projects. The development costs incurred in the 2023 fiscal year were insignificant. The expenses for development amounted to approximately €11 million, about €4 million of which were capitalised. In the field of application solutions, we not only design, develop and implement software on behalf of customers, but also cover special industry requirements where required. Since the reporting period, Bechtle has also been active in the area of research for the first time. By acquiring a stake in PLANET AI, we are expanding our portfolio to include AI solutions in the area of intelligent document analysis. This acquisition means that more than 40 research and development specialists now complement our workforce.\n\n**MODUS Consult.** MODUS Consult GmbH is involved in development activities that are somewhat more significant. Among other things, it develops ERP solutions based on Microsoft Dynamics 365 for the food and beverage industry, mechanical and plant engineering, the plastics and metal industry and the furniture industry, as well as for wholesale companies. In customer projects, solutions are also implemented in the areas of Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Enterprise Content Management (ECM) and Business Intelligence (BI).\n\nIn addition to individual development work in customer projects, we have also carried out development work to update various industry solutions. To safeguard our ability to supply in future, these solutions have been converted for the next generation of Microsoft's cloud ERP suites. Thanks to the expansion of our SharePoint portfolio and integration of the processes with the Microsoft Power Platform, we can now offer the entire Microsoft Platform, including Office 365 and Microsoft Teams, to medium-sized companies.\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the ECM projects, we use ELO and SharePoint products. In this area, MODUS Consult has also developed its own standard modules, which are deployed or customised in customer projects. This includes, above all, a universal document connector that ensures more interoperability.\n\nFurthermore, MODUS Consult assists customers in pure CRM projects, which are already highly cloud-oriented. The CRM portfolio includes marketing solutions as well as sales, service, user portal and support functions. MODUS Consult covers the area of business intelligence with Power BI.\n\n**PLANET AI.** In addition to providing other development services, PLANET AI GmbH focuses on intensive research in the area of artificial intelligence. At the core of this research is PLANETBRAIN. This is an AI platform with patented core technology, which forms the basis for the development of IDA (Intelligent Document Analysis). Another integral component of PLANETBRAIN is the perceptionmatrix technology, which enables the high-precision analysis of text, images and speech and, therefore, fundamentally changes data acquisition and processing. For example, handwritten and typewritten documents, receipts and texts can be processed automatically, document types classified and information extracted. Intelligent document analysis is already being used in various areas. These include logistics, traffic monitoring, banking, insurance, healthcare and archives.\n\nPLANET AI's international research collaborations with universities and research institutions are a key element of these activities. Joint research, close collaboration and the continuous exchange of knowledge and technological advances make a significant contribution towards strengthening the research and development of artificial intelligence.\n\n**In the future, artificial intelligence will make our operations even more efficient, leaving more time for personal exchange. Bechtle already provides plenty of opportunities in this area.** \n\nSigrid Gebhardt, HR Coordinator – Administration/Organisation, System House Stuttgart\n\nSteffen Kleindienst, Global Account Manager, System House Stuttgart\n\nAntje Keller, Communications & Change Office – Management Assistant, System House Stuttgart\n\nEmre Beydogan, Service Owner – Service Desk, System House Stuttgart\n\nfrom left to right\n\nImage /page/45/Picture/12 description: In an indoor shot, three people are standing and one person is sitting inside a small office space.

As such, our corporate culture plays an important role in the performance and motivation of each individual. The applied values at Bechtle provide all employees with a high degree of freedom, along with business responsibility. The long-term orientation of the strategy, underpinned by our vision, also brings with it a high degree of reliability. This is essential for employees, but also for customers, partners and the capital market. Because of this, our business is managed in the short, medium and long term using established systems and processes.\n\n### VISION AND STRATEGY\n\n**Corporate culture forms the basis.** The basic values of the Bechtle Group have remained unchanged for years. They are mentioned in the corporate philosophy, which is part of every employment contract. The four defining values are:\n\n- � Integrity\n- � Perseverance\n- � Reliability\n- � Enthusiasm\n\nThese basic values constitute a central element of our corporate culture. In conjunction with our internal management principles, our Code of Conduct, Vision 2030 and the Bechtle Sustainability and Climate Protection Strategy 2030, they underpin our long-term strategic objectives. They provide all employees and other stakeholders with guidance on efficient and sustainable corporate management and control. Entrepreneurial thinking and behaviour are also a fundamental part of our culture: Employees at Bechtle are given entrepreneurial responsibility at a very early stage – this is both a promise and an obligation.\n\n**Long-term orientation ensures sustainable success.** On the basis of the firmly established corporate culture, Bechtle has formulated its long-term goals in a vision every ten years or so since [bechtle.com/de-en/](http://bechtle.com/de-en/vision2030) the company was founded. The Vision 2030 was published in 2018 and is entitled \"Bechtle: Integrate IT. Architect the future\".

The content of Vision 2030 is dealt with meaningfully in the context of sustainability. The sustainability strategy combines economic, ecological and social aspects and contains strategic goals that are underpinned by specific measures. It therefore creates orientation and transparency at the same time. The Bechtle Sustainability Strategy 2030 focuses on four strategic fields of action, each of which is associated with three key topics and long-term goals. Additionally, we have developed a sustainability programme that defines milestones and determines suitable operating measures. We are therefore able to measure our progress transparently and take any necessary corrective action. 1. Arbeitgeberattraktivität 2.

Information security and data protection\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-48-0\"></span>In order to concretise the sustainability strategy in the environmental field of action, Bechtle published the Climate Protection Strategy 2030 in 2022. It is another building block in our sustainability activities that contributes to the goals of the Paris Climate Protection Agreement. The avoidance and reduction of CO₂ emissions form the core of the climate protection strategy.\n\nThe reduction targets for the greenhouse gas CO₂ relate to the areas we can influence and are distributed across the various emission categories along the value chain according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the so-called scopes. The aim is to reduce emissions according to Scope 1 (company facilities and vehicle fleet) and Scope 2 (purchased energy for own use) by 60 per cent by 2030. The reduction in Scope 3 emissions, which relates to the upstream and downstream value chain, should be 30 per cent (base year 2019). The ambitious road map is based on the science-based reduction targets of the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi).\n\n**Employer branding strengthens competitiveness.** The shortage of specialists and managers throughout the IT sector and demographic trends emphasise the importance of HR work and employer branding. Training and staff development are critical success factors for the implementation of our strategy and the pursuit of our long-term growth targets. Bechtle's HR work has always focused on the training of young people and on further training measures for existing employees. Our aim is to provide innovative, solution-orientated and efficient concepts for customers' IT using highly qualified personnel. In this way, we endeavour to secure a competitive position in an environment marked by rapid change.\n\n**Acquisitions are part of the growth strategy.** We plan to reach the goals of Vision 2030 both through organic growth and by means of acquisitions. As far as organic growth is concerned, we can build on some 40 years of experience in the IT market and our high market penetration. From the outset, takeovers have been part of Bechtle's growth strategy. Since the company was founded, Bechtle has successfully completed 113 acquisitions. In the past, growth through acquisitions was achieved mainly by acquiring small to medium-sized system integrators. However, in our search for suitable acquisition candidates, we often also look at larger businesses. From a geographical perspective, the declared aim of the expanded 2021 M&A strategy is to expand our range of services to all 14 countries in which we already have a trading presence, in the medium term. In all acquisitions, it is primarily important to us that the target company strengthens the market position of the Bechtle Group regionally and in terms of customers and/or performance. Therefore, we aim to supplement our IT-specific expertise and intensive processing of strategically important markets and customer groups in order to gain market share.\n\n[For an overview](#page-77-0)  [of the Scope 1–3 emissions,](#page-77-0)  [see Environment,](#page-77-0)  [page 78f](#page-77-0)\n\n[See People,](#page-61-0)  [page 62ff](#page-61-0)\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Digital future for our customers.** Bechtle has been active in the IT market for 40 years. This market is characterised by rapid technological development, resulting in constantly changing market requirements. One of the main pillars of our success is our ability to adapt our portfolio and business model to the latest market requirements. This is also the case right now: the IT market is currently undergoing a paradigm shift. In the past, most of our customers used to operate their own IT landscape, and IT partners such as Bechtle were merely involved on a project-specific basis. Though this model will not disappear entirely, the digital transformation and the growing complexity of IT will drive the demand for subscription- and consumption-based IT service models, which will be accompanied by a higher demand for solution-oriented IT consulting. In recent years, Bechtle has focussed its strategy on actively shaping this change and expanding the share of business volume in these consumption-based IT solutions. However, we will not lose sight of our traditional business and, above all, will continue to strengthen our most important asset – customer proximity.\n\n**In addition to advising customers, our experts increasingly coach them on a long-term basis. Suitable acquisitions strengthen the skillset in order to accommodate this change even more effectively.**\n\nVerena Boll, Digital Service Consultant, Bechtle AG\n\nKarl-Heinz Kramer, Head of Mergers & Acquisitions /Corporate Development, Bechtle AG\n\nTeresa Limbrunner, Digital Business Management Consultant, Bechtle AG\n\nfrom left to right\n\nImage /page/49/Picture/9 description: In an indoor shot, three smiling professionals are posing in a modern office setting.

The main objective of the company development is to sustainably increase the value of the company through profitable growth.\n\nThe short- and medium-term planning for controlling the operational units and the resulting measures are derived from the long-term corporate planning. At the same time, they are geared towards the development of the competitive and market environment. The company endeavours to boost its growth and returns through successful customers and attainment of market leadership at the respective location.\n\nBusiness volume, revenue, revenue growth, gross margin or contribution margin, earnings before taxes (EBT) and the EBT margin are relevant key performance indicators for the defined economic targets. Individual profit-sharing motivates the majority of employees to pursue the agreed targets with commitment.\n\nVarious reporting systems ensure that all units always have an overview of the performance indicators relevant to them and can manage the business operations accordingly. At group level, this data is then aggregated and used for the coordination of investment and financing decisions, the early identification of target/actual variances and the initiation of suitable measures. The cash flow cockpit has become increasingly important in recent years. It regularly provides all individual companies with a detailed view of their cash flows. A new controlling system is also currently being installed in order to meet the requirements of the growing size of the Bechtle Group in the future. Non-financial targets are also continuously recorded and evaluated in sustainability controlling.\n\nBechtle has defined important non-financial targets as part of the Sustainability Strategy 2030 and the Climate Protection Strategy published in 2022. In line with the decentralised structure of the Bechtle Group, the issue of sustainability is anchored within the Group in an agile manner via the relevant specialist departments and companies and therefore forms an integral part of the operating business.\n\n[See below and in the](#page-151-0)  [Sustainability Programme,](#page-151-0)  [Development of the Group,](#page-151-0)  [page 152ff](#page-151-0)\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT\n\nClimate protection and environmental protection are among the greatest challenges of our age. Furthermore, topics such as the protection of human rights throughout the value chain are gaining in importance. Sustainability in all of its facets is therefore a subject area that is increasingly attracting public attention. This is accompanied by further regulatory requirements from legislators, both nationally and at European level. This, in turn, results in new requirements for sustainability reporting and governance in companies. Governance, environmental and social aspects have been a fixture of our corporate processes and structures for a long time now and are subject to ongoing adjustment.\n\nSince June 2021, Bechtle's Sustainability Management department has been responsible for the implementation and further development of the sustainability and climate protection strategy throughout the group. In the reporting period, it reported directly to the Chairman of the Executive Board, Dr Thomas Olemotz, as a staff unit and is also the central point of contact within the Bechtle Group. This allows us to increase the transparency and controllability of our sustainability activities. From 1 February 2024, Sustainability Management will report to the Executive Board member Antje Leminsky, who will take over the department. At the operational level, a decentralised, agile \"Core Team Sustainability\" works on specific subjects in close coordination with Sustainability Management. The core team includes sustainability controlling, sustainable purchasing, central logistics and sustainability communication and reporting. Other central departments, such as Human Resources, Quality Management or Legal provide advice as specialised departments as and when required. In addition, there is a sustainability community in which more than 150 people from more than 100 Bechtle companies in Germany and abroad are now networked with one another. At least once a year, the entire Executive Board comes together in order to make decisions concerning further orientation, measures and investments. To assess our sustainability performance, we focus on the analyses of the sustainability rating agency EcoVadis, which are also managed by Sustainability Management. In January 2024, we received the EcoVadis gold medal for the first time with 73 out of 100 points.\n\n{52}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT IN THE BECHTLE GROUP\n\nNACHHALTIGKEITSMANAGEMENT BECHTLE GRUPPE\n\n<span id=\"page-52-0\"></span>**Nachhaltigkeitskommunikation und -berichterstattung**\n\nImage /page/52/Figure/2 description: The image shows an organizational chart for sustainability within the Bechtle Group.

The text says \"See material risks: Risk management, pages 124, 141\". Above the text is a small icon of a book.\n\nWe present key topics and explain how we handle them in the individual chapters. The NFR Index provides an overview.\n\n**Stakeholder integration.** By means of a detailed analysis, we have identified Bechtle's main stakeholder groups as follows:\n\n- � Owners/shareholders\n- � Employees\n- � Customers (companies and public clients)\n- � Suppliers/partners\n- � General public\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\nEach stakeholder group has its very own interests, expectations of the company and objectives that could also be contradictory. We therefore balance stakeholder perspectives with our own interests and goals in order to find the best possible path for all parties.\n\nThe following table presents an overview of the most important sustainability topics for our stakeholders:\n\n| Stakeholder group                            | Expectations of Bechtle / material topics                                                                                                                      |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Owners/shareholders1                         | ■ Profitable growth<br>■ Customer satisfaction<br>■ Expertise in new technologies                                                                              |\n| Customers (companies and<br>public clients)1 | ■ Information security and data protection/confidentiality<br>■ Customer satisfaction / sustainable customer relationships<br>■ Training and further education |\n| Employees1                                   | ■ Climate and environmental protection2<br>■ Occupational health and safety2<br>■ Diversity and equal opportunities2<br>■ Corporate culture and values2        |\n| Suppliers/partners1                          | ■ Information security and data protection/confidentiality<br>■ Fair competition<br>■ Profitable growth                                                        |\n| Public3                                      | ■ Social responsibility / social commitments in the region<br>■ Transparent reporting<br>■ Climate and environmental protection                                |\n\n#### KEY TOPICS OF THE BECHTLE STAKEHOLDERS\n\n1 The prioritisation of sustainability aspects is based on the results of the 2015 stakeholder survey and the scoring model used there. For the scoring model cf. Kühnapfel, J. B. (2014): Nutzwertanalysen (Benefit analyses); and Nöllke, M. (2015): Entscheidungen (Decisions).\n\n² All aspects mentioned were designated as “very important”.\n\n<sup>2</sup> All aspects mentioned were designated as \"very important\". <sup>3</sup> The topics were prioritised on the basis of a qualitative evaluation using the Sustainability Code database (deutscher-nachhaltigkeitskodex.de) and the results of the survey of specialist managers on the key non-financial topics.\n\nThe Annual Report (and the Sustainability Report between 2015 and 2021) plays an important role in communicating with our stakeholders. In it, we describe our economic, social and ecological performance and impact based on qualitative and quantitative performance indicators. By way of the reporting, we also provide insight into the processes and structures of the Bechtle Group.\n\nWe also use other publications to keep our stakeholders up to date. These include, for example, the customer magazine Bechtle update, the Bechtle website, social media and press releases. Employ- <bechtle.com/de-en/newsroom> ees are also informed via the Bechtle intranet and e-mail. Staff enter into personal dialogue with management via internal events, feedback formats or regular discussions with line managers.\n\nPersonal discussions or customer trade fairs, such as the Bechtle CDays, determine the dialogue with our customers, manufacturers and partners. We also organise student workshops and university events on sustainability.\n\nImage /page/54/Picture/11 description: The image shows a simple line drawing of an open book.

For 40 years, we have stood for IT expertise, partnership and being future-readiness. Bechtle has 100 system house locations in seven European countries and trading companies in 14 countries in Western and Central Europe. Our success is based on the principle of networked decentralisation. Each individual company in the Bechtle Group operates independently and maintains the vital direct contact with our more than 70,000 customers. The holding, in turn, performs central services for all group companies in a cost-efficient manner and coordinates cooperation between the local units.\n\n#### LEGAL STRUCTURE\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/6 description: The image shows the text \"Autonomous operations of subsidiaries\" on the left and a sun icon on the upper right.\n\n**Customer orientation even in the legal structure.** The networked decentralisation model provides the more than 120 regional and international subsidiaries with plenty of leeway to arrange their operations, thereby enabling them to focus on their core business. At the same time, they benefit from the central functions as well as the competence and organisation of a European group of companies. This is also reflected in our legal structure: The Bechtle Group has a conventional holding structure. As the parent and holding company for the entire group of companies, Bechtle AG is responsible for all overarching tasks such as digital business services, finance and taxes, human resources and personnel development, platform strategy, investor relations, group controlling, marketing, mergers & acquisitions, sustainability management, legal and compliance, risk management, corporate communications and central IT.\n\nBechtle Logistik & Service GmbH is also allocated to the holding. The group's competencies in the fields of address management, purchasing, logistics, warehousing and shipping, sales and partner marketing, price management, product management and software product management, as well as public and major accounts, are bundled here.\n\nA layer of various holding companies has been implemented directly under Bechtle AG. The business segments and brands of the two segments IT System House & Managed Services and IT E-Commerce are bundled at this level, which is involved mainly in business development.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### HOLDING STRUCTURE OF THE BECHTLE GROUP\n\nHOLDINGSTRUKTUR DES BECHTLE KONZERNS\n\n**Bechtle Managed Services holding AG**\n\n**Bechtle Systemhaus holding AG**\n\n**Bechtle Systemhaus holding AG**\n\n**Bechtle Managed Services holding AG** **Bechtle holding Schweiz AG**\n\n**Bechtle holding Schweiz AG**\n\n> **Bechtle e-commerce holding AG**\n\n> **Bechtle e-commerce holding AG**\n\nThe legally independent subsidiaries are allocated to the second holding level. Almost all subsidiaries are wholly owned by Bechtle AG, either directly or via investment companies.\n\nObjectives of this two-level holding structure:\n\n- � To relieve the decentralised subsidiaries of administrative and cross-company work, thereby ensuring focus on the core business\n- � To bundle competencies and resources in order to generate synergies, e.g. by achieving economies of scale in purchasing and logistics, thereby enabling more sustainable operations\n- � To centrally provide outsourcing and cloud services, in particular, in order to optimise the capacity utilisation throughout the group and to provide specialised services on a supra-regional basis\n- � To outline clearly aligned lean leadership responsibilities and competencies, which are vital in view of the size of the Bechtle Group\n\nIn the reporting period, the Executive Board did not significantly change the existing legal structure of the Bechtle Group.\n\nBechtle AG operates according to the traditional dualistic principle. The Executive Board is the statutory body that decides on the management of the company and represents it externally. Additionally, Bechtle has a Supervisory Board, half of which is elected by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and the other half by the German employees of the Bechtle Group. The Supervisory Board serves as a controlling body, appoints the Executive Board and monitors its work.\n\n[For an overview](#page-261-0)  [of the subsidiaries](#page-261-0) [see Notes,](#page-261-0) [page 262 ff](#page-261-0)\n\nResource savings\n\n[See Report of the](#page-16-0)  [Supervisory Board,](#page-16-0)  [page 17 ff](#page-16-0)\n\nImage /page/56/Picture/17 description: The image shows a book icon with text below it that says \"For an overvi\".\n\nSee Report of the\nSupervisory Board\npage 17 ff.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-57-0\"></span>MANAGEMENT\n\n**Networked decentralisation stands for corporate success.** The hierarchical separation of the strategic group management, for which the Executive Board is responsible, from the leadership of the operational units and from the direct customer contact is the most prominent feature of the management structure. In this way, Bechtle underlines the principle of networked decentralisation, which is rooted in the business model. At the same time, this concept enables us to stay abreast of the extensive and continually growing management tasks as well as the highly dynamic development of the business environment.\n\n[bechtle.com/](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en/about-bechtle/company/management) [management](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en/about-bechtle/company/management) The Executive Vice Presidents serve as links between the group's Executive Board and the operational units:\n\n- � Three group-wide Executive Vice Presidents: for the Public Sector division, for the Central Finance department as well as a Chief Technology Officer, who is responsible for all platform activities of the Bechtle Group,\n- � Two Executive Vice Presidents in the IT E-Commerce segment: for Germany, Austria and Switzerland and for the regions of Ireland, Southern Europe and Eastern Europe,\n- � Eight Executive Vice Presidents in the IT System House & Managed Services segment: for the German north/east, west, centre and south regions as well as the International Sales division, the Managed Services division, Application Solutions, PLM/Engineering & Manufacturing, the system house activities in Switzerland as well as the German south-west region and Austria.\n\nThe position of Vice President was filled for the first time at the beginning of 2024. Marijke Kasius assumed cross-segment responsibility in one country market and is responsible for all companies of the Bechtle Group in the Netherlands. Another Vice President will be responsible for all activities of the Bechtle Group in France from April 2024. As a result, the position of Executive Vice President, who was responsible for France, Benelux and the UK until 31 December 2023, was no longer filled.\n\nImage /page/57/Picture/9 description: The image shows the text \"Responsible business\" in bold font, with a sun icon above the word \"business\".\n\nAt the locations of the Bechtle Group, the Managing Directors alone are responsible for the success of their companies. By way of their strictly earnings-oriented variable compensation, each Managing Director directly participates in the success of the respective company. Bechtle thus promotes and supports the entrepreneurial spirit and business responsibility at all locations in order to ensure successful business performance on a long-term basis.\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-58-0\"></span>LOCATIONS\n\n**Largest location: Headquarters in Neckarsulm.** The Bechtle Group is headquartered in Neckarsulm, Germany. Apart from Bechtle AG and the Neckarsulm IT System House, Logistik & Service GmbH and the German intermediate holding companies are also based here. With 2,445 employees, Neckarsulm is our group's largest location. In total, the Bechtle Group has more than 100 operating companies. The majority of the IT system houses and service and trading companies are located in Germany, which is also Bechtle's most important national market. However, Bechtle generates around 39 per cent of its business volume internationally. In terms of business volume, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland are the most important markets there.\n\n[For an overview of the](#page-261-0)  [subsidiaries,](#page-261-0) [see Notes,](#page-261-0) [page 262 ff](#page-261-0)\n\nImage /page/58/Figure/4 description: This image shows a map of Europe with country codes.

In order to ensure the important regional presence, we have a comprehensive international network of more than 100 IT system houses. In this structure, the Managing Directors of the operating subsidiaries act in the capacity of independent entrepreneurs with a high level of personal responsibility in their local markets. In the course of the realignment of the acquisition strategy, the expansion of our service business beyond Germany, Austria and Switzerland was continued through several acquisitions in the 2023 reporting period. The network of system houses thus extends across Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and, since this reporting period, also France and Spain. The objective of the internationalisation strategy is to further expand system house activities outside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, in order to strengthen Bechtle's market and competitive position in the national markets already covered by the IT E-Commerce segment.\n\n**Seven acquisitions in six European countries.** In the reporting period, Bechtle acquired seven companies in six European countries: the UK, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France, Spain and Germany. The UK-based value-added reseller Tangible Benefit Ltd. has been part of the Bechtle Group since March 2023. Founded in 1997, this IT company is based in the City of London. In the 2021/22 fiscal year, Tangible Benefit's business volume totalled around €70 million. In April, Bechtle acquired the VMware and software specialist Fondo ICT Professionals B.V., thereby strengthening its market presence in the Netherlands. With 42 employees, Fondo generated a business volume of around €41 million in the 2022 fiscal year. In the area of 3D printing, the Bechtle Group strengthened its position in May with the acquisition of SGSolution AG. Founded in 2008, the company is based in Wallisellen, near Zurich, and generated a business volume of CHF 4.1 million in the 2022 fiscal year. In August, Bechtle acquired Prosol Ingeniería S.L. and Prosol Iscat S.L., thereby supplementing its portfolio in Spain with IT services for the first time. Prosol employs 50 people and achieved a business volume of around €15 million in 2022. The company's two sites are located near Madrid and Barcelona. Prosol has been active as a system integrator for industrial enterprises in the Spanish market since 1996. The IT consulting company sastema GmbH, a specialist in identity & access management (IAM), governance, risk & compliance management and information security, also joined Bechtle in August. The company was founded in 2018, is based near Frankfurt am Main, employs 21 people and achieved a business\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\nvolume of €2.2 million in the 2022 fiscal year. With its investment in PLANET AI, Bechtle brought an AI specialist in-house in October 2023. Bechtle acquired a 51 per cent stake in this Rostock-based company. PLANET AI, which is active in the field of deep learning, is a spin-off of PLANET intelligent systems GmbH and has been developing its own technological solutions for intelligent document analysis and process automation since 2015. With effect from 5 October 2023, Bechtle completed the acquisition of the French cybersecurity and IT infrastructure service provider APIXIT, thereby expanding its existing portfolio to include IT services in an additional European country. With APIXIT, we have a well-established IT service provider that is rooted with ten locations in the French market. Around 340 employees generated a business volume of €85 million in the 2021/22 fiscal year. APIXIT has a clear portfolio focus on cybersecurity, accounting for over 45 per cent of business volume, and also has a security operations centre for all security-related IT services.\n\nImage /page/60/Picture/2 description: Three people are posing for a picture.

Bechtle benefits from the great diversity of various cultures and nationalities, different genders and a wide age structure of its workforce. Bechtle offers a respectful and appreciative working environment, a wide range of training and development opportunities and plenty of scope for individual ideas and talents. Rising application figures and the positive result of a Group-wide satisfaction survey among all employees are proof of our company's attractiveness as an employer. **11.487 12.180 12.880** 9.383 8.955 3.225 3.497\n\n10.083 3.963\n\n**10.603 4.556**\n\n**14.046**\n\n**15.159 (+ 7,9 %)**\n\n#### DEVELOPMENT OF THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES\n\n**Number of employees grows by 7.9 per cent.** As of 31 December 2023, Bechtle employed 15,159 people across the Group. Compared to the previous year (14,046 employees), the workforce grew by 1,113 people or 7.9 per cent. Around half of these, 554 people, joined Bechtle through acquisitions in the course of the reporting period. The purely organic growth amounted to 4.0 per cent, a relatively small increase compared to that of previous years. This was due to the challenging situation currently prevailing in Bechtle's main sales markets. Expressed in full-time equivalents (FTE), an average of 14,135 employees worked for Bechtle (prior year: 12,898), which represents an increase of 1,237 people or 9.6 per cent. As an internationally active IT enterprise, Bechtle's workforce is marked by a great diversity of cultures and nationalities. In 2023, our company had employees from 110 different nations (prior year: 101).\n\nYear on year, our headcount in Germany went up by 520, an increase of 5.2 per cent. Internationally, 593 more people were employed by Bechtle, an increase of 15.0 per cent. Besides other factors, this was due to the acquisitions that took place in the year ended in France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Spain and the UK. At 30.1 per cent, almost a third of all employees were working internationally for Bechtle at the end of 2023 (previous year 28.2 per cent).\n\n| EMPLOYEES BY REGIONS |   |       |       |       |        |        |        |        |        | as of 31 December |  |\n|----------------------|---|-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------------|--|\n|                      | 0 | 2,000 | 4,000 | 6,000 | 8,000  | 10,000 | 12,000 | 14,000 | 16,000 | Total             |  |\n| 2019                 |   |       |       |       | 8,424  |        | 3,063  |        |        | 11,487            |  |\n| 2020                 |   |       |       |       | 8,955  |        | 3,225  |        |        | 12,180            |  |\n| 2021                 |   |       |       |       | 9,383  |        | 3,497  |        |        | 12,880            |  |\n| 2022                 |   |       |       |       | 10,083 |        | 3,963  |        |        | 14,046            |  |\n| 2023                 |   |       |       |       | 10,603 |        | 4,556  |        |        | 15,159 (+7.9%)    |  |\n\nGermany International\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n**11.223**\n\n**11.853** \n\n**12.529** \n\n**13.661** \n\n**11.487 12.180**\n\n**14.773 (+ 8,1 %)**\n\nBroken down by function, the number of employees in the service sector rose by 588 people or 9.2 per cent.

We create individual performance incentives in the form of variable salary components, aligning them with business interdependencies. Whether or not a variable salary component is granted usually depends on the function and on the salary amount.\n\n#### EDUCATION AND TRAINING\n\n**Facing the shortage of skilled workers with training.** Our goal is to increasingly meet the growing need for experts and executives from our own ranks. Therefore, Bechtle attaches great importance to training, the development of employees and executives and knowledge management. The Staff Development department designs and organises development programmes centrally for experts and executives for the companies in Germany and abroad, and accompanying programmes for apprentices and students on integrated degree programmes and the trainee programme. The Bechtle Academy supplements the offering with a broad training portfolio for the employees of all hierarchy levels.\n\nWe endeavour to attract interested, talented applicants to Bechtle. A transparent, fair and streamlined application process and fast decisions are of particular importance to us. We support young people in choosing a career and create opportunities for them to discover jobs in IT through internships and various events. In the reporting period, Bechtle was again awarded the employer label \"MINT Minded Company\" in recognition of its special interest in students, graduates and talents in the fields of maths, IT, science and technology.\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n842 trainees\n\nBechtle has always attached importance to the training of young people in order to meet the need for qualified junior staff. We view training as an investment in the future for the purpose of actively forestalling a shortage of qualified staff. We have been training apprentices for 38 years now, and have established ourselves as a sought-after training company for numerous commercial and technical professions. We also offer integrated degree programmes in various economic and technical subjects. All in all, we have training offerings in 23 professions and degree programmes.\n\n| DISTRIBUTION OF TRAINING PROFESSIONS AND DEGREE PROGRAMMES<br>as of 31 December |      |      |      |      |      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                                                                                 | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Administrative trainees                                                         | 307  | 288  | 226  | 235  | 248  |\n| Technical trainees                                                              | 426  | 401  | 371  | 363  | 370  |\n| Administrative students                                                         | 69   | 67   | 53   | 54   | 50   |\n| Technical students                                                              | 40   | 37   | 41   | 35   | 35   |\n| Total                                                                           | 842  | 793  | 691  | 687  | 703  |\n\nIn 2023, a total of 299 young people embarked on their training or integrated degree programme with our company.

Year on year, the number of apprentices and students and integrated degree programmes thus went up by 6.2 per cent. At the head office in Neckarsulm, the training ratio was 8.2 per cent (previous year: 8.1 per cent). In Germany, it amounted to 6.8 per cent, also slightly more than in the prior year (6.6 per cent).

The Bechtle Academy, which was established by the company back in 1999, backs the individual training at the group locations, offering all employees a comprehensive qualification programme. From an organisational perspective, the academy's activities take place under the umbrella of the staff development department. The department's task is to support the achievement of the growth targets of the Bechtle Group by means of suitable strategic staff development measures. The academy's offering ranges from ongoing training measures to the acquisition of special skills to personal development seminars. Since 2023, the Bechtle Academy has also been responsible for the \"Release your Potential\" support programme for women, which was first implemented in 2022.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### BECHTLE ACADEMY OFFERING: ONLINE AND CLASSROOM SEMINARS\n\n|                                         | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  | 2019  |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Number of participants                  | 9,871 | 9,428 | 7,668 | 4,991 | 7,425 |\n| Number of persons who completed courses | 787   | 754   | 625   | 401   | 540   |\n\nAdditionally, our learning platform, Learning Campus, features numerous e-learning courses for a wide spectrum of subjects.

Moreover, all employees can take courses at the Bechtle training centres or participate in external training measures.\n\n**Diverse development opportunities.** In 2020, we provided managers with binding guidelines by publishing the new Bechtle Leadership Principles. The Group-wide leadership initiative launched at the same time was also continued in 2023, as was the Bechtle leadership feedback programme. The objective of all measures is to further improve leadership skills in order to boost employee satisfaction and make an important contribution to the realisation of the Vision 2030.\n\nFurthermore, we have two programmes for the development of executives from our own ranks. The Bechtle Junior Management Programme (JuMP) has the orientation \"Leader\". It is aimed at employees without or with only initial management experience and prepares them for taking on more advanced executive roles. The Bechtle General Management Programme (GMP) focuses on corporate management and prepares managers to take on management tasks.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nIntroduced in 2022, the Bechtle JuMP Expert Programme, a development programme for proven experts who explicitly do not wish to take on disciplinary management responsibility, is now offered on a regular basis following a very positive pilot phase.\n\nBesides leadership development, the Bechtle IT Business Architects Programme (IT BA) offers employees with outstanding professional skills attractive development options.\n\n#### PARTICIPANTS IN BECHTLE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES\n\n|                                                   | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|\n| Bechtle Junior Management Programme (JuMP) Leader | 106  | 120  | 85   | 109  |\n| Bechtle Junior Management Programme (JuMP) Expert | 59   | 21   | –    | –    |\n| Bechtle General Management Programme (GMP)        | 13   | 11   | 11   | 19   |\n| Bechtle IT Business Architect Programme (IT BA)   | 16   | 17   | 12   | 12   |\n\nAll staff-development programmes promote intensive interchange among the participants and within the entire company, in order to share knowledge and experience and to learn from each other.\n\nTo make it easier for university graduates to start their careers, we offer them a wide range of attractive entry-level and qualification programmes. For example, this includes the Bechtle trainee programme. Over a period of nine months, the trainees are prepared for taking over a specialist position. The programme is a combination of theoretical and practical training tailored to the candidates' intended career path. Two training courses have taken place every year since 2019. In 2023, 24 people attended the trainee programme.\n\n**Career jumpers programme successfully continued.** In September 2022, Bechtle launched a career jumpers programme in cooperation with the Provadis University of Applied Sciences in Frankfurt am Main to counter the shortage of skilled workers. In a custom-developed certificate course, we offer people without any previous IT experience access to jobs in IT sales and further specialisation in the fields of cloud, IT security, modern workplace and network solutions. In addition to the training courses at the Bechtle Academy, custom-tailored courses are offered through the private, nationally accredited Provadis School of International Management and Technology AG in Frankfurt am Main. At more than 100 national and European Bechtle locations, the participants gain hands-on skills. In the reporting period, 42 participants (previous year: 18 participants) completed this programme and started their career at Bechtle.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### EMPLOYER ATTRACTIVENESS\n\n**Work culture – Work@Bechtle.** As a forward-looking employer, we offer entrepreneurial freedom with clear goals, appreciation and solidarity in a strong team, as well as many opportunities to adapt the work-life balance. Flat hierarchies enable all employees to take on responsibility at an early stage and develop an entrepreneurial mindset. Employee satisfaction and a secure and appreciative work environment are essential components of our work culture.\n\nWe want our employees to have sufficient room in their professional lives for their respective personal situation. This is guided by our Work@Bechtle concept introduced throughout the group in the summer of 2021. This describes the amalgamation of workplace and working time flexibility and modern communications technology to create a productive working environment. Work@Bechtle is an important strategic component of our employer branding and designed to elevate both our inbound and outbound employer communication. Modern work concepts optimally balance our employees' professional and private lives, and the guidelines help us create an attractive working environment. A great deal of flexibility allows us to conciliate specific job and project requirements.\n\nChildcare often poses great challenges for families. For this reason, many Bechtle employees in Germany make use of the option of taking parental leave.\n\n#### PARENTAL LEAVE BECHTLE GROUP IN GERMANY\n\n|                             | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|-----------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Employees on parental leave | 505  | 518  | 462  | 391  | 363  |\n| Proportion of women %       | 55.0 | 51.0 | 48.5 | 50.0 | 52.9 |\n| Proportion of men %         | 45.0 | 49.0 | 51.5 | 50.0 | 47.1 |\n\n#### DURATION OF PARENTAL LEAVE BECHTLE GROUP IN GERMANY\\*\n\n|       | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|-------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Women | 20.3 | 21.2 | 21.0 | 21.9 | 24.5 |\n| Men   | 1.5  | 1.6  | 1.7  | 1.5  | 1.7  |\n\n\\*Average number in months\n\nFlexible working hours contribute to a good work-life balance.

This offer is also often taken up.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n|               | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Full-time     | 13,170 | 12,404 | 11,166 | 10,655 | 10,059 |\n| Male          | 10,066 | 9,372  | 8,509  |        |        |\n| Female        | 3,104  | 3,032  | 2,657  |        |        |\n| Germany       | 9,342  | 8,920  |        |        |        |\n| International | 3,828  | 3,484  |        |        |        |\n| Part-time     | 1,989  | 1,642  | 1,714  | 1,525  | 1,428  |\n| Male          | 807    | 678    | 741    |        |        |\n| Female        | 1,182  | 964    | 973    |        |        |\n| Germany       | 1,261  | 1,163  |        |        |        |\n| International | 728    | 479    |        |        |        |\n\n#### NUMBER OF FULL-TIME/PART-TIME EMPLOYEES\\* as of 31 December\n\n\\* The breakdown by gender and region has been available for full-time and part-time employees since the 2022 reporting period.\n\n**Fringe benefits.** Bechtle offers its employees in Germany an extremely attractive company pension scheme by taking out direct insurance. In 2023, Bechtle increased its employer contribution by up to 100 per cent on the invested amount, depending on the years of service. This is an offer that goes far beyond the usual employer contributions and is, therefore, an important building block in our employer branding. The issue of retirement provision also plays a major role for younger applicants in particular. It is also possible to take out occupational disability insurance through the employer.\n\nAll Bechtle employees have the opportunity to lease a company bicycle on special terms. In 2023, we had 1,136 company bicycles in our fleet across the Group (previous year: 1,113).\n\nOnce again this year, many employees took advantage of the holiday programme offered at Group headquarters for their children aged between five and twelve. This enabled parents to bridge the often childcare-free period during the summer holidays for a minimum of one and a maximum of three weeks.\n\n**High employer attractiveness.** Attracting qualified people to our company and retaining them in the long term is of great strategic and economic importance to us. In the reporting period, various recruiting measures were held at different locations. The recruitment of junior staff was a focal point. For example, Bechtle presented itself as an employer to students at strategically selected universities on a Germany-wide campus tour. Other events were organised for school pupils and, in particular, for young women. We have also taken measures to recruit professionals. Over a period of nine months, for example, a major national IT security campaign was organised on various channels. We are also increasingly focusing on social media.\n\nThe shortage of skilled labour and demographic change will make the search for new workers increasingly difficult. There is also the risk of an increasing willingness to change jobs on the part of the company's own employees. We are working hard to counteract this trend with our targeted measures.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe turnover rate, calculated on the basis of a moving average of the last twelve months, totalled 9.1 per cent in the reporting period (previous year: 10.9 per cent). This means that we have achieved our goal of keeping the ratio below 10 per cent in 2023. The average length of service rose slightly and now stands at 5.9 years (previous year: 5.8 years).\n\n| TURNOVER RATE* as of 31 December |   |      |      |      |      |      |\n|----------------------------------|---|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                                  |   | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Turnover rate women              | % | 9.1  | 10.1 | 7.5  |      |      |\n| Turnover rate men                | % | 9.1  | 11.2 | 9.8  |      |      |\n| Total turnover rate              | % | 9.1  | 10.9 | 9.1  | 7.2  | 9.4  |\n\n\\*The breakdown of the turnover rate by gender has been available since 2021.\n\n| AVERAGE PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT AT BECHTLE<br>as of 31 December |      |      |      |      |      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                                                              | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Average period of employment                                 | 5.9  | 5.8  | 5.8  | 5.8  | 5.5  |\n\nThe \"Top Employers Institute\" recognised Bechtle as a Top Employer for the first time in 2023. In order to prove that we offer outstanding working conditions, we had to undergo an extensive certification process. The certificate was renewed at the beginning of 2024. New application records in 2023 can be seen as a reward for our efforts to further increase our attractiveness as an employer.\n\n**Employee job satisfaction improved.** In October 2023, we completed the second Group-wide satisfaction survey among all employees in a total of 92 Bechtle companies and divisions. Every two years, we ask our employees about their satisfaction in these categories:\n\n- � Activity\n- � Working conditions\n- � Communication and information\n- � Cooperation\n- � Further training and development opportunities\n- � Employment conditions\n- � Leadership behaviour\n\nFollowing the first survey, a large number of projects and measures to improve job satisfaction were initiated at company and division level. The positive result of the second survey shows the great success of these measures.\n\nEspecially in the categories of Further Training and Development Opportunities, and Management Behaviour, the satisfaction values have risen significantly compared to the previous survey. The broad and consistently business-oriented training programme offered by the Bechtle Academy, as well as the development programmes for managers and experts described above, have had an extremely positive effect here.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY\n\n**Diversity as an important goal.** Diversity is a key factor for successful teams, for customer and market excellence, and ultimately for the sustainability of the business going forward. Bechtle is firmly in favour of equal opportunities and against discrimination – be it on the basis of gender and [charta-der-vielfalt.de](http://charta-der-vielfalt.de) gender identity, sexual orientation, age, religious affiliation and ideology, social or ethnic origin, nationality, or illness and disability. This important principle is codified in the Bechtle Code of Conduct. We have documented this self-perception externally by signing Charta der Vielfalt (Diversity [unglobalcompact.org](http://unglobalcompact.org) Charta) and the UN Global Compact.\n\ncharta-der-vielfalt.de\n\nunglobalcompact.org\n\nIn practice, this can be seen from the various measures that have been in place for many years, especially to promote women. For example, this includes the annual Girls' Day, the Future Days and the mentor programmes. In addition, numerous strategic decisions were made and new initiatives launched back in 2022 that will bring us closer to our goal of greater diversity and equal opportunities.\n\nIn order to provide a structured framework for the important topic of diversity at Bechtle, a Head of Diversity has been in place at our company since 1 March 2024. This person's task is to build on the many activities that have been initiated in recent years and to develop a diversity strategy.\n\n**Diversity team and diversity community.** In collaboration with the Human Resources, Staff Development and Corporate Communications departments, an interdisciplinary diversity team appointed by Bechtle assessed the current status by means of a structured analysis. The focus was on gender equality. A number of actions have already been derived on the basis of the initial insight gained: In 2022, a Women@Bechtle community and a Pride@Bechtle community were established across all locations to network employees and offer them the opportunity to share experiences and develop measures on their own initiative. Along a centrally defined road map, employees and, in particular, managers were made more aware of the issue in various fields of action. Among other things, two e-learning courses \"Diversity & Inclusion\" and \"Unconscious Bias – Recognising and Reducing Prejudices and Stereotypes\" were launched in the reporting period and are available to all employees.\n\n**Let's connect.** In cooperation with our manufacturing partners Dell Technologies and Google, the \"Let's connect\" workshop series was set up and integrated into the Bechtle Academy for all employees. Interested people of all genders now have the opportunity to expand their knowledge and skills in the areas of personal branding, self-marketing, resilience and networking.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n**2023**\n\n2022\n\nImage /page/71/Picture/1 description: The image displays the text \"PEOPLE AT BECHTLE\" in white against a gradient background that transitions from blue to gray.

As of 31 December 2023, the Group Management Board and Executive Vice Presidents only had male representatives; women are currently under-represented at higher management levels. However, Bechtle has set itself the goal of increasing the proportion of women, particularly in management positions.\n\nThe Supervisory Board had already set a target for the proportion of women on the Executive Board in December 2020. A woman should be a member of the Group Executive Board by 30 June 2025. Bechtle met this target on 1 February 2024. With Antje Leminsky, who will be responsible for logistics, procurement and partner management, as well as financial services and sustainability management, the Executive Board has been expanded to four members.\n\nThe Group Executive Board also redefined the targets for the proportion of women in supervisory bodies and management functions ahead of schedule. The target for the first management level below the Executive Board is 22 per cent or two positions with a deadline of 31 January 2025. With the appointment of a Vice President in the Netherlands on 1 January 2024 and in France from 1 April 2024, there will be two women at this management level.\n\nThe second executive level under the Executive Board comprises the decision makers in managerial positions as well as other executives throughout the group that report directly to a member of the Executive Board. For this executive level, the Executive Board has determined a target quota of 25 per cent or 31 persons.

For this, we need to assume our responsibility as an employer towards our employees and make sure that the workplaces are designed to be safe and conducive to good health. We place great emphasis on compliance with statutory regulations and attach great importance to occupational safety and health protection. In 2021, Bechtle AG in Neckarsulm and Gaildorf achieved EN ISO 45001 certification in occupational health and safety management.\n\nA central coordination unit for occupational safety supports all German companies of the Bechtle Group. It maintains contact with the occupational health service, instructs the managing directors throughout Germany about their duties in cooperation with the occupational health service and provides e-learning material for employees. Furthermore, the central coordination unit prepares occupational safety, health protection and fire protection guidelines. All employees in Germany regularly receive occupational safety instructions and have access to the German Occupational Safety Act (ASiG) via the Internet. The international subsidiaries organise their guidelines, training and instructions independently in accordance with the relevant national law. In 2023, Bechtle was honoured with the \"Healthy Employer\" award for the Neckarsulm location. The award, bestowed by the international market research institute EUPD, certifies exemplary occupational health services and helps job seekers select a suitable future employer.\n\n|                                                 | 2023  | 2022   | 2021   | 2020  |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|--------|-------|\n| Occupational health and safety training courses | 26    | 24*    | 73     | 29    |\n| Participants                                    | 4,434 | 4,828* | 5,959  | 2,604 |\n| Training of fire prevention assistants          | 49    | 31     | 23     | 8     |\n| Participants                                    | 117   | 111    | 63     | 46    |\n| SARS-CoV-2 training                             | –     | 2      | 2      | 1     |\n| Participants                                    | –     | 1,051  | 11,456 | 7,175 |\n|                                                 |       |        |        |       |\n\n#### OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY TRAINING COURSES BECHTLE GROUP GERMANY\n\n\\* Number adjusted\n\nIn 2023, the group recorded 37 notifiable work accidents in Germany, while the number of work-related injuries was 41.

CHM takes a holistic approach to the subject of health and is a part of the central Human Resources department. Apart from planning and coordinating health measures at Group headquarters, Company Health Management regularly communicates with the HR managers of other Bechtle locations in Germany and internationally in order to exchange experience and roll out CHM measures there as well. Employees throughout the Group can also take part in the majority of the sports and health courses offered at the fitness centre at Group headquarters online.\n\n**For the past 38 years, we have been fulfilling our social responsibility by training people. We also gain talented people by means of our various qualification and training programmes. Since 2023, Bechtle has been a certified \"Top Employer\".**\n\n**76**\n\nThuy Hien Cao, Administrative Trainee, System House Stuttgart\n\nJeremy Fraß, Internal Sales Department, System House Stuttgart\n\nfrom left to right\n\nImage /page/75/Picture/9 description: Two young adults are sitting on an orange couch. The woman on the left has long brown hair and is wearing a light blue button-down shirt and a dark skirt. She is sitting with her legs crossed and has white sneakers on. The man on the right has short brown hair and is wearing a light gray t-shirt and gray striped pants. He is holding a laptop. There is a small black table to the left of the couch with two glasses of water on it. There is a plant in a black pot to the right of the couch. The background is a modern office space with large windows.\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-76-0\"></span>**ENVIRONMENT**\n\n\"Environment\" is one of the four strategic action fields of the Bechtle Sustainability Strategy 2030. In line with the strategy, we focus on the subject areas we have identified as being of material significance, namely climate and energy, sustainable logistics and the circular economy. By optimising our business processes and initiating systematic climate protection measures, we are able to reduce emissions, save resources and minimise our impact on the environment. Moreover, corporate digital responsibility plays a key role both for Bechtle and for our customers. We assist our customers in their digital transformation and in achieving their climate protection goals.\n\nThe Climate Protection Strategy 2030 that was published in August 2022 supplements the Sustainability Strategy and describes how we intend to reach our climate goals. Our actions are aligned with the 1.5-degree target defined at the Climate Change Conference held in Paris in 2015. The focus is on our reduction targets in the field of direct and indirect carbon dioxide equivalents emissions along the value chain on the basis of the scientifically established reduction targets of the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi). In the reporting period, Bechtle also signed the Commitment Letter of the SBTi. Upon submission of our targets, the validation by the SBTi will take place in the course of 2024.\n\nThe central sustainability management is responsible for, and coordinates the implementation of, the sustainability targets within the Bechtle Group and tracks the yearly progress. The strategic responsibility for the Climate Protection Strategy 2030 as a fixed element of the Sustainability Strategy in the action field \"environment\" lies with the sustainability controlling. Here, the needed indicators are collected, the corporate carbon footprint is calculated, and reduction targets are tracked. The progress of the measures is assessed and, if necessary, adjusted in close coordination with the individual units and locations. At the locations of the Bechtle Group, the Managing Directors are responsible for the achievement of the environment and climate goals.\n\n#### ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND EMISSIONS\n\nTo reach our reduction targets in the areas we can influence, we endeavour to avoid and reduce carbon emissions. In our operations, our vehicle fleet plays a major role, and we also use energy for the upkeep of office buildings, warehouses and data centres. In the upstream and downstream value chain, energy is consumed for the transport and use of the products sold by us. In our carbon dioxide equivalents emissions reporting, we follow the approaches of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-77-0\"></span>**Scope 1 and 2 emissions.** A year-end overview of the power consumption, heating energy and district heating can only be provided in the form of a forecast.

The Bechtle account managers, consultants and IT service engineers therefore need to be mobile in order to take care of the customers on-site. For this reason, the vehicle fleet of the Bechtle Group, which currently comprises 5,249 cars, accounts for a major share of the carbon emissions caused by Bechtle. Accordingly, making more use of e-mobility could help us to reduce our emissions greatly.\n\nAs expected, the number of business trips increased after the COVID-19 measures were lifted. Moreover, the increasing number of employees in the group resulted in an expansion of the fleet. Despite these two factors, however, the number of business trips in 2023 remained under that of 2019. We attribute this to the increased use of virtual meetings, whose number again went up considerably.\n\n#### NUMBER OF VIDEO MEETINGS BECHTLE GROUP\n\n|                          | 2023      | 2022      | 2021      | 2020    | 2019    |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|\n| Number of video meetings | 2,162,808 | 1,621,699 | 1,112,768 | 605,834 | 177,118 |\n\n#### KILOMETRES DRIVEN BECHTLE GROUP\n\n|                             | 2023       | 20221      | 20211      | 20201      | 2019       |\n|-----------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Kilometres/year             | 96,451,986 | 84,785,140 | 66,081,352 | 69,532,076 | 98,721,551 |\n| Total number of vehicles    | 5,249      | 4,846      | 4,197      | 4,183      | 3,924      |\n| Kilometres/year per vehicle | 18,375     | 17,496     | 15,745     | 16,623     | 25,158     |\n\n¹ Due to the correction of the data of prior years within the Swiss vehicle fleet, the retroactive figures from 2022 differ.\n\n#### ENERGY CONSUMPTION BECHTLE GROUP FLEET BY SOURCES (SCOPE 1) in l\n\n|             | 2023       | 2022      | 2021      | 2020      | 2019      |\n|-------------|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Diesel¹     | 4,383,955  | 4,678,100 | 4,219,874 | 4,843,667 | 6,465,121 |\n| Biodiesel   | 881        | 813       | 0         | 0         | 0         |\n| Petrol¹     | 2,280,251  | 1,624,027 | 948,302   | 720,327   | 1,000,824 |\n| LPG         | 0          | 0         | 0         | 324       | 1,450     |\n| Natural gas | 952        | 606       | 1,490     | 187       | 70        |\n| Total fuels | 6,666,039² | 6,303,546 | 5,169,665 | 5,564,505 | 7,467,466 |\n\n¹ Due to the correction of the data of prior years within the Swiss vehicle fleet, the retroactive figures from 2022 differ.\n\n² Without hydrogen consumption in the Netherlands\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/80/Figure/1 description: This line graph shows the share of combustion vehicles, electrified drives, and all-electric vehicles from 2019 to 2023. In 2019, the share of combustion vehicles was 93.71, electrified drives was 6.07, and all-electric vehicles was 1.1. In 2020, the share of combustion vehicles was 84.04, electrified drives was 15.96, and all-electric vehicles was 2.34. In 2021, the share of combustion vehicles was 75.32, electrified drives was 24.61, and all-electric vehicles was 3.22. In 2022, the share of combustion vehicles was 65.17, electrified drives was 34.81, and all-electric vehicles was 6.73.

In the reporting period, 40.8 per cent of all company vehicles in the Bechtle Group were either plug-in hybrids or all-electric. Year on year, the share of e-cars throughout the group more than doubled to 14.4 per cent (prior year: 6.7 per cent).\n\n**Expansion of e-mobility in Germany.** Currently, 29.9 per cent of the Bechtle company cars in Germany are hybrid vehicles, and 11.5 per cent are all-electric. According to the latest KfW Climate Barometer, Bechtle is therefore significantly above the German average, which is 5 per cent for all-electric company vehicles in large companies and 14 per cent including hybrid vehicles. At Bechtle, the share in Germany totals 41.4 per cent.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, 492 employees in Germany drove e-cars. In 2023 alone, 327 all-electric vehicles joined the fleet in Germany. Additional vehicles will be needed as the number of employees grows – another reason to promote e-mobility.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Charging infrastructure.** The charging infrastructure at the Bechtle locations needs to be expanded on a large scale in order to enable employees to charge their vehicles, thereby increasing the acceptance of the measures taken. By the end of 2023, a total of 733 charging points were available at 51 Bechtle locations throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland, a year-on-year increase of 222. The Group headquarters in Neckarsulm alone offers 166 charging points that are fed from the PV system on the roof of the car park.\n\n**Use of regenerative energy.** Bechtle intends to increase the share of regenerative energy in the total consumption and, where possible, to generate energy. In recent years, for example, photovoltaic and geothermal systems were installed in newly constructed buildings at various locations of the Bechtle Group. The largest installations are located at group headquarters in Neckarsulm, where all available roof areas have been covered with modules. In the reporting period, two further geothermal plants were commissioned, one in Mägenwil (Switzerland) and the other in Ettlingen (Germany).\n\n#### PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS BECHTLE GROUP\n\n|                     |     | 2023                |               | 2022                |               | 2021                |               | 2020                |               |\n|---------------------|-----|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|\n|                     |     | Group headquarters¹ | Bechtle Group | Group headquarters¹ | Bechtle Group | Group headquarters¹ | Bechtle Group | Group headquarters¹ | Bechtle Group |\n| Power               | kWp | 1,392               | 2,305         | 1,391               | 1,977         | 1,348               | 1,960         | 1,348               | 1,736         |\n| Number of modules   |     | 7,121               | 9,950         | 5,495               | 7,316         | 5,377               | 7,074         | 5,377               | 6,592         |\n| Area                | m²  | 11,634              | 17,252        | 8,985               | 12,527        | 8,770               | 12,328        | 8,770               | 10,769        |\n| Number of locations |     | 2                   | 17            | 2                   | 13            | 1                   | 12            | 1                   | 8             |\n\n¹ Group headquarters including the Gaildorf location from 2022; before that date, the system in Gaildorf was not yet operational.\n\n#### GEOTHERMAL SYSTEMS BECHTLE GROUP\n\n|                                    |     | 2023                |               | 2022                |               | 2021                |               | 2020                |               |\n|------------------------------------|-----|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|\n|                                    |     | Group headquarters1 | Bechtle Group | Group headquarters1 | Bechtle Group | Group headquarters1 | Bechtle Group | Group headquarters1 | Bechtle Group |\n| Power                              | kWp | 680                 | 1,2822        | 680                 | 1,080         | 680                 | 995           | 680                 | 710           |\n| Number of downhole heat exchangers |     | 257                 | 3513          | 257                 | 341           | 257                 | 333           | 257                 | 333           |\n| Number of locations                |     | 2                   | 74            | 2                   | 6             | 2                   | 5             | 2                   | 5             |\n\n¹ Group headquarters including the Gaildorf location\n\n<sup>1</sup> Group headquarters including the Gaildorf location <sup>2</sup> Data for the Bechtle location Ettlingen without downhole heat exchangers due to use of streaming water,\n\nsuction wells and absorption wells; water volume: 21 m<sup>3</sup>/h <sup>3</sup> Includes expansion in Mägenwil (Switzerland)\n\n⁴ Neckarsulm, Gaildorf, Freiburg i.

The Bechtle logistics hubs in Neckarsulm and Hamburg serve as the central hubs for the flow of goods. Products that are not sent directly to the customer by the vendor or distributor largely arrive there, are consolidated by project, stored for later fulfilment or configured according to customer specifications. Apart from the logistics hub in Neckarsulm, the Bechtle Group operates a second logistics hub in Hamburg and additional warehouses in Bielefeld, Wesel (Bechtle Remarketing GmbH), Rotkreuz (Switzerland), Paris (France) as well as smaller satellite warehouses. In the reporting period, a total of 3,083,123 parcels and 68,850 pallets were sent out from the warehouses in Neckarsulm, Hamburg and Bielefeld.\n\n**Optimised packaging solutions.** Both the original product packaging and the outer packaging or transport packaging generate waste and therefore contribute to the consumption of raw materials. Moreover, the transportation of goods causes further carbon emissions. We are only able to influence the transportation of goods indirectly. Products are ordered via the central Purchasing department and shipped to our warehouses or directly to the customers by distributors or vendors. Usually, the distributors and vendors decide how the products are packaged and shipped.\n\nOn a project-specific basis, we implement individual transport solutions in collaboration with partners and customers, e.g. low-emission delivery throughout Europe by train or ship as well as so-called \"last green mile\" solutions. For example, the Bechtle IT system house in Hamburg delivers goods with electric cargo bikes to about 29 customer locations within a radius of 15 km within the framework of a customer project. Other sustainability measures include the consolidation of shipments.\n\nAll questions related to packaging are handled by the logistics hub in Neckarsulm, including the procurement of packaging material, the optimisation of the packaging, the reduction of transport volumes and the leveraging of new, innovative concepts.\n\nFollowing extensive application tests, only stretch films made from 30 per cent recycled material have been used to enclose pallets since 2023. The test results showed that stretch films with a higher share of recycled material lack the required tear resistance. To secure the load and to prevent theft, use of stretch film is essential. All purchased cardboard comes from FSC®-certified sources.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n[see](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en/about-bechtle/sustainability) [bechtle.com/](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en/about-bechtle/sustainability) [sustainability](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en/about-bechtle/sustainability)\n\nIn 2023, customers used the Bechtle Box<sup>®</sup> – an innovative shipping solution – much more often. The number of uses increased from 418 to 1,098 in the reporting period.\n\n#### CONSUMPTION OF PACKAGING MATERIAL¹\n\n|                     | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|---------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Cardboard           |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Total in kg         | 255,020 | 270,426 | 255,227 | 206,404 | 185,835 |\n| Share in %          | 51.31   | 55.39   | 49.21   | 50.17   | 50.46   |\n| CO₂e in kg          | 205,546 | 217,963 | 205,713 | 166,362 | 149,783 |\n| Paper               |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Total in kg         | 47,090  | 40,280  | 82,267  | 80,641  | 72,783  |\n| Share in %          | 9.47    | 8.25    | 15.86   | 19.60   | 19.76   |\n| CO₂e in kg          | 1,648   | 1,410   | 2,879   | 2,822   | 2,547   |\n| Plastic except film |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Total in kg         | 936     | 3,808   | 1,540   | 931     | 827     |\n| Share in %          | 0.19    | 0.78    | 0.30    | 0.23    | 0.22    |\n| CO₂e in kg          | 2,696   | 10,966  | 4,435   | 2,681   | 2,382   |\n| Film                |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Total in kg         | 21,064  | 28,781  | 25,862  | 16,215  | 16,666  |\n| Share in %          | 4.24    | 5.90    | 4.99    | 3.94    | 4.52    |\n| CO₂e in kg          | 54,976  | 75,120  | 67,499  | 42,321  | 43,498  |\n| Wood                |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Total in kg         | 172,914 | 144,911 | 153,740 | 107,192 | 92,204  |\n| Share in %          | 34.79   | 29.68   | 29.64   | 26.06   | 25.03   |\n| CO₂e in kg          | 2,075   | 1,739   | 1,845   | 1,286   | 1,106   |\n| Total               |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Total in kg         | 497,024 | 488,206 | 518,636 | 411,382 | 368,315 |\n| Share in %          | 100     | 100     | 100     | 100     | 100     |\n| CO₂e in kg          | 266,942 | 307,491 | 282,371 | 215,473 | 199,317 |\n\n<sup>1</sup> Purchased packaging by material in kg and carbon equivalent at Bechtle's logistics hub in Neckarsulm.

The returns management at the logistics hub is responsible for key tasks relating to returns logistics for group headquarters and for the warehouses in Bielefeld and Hamburg. OneTrack – a shipment tracking program of EURO-LOG – enables the complaints management to take the initiative to reduce the kilometres travelled by carriers and improve the customer service. This is made possible through continuous transparency in the logistics chain. In 2023, the number of return orders was slightly lower than in the prior year.\n\n#### RETURNS¹\n\n|                         | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Return rate<br>in %     | 0.76   | 0.72   | 0.65   | 0.77   | 0.68   |\n| Number of return orders | 43,989 | 45,084 | 42,742 | 39,232 | 38,491 |\n| Return value<br>in €    | 577    | 492    | 393    | 476    | 392    |\n\n¹ Returns of the German warehouses in Neckarsulm, Bielefeld and Hamburg that are processed via the returns management of group headquarters\n\n#### WASTE AND RECYCLABLES\n\nIn addition to the warehouses, the Bechtle Group has administration buildings where municipal and paper waste, electronic scrap and spent toner cartridges accumulate. When disposing of waste, we are required to respect both EU law and local law. Data about the accumulated waste is collected by the locations owned by Bechtle and recorded in their accounts. Most of the office facilities are located in rental properties whose waste concept is managed by the landlords. Due to the local differences in the relevance and regulation of waste management, these topics are handled by the individual companies.\n\nThe topic of waste and recyclables at group headquarters in Neckarsulm is based on a disposal concept created in the context of Bechtle AG's DIN EN ISO 14001 certification which encompasses the entire location including logistics. In 2024, a new recycling centre will be established at group headquarters.\n\nDue to the different billing periods of the waste disposal providers and landlords, not all waste figures were available as at the end of 2023.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n| WASTE BY TYPE AND DISPOSAL METHOD                      |       |       |       | in t  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|                                                        | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  | 2019  |\n| Total waste Bechtle Group¹                             | 2,864 | 2,485 | 2,354 | 2,606 |\n| Total waste group headquarters Neckarsulm              | 708   | 694   | 579   | 657   |\n| of which actual activity data broken down by category: |       |       |       |       |\n| Hazardous waste (recycled)²                            | 50    | 7     | 49    | 6     |\n| Hazardous waste (disposed of)                          | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     |\n| Non-hazardous waste (recycled)                         | 659   | 688   | 530   | 651   |\n| Non-hazardous waste (disposed of)                      | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     |\n\n¹ Calculation of the accumulated waste: data according to the waste invoice or, if not available,\n\nauxiliary calculation based on the area in square metres\n\n² The great difference between recycled hazardous waste in 2019 and 2020 and between 2021 and 2022 reflects the extensive building and renovation work done at group headquarters in 2020 und 2022.\n\n**Circular economy.** As an IT company, we are always looking for ways to extend the value-added of hardware, in particular. Bechtle Remarketing GmbH, headquartered in Wesel, Germany, is the Bechtle Group's specialist in sustainable IT life-cycle management. Apart from the purchase and sale of IT hardware, Bechtle Remarketing calculates a residual value for returned hardware, ensures secure erasure of the data, and recycles or disposes of unusable parts in cooperation with a local waste management company. Devices that are still operable are given a new lease of life so they can either be resold or leased. Through the sale of used IT hardware alone, 93,150 devices were reintroduced into the cycle in the reporting period, compared to 59,719 in 2022. If requested by the customer, Bechtle Remarketing coordinates the related logistics, the rollback of retired devices plus the roll-out of new equipment in cooperation with other Bechtle units. The DIN EN ISO 9001, 14001 and 27001 audits at Bechtle Remarketing regularly re-evaluate security levels as well as the quality requirements, processes and environmental standards within the company.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### DIGITAL FUTURE\n\nFrom the outset, we identified green IT, i.e. energy-efficient IT, as a relevant sustainability aspect of our business operations. In recent years, the social, ecological and economic factors associated with sustainable development have increasingly found an umbrella in the term corporate digital responsibility (CDR). Though digital transformation affects all industries, CDR is particularly important for an IT company such as Bechtle. On the one hand, this directly impacts our own business operations; on the other, we also play an active, responsible role in the digital transformation of our customers. Our aim is to support them to the best of our abilities in implementing their CDR and achieving their climate protection goals.\n\n**Internal digitisation.** Within the scope of our IT strategy, we pursue the goal of making our own enterprise architecture resource-saving, efficient and user-friendly. We do so under consideration of criteria such as consumer behaviour, modularity, reusability, redundancy and scalability. The management takes place via a matrix organisation: Bechtle's centralised Sustainability Management coordinates and monitors the implementation of the Bechtle Sustainability Strategy 2030, collaborating closely with Bechtle IT.\n\nInternally, Bechtle IT has developed sustainability criteria to evaluate processes and applications under economic, social and ecological considerations. The strategy integrates process optimisation and changes as well as matters pertaining to the retirement and rollback of applications and IT infrastructure. Apart from increasing employee satisfaction, the rollback saves carbon emissions.\n\n**Sustainable technologies, solutions and services.** Across all industries, digitisation is transforming the way we live and work and is the key to a successful future. This entails new expectations placed on companies and public bodies as well as on their employees. From the economic perspective as well, it is vital that we take an active and responsible role in our customers' digital transformation, to help them optimally implement their digitalisation strategy, their CDR and their climate targets. For Bechtle as an IT organisation, sustainable technologies, solutions and services are the very essence of the business model and a topic that permeates the entire Bechtle Group.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe engage closely with our vendor partners, who in turn advance the production of sustainable IT hardware, and we continue to develop our portfolio and integrate new products that meet a variety of sustainability criteria. For instance, certification labels such as TCO Certified or Blue Angel represent an important instrument to evaluate the energy consumption of hardware.\n\nThe data centre in Mutterstadt, Germany, where we cooperate with the co-location provider Pfalzkom, has already implemented key criteria of the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact. Our data centres at NTT in the Frankfurt am Main region have also joined the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact and intend to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030. In 2023, we were able to switch some of the units to eco-power via NTT. The PUE value at NTT was at 1.6, the same level as in the prior year (referring to the locations Fra1 and Fra2).\n\n**Smart digital solutions play a key role in enabling the achievement of upcoming climate protection goals. Bechtle supports numerous companies and public-sector divisions on this path.**\n\nGünter Job, member of the management/Head of Services, System House Stuttgart\n\nNicolas Fröhlich, Manager Smart City Solutions, System House Stuttgart\n\nfrom left to right\n\nImage /page/87/Picture/7 description: Two men are walking down a hallway and talking to each other.

At the same time, these are also indispensable prerequisites for sustainable corporate management. It therefore goes without saying that at Bechtle, the associated maxims have always formed the basis of our entrepreneurial activities. We want to fulfil the interests of the various stakeholder groups, such as shareholders, employees, customers and suppliers, as well as our responsibility to society as a whole, in the best possible way.\n\nIn its reporting on corporate governance, Bechtle generally follows the recommendations and suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) and, in the context of integrated reporting, the GRI standards.\n\nResponsibility for corporate governance at Bechtle lies primarily with the Supervisory Board as the highest body within the stock corporation together with the Executive Board of Bechtle AG. The cen- [bechtle.com/investors/](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en/about-bechtle/investors/corporate-governance) tral document of the corporate governance report at Bechtle is the Corporate Governance Statement, which we publish on our website. All key information on corporate governance, such as the declaration of compliance in accordance with Section 161 AktG, is available there.\n\n[corporate-governance](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en/about-bechtle/investors/corporate-governance)\n\nWithin the scope of the integrated reporting, the following sections explicitly touch on topics of relevance to us and provide takeover-related disclosures.\n\n#### COMPLIANCE AND ANTI-CORRUPTION\n\nBechtle pays great attention to ethically correct and lawful behaviour. In addition to the loss of business and the heavy fines that the respective Bechtle company could incur due to deficiencies and violations in this area, the reputation of the entire Bechtle Group could suffer severe damage. Special attention is therefore paid to prevention in order to raise awareness of the issue among all employees. The processes and measures integrated in the compliance system are of material significance to the measures taken to prevent corruption and mitigate related risks. Bechtle is determined to comply fully with the Bechtle Code of Conduct, the defined guidelines and compliance instruments as well as all relevant laws and regulations. All Managing Directors are obliged to report potential risks and suspected incidents to the central Risk Management, which is part of the Group Controlling of Bechtle AG.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe compliance system is based on the Bechtle Code of Conduct, which entered into force in 2010 and was comprehensively revised in 2021. It sets out a binding commitment to integrity for all employees of the Bechtle Group. The general compliance requirements are continually concretised on a caseand department-specific basis. For example, guidelines on how to handle gifts from business partners have been in force throughout the group since 2011. Additionally, easy-to-apply instructions are available to help employees decide how to handle any benefits to be received or granted, especially in the Public Sector, where stricter rules apply in many cases. The guidelines are to be revised in 2024.\n\nThe current 2021 version of the Bechtle Code of Conduct has been made available to all employees of the Bechtle Group and is also brought to the attention of all new employees as part of the onboarding process. In addition, since 2022 all employees have been required to take part in an annual online training course with two modules: compliance and anti-corruption. In 2023, 12,719 people – almost all Bechtle employees – successfully completed the course.\n\nThere is a special procedure for whistleblowers. Bechtle employees can contact the Compliance Board – consisting of the Executive Board of Bechtle AG and a permanent representative of the central legal department – confidentially to report relevant compliance violations via a telephone hotline or alternatively via a separate e-mail account. The processes for the internal reporting procedure were modified in 2022/23 on the occasion of the Whistleblower Protection Act; this is intended to make it more user-friendly for third parties, in particular. Since the reporting period, violations of applicable human rights along the supply chain can also be reported via the central address published on the company's website. To ensure the effectiveness of the Bechtle compliance system, all Managing Directors of the Group companies and all heads of the 18 central departments act as compliance officers on-site and in their areas. They are obliged to report any violations of the Bechtle Code of Conduct or applicable law to the Compliance Board in the form of an annual compliance report. Compliance reporting (submitted in 2023 for the year 2022) covered all operational and legally independent companies of the Bechtle Group as well as all central divisions, totalling 128 units.\n\nFurthermore, a background check is conducted for all Bechtle business partners, including the employees, via our central SAP system in accordance with relevant EU directives, to prevent the use of the financial system for money laundering and terrorism financing purposes. The compliance handbook is currently being revised; its planned completion had to be postponed by one year to the end of 2024 due to internal processes. The compliance management system is based on DIN EN ISO 37301.\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### INFORMATION SECURITY AND DATA PROTECTION\n\nInformation security, data protection and confidentiality are of utmost importance in Bechtle's business operations. As these subject areas intersect, we consider them as a whole. Compliance with statutory requirements (EU General Data Protection Regulation, EU GDPR) is a matter of course to Bechtle. Since information security and data protection concern the core of Bechtle's business model, security incidents involve a high reputation risk. Therefore, we attach great importance to preventive measures.\n\nDocuments accessible throughout the group help sensitise all Bechtle employees to the principles of data protection, information security, protection of confidentiality and other important requirements, and ensure compliance with statutory requirements. This includes the Bechtle Code of Conduct, the globally applicable training material for the EU GDPR and the Privacy Policy. Documents relevant to information security include, in particular, the central Information Security Guidelines, the central \"IT Compliance\" Policy and the \"Information Security\" Policy for employees. As part of the certification of the information security management system (ISMS) in accordance with DIN EN ISO 27001 (certified companies, see GRI Index), the annual preparation and updating of the ISMS Management Review required by the standard guarantees that the topic is always on the agenda of the company's management. Bechtle has also implemented an incident reporting process. In the field of security, governance, risk & compliance, we concentrate on the data processing, information flow, communication channels, customer data and Bechtle data in our data centres. Furthermore, we keep track of important new laws in order to be able to prepare for them at an early stage.\n\n[See GRI index,](#page-285-0) [page 286 ff](#page-285-0)\n\nAdditionally, we have adapted our protective systems to changing cyberattack scenarios and thus to the current risk situation. In the field of data protection, we mainly concentrate on the requirements of the EU GDPR. To ensure compliance, our Data Protection Officer conducts data protection audits in all Bechtle companies. Any open items are identified and suitable actions are derived. Moreover, mandatory e-learning formats on the topic of data protection are available in German and English. In 2023, 15,973 course completions for \"Data protection in the workplace\" training and 11,340 course completions for information security training were recorded across the Group in Germany.\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### SOCIAL COMMITMENT\n\nWith donations and social sponsoring, Bechtle supports projects that benefit society in a variety of ways. Decisions are based on the donation guidelines updated in the reporting period, which also underlines the fact that Bechtle regards social commitment as part of its corporate responsibility and is particularly committed to projects that fit in with the company's values and corporate culture.\n\nThe Bechtle Group supports selected projects as a reliable partner over a longer period of at least three years. Since 2014, this commitment has focused on three areas of activity: education, children/ youth and popular sports. This triad translates the framework of Bechtle's corporate culture, values, Vision for 2030 and brand understanding into specific areas of potential involvement: Education and youth development are the basis for \"bright minds\" and sport is the dynamic, team-orientated component that represents our corporate goals well. In addition, popular sport fits in very well with the internal measures of the company's health management programme and suits the wide range of sporting events involving Bechtle employees.\n\nWe are also involved in major humanitarian disasters in addition to firmly agreed cooperation programmes. Whenever people are affected and comprehensive solidarity and a willingness to help are required to alleviate hardship and suffering, we examine in detail how, and to what extent, we can contribute. In so doing, we also ask ourselves whether we should donate exclusively as a company or organise additional employee donation campaigns so that colleagues of the Bechtle Group can participate quickly and without excessive bureaucracy. Our largest single commitment in the reporting period was a donation of €200,000 to Aktion Deutschland Hilft e.V. for earthquake relief in Turkey and Syria.\n\nIn light of the flood disaster in the Ahr valley, Bechtle set up its own relief fund in 2021 and provided a one-off sum of €500,000. We intend to increase these funds whenever necessary, in order to be able to act quickly whenever social responsibility is particularly in demand and rapid assistance is required. Recipients are employees and their immediate families.\n\nThe decentralised nature of our business model is also reflected in our social commitment. With its more than 100 individual companies, Bechtle interacts with the respective local communities in various ways, both as an employer and contracting entity and as a business partner. An important principle is therefore to fulfil our social responsibility locally. In this way, the above-mentioned triad and the regional responsibility complement each other. The respective local managing directors are responsible for the local commitments.\n\nGroup-wide, Bechtle raised donations totalling €599,132 in 2023 (previous year: €693,817) and €716,060 (previous year: €454,448) for social sponsorships.\n\nMany of our employees are also personally involved in voluntary work for the common good. Wherever possible, Bechtle endeavours to support these efforts beyond the leave granted for charitable work pursuant to law.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\n### TAKEOVER-RELATED DISCLOSURES\n\nThe disclosures required pursuant to Section 289a, 315a of the German Commercial Code (HGB) are presented below:\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the issued capital of Bechtle AG amounted to €126 million, divided into 126,000,000 no-par bearer shares (ordinary shares). The pro-rata amount of the issued capital that is allocated to each share is €1.00. All shares have voting rights and are entitled to dividends. The rights and obligations associated with the ordinary shares are as specified in the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).\n\nThe Executive Board is not aware of any restrictions relating to voting rights or the transfer of shares.\n\nThe company is aware of the following direct or indirect capital interests exceeding 10 per cent of the voting rights as of the balance sheet date:\n\nKarin Schick, Gaildorf, Germany: 33.40 per cent, of which 25.25 per cent was direct and 8.14 per cent indirect. No changes occurred up to 11 March 2024, the reporting date.\n\nThere are no shares with special rights granting powers of control.\n\nThere are no share ownership plans or similar schemes under which employees hold interests in the capital without directly exercising their control rights.\n\nThe appointment and dismissal of members of the Executive Board is governed by Sections 84 et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and Section 31 of the German Co-determination Act (Mit- [bechtle.com/](https://bechtle.com/satzung) bestG). The regulations of the Articles of Incorporation do not deviate from these statutory provisions. In accordance with Article 6.1 of the Articles of Incorporation, the Executive Board consists of one or several persons. The number of Executive Board members is determined by the Supervisory Board. According to Article 6.4 of the Articles of Incorporation, the Supervisory Board may appoint a member of the Executive Board as Chairperson or Spokesperson of the Executive Board.\n\nThe conditions for amendments to the Articles of Incorporation are outlined in Sections 179 to 181 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The Annual General Meeting of Bechtle AG has delegated the authority to make amendments that merely concern the wording of the Articles of Incorporation to the Supervisory Board (see Article 10.4 of the Articles of Incorporation).\n\nPursuant to Sections 202 et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Executive Board is authorised, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the company's issued capital by a total of up to €18.9 million by issuing new bearer shares against cash contributions and/or contributions in kind until 14 June 2026 (authorised capital according to Article 4.3 of the Articles of Incorporation).

AktG. The Executive Board was authorised, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue bearer convertible bonds, bonds with warrants, profit participation rights, income bonds or combinations of these instruments with or without a fixed term to maturity in a total nominal amount of up to €350 million by 14 June 2026 and to grant the holders or creditors of convertible bonds or bonds with warrants conversion or option rights to new no-par value bearer shares in the company with a proportionate amount of the share capital totalling up to €6.3 million (contingent capital in accordance with Article 4.4 of the Articles of Incorporation). On 1 December 2023, Bechtle made use of this authorisation and announced the successful placement of unsecured and non-subordinated bonds with a total nominal value of €300 million (convertible bonds) with conversion rights into new and/or existing no-par value shares of Bechtle AG. The Executive Board of Bechtle AG has decided, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the subscription rights of the existing shareholders of Bechtle AG. The term of the convertible bonds is seven years. Further details can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe purchase of treasury shares is only permissible according to the provisions of Section 71 (1) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). Based on the resolution of the Annual General Meeting of 27 May 2020, the Executive Board is authorised to purchase treasury shares pursuant to Section 71 (1) no. 8 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). This authorisation is valid until 26 May 2025. Treasury shares must be purchased via the stock exchange or within the framework of a public purchase bid sent to all shareholders or via a public invitation to the shareholders to submit offers for sale. The price the company pays per share shall, in the case of purchase via the stock exchange, not exceed or fall below the price of the company's share on the Xetra trading of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (or a similar successor system), which is determined by the opening auction, or, in the case a public purchase bid sent to all shareholders or a public invitation to the shareholders to submit offers for sale, shall not exceed or fall below the average closing prices of the company's share on the three stock exchange trading days prior to the publication of the public purchase bid or the publication of the invitation to submit offers for sale by more than 10 per cent (in each case without transaction costs). The scope of the authorisation is limited to a maximum of 10 per cent of the issued capital. Other shares of the company that it has already purchased and still possesses or that are attributable to it pursuant to Sections 71 et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) shall be taken into consideration. The buy-back authorisation has been granted for any purpose permitted by law.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe company has no significant agreements that would apply in the event of a change of control due to a takeover bid.\n\nIn the service contract with the Chairman of the Management Board, the upper limit of the severance payment to be granted in the event of premature termination of the employment relationship due to a change of control was set at three times the total annual remuneration. The agreement was amended in February 2024 and the previous severance payment in the event of a change of control was cancelled with effect from 1 January 2024. The company has not concluded any other compensation agreements with members of the Executive Board or employees in the event of a takeover bid.\n\nImage /page/94/Picture/3 description: Three people are posing for a picture in an office setting.

Russia's war of aggression on Ukraine went on, and the conflict in the Middle East flared up again. Domestic political tensions further aggravated the situation, especially in Germany, but also in other countries such as France. In Germany, this resulted in a declining gross domestic product and, therefore, in the second recession in the last five years. Most national economies in the EU nevertheless achieved positive growth rates, although at a low level. The IT market delivered a more positive performance, but was unable to reach the high growth rates of recent years. In these once again challenging conditions, Bechtle performed well. The company grew at a higher rate than the macroeconomy and IT industry and gained further market shares.\n\n#### MACROECONOMY\n\nec.europa.eu\n\n**Macroeconomic growth considerably slower.** The year 2023 continued to be overshadowed by the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, which flared up again. The continued high infla- [ec.europa.eu](https://ec.europa.eu) tion and the higher interest rates also had an effect. According to the latest figures published by the European Commission, the gross domestic product (GDP) in the EU achieved minimal growth of 0.5 per cent in 2023. The first two quarters each closed with a marginal growth rate of 0.1 per cent over the prior quarter. In the third quarter, the rate dropped by 0.1 per cent. In the final quarter, economic performance stagnated at 0.0 per cent. The performance differed in the various Bechtle markets in the EU. In the reporting period, Spain reported the best performance of them all, with growth of 2.5 per cent, followed by Portugal with 2.3 per cent. Ireland came in last, with a significant decline in economic performance of 1.9 per cent.\n\nIn 2023, the German economy fell into recession. As reported by the German Federal Statistical Office, GDP underwent a slight decline of 0.3 per cent (prior year: +1.8 per cent). The performance in the [destatis.de](https://www.destatis.de/) individual quarters followed an even more pronounced downward trend than in the EU as a whole. In the first quarter, GDP managed to achieve a marginal increase of 0.1 per cent over the prior quarter, but growth stagnated at 0.0 per cent in the second and third quarters. In the fourth quarter, GDP dropped by 0.3 per cent. On the other hand, investments in equipment performed well, achieving growth of 3.8 per cent in the year as a whole. In contrast, government investments went down by 2.5 per cent.\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe ifo Business Climate Index for Germany also declined in 2023, from 90.1 points in January to 86.3 points at the end of the year. In the first four months of the year, the index went up, reaching its high [ifo.de/en](https://www.ifo.de/en) of the year of 93.1 points in April. From then on, however, the index continually dropped, falling to 85.9 points in August and September. From this low, the index only recovered slightly towards the end of the year. 6 4 3 2 **2,2**\n\n**1,3**\n\nWACHSTUM IT-MARKT IN DEUTSCHLAND in %\n\n**8,7 9,1**\n\n#### INDUSTRY 0 2019 2020 2021 2022 **2023**\n\n1\n\n**German IT market picks up.** According to figures presented by the industry association bitkom, the IT market in Germany achieved growth of 2.2 per cent despite the difficult framework conditions. [bitkom.org](https://www.bitkom.org/) Although the growth rate was much lower than in previous years, the IT industry once again stood out with its remarkable resilience. Due to the weakness of the PC market and many customers' reluctance to buy, the hardware business volume fell by 5.4 per cent. However, service revenue increased by 5.1 per cent. In the year ended, the software revenue once again served as the growth driver, with significant growth of 9.6 per cent. According to the French industry association numeum, much higher growth of 6.5 per cent was achieved in France, our largest international market, than in Germany.\n\nThe ifo index for IT service providers reflects the macroeconomic mood. In the course of 2023, the balance value of the index declined from 25.9 to 16.3 points. The annual low of 12.9 points was reached in November. Although the assessment of the current business situation remained at a low level, the outlook for the coming months at least improved in December.\n\n#### IT MARKET GROWTH IN GERMANY in %\n\nImage /page/96/Figure/6 description: This image is a bar chart with the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 on the x-axis and values from 0 to 10 on the y-axis.

However, the impact of the war was no longer being felt to its full extent. Energy prices as well as inflation receded. Nevertheless, the mood in the economy as well as the actual economic data remained at a low level. The situation in the IT market was better, with high demand for services and software. The situation in the supply chains improved as well in the course of the year. However, noticeable reluctance to purchase was evident in the hardware segment, especially with regard to PC sales, particularly among medium-sized customers.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Bechtle Group performed well. In line with our forecast for the 2023 fiscal year, we recorded growth in the upper single-digit range. All in all, our company once again outperformed the IT market in the reporting period in terms of business volume and revenue growth. We were therefore also able to further expand our market share.\n\nApart from the challenges indicated, the Bechtle markets did not witness any significant events outside the company that had a noteworthy impact on the business performance.\n\n{98}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-98-0\"></span>**EARNINGS POSITION**\n\nThe economic framework conditions continued to be challenging in 2023. Especially in Germany, the mood and economic performance were encumbered. As a result, the willingness to invest – especially in larger and complex IT infrastructure projects – lagged behind expectations. Nevertheless, Bechtle was able to increase its business volume and revenue significantly. Particularly in our service business, we saw continually high demand. At the same time, the cost base went up in 2023 due to inflation. As well as in personnel expenses, there were also increases in energy expenses, vehicle expenses and travel expenses. We are proud to report that, despite these factors, we were able to improve our earnings significantly and keep the EBT margin at exactly the same level as in the prior year.\n\n#### ORDER POSITION\n\n**New basis for calculating the order backlog.** In the reporting period, Bechtle changed the way it calculates the order backlog. This change is associated with the introduction of a new group-wide standard input portal for incoming orders. This portal enables us to enter more comprehensive and more detailed data for the various transaction types, especially also for contracts with longer terms, some of which extend over several years. As a result, the order backlog is significantly higher than in prior years. Since the change to the new portal was within the course of the year, we are only going to publish the new incoming orders in our report for the first quarter of 2025. The new calculated order backlog will be reported starting with this annual report.\n\n**High order backlog.** For the sale of IT products and the provision of services, Bechtle concludes both short-term and long-term contractual relationships. The IT E-Commerce segment is characterised almost entirely by the conclusion of pure trading deals, usually with short order and delivery times. In the IT System House & Managed Services segment, project deals can take anywhere from several weeks to one year. Especially in the fields of managed services and cloud computing, the master and operating agreements that Bechtle concludes with customers often have terms of several years. Contract terms for as-a-service models, e.g. for the procurement of software, can also be longer than one year.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-99-0\"></span>GESCHÄFTSVOLUMEN in Mio. €\n\n5.374,5\n\n5.819,2\n\n0 1.000 2.000 3.000 4.000 5.000 6.000 7.000 8.000\n\nIn the reporting period, incoming orders amounted to €7,488 million, about 6.7 per cent more than the prior-year figure of €7,017 million. This figure comprises an increase in incoming orders by 9.6 per cent from €4,587 million to €5,027 million in the IT System House & Managed Services segment and by 1.3 per cent from €2,430 million to €2,460 million in the IT E-Commerce segment. 2022\n\nThe order backlog was reduced substantially in the reporting period. Based on the new calculation, it amounted to €2,146 million as of the end of the year, after €2,452 million in the prior year. Of this amount, the IT System House & Managed Services segment accounted for €1,913 million (prior year: €2,117 million), and the IT E-Commerce segment for €305 million (prior year: €407 million). The order backlog is about four and a half months in the IT System House & Managed Services segment and less than two months in the E-Commerce segment.\n\n#### BUSINESS VOLUME\n\n**Higher business volume.** The business volume is an alternative performance indicator which Bechtle introduced in the context of the change in the presentation of the revenue pursuant to IFRS 15. This indicator describes the recorded revenue on a gross basis, i.e. without a reduction for software revenues as an agent in accordance with IFRS 15.\n\nIn the fiscal year, the business volume amounted to €7,793.6 million, 7.0 per cent more than in the prior year (€7,285.7 million).\n\nImage /page/99/Figure/8 description: This image shows a horizontal bar chart titled \"BUSINESS VOLUME\" in euros millions. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 8,000. The y-axis shows the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. The business volume for 2019 is 5,374.5. The business volume for 2020 is 5,819.2. The business volume for 2021 is 6,245.8. The business volume for 2022 is 7,285.7. The business volume for 2023 is 7,793.6, which is an increase of 7.0%.\n\n{100}------------------------------------------------\n\n**(+ 6,5 %)**\n\n#### REVENUE PERFORMANCE\n\n**Significant revenue growth.** Despite the very challenging framework conditions, revenue increased by 6.5 per cent from €6,028.2 million to €6,422.7 million in the 2023 reporting period. The organic revenue growth amounted to 3.7 per cent.\n\nUMSATZ in Mio. €\n\n4.712,0\n\n5.050,3\n\n5.305,5\n\n6.028,2\n\n**6.422,7**\n\n<span id=\"page-100-0\"></span>0 1.000 2.000 3.000 4.000 5.000 6.000 7.000 8.000\n\n[See Notes,](#page-198-0) [Revenues,](#page-198-0) [page 199 f](#page-198-0)\n\nImage /page/100/Figure/4 description: This image shows a horizontal bar chart of revenue in millions of Euros from 2019 to 2023. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 8,000. The revenue for 2019 is 4,712.0. The revenue for 2020 is 5,050.3. The revenue for 2021 is 5,305.5. The revenue for 2022 is 6,028.2. The revenue for 2023 is 6,422.7, which is an increase of 6.5%.\n\n**Segment allocation of acquisitions abroad.** In the last two fiscal years, Bechtle has acquired system-integration service providers outside Germany, Austria and Switzerland in accordance with its expanded M&A strategy. In line with the new regional leadership responsibilities, most of these companies are allocated to the IT E-Commerce segment. In particular, this affects the company ACS Systems UK Ltd. in the UK, acquired in 2022, as well as the companies Tangible Benefit Ltd. in the UK, Prosol IngenierÍa S.L. and Prosol Iscat S.L. in Spain, and Apixit S.A.S. in France, which were acquired in 2023.\n\nThe two segments developed differently. While the revenue growth in the IT System House & Managed Services segment amounted to 13.5 per cent1, revenue in the IT E-Commerce segment receded by 5.1 per cent1. The growth rates of the German companies and of the international companies were closer to each other, at 7.1 per cent and 5.7 per cent, respectively, with Germany achieving slightly stronger growth.\n\nIn line with our acquisition strategy that is more focused on other European countries, we acquired five companies outside of Germany in the reporting period. Therefore, the organic revenue growth abroad amounted to –1.8 per cent. In Germany, we achieved organic growth of 7.1 per cent. In relation to the total revenue, the international companies accounted for a share of 37.8 per cent (prior year: 38.1 per cent). Accordingly, the domestic share amounted to 62.2 per cent (prior year: 61.9 per cent). Germany thus remains Bechtle's largest market.\n\nThe average number of full-time equivalents (FTE; without absentees and trainees) increased by 9.7 per cent, a rate higher than that of the revenue growth. Based on 13,026 full-time equivalents (prior year: 11,878), the revenue per employee thus amounted to €493 thousand, after €508 thousand in the prior year.\n\n{101}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### COST AND EARNINGS PERFORMANCE\n\n#### **Significant EBT increase.**\n\n[See Notes,](#page-199-0) [Expense structure,](#page-199-0) [page 200 f](#page-199-0)\n\n**Cost of sales.** In 2023, gross earnings went up by 6.5 per cent from €1,053.4 million in the prior year to €1,121.9 million in the year under review, growth similar to that of revenue. Compared to revenue, the cost of sales went up at a slightly higher rate of 6.6 per cent. Material costs increased by 5.4 per cent, a rate significantly lower than that of the revenue growth. This disproportionately low increase was able to largely compensate for the significantly disproportionaly large increases of the other expense positions. Personnel expenses, which are included in the cost of sales, increased by 15.4 per cent. Other operating expenses also underwent an increase of 12.8 per cent. In the reporting period, the gross margin thus amounted to 17.5 per cent, a level that corresponds to that of the prior year.\n\n#### COST OF SALES/GROSS EARNINGS\n\n|                |    | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|----------------|----|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Cost of sales  | €m | 5,300.8 | 4,974.8 | 4,385.5 | 4,193.8 | 3,944.2 |\n| Gross earnings | €m | 1,121.9 | 1,053.4 | 920.0   | 856.6   | 767.8   |\n| Gross margin   | %  | 17.5    | 17.5    | 17.3    | 17.0    | 16.3    |\n\n[See People at Bechtle,](#page-63-0) [page 64](#page-63-0) **Distribution costs and administrative expenses.** The expenses in the two functional areas of sales and administration developed differently. In the fiscal year, distribution costs underwent above-average growth of 11.1 per cent to €436.7 million, after €393.0 million in the prior year. The distribution cost ratio was 6.8 per cent, after 6.5 per cent in the prior year. Administrative expenses increased at a disproportionately low rate of 4.7 per cent from €340.8 million to €356.8 million, especially as a result of the disproportionately low increase in personnel expenses. The administrative expense ratio was 5.6 per cent, after 5.7 per cent in the prior year. Other operating expenses underwent a very substantial increase in both functional areas. This was due especially to the higher travel expenses, vehicle expenses, higher building expenses due to the rise in energy costs, as well as marketing expenses. In the reporting period, other operating income went up by 50.3 per cent from €35.9 million to €53.9 million. The almost exclusive reason for this surge was the increase in additional vendor grants for marketing measures for the roll-out of the digital transformation in the context of new IT infrastructures and technologies. However, we do not expect payments in the same amount in this fiscal year.\n\n#### DISTRIBUTION COSTS/ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n\n|                                | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  | 2019  |\n|--------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Distribution costs €m          | 436.7 | 393.0 | 345.2 | 319.2 | 306.6 |\n| Distribution cost ratio %      | 6.8   | 6.5   | 6.5   | 6.3   | 6.5   |\n| Administrative expenses €m     | 356.8 | 340.8 | 282.6 | 286.5 | 249.6 |\n| Administrative expense ratio % | 5.6   | 5.7   | 5.3   | 5.7   | 5.3   |\n\n**Earnings.** EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.

This was due to factors such as the seven acquisitions that took place in the reporting period, which resulted in an increase of 41.7 per cent in amortisation of customer bases. However, the depreciation of property, plant and equipment again accounted for the bulk of the depreciation and amortisation figure, amounting to €93.4 million, after €80.7 million<sup>1</sup> in the prior year. 2019 **104 SEGMENT REPORT** \n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500\n\n236,3\n\nEarnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) improved by 7.6 per cent to €382.3 million, after €355.4 million in the prior year.

In the reporting period, seven acquisitions and the first-time issue of a convertible bond caused some significant shifts in individual positions. Overall, however, the structure of the balance sheet and the key indicators remain largely unchanged. Bechtle shows financial strength and is a rock-solid partner for customers and for the financial market, especially in these times of uncertainty. This is also underlined by our strong equity ratio and our extremely comfortable liquidity situation.\n\nWhere we provide structural indicators in connection with the assets position or the working capital, we do so on the basis of the business volume.\n\nImage /page/107/Picture/7 description: The image shows the text \"For the assets position of the segments, see Notes, page 243 f\" along with a small icon of a book in the upper right corner.\n\n**Strong, sound balance sheet.** In the reporting period, the balance sheet total of the Bechtle Group climbed to €3,803.2 million, an increase of 10.3 per cent.\n\n| CONDENSED BALANCE SHEET |         |         |         |         |         | €m |\n|-------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|----|\n|                         | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |    |\n| Assets                  |         |         |         |         |         |    |\n| Non-current assets      | 1,427.3 | 1,115.2 | 984.2   | 958.9   | 846.4   |    |\n| Current assets          | 2,375.9 | 2,332.7 | 2,035.6 | 1,728.2 | 1,548.3 |    |\n| Equity and liabilities  |         |         |         |         |         |    |\n| Equity                  | 1,742.6 | 1,538.3 | 1,353.1 | 1,162.0 | 1,014.8 |    |\n| Non-current liabilities | 784.9   | 464.9   | 499.5   | 599.9   | 566.7   |    |\n| Current liabilities     | 1,275.7 | 1,444.6 | 1,167.1 | 925.2   | 813.1   |    |\n| Balance sheet total     | 3,803.2 | 3,447.9 | 3,019.8 | 2,687.1 | 2,394.7 |    |\n\nOn the assets side, non-current assets increased by 28.0 per cent to €1,427.3 million as of the reporting date. Goodwill accounted for the bulk of non-current assets. Also due to acquisitions, this item underwent an increase of 32.1 per cent or €178.1 million to €732.3 million in the reporting period. As a result of acquisitions and investments, property, plant and equipment climbed by €76.3 million or 20.9 per cent to €441.8 million. Other intangible assets, too, went up by 17.8 per cent to €117.5 million, largely as a result of acquisitions. The item \"investments accounted for using the equity method\" in the amount of €32.5 million was newly added as of the investment in PLANET AI.\n\nAt €95.2 million, the amount spent on investments was higher than the prior-year figure of €82.0 million. The investment ratio increased from 26.0 per cent to 27.0 per cent. However, conventional investments merely amounted to approximately €75 million, i.e. the bottom end of our forecast (€75 million to €85 million). About €20 million accounted for capitalised leasing items that we had to include in our balance sheet in accordance with IFRS for sales financing.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs of the reporting date of 31 December 2023, the capitalisation ratio increased to 37.5 per cent (prior year: 32.3 per cent). The coverage of the non-current assets by the equity amounted to 122.1 per cent, after 137.9 per cent in the prior year.\n\n**Liquidity for further growth.** Current assets increased slightly by 1.9 per cent to €2,375.9 million. As expected, inventories were reduced considerably, namely 27.6 per cent to €439.8 million (prior year: €607.7 million). Accordingly, the share of the inventories in the balance sheet total went down from 17.6 per cent to 11.6 per cent. Due to the implementation of central receivables management, but also due to the weaker year-end business, trade receivables declined by 4.0 per cent to €1,157.6 million. In the reporting period, receivables (DSO – days sales outstanding) decreased slightly from 41.1 to 40.9 days. Other assets increased by 40.3 per cent or €83.7 million. This development reflects the higher bonus payments from suppliers. Due to, amongst other things, the issue of convertible bonds, cash and cash equivalents surged by €206.2 million.\n\nBechtle's liquidity including time deposits and securities is at a very comfortable level of €465.8 million. Bechtle thus has sufficient funds to finance both organic growth and growth through acquisitions.\n\nThe working capital underwent a significant decline of 18.1 per cent to €800.1 million. In relation to the business volume, the figure went down by 13.4 per cent to 10.3 per cent. This item was affected positively especially by the reduction of inventories as well as the decline in trade receivables.\n\n#### WORKING CAPITAL\n\n|                       | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  | 2019  |\n|-----------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Working capital<br>€m | 800.1 | 976.6 | 725.9 | 652.5 | 647.7 |\n| % of business volume  | 10.3  | 13.4  | 11.6  | 11.2  | 12.1  |\n\nOn the liabilities side, non-current liabilities increased from €464.9 million in the prior year to €784.9 million as of the reporting date. This change is attributable especially to the financial liabilities, which underwent a surge from €261.9 million to €524.1 million as a result of the issue of convertible bonds. The share of non-current liabilities in the balance sheet total thus increased from 13.5 per cent to 20.6 per cent.\n\nCurrent liabilities went down by 11.7 per cent from €1,444.6 million to €1,275.7 million. This development reflects the slump in current financial liabilities from €111.4 million to €16.4 million, due to the repayment of short-term loans as well as the decline in trade payables by €69.8 million to €629.2 million.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-109-0\"></span>**ASSETS POSITION**\n\n**Equity ratio at high level.** In the reporting period, the equity grew by 13.3 per cent to €1,742.6 million. This was due to the increase of €177.6 million in retained earnings. The equity ratio underwent a year-on-year increase from 44.6 per cent to 45.8 per cent. In the reporting period, the equity ratio amounted to 17.2 per cent, after 18.6 per cent in the prior year.\n\n| RETURN ON EQUITY AND RETURN ON ASSETS | %    |      |      |      |      |\n|---------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                                       | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Return on equity                      | 17.2 | 18.6 | 20.4 | 19.5 | 19.8 |\n| Return on assets                      | 8.4  | 8.5  | 9.0  | 8.3  | 8.5  |\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the debt ratio dropped from 124.1 per cent to 118.3 per cent. The net debt also improved to €74.8 million, after €83.7 million in the prior year. Thus, it remained on a very comfortable level.\n\nIn the reporting period, the return on assets, which indicates the return on the entire capital employed, decreased slightly from 8.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent.\n\nIn the business of Bechtle, which does not involve a great deal of property, plant and equipment, the ROCE (return on capital employed) is affected by the development of current assets and liabilities, on the one hand, and the earnings performance, on the other. In the reporting period, the ROCE thus amounted to 18.9 per cent, after 20.1 per cent in the prior year.\n\n#### ROCE/CAPITAL EMPLOYED\n\n|                     | 2023    | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|---------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| ROCE %              | 18.9    | 20.1    | 22.2    | 19.8    | 18.7    |\n| Capital employed €m | 2,017.7 | 1,767.0 | 1,469.6 | 1,395.4 | 1,288.7 |\n\n#### VALUE INFORMATION\n\nImage /page/109/Picture/10 description: The image shows a book icon above the text \"See Notes, page 231 ff\". The book icon is an open book with two pages visible.\n\nIn almost all cases, the fair value of the current assets and liabilities corresponds to the carrying amount. Within the scope of the non-current assets, intangible assets with a limited useful life, property, plant and equipment as well as trade receivables, income tax receivables, other assets as well as time deposits and deferred taxes are measured at amortised cost. The carrying amounts of the goodwill and of the brands presented under other intangible assets (except for Inmac Wstore and ARP, which are subject to scheduled amortisation) are reviewed for impairment by means of annual impairment tests on the basis of the value in use. As the values in use significantly exceeded the carrying amounts, no impairment was applied to these assets. Non-current liabilities are carried at amortised cost.\n\n[For value in use of](#page-205-0) [the goodwill, see Notes,](#page-205-0) [page 206 f](#page-205-0)\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### E U TA X O N O M Y D I S C L O S U R E S F O R T H E 2 0 2 3 F I S C A L Y E A R\n\nIn accordance with Art. 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the European Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 and the delegated acts adopted thereunder (below: EU Taxonomy), companies subject to non-financial reporting obligations have been required to make disclosures on environmentally sustainable revenues, capital expenditures (CapEx) and operational expenditures (OpEx) since the 2021 financial year. Business activities are \"environmentally sustainable\" in the meaning of the Taxonomy Regulation if they meet the following criteria: An activity is only considered to be sustainable if it contributes substantially to at least one of the following six objectives of the EU Taxonomy:\n\n� Climate change mitigation,\n\n- � climate change adaptation,\n- � sustainable use and protection of water resources,\n- � transition to a circular economy,\n- � pollution prevention and\n- � protection of ecosystems and biodiversity.\n\nAt the same time, the activity must not harm any of the other environmental objectives (\"do no significant harm\" – DNSH). Moreover, minimum social safeguards (MSS) must be implemented to comply with basic social, labour and human rights standards.\n\nThe regulation distinguishes between \"taxonomy-eligible\" and \"taxonomy-aligned\" activities. Activities are considered to be eligible if they can be mapped to the technical assessment criteria. If they actually meet these criteria, they are considered to be aligned.\n\nBechtle's core activities comprise IT services and the trading business with IT products, which account for the lion's share of our business volume. However, as the regulations do not consider the trading-only business, the business activities relevant in the context of the EU taxonomy only concern secondary activities, not Bechtle's core business. For 2023, we therefore do not report any business volume, but only capital expenditure (CapEx), as we do not have any EU taxonomy-relevant activities.\n\nMoreover, we do not present the operating expenditure (OpEx), as only operating expenses for maintenance and short-term leases would be relevant, but are insignificant and, according to the FAQ on Art. 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation, do not need to be reported. We consider all six environmental objectives, especially climate protection and climate change adaptation. For the full application of the taxonomy, the technical audit and DNSH criteria were taken into consideration.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Description of the activities.** The first step was the identification of the business activities relevant for Bechtle. In an initial phase, this meant identifying those that fulfil the preconditions for taxonomy eligibility and alignment. In a second phase, the figures for the CapEx were determined. At Bechtle, taxonomy-related activities can be found in the areas of mobility and property.\n\nIn the second step, we conducted a qualitative climate risk analysis of the activities and our business activity by assessing the probability of occurrence and the damage impact of previously identified climate risks and classifying them in a three-stage scale. In the 2024 fiscal year, we are going to conduct a comprehensive climate risk analysis in line with the requirements of the ESRS standards and under consideration of the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.\n\n**Process description of the data collection.** The data collection for the report according to the EU taxonomy was performed in the system on the basis of the financial reporting. The plausibility check then took place with a bottom-up approach in which we listed all CapEx on the basis of the relevant company codes. We will automate the internal systems in the medium run in order to reduce the workload for collecting the needed data.\n\nUnlike in the report for 2021 financial year, we have reported CapEx since the 2022 fiscal year without construction in progress (CIP), as CIP and down payments made are only taken into consideration once a building is completed.

The capital expenditure presented elsewhere in the Annual Report 2023 excludes capitalised rights of use pursuant to IFRS. As Bechtle does not obtain property or comparable rights here, rights of use are not – in the strictest sense of the term – considered capital expenditure. In the calculation of the EU taxonomy, we include capitalised rights of use pursuant to IFRS in the total capital expenditure, as activities pertaining to property and the vehicle fleet greatly influence our sustainability efforts and impact. This explains the deviation in total capital expenditure.\n\n**ASSETS POSITION**\n\nImage /page/112/Picture/2 description: Three people are standing behind a counter in what appears to be a break room or bistro.

Additionally, numerous measures to optimise the working capital and cash flow quickly yielded noticeable effects. Alongside this operational development, the first-time issue of a convertible bond has also meant that the liquidity situation in the group is very comfortable. All of this represents the basis for the further profitable growth of the Bechtle Group.\n\n#### CASH FLOW STATEMENT\n\n[See Assets position,](#page-107-0) [page 108 ff](#page-107-0)\n\n**Operating cash flow reaches new record.** In 2023, the cash flow from operating activities amounted to €459.0 million. This was not only significantly above the prior-year figure of €116.7 million, it also represented a new record. This development is attributable mainly to the changes in net assets. In the reporting period, Bechtle recorded positive changes in trade receivables, in particular. The reduction of trade receivables in the reporting period amounted to €102.7 million. In the prior year, this figure had amounted to –€248.5 million. This clearly shows the positive effect of our measures to optimise receivables management. The stock levels that had gone up due to the problems in the supply chains in 2021 and 2022 were gradually reduced in the reporting period. The change in inventories amounted to €175.7 million in the reporting period, resulting in a positive effect on the cash flow from operating activities (prior year: –€93.7 million). The item of trade payables amounted to –€97.6 million, after €56.7 million in the prior year.\n\nImage /page/113/Picture/9 description: The image shows a book icon above the text \"See Notes, page 229 f\".\n\nThe cash flow from investing activities amounted to –€282.6 million, after –€224.3 million in the prior year. One of the main reasons for this was the much higher outflow for acquisitions, which climbed by €131.3 million to €223.4 million. On the other hand, we recorded an inflow of €60 million for the purchase of time deposits and securities (prior year: €0).\n\nThe cash flow from financing activities as well was positive and amounted to €28.2 million, after −€100.2 million in the prior year. This was due especially to the issue of convertible bonds, which impacted the cash received from the assumption of financial liabilities in the amount of €298.0 million. The cash paid for the repayment of financial liabilities amounted to –€108.1 million. Furthermore, the dividend payment resulted in a change of –€81.9 million.\n\nThe development of the free cash flow in the reporting period was very positive resulting in €151.2 million after −€29.8 million in the prior year. Although the payments for acquisitions as well as for investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment increased, this development was more than offset by the impressive progress of the operating cash flow.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Image: book icon               |\n|--------------------------------|\n| See Notes,                     |\n| page 193 ff and<br>page 231 ff |\n\n|                           | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019  |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|\n| Cash flow from            |        |        |        |        |       |\n| operating activities      | 459.0  | 116.7  | 284.5  | 317.5  | 186.0 |\n| investing activities      | -282.6 | -224.3 | -42.9  | -146.5 | -72.1 |\n| financing activities      | 28.2   | -100.2 | -179.4 | -78.7  | -89.7 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | 435.8  | 229.6  | 431.8  | 363.2  | 272.2 |\n| Free cash flow            | 151.2  | -29.8  | 218.6  | 204.1  | 109.5 |\n\nThe main conditions of the financial liabilities are explained in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Due to the secondary importance of financial earnings to the Bechtle Group, a change in interest rates would not have any major impact on the financial position.\n\nAt Bechtle group, off-balance-sheet financing instruments primarily concern operating leases. Details are presented in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nCurrently, the Executive Board of Bechtle AG does not see any signs of liquidity bottlenecks for the group. There are sufficient financial resources for further organic growth and growth through acquisitions.\n\n### FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES\n\n**Financial independence.** The objective of Bechtle's financial policy is to keep the group's financial power at a high level, thereby retaining the company's financial independence by ensuring adequate liquidity. At the same time, risks are to be avoided as far as possible or hedged effectively. For example, the Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board prohibit any kind of speculative forward transactions. This applies especially to currencies, goods and securities as well as forward transactions associated with these, unless they serve the hedging of ongoing business operations.\n\nAs a matter of principle, Bechtle uses derivative financial instruments exclusively for hedging its operating activities. In the reporting period, the company mainly made use of currency futures. Through the hedging of purchase and sale transactions in non-group currencies, the exchange rate risk from the cash flows is minimised in the income statement. One of the main areas the finance management concentrates on is the hedging of net investments in foreign operations. The hedging compensates for exchange rate fluctuations against the Swiss franc, the British pound, the Polish złoty, the Czech koruna and the Hungarian forint from the translation of the equity of the foreign subsidiaries in the group equity.\n\nCASH FLOW €m\n\nImage /page/114/Picture/11 description: The image shows a simple line drawing of an open book. The book is oriented vertically, with the spine on the left. The pages are slightly fanned open, revealing several lines of text on each page. The lines of text are represented by short, horizontal lines stacked on top of each other.\n\n[See Notes,](#page-225-0)  [page 226](#page-225-0)\n\n[See Notes,](#page-253-0)  [Operating leases,](#page-253-0)  [page 254](#page-253-0)\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-115-0\"></span>In the investment of excess liquidity, quick availability is more important than maximum yield, e.g. in order to be able to access available cash and cash equivalents in the event of acquisitions or major project pre-financing measures. Thus, purely financial goals – such as the optimisation of the financial income – are subordinate to the acquisition strategy and the company growth. This financial flexibility forms the basis for Bechtle's success in a highly consolidating market. The liquidity situation is centrally managed and monitored by the treasury.\n\nInvestment business is only conducted with investment-grade debtors. For time deposits within the European Union, investments with a deposit guarantee are preferred. As such a guarantee only exists to a limited extent in Switzerland, we only make investments in this country with banks with an excellent credit rating.\n\n### **STRATEGIC FINANCING MEASURES**\n\n**High equity ratio.** In 2023, the current business and necessary replacement investments were financed with cash and cash equivalents and the operating cash flow. The funds required for the acquisitions in the fiscal year ended were covered partly by cash and cash equivalents and partly debt-financed. The acquisitions made as well as future acquisitions were financed successfully by means of the issue of a convertible bond in the amount of €300 million.\n\nAt 45.8 per cent, the equity ratio remained at a very high level (prior year: 44.6 per cent). It forms the basis for our financial flexibility and independence. For instance, it enables us to make use of any acquisition opportunities that arise at short notice. Moreover, it enables us to respond to current circumstances in a timely and flexible manner. Apart from time deposits and securities worth €30.0 million, Bechtle therefore holds funds in the amount of €435.8 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nMoreover, there are a confirmed bilateral credit lines with eight banks totalling about €400 million. Thus, Bechtle has secured adequate liquidity by means of various financing sources.\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-116-0\"></span>**OVERALL ASSESSMENT**\n\n**Forecast fulfilled.** As previously, the Executive Board of Bechtle AG considers the company's economic position as of the reporting date to be good. Despite the known challenging framework conditions and the difficult mood especially in Germany, the figures of the 2023 reporting period underline the vigour and crisis resilience of Bechtle's business model. Once again, this proves the company's economic strength and reliability. In 2023, Bechtle fulfilled all forecasts made on the basis of the 2022 fiscal year, although macroeconomic development was deteriorating in the course of the year.\n\n#### COMPARISON OF THE ACTUAL AND PROJECTED BUSINESS PERFORMANCE\n\n|                              | Forecast AR 2022                                                              | Actual 2023                      | Comparison |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------|\n| Business volume              | Significant increase<br>over 2022                                             | Growth: 7.0%                     | Fulfilled  |\n| Revenue                      | Significant increase<br>over 2022                                             | Growth: 6.5%                     | Fulfilled  |\n| Cost of sales                | Increase more or<br>less in line with<br>revenue increase                     | Growth: 6.6%                     | Fulfilled  |\n| Gross margin                 | > 17%                                                                         | 17.5%                            | Fulfilled  |\n| Distribution cost ratio      | < 7%                                                                          | 6.8%                             | Fulfilled  |\n| Administrative expense ratio | < 6%                                                                          | 5.6%                             | Fulfilled  |\n| EBT                          | Increase more or<br>less in line with<br>revenue increase                     | Growth: 6.8%                     | Fulfilled  |\n| EBT margin                   | More or less at<br>prior-year level                                           | 5.8%                             | Fulfilled  |\n| Dividend                     | Dividend payout<br>ratio of about one<br>third of the earnings<br>after taxes | Dividend payout<br>ratio: 33.2%* | Fulfilled  |\n\n\\* Subject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-117-0\"></span>**OPPORTUNITY AND RISK REPORT**\n\nOpportunities and risks are inextricably linked in entrepreneurial activity. The courageous seizing of opportunities is inevitably accompanied by risks, while missing or overlooking opportunities also represents a risk. Opportunity and risk management at Bechtle forms the basis for identifying and utilising the opportunities for profitable growth that present themselves to us, while at the same time, recognising and appropriately assessing the associated risks at an early stage. We are not currently aware of any risks that could jeopardise the continued existence of the company, either alone or in combination.\n\n### **OPPORTUNITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT**\n\nMore than ever, our industry is in a phase of drastic change. Accordingly, to engage in business operations and make use of opportunities, it is necessary to take risks. To ensure Bechtle's success, we have taken the needed precautions by establishing efficient opportunity and risk management. We already record and assess many opportunities in the context of the risk management system. Thus, all statements made below concerning risk management largely apply to opportunity management as well. However, opportunities that are not linked to any risk are also identified. The leaner opportunity management of Bechtle that has been established for this purpose is derived mainly from the strategy of the business segments, from their goals and from the Vision 2030. Direct responsibility for the early and continuous identification, measurement and management of opportunities lies primarily with the Group Executive Board and the operational management level in the respective business segments and holding companies with the Executive Vice Presidents, Vice Presidents and Managing Directors. Like the risk management, these tasks are an integral part of the corporate planning and control system. The management of the Bechtle Group puts a lot of emphasis on detailed evaluations and comprehensive scenarios concerning the market and competitive position as well as critical success factors for the company's performance. From this information, it derives the potential for specific opportunities for the individual business segments. These are discussed in planning meetings between the Executive Board and the executives with operating responsibility, and suitable measures and targets are agreed in order to make use of this potential.\n\n[See Vision, strategy](#page-46-0) [and governance,](#page-46-0)\n\n[page 47 ff](#page-46-0)\n\n{118}------------------------------------------------\n\nBechtle defines risk management as the entirety of all organisational arrangements and measures to identify risks and manage them. The main objective of risk management is to effectively and proactively ensure the company's going concern on a long-term basis. This is achieved by means of the timely identification of risks, their measurement and the initiation of suitable risk control measures. In this way, the company endeavours to avoid risks or to avert or minimise harmful consequences of the occurrence of a particular risk for the company. The measurements range from minor risks to material and existential risks.\n\n#### ORGANISATION\n\nIn line with the organisational structure of the Bechtle Group, risk management clearly distinguishes between duties and responsibilities of the group holding/intermediate holdings and of the operational subsidiaries and individual management areas. Group controlling has established a reporting system that enables early identification of developments that threaten the company's success. Apart from the provision of various analysis tools for the operational units, the insights gained from periodic analyses and statistics support effective risk management in the individual areas. The Managing Directors and Business Unit Leaders thus bear a substantial part of the responsibility for the active risk management. This basic principle also corresponds with the decentralised business model and the management philosophy of Bechtle. Compared to the prior year, the risk management organisation did not undergo any material changes.\n\nThe risk management organisation of the Bechtle Group primarily performs two functions:\n\n�**The early detection system:** Early detection systems are instruments that identify risks and opportunities of an enterprise early enough to enable reactions to ward off the risks and make use of opportunities. Early detection indicators enable the detection and analysis of latent risks over time. This requires systematic risk identification, risk measurement and risk communication. In this area, Bechtle benefits from the robust interaction of various supporting systems and instruments. The auditor within the context of the annual financial statements also assesses whether the Executive Board has, in a suitable manner, taken the steps required in accordance with Section 91 (2) AktG and whether the monitoring system to be established thereunder can fulfil the tasks for which it was created.\n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\n**risikomanagementsystem**\n\n**risikofrüherkennungssystem**\n\nRisikosteuerung\n\nRisikokommunikation Risikosteuerung\n\nRisikokommunikation\n\n**risikobewältigung**\n\n**120**\n\n� **The monitoring system:** At Bechtle, the internal monitoring system is responsible for monitoring the risk management system. It consists of process-independent and process-specific monitoring Unabhängige measures. Process-independent means that the respective monitoring entity is not integrated in Über-Kontrollen to rische the risk management process and is not responsible for its outcome. On the other hand, there are wachungsprocess-specific monitoring entities that are integrated in the risk management process. The process-independent monitoring entity audits the risk management system, is informed about significant changes, plans and regulations and may, if necessary, request additional information. The system audit takes place once a year. The risk management system is audited for correctness, appropriateness and efficiency on the basis of samples. At Bechtle, the process-dependent monitoring measures are subdivided into organisational security measures, such as the separation of functions and access restrictions as well as controls. The latter are taken care of by the individual operational areas and the person responsible for risk management. funktion Maßnahmen Organisa-\n\nRisikobewertung\n\nImage /page/119/Figure/3 description: This image is a flowchart that describes a risk management system. The flowchart starts with a box at the top labeled \"Risk management system\". This box has three branches: \"Internal monitoring system\", \"Early risk detection system\", and \"Risk handling\". The \"Internal monitoring system\" branch has two sub-branches: \"Process-independent monitoring measures\" and \"Process-specific monitoring measures\". The \"Process-independent monitoring measures\" branch has a sub-branch labeled \"Independent monitoring function\".

Important instruments for organising and controlling the necessary flow of information are therefore the committees and the various teamwork formats at different management levels. At the top level of the Bechtle Group, this comprises the Supervisory Board, Executive Board and risk management meetings. At management level, these are primarily the meetings of the Executive Vice Presidents, Vice Presidents and management and strategy meetings, planning and individual discussions as well as more informal management meetings with the Executive Board.\n\n#### INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nIn accordance with Section 315 (4) of the German Commercial Code (HGB), capital market-oriented companies must address the key features of the internal control and risk management system (ICS) with regard to the Group accounting process in the Group management report. In this regard, Bechtle uses the definition of the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW). According to this definition, an [idw.de](https://idw.de) ICS consists of the principles, procedures and measures that management introduces in the company for the organisational implementation of the decisions of the management. The tasks and goals of the ICS are as follows:\n\nidw.de\n\n- � To ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the business activity. This also includes the protection of tangible and intangible assets as well as the prevention and/or detection of financial losses that may be caused by own employees or third parties;\n- � To ensure the correctness and reliability of the internal and external accounting;\n- � To comply with the legal regulations applicable to the company.\n\nThe principles, the structural and process organisation and the processes of the accounting-related ICS are outlined in policies and organisational instructions that are continually adjusted in line with the latest external and internal developments. The controls defined throughout the group are outlined in a group accounting manual. The requirements in the guidelines and organisational instructions are based on statutory standards as well as on voluntarily defined corporate standards.\n\nWith respect to the financial accounting, this ensures that business transactions and facts are fully and duly identified, processed and reflected in the accounts, thereby ensuring correct accounting.\n\n{121}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-121-0\"></span>E F F E C T I V E N E S S O F T H E I N T E R N A L C O N T R O L A N D RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\\*\n\nThe internal control system and the risk management system are dynamic systems that are continuously adapted to changes in the business model, the type and scope of business transactions or responsibilities. As a result, internal and external audits can reveal potential for improvement in individual cases with regard to the appropriateness and effectiveness of controls, e.g. in the reporting year in the field of general IT controls. With regard to the measurement of these management systems, the Executive Board has no evidence that they are inadequate or ineffective in their entirety.\n\n#### RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT\n\nTo pinpoint all risks relevant to Bechtle as comprehensively as possible, the company uses a risk pool. The risk pool describes all potential risks that the Bechtle Group is able to identify. Within the scope of a CSR risk assessment, this also includes any non-financial risks identified. To identify risks correctly, Bechtle makes use of risk measurement forms. These are used to structure various risk types in the form of a checklist. The content of this list can be adapted and supplemented by the stakeholders involved in risk identification and measurement, in order to take any peculiarities of individual business areas into consideration.\n\nThe risk measurement form, which contains risks from the risk pool and whose purpose is to map possible risks as comprehensively as possible, serves as the basis for the risk assessment: each risk is assessed for probability of occurrence and expected damage amount (risk potential) and, within the risk analysis, is positioned in a risk matrix indicating the significance (A, B and C risks). The result is an additive presentation of all identified risks in the form of qualified overviews, both for Bechtle as a group and for each of its business segments. Within the context of the risk assessment, the Bechtle Group performs a net measurement of certain risks (risk measurement after initiation of specific measures). For this process, lump-sum figures are used for main and individual risks. The gross measurement serves as the basis for calculating the risk-bearing capacity. The risk capacity describes the financial potential of the Bechtle Group to absorb any losses that may result from the occurrence of the identified business risks. The result of this calculation for the query from the fourth quarter of 2023 was that the share of the total risk position in the risk-bearing capacity is a comfortable 43.3 per cent.\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### RISK CONTROL\n\nAs a matter of principle, the individual operational units are responsible for the risk control. The company responds to identified risks on a case-by-case basis and with different strategies.\n\n� **Risk avoidance:** refraining from activities involving risks may mean that opportunities cannot be used either\n\n- � **Risk reduction:** reduction of the average probability of occurrence and/or of the amount of the loss\n- � **Risk transfer:** transfer of the risk to another (insurance) company\n- � **Risk acceptance:** acceptance of the risk without taking countermeasures\n\n#### RISK REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION\n\nThe management of the Bechtle Group holds risk management meetings at least once a year, the formal requirements of which are constantly reviewed and supplemented by the risk situation of new subject areas. In addition to the risk management meetings of the Bechtle Group, separate meetings at which the risks are explicitly discussed and continuously reassessed with the responsible individuals are held for each segment and executive division. The members of the Executive Board attend the meetings of the essential operative units as well as the group's meeting completely. The Executive Vice Presidents, Vice Presidents and individual employees entrusted with controlling and risk management tasks also take part in the meetings. Thus, all areas and responsibilities that are important for the company's success are involved in the risk management process. At quarterly intervals, this group receives a status query in which the previous measurement of risks is reviewed and any new risks are queried. In addition to the standard reporting and measurement of risks at these meetings, there is an arrangement for ad hoc reporting. This ensures that critical issues are communicated immediately to the Executive Board and subsequently to the responsible committees (Audit Committee, Supervisory Board) and the other persons involved in the risk management process.\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-123-0\"></span>SUSTAINABILITY RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nIn the 2022 fiscal year, Bechtle expanded the processes for identifying and measuring sustainability risks. Compliance with new legal obligations and other requirements, such as the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC), played a central role here.\n\nBechtle defines sustainability risks as risks for the company associated with social and environmental factors (outside-in perspective) as well as possible ecological and social effects of the company's own business activities that have a negative impact on the environment (inside-out perspective). The company defines sustainability opportunities as the potentially positive ecological and social effects of its own business activities on the outside.\n\nThe survey for sustainability risk management is carried out in a separate questionnaire, but on a quarterly basis, analogous to the classic risk surveys. For the identification of sustainability risks, Bechtle makes use of a separate sustainability risk pool that consists of two parts: � Outside-in perspective of sustainability risks;\n\n� Inside-out perspective of sustainability risks – these result from the four thematic areas of our Sustainability Strategy 2030: ethical business, environment, people and digital future.\n\nFor the two perspectives shown, the sustainability risks are measured differently. While the measurement of sustainability risks from the outside-in perspective is based on the measurement of traditional risk management, the measurement of sustainability risks from the inside-out perspective only follows this in part. From an inside-out perspective, sustainability risks are generally assessed according to the two known dimensions: the probability of occurrence and the risk impact (\"loss amount\"). The definition of the classes of probability of occurrence takes place in the same way as in the conventional risk management system. However, a separate measurement logic referred to as the \"severity\" of the risk is employed for assessing the risk impact (\"loss amount\"). This severity is made up of measurements of the extent, scope and irreversibility of a potential risk materialising. All identified sustainability risks are summarised in a risk matrix.\n\nThe individual units are responsible for monitoring the sustainability risks and controlling any actions to address these risks. The sustainability risk reporting is presented in a separate section under \"Risks\".\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-124-0\"></span>**OPPORTUNITIES**\n\n### MARKET AND COMPETITION\n\nLike every company, Bechtle is subject to developments in the industry and the economy as a whole. Obviously, a positive economic development presents opportunities for further successful company growth. But even if the overall economy or the industry stagnates or declines, Bechtle has the opportunity to grow faster than the market and thus expand its relative market share. Bechtle once again proved to be very resilient in the reporting period, particularly in view of the weak macroeconomic development. Although the reluctance of medium-sized customers, in particular, also had an impact on us, Bechtle was able to develop positively overall in an extremely difficult environment. The general demand for IT driven by the digital transformation, our international presence in 14 European country markets, our broad solution expertise and the diversity of customer groups and sizes were the basis for this. Demand for IT solutions was high across Europe, driven in particular by the Public Sector division in the reporting period and, in terms of technology, by strong demand for network solutions.\n\nThe IT market is characterised by rapid technological innovation and relatively short product cycles. Due to the digitisation, information technology is becoming increasingly important. IT is therefore an integral part of operational value creation and a decisive success factor for all companies and public institutions. This has been shown, in particular, by the experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, due to the complexity of IT, many enterprises need competent partners for the successful and secure operation of their IT infrastructures, increasingly also in the field of high-quality services such as managed or cloud services. Most customers also rely on the expertise of an experienced partner for questions relating to the use of artificial intelligence (AI), the implications of which are not yet fully foreseeable. Therefore, the markets addressed by Bechtle in Western and Central Europe still offer significant, increasing growth potential. Our product and service portfolio covers almost all major current and foreseeable needs of industrial customers and Public Sector clients. With this comprehensive offer, Bechtle distinguishes itself from most direct competitors. In terms of strategic and structural positioning, our company is well prepared to make use of any newly emerging growth potential.\n\nIT markets in the individual European countries – especially in German-speaking regions – have been in a phase of intensive consolidation for several years, which Bechtle is making good use of. Thanks to our robust financial resources and good reputation, we have been able to complete 113 acquisitions since our company was founded, continuously strengthening our market position. In view of the progressive consolidation of the industry and the Bechtle Group's persistently excellent financial situation and funding, the company will have further opportunities to fortify its competitive position, e.g. by\n\nImage /page/124/Picture/6 description: The image shows a simple line drawing of an open book.

Against this background, Bechtle made seven acquisitions in six countries in the reporting period. We have further improved our funding by means of the successful issue of a convertible bond, opening the way for further growth through acquisitions throughout Europe. By linking the existing trading business in the respective countries with system-integration services, we are improving our market position and increasing our growth potential.\n\nThe Bechtle Group occupies a leading competitive position in Germany and Europe. This size creates opportunities on the customer side, as Bechtle can set itself apart from many of its competitors with a comprehensive portfolio of solutions and a holistic view of the customer's IT. High availabilities and therefore fast delivery times are also of great importance when selecting an IT partner. The very good and intensive relationships with our suppliers are of paramount importance here. Bechtle is one of the preferred partners of all well-known IT manufacturers and distributors in Europe. Despite its size, Bechtle's decentralised structure enables it to quickly and flexibly leverage any weaknesses of its competitors for the purpose of increasing the regional market penetration. The group has the size and financial strength of an international business combined with the agility and customer proximity of a local mid-sized enterprise.\n\n#### CUSTOMERS\n\nImage /page/125/Figure/12 description: The image shows a book icon above the text \"See chart\".\n\n[Industry segmentation,](#page-43-0) [page 44](#page-43-0)\n\nBechtle has a broadly diversified customer structure – from smaller customers to large corporations – which we serve via various channels. We have historically developed a particularly high level of expertise in business with SME customers. Due to this broad diversification, industry-specific economic trends and special investment-related framework conditions are only of a high relevance for the company from a location perspective. The success of the Bechtle Group as a whole is not endangered, as Bechtle has the opportunity to balance and compensate for the weaknesses of individual sectors or regions. This is another reason why Bechtle plans to offer the entire portfolio, including services, in all 14 European countries where Bechtle has a presence in the medium term. Apart from the unique aspect of regional customer proximity, the ability to serve customers on an international scale is thus growing in importance. As Bechtle is the only system house in Europe with a presence throughout Western and Central Europe, this unique selling point in turn creates opportunities for us.\n\n[See Business Actitivy,](#page-38-0) [Public sector clients,](#page-38-0) [page 39](#page-38-0)\n\nPublic Sector clients are an important customer segment for Bechtle. In the past, we used to generate about a third of the business volume with these customers, and the share has become even higher over the last four years. Bechtle has always considered the specialisation with regard to the requirements of Public Sector clients and the focus on special aspects of the contract-awarding practice in this customer segment to be a great opportunity. The developments in recent years have confirmed the notion that the investment behaviour of this customer group is less susceptible to the influence of economic trends and is often even anti-cyclical.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-126-0\"></span>It is therefore conceivable that clients from the Public Sector may even increase their demand in times of crisis. The digitisation trend – which was only triggered or which was heightened by the pandemic in many areas – is associated with further opportunities for further successful business in this customer segment. Moreover, the need for digitisation is also driven by the corresponding legal requirements, which could trigger further demand on the part of these customers.\n\nBechtle's long-standing presence in the IT market, and in particular in the customer group of small to medium-sized companies, represents a high barrier to market entry for potential competitors. A strong competitive position in the SME segment thus enables our company to expand its market leadership in this area. At the same time, we also want to further intensify our business with large customers.\n\nIn the trading business, we are active in 14 European countries. We want to further expand our market share in all 14 countries, irrespective of acquisitions. This is to be promoted by means of marketing measures that address a wider spectrum of customers and by further internationalising the business. For cross-border transactions in particular, Bechtle offers a comprehensive range of services with its own group units, which is supported by global delivery capability via the Global IT Alliance (GITA) established in 2014.\n\nAt bechtle.com, Bechtle merges the trading business of its online shops with the service offering of the system houses on a single digital platform. Driven by our Digital Business Services, this holistic [See Business activity,](#page-39-0) online platform is to be further expanded in the coming years. This provides the opportunity to offer customers Bechtle's entire portfolio, to better utilise existing potential and to exploit synergies. Additionally, bechtle.com will be further expanded in order to increasinlgy advance digitisation in cus-[bechtle.com](https://www.bechtle.com/de-en) tomer contact and order behaviour. This will also help us to increase our productivity and improve our efficiency.\n\n#### M A N U FA C T U R E R S A N D D I S T R I B U T O R S\n\nThe Bechtle Group maintains close partnerships with all major vendors and distributors in the IT industry, and the majority of the certifications have the highest partner status. In line with our sustainability strategy and the Bechtle Code of Conduct, we treat our suppliers and vendors in a respectful and cooperative manner. We maintain close contact with our strategic partners, coordinate our alignment with them on a regular basis and continue to develop our business model. Intensive cooperation with partner companies enables us to offer technology solutions that meet our customers' growing demands at all times. Thus, we are expanding our growth opportunities especially by means of an extensive range of individual service solutions for corporate customers and Public Sector clients.\n\n[See Business activity,](#page-37-0) [IT E-Commerce,](#page-37-0) [page 38](#page-37-0)\n\n[page 40](#page-39-0)\n\nbechtle.com\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\nBechtle has very close and trusting relationships with its suppliers. Cooperation with Bechtle is extremely important for suppliers, as we are one of the largest providers in the European IT market and can therefore reach many potential customers. Due to the close integration and the high relevance of Bechtle for its partners, we have the opportunity to benefit more than many competitors from the bonus programmes of vendors and distributors.\n\nTo promote the strategic collaboration with key vendors, Bechtle employs Vendor Integrated Product Managers (VIPM), who know and promote the interests of the vendors as well as those of Bechtle. The advantage of VIPMs is that vendor information is forwarded to procurement, sales and service staff without delay in a centralised and target-oriented manner. This enables Bechtle to offer its customers a portfolio of services that always reflects the state of the art. At the same time, this increases the quality of sales activities, and customers benefit immediately from innovative products from the respective vendors. In return, the vendors promptly receive largely unfiltered user feedbacks about existing products and requirements for future products.\n\nAdditional synergies are achieved through the standardisation of logistics processes and synchronisation of the ERP systems between Bechtle and its partners. This expands the product offer, increases the availability of the goods and enhances the attractiveness of Bechtle among other distributors and vendors. In addition, it gives our company the opportunity to further increase its efficiency and optimise its costs. Furthermore, improvements in logistical processes, and thus the avoidance of unnecessary transport, also offer opportunities to reduce CO2 emissions.\n\n**Events establish strong bridges between the employees and to customers. Bechtle has numerous events on its calendar. The events are held online, in person or hybrid, and are highly specialised or of general interest. All events attract a broad audience.**\n\nMelanie Dollmann, Event Management, Bechtle AG\n\nFabian Grau, Event Management, Bechtle AG\n\nMarie Durst, Event Management, Bechtle AG\n\nfrom left to right\n\nImage /page/127/Picture/10 description: In an indoor shot, a man and a woman are posing in an office setting. The woman is seated in an office chair, wearing a light blue blazer, a white shirt, dark pants, and black boots. She is positioned at a desk with a computer monitor and a laptop. The man is standing next to the desk, wearing a blue suit, a white shirt, brown shoes, and orange socks. In the background, there is a seating area with two women sitting on yellow chairs. The office has a modern design with white walls and dark gray carpet.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### S E R V I C E S P E C T R U M\n\nIT is becoming increasingly complex. Enterprise customers are therefore dependent on IT consulting and often expect their service provider to provide holistic solutions for their IT requirements from a [See Business segments,](#page-34-0) single source. Bechtle offers its customers an extremely broad portfolio that covers all IT-related requirements. We are therefore ideally placed to benefit from this trend. Moreover, Bechtle has duly positioned itself through acquisitions, strategic alliances and competence centres especially tuned to market demand and trends, and by hiring and retaining qualified staff. We intend to continue to develop along these lines in future.\n\nIn connection with the procurement and operation of IT, many companies usually focus on several features, such as competitiveness, efficiency gain and modernisation. To meet these diverse demands, Bechtle analyses the customer's existing corporate processes in order to systematically offer solutions and IT management models, such as outsourcing or cloud computing. Our broad portfolio enables us to devise optimal solutions that are tailored to each customer's specific needs. As a one-stop provider, we have great advantages over smaller and niche providers. Furthermore, due to the high and increasing relevance of IT to all business processes and increased security concerns, customers attach great importance to the reliability of their service provider when selecting their IT partner. In addition to its 40 years of experience and advanced solution expertise, Bechtle also enjoys a strong, solid financial position. These factors directly influence the choice of service provider, prices, and how and from whom external services are procured. As a financially robust and reliable partner with an excellent reputation, Bechtle will continue to enjoy attractive growth opportunities. Especially customer relationships in the so-called \"as-a-service\" business can benefit from this. These relationships are usually of a long-term nature, which facilitates business development planning. Also, this area generally enables higher margins than the conventional trading or project business. While, during the pandemic, our customers ordered mainly conventional hardware, especially home office equipment, they are now investing more heavily in comprehensive infrastructures once again. At this point, Bechtle has the opportunity to provide customers with suitable as-a-service models, thereby benefiting from this longer-term, projectable higher-margin business.\n\nFor many years, we have been selling own-brand peripheral products under the name ARTICONA. For this purpose, the Bechtle Group has its own purchasing company in Taiwan. The portfolio comprises IT accessories and connectivity products. ARTICONA is available to all companies of the Bechtle Group. In this way, all our customers benefit from the excellent value for money of the ARTICONA products, which also results in higher profitability.\n\nCloud computing is still an area with great growth potential. Cloud computing is widely used in large corporations, and the demand for cloud solutions is on the rise among small and medium-sized customers as well. In cloud computing, processing performance, storage, applications and IT services are obtained in real time via data networks. The fees for the individual services are based on actual usage. Bechtle is active in the cloud computing market, both in cooperation with renowned partners and with a proprietary solution portfolio. Bechtle has a broad portfolio of virtualisation and server technologies, infrastructure solutions and security-relevant applications. Accordingly, we are able to\n\nImage /page/128/Picture/6 description: The image contains a book icon and the text \"See Business se\".\n\n[page 35 ff](#page-34-0)\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\nmeet specific customer needs relating to the provision and operation of cloud IT services. The offer is supplemented with consulting and integration services for cloud computing, as the specific services often need to be integrated and networked with existing systems.\n\nBechtle Clouds represents another key aspect of our cloud offering. Under this name, Bechtle bundles public and business cloud services. As a multi-cloud service provider, Bechtle Clouds offers custom-produced cloud services as well as numerous public cloud solutions. This allows us to benefit from the growing demand for cloud services. Overall, Bechtle wants to strengthen the platform business. Our CTO, who holds the position of Executive Vice President, is responsible for all platform activities at Bechtle: the Bechtle Service Factory with its managed service offerings, the further development of the central web platform bechtle.com, the Bechtle Clouds platform and the operation of the Bechtle data centres in Frankfurt am Main, Rüsselsheim and Mutterstadt.\n\nDigitalisation and the trending topic of artificial intelligence (AI) also offer opportunities for the Bechtle Group. The complexity of the industrial IT landscape as well as the relevance of IT to corporate workflows and production processes will continue to grow. The integration of IT in production processes and the incorporation of AI, in particular, requires holistic thinking and competencies, both in the field of IT and in the field of engineering. In recent years, Bechtle has prepared for these challenges through systematic training measures as well as acquisitions and is thus able to address the demand in this area.\n\n#### COMPANY ORGANISATION\n\nImage /page/129/Picture/7 description: The image shows a simple line drawing of a book. The book is open, with two pages visible. The pages are filled with lines, suggesting text. The book is upright and centered in the image. Below the book is the word \"Management\".\n\n[See Management](#page-57-0) [structure, page](#page-57-0) 58\n\nWith more than 100 system houses, Bechtle has a strong presence in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as in France, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. The decentralised structure of the Bechtle Group is of great significance, as every location is a separate legal entity with a Managing Director responsible for the business performance in their respective territory. The decentralisation principle creates opportunities by promoting a sense of responsibility and entrepreneurial drive at the individual locations. Moreover, locally and regionally positioned system houses enable Bechtle to address the often small and medium-sized customers at eye level and at the same time – at the aggregate group level and via the e-commerce companies that operate on a nationwide basis – supra-regional companies and groups that need a large IT service provider as a trusted partner. The Bechtle Group thus benefits from decentralised responsibility and decision-making structures, on the one hand and, due to its size, from economies of scale with respect to centralised administrative tasks as well as the purchasing and logistics processes that are combined under Bechtle AG, on the other hand. Additionally, competence centres, specialised product management teams and segment heads bundle expertise that is made available centrally to all locations and segments.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-130-0\"></span>With the expansion of the system integration activities to all 14 European countries in which Bechtle is already represented by trading companies, the same opportunities also arise in the respective countries as well as additional growth potential for the Bechtle Group.\n\nThe organised interaction between central support and a decentralised market approach by the units on location yields improved opportunities for growth in the respective market, e.g. in the Public Sector division, in the application solutions segment as well as in the fields of managed services and cloud services. Bechtle recognises clear opportunities in supporting the provision of services centrally, where possible, or in taking them over completely in order to achieve efficiency gains and economies of scale.\n\n#### HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nEmployees are a key part of the Bechtle business model. Retaining employees on a long-term basis, maintaining high motivation and fostering a positive corporate culture are therefore essential to our business success. Further increasing the attractiveness of Bechtle as an employer represents both a challenge and an opportunity. Bechtle conducts systematic employer branding to position itself as an attractive employer and uses its strong employer brand to recruit new staff to the company and to retain existing staff in the long term. We want to further expand our employer branding in order to remain successful in this area in future.\n\nWhen it comes to recruiting new employees, the shortage of qualified staff poses a challenge for Bechtle. However, the limited availability of qualified people could also create opportunities, e.g. if the company manages to train a sufficient number of skilled employees and thus meet its needs by means of its own initiatives. Apprenticeships are therefore a key focus of Bechtle's HR work. We plan on stepping up our training ratio in Germany to about 10 per cent by 2030. Furthermore, we also invest intensively in the further training of our staff. This active career-development offering enhances the satisfaction of our employees, which translates into long-term loyalty. Our headcount is constantly growing, and our turnover rate of 9.1 per cent is below the industry average, indicating that Bechtle is successfully taking advantage of opportunities to recruit and retain employees.\n\nIn 2022, Bechtle introduced a special programme for career shifters in order to address even people who do not have any IT experience. In this way, Bechtle not only addresses the shortage of skilled workers – the participants in the programme often bring diverse cultural backgrounds, different specialist knowledge and a wealth of experience from a wide range of industries. This, in turn, increases Bechtle's diversity.\n\nIn the reporting period, Bechtle completed a group-wide satisfaction survey among all employees. Compared to the previous study, employee satisfaction at Bechtle has increased. The results are to be taken into consideration in future HR work and in the further development of the employer branding. The survey is to be conducted every two years.\n\n[See People at Bechtle,](#page-61-0) [page 62 ff](#page-61-0)\n\n[bechtle.com/de-en/career](http://bechtle.com/de-en/career)\n\nSee Forecast report,\n\npage 147 ff\n\n{131}------------------------------------------------\n\n### SUSTAINABILITY\n\nSustainable business is a must in order to face the great challenges of our age, from environmental and climate protection to IT security, resilient supply chains and the protection of human rights along the value chain. As a responsible company, we want to tackle these challenges in close cooperation with the business world, civil society and politics, and we regard our sustainable operations as an opportunity to make a contribution to general welfare.\n\nAround the globe, the digital and ecological transformation of society and the economy is resulting in changing business models. This trend benefits companies that offer technologies and services for the successful design of these transformation processes. Digitisation and investments in sustainability are making companies more innovative and crisis-proof.\n\nWe are seeing a rapid rise in demand, both on the part of our customers and on the part of the financial market, not only for a sustainable product portfolio, but also with regard to our company's corporate governance. We are convinced that the establishment of the sustainability management structure, the Bechtle Sustainability Strategy 2030 and the associated goals and actions will open up great opportunities for positioning Bechtle as an innovative IT company on a long-term basis.\n\nIn the area in which we operate, there is great potential in the fields of resource efficiency, recycling and IT security. With our portfolio of sustainable technologies, solutions and services, we are actively supporting our customers in the digital transformation and the fulfilment of their corporate digital responsibility.\n\nSustainable management is also an important criterion for attracting and retaining staff. Young people especially want to work for an employer who does sustainable business. We clearly sense this in interviews with applicants, apprentices and students.\n\n{132}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-132-0\"></span>**RISKS**\n\nThe management believes that the risks described below could have a detrimental effect on the company's earnings, assets and financial position, its reputation and its valuation on the capital market. This does not apply to the sustainability risks described in the inside-out perspective. Nevertheless, this list does not include all risks the Bechtle Group might be exposed to. Risks that are not yet known or risks that are currently considered to be of little significance could also impair the company's performance.\n\nThe 2023 reporting period was characterised by major uncertainties. The very tense macroeconomic situation that took centre stage was, in turn, influenced by various geopolitical events: the ongoing war in Ukraine, the crisis in the Middle East exacerbated by Hamas' attack on Israel, inflationary tendencies and the associated uncertainty in large parts of the economy. Due to these general conditions, risks have materialised in some cases and new risk scenarios have also emerged. However, Bechtle has obviously not suffered any direct effects, and the indirect effects have only affected the company to a limited extent. Nevertheless, the high level of uncertainty associated with the aforementioned general environment has caused some of our customers to postpone planned investments in IT. Overall, however, the IT market and Bechtle are showing strong resilience to the overall economic situation. In this respect, we can state that some of the macroeconomic risks at Bechtle have materialised only in mitigated form or not at all. Accordingly, this risk report merely describes any remaining direct risks that the Bechtle Group was exposed to as of the reporting date.\n\n#### RISK ASSESSMENT\n\nTo introduce suitable risk control measures, identified risks are assessed on the basis of their estimated probability of materialising and the loss amount expected upon materialisation with respect to the earnings, assets and financial position of the Bechtle Group, and subsequently classified as \"high\", \"medium\" or \"low\" in a matrix. To ensure uniform understanding, the definitions used for the measurement are described below.\n\nSee Risk identifi\nand assessment,\n\n| Probability of occurrence | Description                                                                                                      | Per cent |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| High                      | The risk is very likely to occur.

Additionally, the trust that companies put in a positive economic development plays a major role. The Bechtle Group generates over 60 per cent of its business volume in Germany and just under 40 per cent in the international markets. Thus, the development of the European economy as a whole and of the German economy in particular has a key impact on our company's growth. Weaker, or worse, decreasing economic activity involves risks to the earnings, assets and financial position of the Bechtle Group.\n\nIn the reporting period, the macroeconomic environment continued to be influenced by the global crises and their direct and indirect effects. High inflation, discussions about energy supply and the associated uncertainties had a negative impact on the economy as a whole. As a result, gross domestic product shrank in the 2023 reporting period. The IT market also experienced weaker growth due to the general conditions described above, but still showed positive rates compared to other sectors. IT is now an essential factor in value creation for all companies and Public Sector clients. IT expenditure therefore tends to remain stable or even increase, even in times of high uncertainty. In this respect, it is also a positive sign that incoming orders rose more strongly again in the second half of 2023. We must continue to monitor both the effects of the global crises and the uncertainties affecting society as a whole, as an unexpectedly long continuation of the current situation could lead to a further overall economic slowdown, which could also have a greater impact on the IT market and consequently also on Bechtle.\n\n{134}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe consider the probability of occurrence of macroeconomic and industry performance risks to be high. This could involve substantial detrimental effects on our earnings, assets and financial position. We consider this risk to be high.\n\n#### BUSINESS ACTIVITY\n\n**Cost structure.** The cost structure of the Bechtle Group is characterised by a high proportion of personnel expenses, which can only be adjusted with some delay in case of changes in capacity utilisation. In phases of a weaker economy or curbed investment affinity of customers, the company can only reduce functional costs to a certain extent in the medium run without significantly modifying the employment situation, e.g. by means of short-time work or by making use of the natural fluctuation. All measures affecting the personnel expenses must always take the existing or possible future personnel risk (lack of qualified staff) into consideration. Therefore, Bechtle endeavours to retain employees on a long-term basis and wants the labour market to perceive the company as a highly attractive, reliable employer. The often rather short-term risk of lower earnings is countered by the long-term [See](#page-130-0) opportunity of successful employer branding and bonding of qualified staff. In the reporting period, Bechtle's organic headcount increase was not as dynamic as in other years. On the one hand, this was a deliberate strategic decision in order to keep the cost pressure in check in the face of the extremely challenging framework conditions. On the other hand, however, Bechtle is also becoming increasingly successful in achieving growth in business volume with a disproportionately low increase in personnel. One reason for this is that we are digitalising an increasing number of processes internally. Secondly, we can make our work more efficient and productive. In this way, we counteract the risk of a disproportionately high increase in personnel expenses to a certain extent.\n\nFor the Bechtle Group to retain its earning power, the salary level of all employees as a whole should not rise excessively. However, in view of the shortage of skilled personnel and the demographic change, it will become increasingly difficult to staff all vacancies with qualified people. To attract applicants, Bechtle could be forced to raise the salary level. Bechtle endeavours to counteract this risk by strengthening the employer branding, by perpetuating its long-standing emphasis on training measures and by focusing more intensively on the employees and their qualifications in the context of acquisitions. The risk of a disproportionate increase in salary levels has gained additional weight in the past two years due to inflation. In the 2023 reporting period, Bechtle was able to keep the increase in organic personnel costs at a moderate level. The inflation adjustment payment made to the majority of employees also had a positive effect on the development of personnel costs. Although the employees received this payment in the first half of 2023, the relevant provision was recognised in the [See](#page-63-0) [Personnel expenses,](#page-63-0) [page 64](#page-63-0)\n\nImage /page/134/Figure/6 description: The image shows a book icon. The book is open, and there are several horizontal lines on each page, representing text. Below the book icon, the word \"See\" is written in a sans-serif font.\n\n[Opportunities,](#page-130-0)  [Personnel,](#page-130-0)  [page](#page-130-0) 131\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nincome statement in the fourth quarter of 2022. As salary negotiations with employees are generally conducted at the beginning of the year, the risk did not increase specifically during the course of the reporting period. The risk described above cannot be seen without the associated risk of an increasing fluctuation rate. As in the previous year, the focus of salary negotiations should therefore be on lower salary levels. At higher salary levels, Bechtle endeavours to respond by increasing the focus on variable salary components.\n\nDespite the aforesaid, we consider the occurrence of the risks associated with the development of personnel expenses and salaries to be highly probable. This could result in substantial detrimental effects on the earnings, assets and financial position of the Bechtle Group. We consider this risks to be high.\n\n[See](#page-126-0) [Opportunities, Manufacturers](#page-126-0) [and distributors](#page-126-0) [page 127 f](#page-126-0)\n\n**Procurement.** Bechtle buys its products from all renowned IT vendors and distributors. Across Europe, there are around 270 vendors and over 2,000 distributors. In every national market in which Bechtle is represented, the company has established a close network with vendors and distributors. As the Bechtle Group continues to grow, vendors could increasingly start supplying directly without going through distributors. As a result, the bonus payments received from distributors could be discontinued or reduced. This, in turn, could impair the earnings and margin of Bechtle.\n\nWe consider the occurrence of risks from the direct supply by vendors to be highly probable. This could result in some detrimental effects on the earnings, assets and financial position. We consider this risk to be high.\n\nTraditionally, the vendors on the IT market have always cooperated with partner companies such as Bechtle in order to boost their market share. This cooperation involves the yearly determination of individual targets for the business with the respective vendor's products and services. The vendor incentivises the achievement of targets by means of bonus payments, refunds or marketing grants. These programmes can be modified by the vendors, e.g. to realign the incentives with the vendors' new business segments. A weaker positioning of Bechtle in these fields could result in a reduction of the funds provided by the vendors. Bechtle counters this risk by closely collaborating with all major vendors. In this way, Bechtle learns of the vendors' new developments at an early stage and is able duly to respond.\n\nWe classify the risks from the vendors' terms of sale as a high risk. We consider the occurrence of this risk to be probable. In the event of the occurrence of these risks, we would expect substantial detrimental effects on the earnings, assets and financial position.\n\n{136}------------------------------------------------\n\nDifficulties in the global supply chains led to a significant increase in inventories at Bechtle in 2021 and 2022. This was necessary especially with regard to the project business, in which a solution often includes various different products. Where individual components of an overall project are unavailable or difficult to obtain, Bechtle is forced to store the components already procured. Thus, there is a risk in connection with the costs for additional storage capacities, higher logistics management expenses or an increased capital commitment. There is also the risk of possible write-downs on inventories. As a result, the Group has already taken measures to reduce inventories again in 2022. These measures have had a positive effect – in addition to the easing of supply chains – so that inventories and the associated capital commitment could already be reduced in the reporting period. In general, availability continues to be an important criterion in customers' purchasing decisions. In this respect, this risk is always accompanied by the opportunity of benefiting from the market situation.\n\nDue to the positive development described above, we were able to downgrade the probability of occurrence. We estimate that the risks from the increase in inventories are likely to materialise and would have a substantial detrimental impact on earnings, assets and financial position. We consider this risk to be high.\n\nThe dynamic IT market inherently displays a strong focus on certain vendors, which entails the risk of an excessive dependence on these. This dependence can lead to cost increases and put the margin aspired to at risk. To counter this challenge, we cooperate with a broad spectrum of around 270 vendors.\n\nWe nevertheless consider the risks arising from dependencies on individual vendors as high. We consider the occurrence of this risk as highly probable and would expect substantial effects on our earnings, assets and financial position.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/1 description: The image contains the words \"OPPORTUNITY AND RISK REPORT\" in white text on a blue background, followed by the word \"RISK\" in white text on a gray background.\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/2 description: The image shows a simple line drawing of an open book. The book is depicted with several horizontal lines representing the pages, and the spine is visible on the right side.\n\n[See](#page-43-0) [Competitive position,](#page-43-0) [page 44 f](#page-43-0)\n\n**Service range.** On the IT market, Bechtle competes with numerous providers. Besides other conventional system houses and e-commerce providers, some vendors also engage in direct sales, thus becoming competitors. Large customers, in particular, are already cared for directly by some vendors. Some distributors also endeavour to do direct business with end customers, thereby becoming competitors of Bechtle. Especially in the cloud business, but also in the field of managed services, some large multinationals offer their services and try to sell their offerings directly to customers. Moreover, providers who used to operate exclusively in the private customer business are increasingly making efforts to gain a foothold in the business customer segment. Therefore, competition might intensify in future. We therefore see a risk that individual sales units cannot achieve the expected business volume due to the increased competition. However, due to its strong presence in many European regions and its international presence in 14 European countries, Bechtle has an advantage in terms of customer approach and loyalty, as well as with respect to delivery and the provision of services. No other competitor has such a strong presence in such a widespread area. Moreover, vendors cannot offer independent consulting services, and distributors have a more limited portfolio bandwidth. Through its consistent focus on efficient sales teams, Bechtle intends to maintain its competitive edge, thereby reducing the risk of entry of new competitors in Bechtle's customer base.\n\nWe consider the occurrence of general competitive risks to be probable and would expect substantial detrimental effects on our earnings, assets and financial position. These risks are classified as high.\n\n**Customers.** Bechtle's range of customers includes companies and public institutions of all sizes, with a certain focus on larger medium-sized enterprises. In total, Bechtle has over 70,000 customers. Therefore, the company does not depend on any individual customers. Nevertheless, loss of a larger customer could affect not only the individual local Bechtle company, but also the Bechtle Group as a whole. Bechtle counteracts this risk by applying the principle of close personal customer care and optimum performance in all customer relationships. In the segment of Public Sector clients, we see a consolidation trend in the form of bundling of the purchase volume of multiple clients (in so-called buying centres). Should a larger tender that comes about in this way be lost, Bechtle could lose market shares in this segment. In recent years, Bechtle has also been more successful in the large customer business and with regard to the conclusion of framework agreements. However, the loss of such a major order also harbours commensurate risks.\n\nAs a result, we have increased the risk assessment and rate the probability of occurrence as highly probable. If risks materialise, we expect substantial detrimental effects on our earnings, assets and financial position. The risks are therefore classified as high.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\nDespite our efforts to maintain a secure business operation, the danger of falling victim to fraudulent activities is real. To effectively counter this threat, we have implemented robust internal security measures to protect our system from fraudulent transactions. In addition, we have taken intensive measures to raise our employees' awareness towards potential fraud.\n\nWe nevertheless consider these risks to be high. We consider the probability of their occurrence to be high, and they could result in some detrimental effects on our earnings, assets and financial position.\n\n**IT.** Nowadays, all companies depend on information technology. Due to the advanced digitalisation, all material business processes at Bechtle are closely linked to IT systems and applications. The use of IT involves various risks in areas such as e-commerce shop systems, order processing, ERP, controlling, financial accounting as well as collaboration and telephony applications. For example, a smooth process ranging from the enquiry and order placement to the delivery and invoicing could face an availability risk if the operability of the required IT systems and applications were to be endangered. Potential causes include the malfunction of infrastructure components, energy or telecommunications outages, disruptions or faults at partners or software providers and operating errors.\n\nWithin the internal IT, Bechtle continually endeavours to establish the preconditions to curb the risks associated with the operation of IT. Apart from measures such as the continued recruitment of personnel, this includes ongoing investments to make sure the platforms are secure and up to date.\n\nNevertheless, we consider it highly probable that these risks will materialise and that they would have a substantial detrimental impact on our earnings, assets and financial position. These risks are classified as high risks.\n\nThe increase in cybercrime is another risk. The probability and extent of damage from external attacks is very difficult to estimate. Attackers could exploit potential vulnerabilities of software products used. The intrusion of unauthorised parties into the IT system could result in a confidentiality risk, or the systems could lose their smooth operability after an attack. Furthermore, there is a risk of falling victim to a ransom attack.\n\nTo be prepared for potential emergency scenarios, the company's existing crisis plans need to be continually updated, and new ones need to be created, e.g. for new scenarios. For this purpose, Bechtle has appointed an interdisciplinary workgroup. Nevertheless, a new scenario could arise before a new emergency plan is elaborated.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\nDespite advanced protective mechanisms and security standards, we consider the occurrence of IT security risks to be highly probable. This could result in substantial detrimental effects on our earnings, assets and financial position. These risks are classified as high risks.\n\n**Personnel.** As a trading service provider, the employees as well as their training and education, motivation and commitment are key success factors for Bechtle. For the company's ongoing growth path, it is also important to be able to attract new personnel to Bechtle and retain them on a longterm basis. Therefore – also in view of the demographic change – the inability to recruit the required number of qualified people is one of the greatest HR risks. Moreover, risks exist in connection with the retention of employees in the company. This could result in a loss of expertise due to an above-average fluctuation in qualified personnel or customer satisfaction could suffer due to a lack of qualifications and a lack of performance orientation on the part of employees. Apart from further developing Bechtle's employer branding, the HR work therefore focuses on creating a positive work environment, providing operational training and promoting junior executives by means of internal development programmes. The second Group-wide employee satisfaction survey was completed in the reporting period. Overall satisfaction has increased compared to the previous survey. Investments in employer branding also had a positive effect. Both aspects are ultimately reflected in the lower fluctuation rate. As part of the growing international presence of the Bechtle Group, one of the objectives of HR work is to reduce the workload of the operating companies in Germany and abroad and leverage the efficiency potential by means of a uniform alignment.\n\nThe risk assessment was downgraded due to the positive developments resulting from higher employee satisfaction, the positive effects of employer branding and the resulting reduction in the fluctuation rate. The occurrence of fluctuation risks is considered probable. This could cause some detrimental effects on the earnings, assets and financial position. We categorise the risk as medium risk. We classify the recruitment risk as high, as it is very likely to occur and some detrimental effects on the earnings, assets and financial position cannot be ruled out.\n\n[See Training and](#page-63-0) [further education,](#page-63-0) [page](#page-63-0) 64 ff\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-140-0\"></span>**Sustainability.** In 2022, the processes relating to sustainability were expanded to identify and assess the associated risks. We differentiate between the outside-in perspective and the inside-out perspective. All in all, thanks to the early approach to the subject of sustainability, the risks of the Bechtle Group in this area are rather limited. Nevertheless, we have identified a number of risks that are relevant to a certain extent.\n\n**Outside-in perspective.** Sustainability topics are also gaining relevance on the financial markets. ESG ratings therefore increasingly serve as an instrument that investors or analysts consult with respect to the subject area of sustainability when deciding to buy or sell the Bechtle share. The various ESG ratings of the different rating agencies are often not comparable and are not adapted to sector-specific circumstances. Bechtle maintains ongoing dialogue with the rating agencies. Nevertheless, there is a risk that a poor assessment of individual criteria could lead to a poorer ESG rating overall. This could, in turn, lead to sell recommendations by analysts and sell decisions by investors. The recommendations resulting from the ESG ratings to be voted on in the Annual General Meeting may also be worse than in the past, which could result in lower approval rates.\n\nThe risk is therefore classified as high. The probability of occurrence of the risk is high and if it materialises, it could have some detrimental effects on earnings, assets and financial position.\n\n**Inside-out perspective.** Bechtle considers the greatest risk in the area of sustainability to be the risk of a lack of information security, which has already been described partially in the IT risks section. Bechtle has established the highest standards and is subject to the highest qualifications. At the same time, the risk of loss of company-relevant data cannot be ruled out completely when working with highly sensitive information on a daily basis.\n\nThe risk presented is to be classified as high. The probability of occurrence is high and the level of damage, i.e. the severity, is classified as high.\n\nOne of the key competitive advantages is proximity to the customer, which also requires a local presence. Our increasing internationality and the maintenance of the existing networked decentralised structure also leads to increased employee travel between locations. As a trading company, we are also dependent on the transport of goods, which also causes a certain amount of CO₂ emissions.\n\nWe consider the risk in relation to CO₂ emissions and the associated impact on climate change to be a medium risk. We consider the risk to be highly probable to occur. The level of damage of the risk, i.e. the severity, is to be regarded as medium.\n\n[For the measurement logic,](#page-123-0)  [see Opportunity and](#page-123-0) \n\n[risk management,](#page-123-0)  page [124 ff](#page-123-0)\n\n{141}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n[of the risks, see Notes,](#page-234-0) [page 235 ff](#page-234-0)\n\n<span id=\"page-141-0\"></span>**Risk management.** Currency, interest rate and liquidity risks are subject to active management on For quantification the basis of guidelines that apply to the entire group. In this context, the specific requirements for the organisational separation of the operations and auditing of the functional divisions are observed.\n\n> Derivative financial instruments are used exclusively for the purpose of hedging operational underlying transactions and mission-critical financial transactions in the form of currency futures, currency options and currency and interest swaps.\n\n> The financial risk management is characterised by clear allocation of responsibilities, central rules for the fundamental limitation of financial risks, purposeful alignment of the employed instruments to the requirements of the business activity and separate monitoring by a centrally controlled treasury.\n\n> **Receivables.** The solvency of our business customers plays an important role in the assessment of the future risk situation. Bechtle could be exposed to bad-debt risks if customers can no longer meet their payment obligations in due time or in full due to inadequate financial means or unfavourable economic developments. However, this risk is manageable in most fiscal years, as detailed monitoring of customer relationships including ongoing solvency checks and proactive receivables management help counteract this risk and eliminate the need for taking out trade credit insurance. Nevertheless, the situation of some industrial enterprises remained tense in the reporting period even after the COVID-19 pandemic, due especially to the inflationary framework conditions and the associated uncertain economic situation. Thus, this risk has also become clearer for Bechtle. However, the stable development of the DSO and the consistently low level of bad debts in the reporting period gave no cause for concern. Nevertheless, we regard the occurrence of bad-debt risks as highly probable and would expect substantial detrimental effects on our earnings, assets and financial position. These risks are classified as high risks.\n\n> Potential risks in connection with the investment of cash equivalents are limited by exclusively executing investments with banks with an excellent rating and within the scope of defined limits. Payment transactions, too, are largely handled via banks with a top rating.\n\nImage /page/141/Picture/9 description: The image shows a simple line drawing of an open book. The book is seen from the front, with the spine not visible. The pages are slightly fanned open, revealing several horizontal lines on each page, suggesting text or content within the book.\n\nSee [Assets position,](#page-107-0) [page 108 ff,](#page-107-0) and [Notes, Interest rate risk,](#page-236-0) [page 237 f](#page-236-0) **Interest rates.** Financial assets and liabilities with maturities of more than one year generally involve an interest rate risk. The ongoing inflationary conditions in the reporting period led to increases in the key interest rate by the European Central Bank. To counteract persistently high inflation rates, the key interest rate could be further raised. This, in turn, would trigger adjustments of the interest rates charged by banks and thus significantly higher interest expenses, resulting in a higher risk for Bechtle. The interest rate risks of the Bechtle Group are centrally analysed, and the resulting measures are actively managed by the central finance department. The approach to this area is subject to regular review as determined by management.\n\n{142}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-142-0\"></span>Nevertheless, the occurrence of risks from changes in interest rates is considered to be highly probable. We would expect some detrimental effects on our earnings, assets and financial position. These risks are classified as high risks.\n\n**Foreign currencies.** Currency risks are incurred in particular in areas where receivables, liabilities, cash and planned transactions exist or will accrue in currencies other than the local currency of the parent company. The foreign currency risk is mainly limited to Swiss francs, as a considerable portion of the international business is generated in Switzerland. Except for Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, transactions take place mainly in euro countries and in euros. In some cases, goods are purchased in US dollars or other currencies in order to take advantage of better prices. The Bechtle Group hedges the currency risk with currency futures. Since the 2018 fiscal year, the hedging of net assets held by international subsidiaries in foreign currencies has comprised all non-euro countries. Currency futures are used in individual cases to hedge the currency risk associated with other currencies when purchasing goods or when customers pay in foreign currency. In the case of one-time amounts with terms to maturity that are usually short, these economic hedges are not accounted for as hedges. For projects that run over a longer period and generally have several associated hedges, the hedge accounting regulations of IFRS 9 are applied. Open currency transactions and the respective receivables and liabilities are analysed on a monthly basis and tested for effectiveness. There are neither any significant individual risks in this area, nor has an assessment been conducted.\n\n**Liquidity.** To ensure unlimited solvency, the company must have sufficient liquidity at all times. The liquidity situation is managed and monitored by the treasury. The financial position of the Bechtle Group as at the end of 2023 is very sound and extremely comfortable, with cash and cash equivalents and time deposits and securities totalling €465.8 million (previous year: €289.6 million) as well as a positive cash flow from operating activities of €459.0 million (previous year: €116.7 million). The probability of a liquidity risk materialising is limited.\n\nThe treasury department of the Bechtle Group ensures the liquidity supply for the group divisions and subsidiaries by means of cash pooling or inter-company loans. Furthermore, it controls the interest rate risk and is responsible for the assessment, analysis and monitoring of positions subject to market risks. The materialisation of liquidity risks is considered to be improbable. Weak detrimental effects on our earnings, assets and financial position cannot be fully excluded. The risk is classified as a low risk.\n\n[See Notes,](#page-235-0) [currency risk,](#page-235-0) [page 236 ff](#page-235-0) \n\n[See Financial position,](#page-113-0) [page 114 ff](#page-113-0) \n\n{143}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### OTHERS\n\n[See Locations,](#page-58-0) [page 59 ff](#page-58-0)\n\n**Acquisitions.** Since its foundation, the Bechtle Group has acquired 113 companies. Takeovers are an essential part of the corporate strategy, which is designed with long-term profitable growth in mind. Bechtle intends to continue to strengthen and expand its market position by means of systematic acquisitions. At the same time, however, the decision to purchase a company and integrate it in the group always involves an entrepreneurial risk. It is always possible that the expectations placed on the acquired company may not fully materialise. Bechtle addresses this risk by conducting extensive due diligence audits in advance. The preparation, implementation and audit of acquisitions take place in line with defined competence arrangements and approval processes. Moreover, Bechtle has many years of experience in integrating companies. We have established the structures and processes that are necessary for this and pursue a post-merger concept that meets the group's needs in connection with the integration of newly acquired companies in the best way possible. For Bechtle, the opportunities that acquisitions offer therefore clearly outweigh the risks.\n\nWe believe that risks from acquisitions are likely to occur and would expect some detrimental effects on our earnings, assets and financial position. The risk is classified as a medium risk.\n\n**Legal environment.** Being active at an international level, the Bechtle Group is subject to various national laws. This may involve legal transaction risks – e.g. in connection with the wording of contracts – which Bechtle counters by engaging the internal legal department or an external legal consultancy at an early stage whenever necessary.\n\nAt present, the company is not involved in any legal disputes that we would expect to result in a noticeable detrimental effect on the consolidated earnings. Bechtle will create provisions for any future legal disputes in connection with the group's business if liabilities are likely to result and the amount of the liabilities can be determined with reasonable certainty.\n\nIn principle, however, there are always potential risks in the legal environment. The increase in general regulation and in legal requirements could result in such rules being overlooked. As the company placing such products on the market, Bechtle could also be subjected to product liability risks. We therefore consider the risks in the legal environment to be high. Their probability of occurrence is high, and we would expect significant effects on our earnings, assets and financial position.\n\n**Insurances.** Bechtle endeavours to cover risks that cannot be avoided by taking out insurance. For certain risks, it has become more difficult to find suitable insurances. Especially for IT risks, many insurance companies are no longer willing to provide coverage. Accordingly, there is a risk that Bechtle could be unable to duly insure material risks.\n\nDue to their specifics and character, we consider these risks to be high. The probability of occurrence is medium, and we consider the impact on our earnings, assets and financial position to be substantial.\n\n{144}------------------------------------------------\n\n• • • •\n\n### **OVERALL EXAMINATION OF OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS**\n\n• • • •\n\nCRIF (früher Bürgel) (Skala 1,0 bis 6,0) Creditreform (Skala 100 bis 600) Creditsafe (Skala 1,0 bis 6,0)\n\n• • • •\n\nThe evaluation of the group's overall opportunity and risk situation by the Executive Board is based on an examination of all major compound and individual risks under consideration of any opportunities that may arise.

Apart from the company's own internal risk assessment, Bechtle's credit rating and aggregate credit risk are regularly appraised and monitored by banks and rating agencies. Due to the sound capital structure and firstclass funding of the company, Bechtle has received excellent ratings for many years. There is no reason why this should change in the future.\n\nExcellent credit rating\n\n| Excellent creditworthiness 1.0/100<br>Very good creditworthiness 1.5/150<br>Good creditworthiness 2.0/200<br>Medium creditworthiness<br>Strained creditworthiness<br>Very low creditworthiness<br>Poor creditworthiness<br>Default 6.0/600 | 1.2<br>109<br>1.4<br>•<br>•<br>•<br>• | 1.2<br>106<br>1.4<br>•<br>•<br>•<br>• | 1.1<br>100<br>1.4<br>•<br>•<br>•<br>• | 1.2<br>100<br>1.4<br>•<br>•<br>•<br>• | 1.2<br>100<br>1.4<br>•<br>•<br>•<br>• |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 2019                                  | 2020                                  | 2021                                  | 2022                                  | 2023                                  |\n\n#### CREDIT RATINGS OF THE BECHTLE GROUP\n\nBONITÄTSBEWERTUNGEN BECHTLE KONZERN\n\n<span id=\"page-144-0\"></span> ausgezeichnete Bonität 1,0 / 100 sehr gute Bonität 1,5 / 150 gute Bonität 2,0 / 200 mittlere Bonität angespannte Bonität sehr schwache Bonität mangelhafte Bonität Ausfall 6,0 / 600\n\nTo date, the creditworthiness of the Bechtle Group has not been assessed by the rating agencies S&P Global Ratings, Moody's Investors Service, Fitch Ratings and DBRS Morningstar.\n\nThe Bechtle Group is aware of its own risk and opportunity profile for its business activities.

At the beginning of the year, some of the economic growth forecasts for 2024 have been reduced considerably, and the uncertainties with regard to the coming months remain very high. Nevertheless, the IT market is expected to recover in the course of the year, again escaping certain developments that affect the economy in general. We at Bechtle are convinced that the outlook for the further development of the Bechtle Group continues to be bright in the 2024 fiscal year. We expect that the demand might pick up gradually, especially in the second half of the year.\n\n### **FRAMEWORK CONDITIONS**\n\n**Slight economic upturn anticipated.** According to its forecast of February 2024, the European Commission expects a slight increase in economic growth in the EU. In 2024, the gross domestic product (GDP) is to grow 0.9 per cent, after only moderate growth of 0.5 per cent in the reporting period. Further into the year, growth rates are expected to increase in small steps from quarter to quarter. At 0.2 per cent, the first quarter is already projected to see higher growth than the quarters of the reporting period. Further slightly higher economic growth of 0.3 per cent is predicted for the second quarter. The growth rate is expected to amount to 0.4 per cent both in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. The generally positive growth expectation for the entire EU is also reflected in some of Bechtle's markets. Germany with an expected growth rate of 0.3 per cent, the Netherlands with 0.4 per cent and Austria with 0.6 per cent are at the bottom of the scale. The highest growth rates are projected in Poland with 2.7 per cent and in Hungary with 2.4 per cent. Higher dynamics are expected for 2025, with economic growth of 1.7 per cent in the EU.\n\nIn contrast to the reporting period, the economic performance in Germany is expected to return to slightly positive figures in 2024. The European Commission predicts GDP growth of 0.3 per cent for the current year, after –0.3 per cent in the reporting period. However, this estimate is below the figure published in autumn. In 2024, investments in equipment are expected to grow by 2.7 per cent, a lower rate than in the reporting period (3.8 per cent). Following the decline of 2.5 per cent recorded in 2023, government investments are predicted to grow by 1.0 per cent. For 2025, the European Commission \n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\n**FRAMEWORK CONDITIONS**\n\nexpects GDP growth of 1.2 per cent, which means an increase over 2024. Investments in equipment are to increase by 2.7 per cent in 2025, a rate higher than that of the GDP growth.\n\n**Stronger growth predicted for global IT market.** The market research institute Gartner predicts 6.8 per cent growth in global IT expenditure in 2024. Even higher growth of 9.3 per cent is expected in Europe. Software sales are even predicted to grow by 14.5 per cent, due especially to the ongoing increase in the demand for cloud services. In 2024, the demand for IT services, too, is to undergo a disproportionately high increase of 11.8 per cent, says Gartner.\n\nitkom or\n\n[See Risks,](#page-132-0) [page 133 ff](#page-132-0)\n\nBitkom predicts stronger growth in the German IT market in 2024 again. The expected growth rate is [bitkom.org](https://www.bitkom.org/) 6.1 per cent, a rate much higher than that of the reporting period (2.2 per cent). Hardware sales are projected to recover and undergo growth of 4.6 per cent (reporting period: –5.4 per cent). Growth in the field of services is to amount to 4.8 per cent, slightly less than in the reporting period (5.1 per cent). Thus the software segment is again expected to record the highest increase of 9.4 per cent. Though this figure is marginally smaller than that of the reporting period (9.6 per cent), the segment is expected to be the growth driver in the German IT market.\n\nIn France – a national market that is important for Bechtle – IT revenue is to increase significantly in 2024. The industry association numeum again projects a significant increase of 5.8 per cent.\n\n**Macroeconomic challenges.** With respect to the predicted future economic situation in the relevant national markets, the Bechtle Group does not expect any major impact on demand due to changes in legal framework conditions or the implementation of policy measures. However, the macroeconomic situation in Europe is marked by great tension. The war in Ukraine, but also the conflict in the Middle East and associated potential macroeconomic effects burden the macroeconomic development. All these factors can indirectly influence the business performance of the Bechtle Group. However, it is impossible to reliably ascertain and assess the probability of occurrence, the extent and the duration of these events. The exchange rate development does not play a major role in most countries in which Bechtle is present, as these belong to the euro area and therefore, purchases and billing mostly take place in euros.\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-148-0\"></span>**GROUP PERFORMANCE**\n\n#### PRODUCTS AND MARKETS\n\n**Digitalisation drives demand for sustainable IT solutions.** Digitalisation remains the predominant trend in IT. This development has further intensified due to the experience gained during the COVID-19 pandemic, which made it necessary for many to work from their homes. A high degree of digitalisation is required for high availabilities, access by the employees who work remotely or flexibility in the use of IT. The subject area of security will also increase in significance. An EU directive (NIS 2) that entered into force in the reporting period requires numerous companies in the EU to ensure certain IT security standards. In 2024, this directive is to be adopted in national law. This might result in even higher awareness of IT security aspects and a higher demand in this area. With a team of more than 400 employees, Bechtle is already very strong in the business field of security. In the reporting period, some of our customers also started looking into the trending topic of artificial intelligence (AI). AI-related requirements will make the operation of IT infrastructures even more complex, pushing the demand for competent partners. In this area, we see clear impulses for our business in the medium term. In the reporting period, we noticed a reluctance to invest in conventional PC projects, especially among our medium-sized customers. This was due to the macroeconomic situation and the substantial uncertainties caused by this situation. The macroeconomic situation was largely unchanged in early 2024. Therefore, we believe that at least the first half of 2024 will continue to be marked by the said reluctance. Nevertheless, it is obvious that there is no going back as far as the need for digitalisation is concerned. Thus, Bechtle expects the high demand for sustainable IT solutions to continue in the coming years.\n\nIn the coming years, Bechtle will expand the range of special IT solutions in the IT System House & Managed Services segment. In this context, we regard subjects such as cloud solutions, as-a-service models, security, network solutions, mobility, storage, modern workplace and AI as market drivers. Bechtle boasts an excellent position in all these areas and is always able to offer customers state-ofthe-art solutions. In general, we plan to continually expand the share of higher-margin services and the share of recurring revenue.\n\nBechtle is confident that the demand for individual solutions as well as for standardised processes will grow. With our multi-cloud portal Bechtle Clouds and our website bechtle.com, we offer all our customers, whatever their size, the opportunity to procure IT solutions quickly and easily. We intend to continue to expand in this area. Our efforts also included the expansion of our Service Factory with \n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\nits managed service offerings for the standardised performance of services, which will help us to leverage additional synergies and economies of scale within our company. Our platform strategy is supplemented by the operation of our three Bechtle data centres.\n\n**Digitalisation also an internal lever.** The continued digitalisation at Bechtle itself is a key element of the said platform strategy. Since 2017, Bechtle has been systematically developing bechtle.com into a digital marketplace. On this website, our customers can see the entire bandwidth of Bechtle's service and solution portfolio at a glance. Regardless of a customer's original concern and the segment in which the respective customer's contact is based, Bechtle is able to address their needs comprehensively and offer them further solutions. At the same time, this approach helps us to boost the customer satisfaction and penetration. Additionally, it is possible to address smaller customers that Bechtle has not focused on so far without any personal sales activities. Moreover, cooperation between the segments and across national borders is being further promoted under the \"One Bechtle\" motto. This would be hardly possible without virtual collaboration platforms. By increasing the degree of digitalisation, we will also be able to make our own processes more productive and efficient. Apart from having a positive effect on the profitability, this will help us to achieve significant growth in the future without increasing the headcount to the same extent. In view of the demographic factor, this is an invaluable advantage. For the future successful positioning of Bechtle, we therefore believe that digitising many of our (internal) processes is vital.\n\n**Bechtle takes profit from consolidation.** The consolidation of the German and European IT markets, which has been ongoing for several years, will continue in the years to come. Smaller providers, in particular, will find it increasingly difficult to offer their customers services in the needed breadth and depth and ensure competitive availabilities for the products offered. After the coronavirus years, which were full of economic hardships for many providers, and the subsequent shortage of many products due to the issues in the supply chain, it is generally assumed that the consolidation pace has picked up slightly. However, the high degree of fragmentation of the European IT market and especially of the German-speaking IT market has not changed fundamentally. This structure is likely to remain unchanged even if, in the coming years, the consolidation were to intensify as expected. The Bechtle Group can benefit from this development thanks to its financial strength, its leading competitive position, its decentralised positioning as well as its outstanding reputation in the M&A market and among all relevant customer groups. Therefore, we are confident that we will be able to continue to expand our market share at a disproportionately high rate.\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-150-0\"></span>The Bechtle Group will carry on with its efforts to reinforce its market position by expanding existing companies and business fields and through acquisitions. We have already expanded our M&A strategy accordingly in 2021. Previously, we had focused on acquisitions in the service segment in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as our system houses were located only in these countries. Our expanded acquisition strategy now also provides for acquisitions outside German-speaking countries. Thus, we are going to expand our presence and extend our range of system-integration services to countries in which we had previously only engaged in trading. With the acquisitions realised in the reporting period, we are now also represented with our service portfolio in seven European countries. In this way, we not only increase the growth potential in the respective countries by expanding our portfolio, we also step up our existing activities in the individual markets and increase the customer bonding. The expanded M&A strategy continues to concentrate on the national markets in Benelux, France, Spain and the United Kingdom, as well as on Italy and Poland starting from this year. Of course, we will also continue to consider acquisitions in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\n\n#### HUMAN RESOURCES\n\n**Focus on training.** Staff development, training as well as further education will continue to play an extremely important role in our company. With an established range of training measures and consistent continuation of the internal management programmes, Bechtle intends to continue to invest in the development of junior and executive staff. As in the reporting period, the Executive Board plans to continue to raise the headcount in 2024, regardless of whether or not acquisitions are going to take place, though at a lower rate than the business volume growth. As already mentioned, the advancing internal digitalisation enables us to keep the headcount increase below the growth of the business volume.\n\nBechtle's HR policy has always focused on training young people. To safeguard its future, Bechtle's goal is to increase the training ratio in Germany to approximately 10 per cent by 2030.\n\nAnother central goal of our HR strategy is to further upgrade Bechtle as an employer brand. Bechtle has not lost its ability to attract attention and stimulate enthusiasm. The further development of the employer branding is not an entirely cost-neutral process. However, the investments made in this area are future-oriented and effectively secure Bechtle's success in the coming years.\n\n{151}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-151-0\"></span>SUSTAINABILITY GOALS AND ACTIONS\n\n**Sustainability programme defines actions and goals.** The sustainability programme comprises specific actions and goals for all key topics from the four strategic action fields of the Sustainability Strategy 2030. It documents measures that serve the achievement of our goals. In this way, we are able to observe and measure our progress in a structured, transparent manner and make any needed adjustments. Below, you can find an overview of the sustainability programme, starting from the 2023 fiscal year. Measures already implemented in the fiscal year are reported on in the respective chapters.\n\n#### SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAMME – ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES\n\n| Key topic                             |

PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n**Business volume.** For many years, Bechtle has grown faster than the market. Since 2013, we have increased our business volume greatly at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 13 per cent, thereby outperforming the IT market. Over the years, the strong growth has been driven mainly organically. As a result of the intensive M&A activities in the reporting period (seven acquisitions in total), the share of the acquired companies in the growth of the business volume amounted to 2.7 percentage points. We believe that in the future, the group's growth rates will continue to be largely organic. In the reporting period, we achieved good overall growth of 7.0 per cent. The macroeconomic framework conditions for 2024 are not much better than for the reporting period, but not worse either. Because of that, we again project significant growth of five to ten per cent for 2024 (including acquisitions), although we suspect that it might be at the lower end of the range of the guidance.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Revenue.** In principal, the development of revenue follows the same framework parameters as the development of business volume. As a result of solid growth in our software business in recent years, it typically remained somewhat below the growth rates of the business volume. In the reporting period, however, the values of these two indicators had converged again. At 6.5 per cent, the revenue growth was only slightly below the growth rate of the business volume. This was also due to the high reference figures of the software business from the prior year. In view of the continued dynamic development of our software business, we expect the revenue growth in 2024 to remain further below the business volume growth. Nevertheless, we again expect significant revenue growth in 2024.\n\nMinor differences can often be observed between the segments and regions. Overall, the revenue split is expected to remain more or less the same in the 2024 fiscal year, with Germany accounting for about 60 per cent of the revenue and the companies abroad for about 40 per cent. In the medium term, however, the pursuit of the M&A strategy and the further internationalisation of our business might result in an increased revenue share of the international companies. We do not expect any major shifts between the segments.\n\n**Costs.** In recent years, the cost of sales increased largely in line with revenue. In years marked by significant growth rates – which are usually associated with a higher proportion of hardware – we often see a disproportionately high increase in material costs, resulting in pressure on gross margins. We can mitigate this in years with high single-digit growth rates and an often higher share of service revenue and solution business. We again witnessed such a development in the reporting period. Due to the high demand for services and the curbed demand for hardware, especially for PCs, material costs did not grow as much as the revenue. As a result of inflation and other reasons, personnel expenses – which are included in the cost of sales – underwent a stronger increase. All in all, the cost of sales thus developed at almost the same rate as the revenue. Bechtle thus succeeded in keeping the gross margin stable at 17.5 per cent. An increased demand for higher-volume client projects in the course of 2024 should result in a disproportionately high growth in material costs, causing pressure on the gross margin. Our bottom-line goal is to keep the gross margin over 17 per cent. Therefore, we intend to keep the increase in cost of sales in 2024 largely in line with revenue growth.\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\nBeing a service provider, personnel expenses play a prominent role at the Bechtle Group. These expenses represent the bulk of the costs, accounting for approximately 80 per cent of the distribution costs and more than 60 per cent of the administrative expenses. Due to Bechtle's increasingly consulting-intensive business model, the decentralised broad positioning of the system houses and the shortage of qualified staff in some areas, flexible adjustment of personnel expenses is not feasible. Moreover, especially in view of the shortage of experts, Bechtle considers employee bonding and a reputation as a reliable employer to be far more important than short-term cost-optimisation measures. Often, the expenses are also directly linked to the revenue performance, since the growth should also be reflected in the headcount. However, this connection is no longer as strong as in prior years. Due to the advancing digitalisation and automation of internal processes, on the one hand, and the fact that we make work processes more efficient and productive, on the other hand, we are getting better at handling the high revenue growth with a disproportionately lower increase in the number of employees. In the 2024 fiscal year, we expect personnel expenses to experience an organic increase that will remain below the inflation-driven high level of the reporting period. However, we also need to accommodate employee interests, thereby keeping their satisfaction high and the employee turnover rate low. All in all, the Executive Board expects the absolute expenses for the two functional areas sales and administration to further increase in 2024. However, as we endeavour to prevent above-average growth of personnel expenses, the ratios of these two items will remain at least at the levels of the reporting period, i.e. at below 7 per cent and below 6 per cent of the revenue, respectively.\n\n**Earnings.** The earnings performance in recent years was also very good. Since the 2013 fiscal year, the CAGR for the EBT has been above 15 per cent. On a long-term average, EBT has thus performed better than the revenue. This was also the case in the reporting period, driven by factors such as the highly positive performance of the other operating income. The cost base will continue to go up in 2024, though we expect its growth to remain at the level of the revenue growth. But most probably, we will not be able to perpetuate the high level of other operating income. However, we believe that we will be able to compensate this effect with productivity and efficiency gains. Therefore, our overall goal for 2024 is to keep earnings growth largely in line with revenue growth. The EBT margin is expected to reach approximately the same level as in the prior year (5.8 per cent).\n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the medium to long term, we want to further increase the share of higher-margin services and recurring revenue in the IT System House & Managed Services segment. This growth is to be accompanied by a sustainable increase in the EBT margin. In E-Commerce, the main objective is to maintain the high margin level, which has been achieved especially through efficient processes and modern logistics.\n\nBechtle AG plans to continue to share its entrepreneurial success with its shareholders in the form of an attractive dividend. The dividend policy is mainly aligned with the group's earnings and liquidity position and provides for a dividend payout ratio of about one third of the earnings after taxes. The current dividend proposal for the 2023 fiscal year of €0.70 per share represents a ratio of 33.2 per cent. This is in line with our long-standing dividend strategy and also higher than in the prior year (32.6 per cent). There are no plans for any fundamental changes to the company's dividend policy.\n\nImage /page/156/Picture/3 description: Three people are standing behind a wooden counter in a well-lit room.

As previously, Bechtle boasted an excellent liquidity situation and a very sound equity ratio. Thanks to the first-time issue of convertible bonds, the liquidity situation has even improved, at least in the short term. Financial strength is a vital precondition that enables Bechtle to continuously grow under its own steam and respond flexibly to the requirements of the markets. The high liquidity represents a competitive advantage. The financial position and stability of the IT partner is a key decision-making criterion from the customer perspective, especially in connection with the award of long-term projects. Therefore, Bechtle will continue to attach special importance to cash management. In view of the good balance sheet ratios, Bechtle AG has substantial \"rating-neutral\" borrowing potential, in addition to free liquidity of €465.8 million. Combined with the continued positive development of the operating cash flow, Bechtle thus has the leeway needed for attaining its goals and financing the targeted above-average growth – even under its own steam. Also in view of the internal cash flow optimisation measures successfully implemented in the reporting period, we are confident that we will be able to continue to generate positive cash flows in 2024 and beyond.\n\n**Financing.** Traditionally, Bechtle's financial liabilities have always remained at manageable levels. Though the issue of convertible bonds has doubled financial liabilities, a considerable increase was seen in cash and cash equivalents and, due to acquisitions, in goodwill. At the bottom line, therefore, the balance sheet structure of Bechtle remains largely unchanged. This is also evident from the net debt position. In the reporting period, this position amounted to €74.8 million, even less than in the prior year (€83.7 million), a small amount compared to the balance sheet total. The basic positions will not undergo any material changes in 2024, unless major acquisitions take place. In 2024, smaller acquisitions could be financed from the existing liquidity and the current cash flow, as previously. Owing to its good creditworthiness, Bechtle could also raise debt capital whenever necessary. The takeover of larger companies could result in a more drastic cash outflow, though in such a case, financing with further debt capital or other external financing options would be more likely, at least to a certain extent. The company could also resort to the equity financing options according to the adopted Annual General Meeting resolutions. Until June 2026, the Executive Board is authorised to increase the share capital by issuing up to 18.9 million shares against cash or in-kind contributions. Bechtle already used the option to issue convertible bonds (conditional capital) in 2023.\n\nProvided that no major takeovers occur in 2024, the balance sheet structure will most likely not undergo any significant changes compared to the reporting date of 31 December 2023.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Investments.** The business of Bechtle AG, which comprises IT product trading and IT services, does not involve any major investments. The investment ratio in 2023 was about 27 per cent, a figure higher than the long-term average. The total amount of investments in 2023 was €95.2 million, more than we had planned. However, conventional investments merely amounted to approximately €75 million, i.e. the bottom end of our forecast (€75 million to €85 million). Capitalised leasing items that we had to include in our balance sheet for sales financing in accordance with IFRS accounted for about €20 million. This year, Bechtle will continue to invest in the company's future. Though we do not plan any major individual investments, we will continue to invest in the buildings at our locations and in our digitalisation, our own IT systems and our Clouds Platform as well as the adaptation of a new ERP system. We expect conventional investments in 2024 to total €80 million to €90 million.\n\nAcquisitions will remain an integral element of our growth strategy in all business fields.\n\nImage /page/158/Picture/3 description: Two smiling people, a woman and a man, are posing in an office setting.

While gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to edge up slightly after the decline in the reporting period, substantial uncertainties remain in terms of the economic outlook for Germany and Europe. Still, the forecasts anticipate an improvement of the macroeconomic situation further into the year. However, the sentiment in Germany was still very gloomy at the beginning of the year. In January 2024, the ifo Business Climate Index dropped to 85.2 points, from 86.3 points in the preceding month. This is the lowest value since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020.\n\nImage /page/159/Figure/6 description: This image shows a line graph comparing business climate, business situation, and business expectations from 2019 to 2024. The y-axis ranges from 70 to 110. In 2019, business climate starts around 98, business situation starts around 102, and business expectations starts around 94. All three lines drop sharply in 2020, with business expectations reaching the lowest point. From 2021 to 2022, all three lines increase, with business climate and business situation peaking around 102. After 2022, all three lines decrease again, with business expectations showing the most significant drop. By 2024, business climate is around 86, business situation is around 84, and business expectations is around 82.\n\n#### IFO BUSINESS CLIMATE GERMANY\n\nThe mood in the IT industry was slightly better at the beginning of the year. In January 2024, the ifo index for IT service providers climbed to 17.9 points, after 16.3 points in the preceding month. Here, the expectations for the next six months improved considerably and thus propelled the rise.\n\nDespite the uncertainties, the Executive Board is confident that the company will deliver positive business performance above the industry average. Bechtle has already furnished evidence of its ability to achieve profitable growth with its competitive business model even in times of economic hardship.\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### OVERVIEW OF FORECASTS ON THE EARNINGS POSITION FOR 2024\n\n**OVERALL ASSESSMENT**\n\n|                              | Group                                                                  | IT System House<br>& Managed Services               | IT E-Commerce                                       |\n|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Business volume              | Significant increase<br>over 2023                                      |                                                     |                                                     |\n| Revenue                      | Significant increase<br>over 2023                                      | Significant increase                                | Significant increase                                |\n| Cost of sales                | Increase more or less<br>parallels revenue increase                    |                                                     |                                                     |\n| Gross margin                 | >17%                                                                   |                                                     |                                                     |\n| Distribution cost ratio      | <7%                                                                    |                                                     |                                                     |\n| Administrative expense ratio | <6%                                                                    |                                                     |                                                     |\n| EBT                          | Increase more or less<br>parallels revenue increase                    | Increase more or less<br>parallels revenue increase | Increase more or less<br>parallels revenue increase |\n| EBT margin                   | More or less at<br>prior-year level                                    | More or less at<br>prior-year level                 | More or less at<br>prior-year level                 |\n| Dividend                     | Dividend payout ratio of<br>about one third of<br>earnings after taxes |                                                     |                                                     |\n\n{161}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-161-0\"></span>**INFORMATION ON BECHTLE AG (ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCORDING TO THE GERMAN COMMERCIAL CODE [HGB])**\n\nWithin the conventional holding structure of the Bechtle Group, Bechtle AG as an individual company is responsible, as the parent company, for all overarching tasks for the whole group. In addition to the operating business, the result of Bechtle AG is shaped, to a significant extent, by the investment earnings which are influenced by the performance of the Bechtle Group companies. The economic framework conditions of Bechtle AG are essentially identical with those of the Bechtle Group. The explanations below refer to the annual financial statements in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB) of Bechtle AG for the 2023 financial year.\n\nSee [Forecast report,](#page-146-0) [page 147 ff](#page-146-0) and see [Opportunity and risk report,](#page-117-0) [page 118 ff](#page-117-0)\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-162-0\"></span>**EARNINGS, ASSETS AND FINANCIAL POSITION**\n\n### **EARNINGS POSITION**\n\nAll percentages are calculated on the basis of figures in € thousand. This can result in rounding differences.\n\nOwing to its function as a financial holding, the earnings position of Bechtle AG largely depends on the financial performance of its operating subsidiaries. Apart from a few exceptions, the earnings of all major domestic subsidiaries are synchronised taken over by Bechtle AG as the top parent company on the basis of existing profit transfer agreements or regulations in their charters.\n\nThe investment earnings (incl. income from profit transfer agreements and expenses from the assumption of losses) increased by €27.6 million to €222.8 million in comparison to the prior year.\n\nAll in all, revenue climbed from €284.4 million to €447.2 million. The increase was due to higher income from merchandise and third-party services.\n\n|         |       |       |       |       | €m    |\n|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|         | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  | 2019  |\n| Revenue | 447.2 | 284.4 | 245.4 | 259.2 | 209.6 |\n\nIn 2023, other operating income dropped by 2.95 per cent to €7.1 million, after €7.3 million in the prior year. This item mainly comprises income from the reversal of provisions in the amount of €3.4 million (prior year: €1.7 million), income from brand licences in the amount of €1.8 million (prior year: €0 million) and extraordinary income in the amount of €0.6 million (prior year: €0.7 million).\n\n|                        |      | €m   |      |      |      |\n|------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                        | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Other operating income | 7.1  | 7.3  | 5.1  | 10.4 | 3.5  |\n\nThe cost of materials increased by €138.3 million in comparison to the prior year to €334.1 million (prior year: €195.8 million), which is largely the result of the increase in costs of goods purchased for resale, in particular merchandise, in the amount of €225.6 million (prior year: €114.7 million).\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\nDue especially to new recruitment, personnel expenses increased by 10.1 per cent from €50.4 million to €55.5 million.\n\n|                    |      |      |      | €m   |      |\n|--------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                    | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n| Personnel expenses | 55.5 | 50.4 | 43.8 | 42.8 | 36.6 |\n\nOther operating expenses included mainly software licences amounting to €15.6 million (prior year: €11.6 million), legal and consulting costs amounting to €11.1 million (prior year: €15.6 million), extraordinary expenses amounting to €10.8 million (prior year: €19.6 million), maintenance fees amounting to €5.4 million (prior year: €5.9 million) and building expenses amounting to €5.2 million (prior year: €5.3 million).\n\n|                          | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 | 2020 | €m | 2019 |\n|--------------------------|------|------|------|------|----|------|\n| Other operating expenses | 67.4 | 65.5 | 58.1 | 36.6 |    | 35.6 |\n\nThe investment earnings presented below comprises the income from profit transfer agreements and investments as well as expenses from the assumption of losses. In total, investment earnings increased by 14.1 per cent from €195.2 million to €222.8 million. Interest expenses and income vis-àvis affiliated companies increased in comparison to the prior year and resulted essentially from interest increases from cash pooling with the affiliated companies. The increase in interest expenses visà-vis third parties is a result of the commitment interest and interest expenses which arose in connection with the convertible bond.\n\n|                     | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  | 2019  | €m |\n|---------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|----|\n| Investment earnings | 222.8 | 195.2 | 178.7 | 180.0 | 145.6 |    |\n\nIncome tax expenses went up from €30.7 million to €34.8 million.\n\n|               | 2023  | 2022  | 2021  | 2020  | 2019 | €m |\n|---------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------|----|\n| Annual profit | 171.2 | 131.0 | 110.8 | 132.3 | 98.2 |    |\n\nThe annual profit went up by €40.2 million to €171.2 million. After allocation to provisions pursuant to Section 58 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in the amount of €83 million, the net profit was €88.2 million. An amount of €88.2 million is to be paid out. The planned dividend per share amounts to €0.70 (prior year: €0.65). As a matter of principle, Bechtle AG pursues a shareholder-friendly dividend policy which is geared towards continuity. A dividend payout ratio of about one third of group earnings as well as continual dividend increases are manifestations of a reliable dividend policy.\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-164-0\"></span>**ASSETS POSITION**\n\nThe structure of the assets reflects the field of activity of Bechtle AG as a financial holding: Financial assets accounted for 41.6 per cent or €802.7 million and receivables from affiliated companies – which are largely related to the financing of the subsidiaries – accounted for 38.4 per cent or €739.8 million of the balance sheet total.\n\nYear on year, the balance sheet total underwent an increase of €293.1 million or 17.8 per cent. On the assets side, the increase is largely the result of the increase in financial investment assets due to capital increases at subsidiaries and the acquisition of PLANET AI GmbH. The increase in current assets is largely attributable to an increase in bank balances, due primarily to the issue of the convertible bond. On the equity and liabilities side, the increase is due largely to the increase in equity. The increase in liabilities, analogous to the increase in bank balances, results from the placement of the convertible bond. This was offset, to some extent, by the repayment of existing loans.\n\nAs of the balance sheet date, Bechtle AG held cash and cash equivalents worth €235.0 million (prior year: €99.0 million). Together with unused credit lines amounting to €523.4 million (prior year: €453.2 million), the company thus has sufficient liquidity for future expansions and acquisitions.\n\n|                                                        | 2023      | 2022      | 2021      | 2020      | 2019      | € |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---|\n| Assets                                                 |           |           |           |           |           |   |\n| Fixed assets                                           | 836,268   | 664,828   | 590,086   | 578,440   | 517,090   |   |\n| Inventories                                            | 34,295    | 9,511     | 19,036    | 8,652     | 4,797     |   |\n| Receivables                                            | 798,084   | 849,552   | 522,662   | 451,279   | 463,617   |   |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                              | 234,978   | 98,956    | 205,889   | 242,644   | 156,441   |   |\n| Other assets                                           | 23,715    | 12,659    | 6,719     | 14,974    | 7,718     |   |\n| Equity and liabilities                                 |           |           |           |           |           |   |\n| Equity                                                 | 826,504   | 737,243   | 675,569   | 621,537   | 539,655   |   |\n| Non-current liabilities<br>and deferred income         | 531,175   | 234,086   | 316,928   | 441,376   | 318,750   |   |\n| Current liabilities, provisions and<br>deferred income | 569,661   | 664,177   | 351,580   | 233,076   | 295,628   |   |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                               | 0         | 0         | 315       | 0         | 0         |   |\n| Balance sheet total                                    | 1,927,340 | 1,635,506 | 1,344,392 | 1,295,989 | 1,154,033 |   |\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-165-0\"></span>**FINANCIAL POSITION**\n\n#### FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES\n\nThe objective of Bechtle's financial policy is to keep the group's financial power at a high level, thereby retaining the company's financial independence by ensuring adequate liquidity. At the same time, risks are to be avoided as far as possible or hedged effectively. For example, the Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board prohibit all kinds of speculative forward transactions. This applies especially to currencies, goods and securities, as well as the respective forward transactions, unless they serve the hedging of the business operations.\n\nAs a matter of principle, Bechtle uses derivative financial instruments exclusively for hedging its operating activities. With regard to the investment of excess liquidity, quick availability is more important than maximum yield. Investment business was only conducted with investment-grade debtors. Moreover, investments in the banking sector are only made in the form of protected deposits.\n\n#### CASH FLOW STATEMENT\n\nCash and cash equivalents amounted to €99.0 million at the start of the period and to €235.0 million at the end of the period, with a resulting change in cash and cash equivalents of €136 million.\n\nThe net cash outflow from operating activities was €9.5 million (prior year: €195.0 million). The cash flow from operating activities increased significantly in comparison to the prior year, due to an improved working capital management.\n\nIn the reporting period, there were investments in intangible assets in the amount of €10.7 million (prior year: €12.7 million) and in property, plant and equipment in the amount of €4.3 million (prior year: €6.3 million). The main investments concern the capital increases of subsidiaries and the acquisition of PLANET AI GmbH. The cash inflow from investment activities was €40.1 million (prior year: €107.3 million) and also resulted from increased investment earnings.\n\nThe dividend payment of €81.9 million, the cash inflow from borrowing in the amount of €1,190 million, the cash outflow from the repayment of financial loans in the amount of €1,291.7 million and interest payments of €11.0 million, as well as a cash inflow from the issue of a convertible bond (issue proceeds: €300 million), together led to cash inflows from financing activities in the amount €105.4 million (prior year: cash outflows of €19.3 million).\n\n{166}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-166-0\"></span>**OPPORTUNITY AND RISK REPORT**\n\nBecause of its function as the holding company for the group, the performance of Bechtle AG, in principle, is subject to the same opportunities and risks as that of the Bechtle Group. Bechtle AG participates in the opportunities and risks of the indirect and direct subsidiaries. In this respect, the opportunities and risks and the risk management as described in the opportunity and risk report of the group also apply to Bechtle AG.\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-167-0\"></span>**FORECAST REPORT**\n\nThe future performance of Bechtle AG is closely linked to the operating performance of the group. Due to its ties with the group companies and their importance for the group, the expectations here are largely reflected in the forecast report of the group. In light of the planned earnings position of the group companies, we expect a small increase in investment earnings and thus also in the annual profit of Bechtle AG.\n\n{168}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n{169}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/169/Picture/0 description: The image is an abstract design featuring a green background with curved lines in the lower left and upper right corners.

GENERAL DISCLOSURES**\n\nBechtle AG (Stuttgart District Court, HRB 108581), Bechtle Platz 1, 74172 Neckarsulm, Germany, is a joint stock corporation under German law. Through its subsidiaries, Bechtle AG operates IT system houses in Germany, Austria, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland, and is active in the IT trading business as an IT e-commerce provider in 14 European countries. In this way, the group offers its customers a comprehensive portfolio of IT infrastructure and IT operation solutions from one source.\n\nBechtle has been listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Prime Standard) since 2000. Moreover, it has been listed in the TecDAX technology index since 2004 and in the MDAX stock exchange index for medium-sized companies since 2018. The company's shares are traded on all German stock exchanges.\n\nOn 11 March 2024, the Executive Board released the Consolidated Financial Statements of Bechtle AG for the 2023 fiscal year for submission to the Supervisory Board.\n\n[bechtle.com/](https://www.bechtle.com/corporate-governance) [corporate-governance](https://www.bechtle.com/corporate-governance) Bechtle AG has issued a declaration of conformity with the German Corporate Governance Code in accordance with Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). An up-to-date version of the declaration has been published on the company's website (www.bechtle.com/ueber-bechtle/ investoren/corporate-governance).\n\n### **II. SUMMARY OF KEY PRINCIPLES OF ACCOUNTING AND CONSOLIDATIONS**\n\n#### BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\nThe parent company Bechtle AG is a listed company and as such required under Section 315e of the German Commercial Code (HGB) to prepare its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and as adopted by the European Union. All International Financial Reporting Standards mandatory for the 2023 fiscal year have been applied.\n\n{178}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments, which have been measured at fair value. The presentation in the balance sheet distinguishes between current and non-current assets and liabilities. Assets and liabilities with a maturity of up to one year are considered as current items. Deferred tax assets and liabilities and provisions for defined benefit plans are presented as non-current items. The income statement is prepared according to the function of expense method. The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euros and rounded to the nearest thousand (€ thousand). Any deviations are explicitly indicated.\n\n#### NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\n**New/amended standards and interpretations applied for the first time.** In the reporting period, Bechtle applied the following new and revised standards and interpretations of the following [efrag.org](https://efrag.org) new accounting pronouncements, which had been published by the IFRS IC and adopted by the EU.\n\n| Pronouncement                                                                                                          | Publication by<br>IASB/IFRS IC         |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Amendments to IAS 12 International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules                                                 | 23 May 2023                            |\n| Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising<br>from a Single Transaction               | 7 May 2021                             |\n| Amendments to IAS 1 Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current,<br>Non-current Liabilities with Covenants | 23 January 2020<br>and 31 October 2022 |\n| Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS practice statement 2 Disclosure of Accounting Policies                                    | 12 February 2021                       |\n| Amendments to IAS 8 Definitions of Accounting Estimates                                                                | 12 February 2021                       |\n\nBechtle is subject to the regulations on Global Minimum Tax (GloBE/Pillar II), which is generally applicable from 2024 and has already been adopted in the national law of some jurisdictions in which Bechtle is represented. According to the law, if no local minimum tax is charged, the parent company in Germany is required to pay an additional tax on the profits of its subsidiaries that are taxed at an effective tax rate of less than 15 per cent. The jurisdictions relevant to Bechtle, in which this tax can be charged, include Switzerland, Ireland and Hungary. Based on analyses conducted, we do not expect Bechtle to suffer major increases of the current taxes in connection with Pillar II.\n\n{179}------------------------------------------------\n\n**New/amended standards and interpretations not yet applied.** IASB and IFRS IC have adopted further standards and interpretations, which are not yet mandatory (\"effective date\") or have not yet been endorsed by the EU. Where the endorsement has yet to take place, the date for the mandatory adoption is derived from the respective pronouncements of IASB/IFRS IC. If endorsed later on, the EU directive may specify a different date for mandatory application.\n\n| Pronouncement                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Publication by IASB/IFRS IC | Endorsement      | Effective date1 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Published pronouncements not yet adopted                                                                                                                                                                                               |                             |                  |                 |\n| Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Investment<br>Entities (Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and<br>IAS 27), Sale or Contribution of Assets between<br>an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture<br>(Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28) | 11 September 2014           | open             | open            |\n| Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Lease Liability<br>in a Sale and Leaseback                                                                                                                                                               | 22 September 2022           | 20 November 2023 | 1 January 2024  |\n| Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 Supplier Finance<br>Arrangements                                                                                                                                                                        | 25 May 2023                 | open             | 1 January 2024  |\n| Amendments to IAS 21 Lack of Exchangeability                                                                                                                                                                                           | 15 August 2023              | open             | 1 January 2025  |\n\n1 Must be adopted at the latest at the beginning of the first fiscal year commencing on or after the said date.\n\nCurrently, we do not expect these standards to have any significant impact on the financial statements of the Bechtle Group.\n\n#### CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are based on the financial statements of Bechtle AG and its direct and indirect subsidiaries prepared using uniform group accounting policies. Subsidiaries are companies directly or indirectly controlled by Bechtle AG. Capital consolidation is carried out by offsetting the carrying amount of the shareholding against the pro-rata re-measured equity of the subsidiaries at the time of acquisition. Any positive differences are recognised as goodwill pursuant to IFRS 3.32. Any negative differences are to be recognised in the income statement through profit or loss pursuant to IFRS 3.34 ff. The consolidated income statement takes into account the earnings of the acquired companies from the acquisition date, i.e. from the date the group attains control. Inclusion in the Consolidated Financial Statements ends as soon as the parent company relinquishes control.\n\nIf the investment company is not controlled and the investment company is an associate, it is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method.\n\nBechtle AG Annual Report 2023\n\n{180}------------------------------------------------\n\nAll intra-group gains and losses, revenue, expenses, income, receivables and liabilities are eliminated.

The company is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a joint venture using the equity method, since the parties involved hold the rights in the net assets and decisions on important activities require the parties' unanimous approval. The joint venture is based on the agreement between the partners (Bechtle AG and the company's continued management and founding team) to combine application-oriented AI research with the sales competencies of the largest German IT system house. Another objective of the agreement is to strengthen the AI ecosystem in Europe and to assume a leading role in future innovation.\n\n{181}------------------------------------------------\n\nSee [page 206 f](#page-205-0) and [page 245 ff](#page-244-0) Further disclosures concerning the companies acquired are presented in section VIII. \"Acquisitions and purchase price allocation\" and section IV. \"Further explanatory notes on the balance sheet\", (8) \"Goodwill\".\n\n#### C U R R E N C Y T R A N S L AT I O N\n\nThe subsidiaries of Bechtle keep their books in local currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are converted at the closing rate on the date of the transaction. On the closing date, monetary assets and liabilities are measured at the closing rate, while non-monetary balance sheet items are translated at the rate on the day of the transaction. Gains and losses resulting from exchange rate fluctuations in foreign currency transactions are recognised through profit or loss. By contrast, currency translation differences based on net investments in foreign operations of a subsidiary are recognised in equity through other comprehensive income.\n\nWithin the framework of the consolidation, assets and liabilities are translated into euros, the group's presentation currency, at the closing rate. The revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average rate during the reporting period. Equity is determined on the basis of historical rates. Any resulting translation differences are recognised in a separate item in the equity.\n\nChanges in exchange rates of currencies important to the Bechtle Group in relation to the euro:\n\n|                | Currency | Closing rate |        | Average exchange rate |        |\n|----------------|----------|--------------|--------|-----------------------|--------|\n|                |          | 2023         | 2022   | 2023                  | 2022   |\n| Switzerland    | CHF      | 0.93         | 0.99   | 0.97                  | 1.00   |\n| UK             | GBP      | 0.87         | 0.89   | 0.87                  | 0.85   |\n| USA            | USD      | 1.11         | 1.07   | 1.08                  | 1.05   |\n| Poland         | PLN      | 4.35         | 4.69   | 4.54                  | 4.69   |\n| Hungary        | HUF      | 382.78       | 400.25 | 381.95                | 391.33 |\n| Czech Republic | CZK      | 24.73        | 24.12  | 24.01                 | 24.57  |\n\nFor our subsidiary in Argentina, we apply the accounting for high-inflation countries by adjusting the financial statements of this subsidiary for the current period under consideration of the change in the general purchasing power of the local currency on the basis of the relevant price indices as of the reporting date. The effects on the consolidated earnings are of minor importance and are not significant.\n\n{182}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n**Revenue recognition.** The gross revenue comprises all income resulting from Bechtle's ordinary business operations from contracts with customers. Gross revenue is presented without value-added tax and other taxes collected from the customers and paid to the tax authorities.\n\nBechtle does not reduce its promised consideration by a financing component if the term of the receivable is no more than one year. Where the term of the receivable is more than one year, the revenue is discounted to the fair value.\n\nBechtle recognises revenue as follows: When selling hardware and software, the revenue is recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied. The performance obligation is satisfied when the customer obtains control of the good or service. In Bechtle's business environment, the most significant indicators for the transfer of control are the purchase by the customer and the transfer of the ownership-related opportunities and risks of the asset. Depending on the underlying business transaction, the recognition of the revenue takes place in the amount of the consideration that Bechtle expects to receive for these goods (accounting as principal) or in the amount of the gross margin (accounting as agent).\n\n**Principal/agent.** In its **hardware selling** business, Bechtle recognises the revenue as principal. Bechtle acts as the principal as it has the control over the determined claim to transfer of the goods before they are transferred to the customer. Bechtle obtains the control over the claim to transfer of the goods after concluding the contract with the customer but before the goods are transferred to the customer. The terms and conditions of the contract with the customer permit Bechtle to decide whether to ship directly from its own warehouse or via the vendor or distributor. If the shipment takes place directly via the manufacturer or distributor, the manufacturer or distributor acts on behalf of and for the account of Bechtle (drop shipping).\n\nWith regard to the **sale of software licences,** Bechtle distinguishes several types of software licences. These types reflect Bechtle's business model and thus help to clarify this issue:\n\n#### � Standard software without customising\n\nIn the field of sales of standard software without customising, Bechtle makes distinction between two types:\n\n� Direct business: as an authorised sales partner, Bechtle places standard software products that are delivered by software vendors to end customers. Bechtle's only obligation from these agreements consists of asking another company to grant the standard software licence to the end customer. Bechtle thus acts as an agent and recognises the income at the net amount it receives from the agency services.\n\n{183}------------------------------------------------\n\n� Indirect business: within the scope of the sale of customer-specific solutions on the basis of standard software licences, Bechtle acts as a value-added software reseller and performs pre-sales consulting services in connection with the sale. This especially includes aspects of strategic and operational software procurement and consulting services with respect to the contract and compliance. Under consideration of all relevant factors (see Discretionary Decisions, Estimates and Assumptions), Bechtle is of the opinion that in the context of the pure sale of standard software, Bechtle acts as an agent. In the indirect business, Bechtle thus records the revenue in the amount of the gross margin. This assessment also applies to the sale of standard software licences with basic installation services. These installation services are generally not very extensive or complex, so that the standard software or the interfaces do not need to be customised (no customisation of the existing interfaces and no new development). Based on this analysis, Bechtle is of the opinion that it transfers two separately specified goods or services to the customer. Under consideration of all factors, Bechtle is thus of the opinion that when selling standard software licences with basic installation services, it acts as an agent. The classification as principal or agent does not depend on the provisioning model, i.e. it applies both to on-premise models and to SaaS models from the cloud, which\n\nare sold in the context of the indirect business model.\n\n� Standard software including customising and/or customer-specific integration of the standard software: on the one hand, Bechtle performs basic adjustments to the function scope of the standard software in order to meet the individual requirements of an end customer in connection with the sale of the standard software. In this connection, Bechtle has noticed that the customising for customer-specific requirements is so extensive that the standard software is changed or adapted significantly by means of this customising. On the other hand, Bechtle also performs integration services that are aligned with the needs of the end customer in order to integrate the standard software licence in the existing system of the end customer. Bechtle thus uses the standard software licence and the customer-specific integration service for the purpose of achieving the combined end result (= functional and integrated software system) as defined in the contract with the end customer. Accordingly, Bechtle comes to the conclusion that the services cannot be separated from each other, and a single performance obligation is owed to the customer. As Bechtle is responsible for fulfilling this promise, Bechtle acts as the principal in these agreements. This is backed by the fact that Bechtle can freely determine its selling prices. In this business, Bechtle thus recognises the revenue in the amount of the consideration that Bechtle expects to receive for these goods and services.\n\nAt Bechtle, **warranty obligations** usually do not meet the requirements for a separate performance obligation, as they do not exceed the statutory scope. They are presented as provisions.\n\nHowever, if third-party warranty obligations are sold, Bechtle sees itself as an agent and recognises the resulting revenue in the amount of the gross margin.\n\n[See page 197 f](#page-196-0)\n\n{184}------------------------------------------------\n\nRevenue from the **performance of IT services** is recognised over time, as the units rendered by Bechtle cannot be used otherwise and Bechtle is entitled to payment for the services already performed. The revenue is recognised on the basis of input-based methods to measure the progress of the performance. Until the invoice is issued to the customer, the revenue is presented in the contract assets.\n\nBechtle recognises the revenue from the performance of IT services as principal, as the group transfers the control over the service directly to its customers or makes it available directly to its customers.\n\n**Multiple-element contracts** for the shipment of several products or the performance of several services need to be separated into individual performance obligations for each of which a separate income is to be determined and recognised upon fulfilment of the obligation towards the customer. In addition to the combination of various hardware and software products, this especially concerns Bechtle's managed service contracts. The total transaction price of the combined contract is divided to the individual performance obligations on the basis of the pro-rata individual selling prices, i.e. the individual selling price of each element is put in relation to the total of the individual selling prices of the contractual performance obligations.\n\nThe evaluation whether the revenue needs to be recognised over time or on a point-in-time basis is performed separately for each performance obligation.\n\nPursuant to IFRS 15, **contract costs** that arise in connection with the fulfilment of managed service contracts need to be capitalised and amortised over the contract term, provided they are directly connected to the contract, result in enhanced use of resources and are recoverable. As in the previous year, these costs played only a minor role in the reporting period.\n\nPursuant to IFRS 15.91, **sales commissions** in connection with long-term managed service contracts needs to be capitalised if the time of accrual does not coincide with recognition of the revenue. This would be the case if the sales commission were to be due upon conclusion of the contract. Bechtle recognises sales commission on trading business and services as expenses at the time of delivery or performance, i.e. at the same time as the revenue recognition.\n\n**Research and development costs.** Apart from the development costs incurred in connection with the production of software designated for internal use or for sale, no significant research and development costs were incurred. Please refer to our statement on internally developed software.\n\n[See Company,](#page-44-0)  [page 45 f](#page-44-0)\n\n{185}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Leases. Bechtle as lessee.** Accordingly, all contracts in the Bechtle Group that constitute a lease or leases that are included in another contract must be measured as a lease liability at the present value of the lease payments when they are first recognised at the time of provision. This includes variable lease payments that are linked to an index or (interest) rate and whose initial measurement is made using the index or (interest) rate valid on the provision date. The discounting takes place on the basis of Bechtle's incremental borrowing rate of interest at the same time and in the same currency. On the assets side, a right-of-use asset is recognised for the underlying asset under property, plant and equipment as of the time of initial accounting. This right-of-use asset is depreciated according to schedule over the lease term. If no term is determined in an agreement or the agreement can be terminated on a monthly basis, a term of five years is used. Furthermore, extension and termination options contained in rental agreements and leases are taken into consideration in the measurement of the lease liability and thus included in the evaluation of the right-of-use asset, provided that the exercise of these options is reasonably certain. Bechtle does not account for a right-of-use asset and the corresponding lease liability for leases that are classified as short-term leases with a term of up to twelve months or as leases for low-value assets (up to €5 thousand).\n\nAt Bechtle, the application of IFRS 16 resulted in the capitalisation of right-of-use assets, especially for rental property and leased company vehicles. Additionally, there are leases for office equipment, furniture, fixtures and fittings, job bicycles and customer equipment, which, however, are of minor significance.\n\nWith the application of IFRS 16, the expenses for leases do not affect EBIT in the full amount in the income statement. Rather, only the expense from the depreciation of the capitalised right-of-use asset is recognised in EBIT; the interest costs for the lease liability are posted to the financial earnings.\n\nIn the cash flow statement, the lease payments in the amount of the interest and repayment share are included in the cash flow from financing activities.\n\n**Leases. Bechtle as lessor.** Bechtle also acts as a lessor. From this perspective, leases are classified as operating leases and finance leases. Payments from operating leases are recognised as income over the lease term through profit and loss. Assets in operating leases are carried at amortised cost in property, plant and equipment.\n\nIf all material opportunities and risks associated with the ownership have passed to the lessee, the lease shall be recognised as a finance lease. In this context, a receivable is accounted for from the finance lease in the amount of the net investment value from the lease. In this connection, Bechtle regularly engages in vendor leasing on the market and recognises revenue in the amount of the present value of future lease payments. On the other hand, expenses associated with the lease are recognised in the income statement, and the amount of the present value of future payments is accounted for as a lease liability.\n\n{186}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Goodwill** from a business combination is initially recognised at cost of purchase in the form of the surplus of the cost of purchase of the business combination over the share of net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised by the buyer pursuant to IFRS 3. The goodwill identified in the context of a business combination corresponds to the expectation of future economic benefit from assets that cannot be individually identified or presented separately.\n\nPursuant to IFRS 3, goodwill is not amortised. Instead, it is tested for impairment at least once a year pursuant to IAS 36.\n\n**Other intangible assets** in the Bechtle Group include brands, customer bases, purchased software, internally developed software and customer service agreements. Depreciation and amortisation of other intangible assets is allocated to the respective functional areas.\n\nBrands acquired in the context of company acquisitions are measured at the fair value of the brand right. Except for the Inmac Wstore brand purchased in the 2018 fiscal year, the useful life used to be assumed to be unlimited, as an analysis of all relevant factors does not reveal any foreseeable limitation of the period in which these brand rights can prospectively generate net cash flows for the Bechtle Group. Consequently, in accordance with IAS 38, brand rights may not be amortised, but shall be tested for impairment at least once a year pursuant to IAS 36.\n\nCustomer relationships acquired in the context of company acquisitions are measured in accordance with the economic benefit resulting from the customer relationships. Customer relationships are amortised on a straight-line basis over a period that depends on the expected benefit for the company. As a matter of principle, it is assumed that customer relationships are of a long-term nature. The expected useful life is five to ten years.\n\nPurchased software is measured at cost of purchase and amortised on a straight-line basis over a useful life of one to ten years.\n\nInternally developed software is capitalised under the conditions of IAS 38 provided that both the technical feasibility and the marketability of the newly developed products are ensured, the group derives an economic benefit, and internal use or sale is planned. Capitalisation takes place at cost, including all attributable costs. Costs incurred in the period prior to the technical feasibility are immediately recognised as research costs. Straight-line depreciation of the capitalised costs takes place from the date of commercial use of the asset over a useful life of three to five years.\n\n{187}------------------------------------------------\n\nFor goodwill and other intangible assets with an unlimited useful life, an impairment test is performed at least once a year for the cash-generating unit that these assets are allocated to. In the case of intangible assets with limited useful lives and property, plant and equipment, an impairment test is performed if events or changes occur that suggest impairment. In the Bechtle Group, impairment tests are always conducted on the basis of the value in use determined by means of the discounted cash flow method. The basis for this is the current plan drawn up by the management for the next three fiscal years. The planning assumptions are duly adjusted to the current state of knowledge based on internal and external information available. In the process, appropriate assumptions on macroeconomic trends and historical developments are taken into account. As a matter of principle, the expected growth rates in the relevant markets are used as the basis for the calculation of cash flows.\n\nThe need for depreciation and amortisation corresponds to the amount by which the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit exceeds the value in use. For the goodwill impairment test, the goodwill is allocated to its corresponding cash-generating units. Assets that are no longer intended for use in business operations are classified as available for sale and are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell.\n\n**Property, plant and equipment.** Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost of purchase less scheduled amortisation. Most of the property, plant and equipment consists of land and buildings. These assets are held by a limited number of companies. Within the scope of the preparation of the annual financial statements of these companies, the existence of any indications or changed circumstances which might render it impossible to recover the carrying amount of an asset is checked. Scheduled amortisation takes place on a pro rata temporis basis, and mainly on a straight-line basis according to the expected useful life. Scheduled amortisation is based on the following useful lives:\n\n| Office equipment                 | 3–10 year |\n|----------------------------------|-----------|\n| Furniture, fixtures and fittings | 3–20 year |\n| Vehicle fleet                    | 3–6 year  |\n| Buildings                        | 5–33 year |\n\nLow-value assets of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost of purchase and depreciated on a straight-line basis over a useful life of three to eight years. Maintenance costs are recognised through profit or loss when incurred.\n\n{188}------------------------------------------------\n\nA **joint venture** is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement that exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nAccording to the equity method, interests in joint ventures are to be included in the consolidated balance sheet at cost of purchase and subsequently adjusted by changes in the group's interest in the profit or loss and in the other comprehensive income of the joint venture after the date of acquisition. Losses of a joint venture that exceed the group's share in the joint venture are not recorded. They are recorded only if the group has assumed legal or constructive obligations to take over the loss or makes payments on behalf of the joint venture.\n\nAn investment in a joint venture is accounted for as of the date on which the conditions for joint ventures are on hand. Any excess of the cost of purchase of the purchased interest over the interest gained in the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised as goodwill. According to the equity method, the goodwill is part of the carrying amount of the investment and is not separately tested for impairment.\n\nAt re-measurement, any excess interest of the group in the carrying fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities over the cost of purchase of the acquired interest (negative difference) is immediately recognised through profit or loss.\n\nTo determine whether the interests in joint ventures are subject to any impairment, the regulations of IAS 36 are applied. If an impairment test needs to be conducted, this is done for the carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) according to the regulations of IAS 36. For this, the recoverable amount – i.e. the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs of disposal of the investment – is compared with its carrying amount. The determined impairment loss on the assets included in the carrying amount of the interest including goodwill is not performed. If the recoverable amount increases in subsequent years, the impairment loss is reversed in accordance with IAS 36.\n\nThe group stops using the equity method from the date on which its investment no longer represents a joint venture.\n\n{189}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn accordance with IAS 12, **deferred taxes** are recognised for all temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the group's consolidated balance sheet and the tax base of assets and liabilities (liability method) as well as for unused tax losses.\n\nDeferred tax assets for accounting and valuation differences and for unused tax losses are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that these differences will lead to taxa-ble profit in future. As of the balance sheet date, the value of the deferred tax assets rec-ognised in previous periods is reviewed as to whether it is still sufficiently probable that a future benefit can be realised. Deferred tax assets are offset against deferred tax liabilities provided that a legally enforceable right of offsetting exists and the deferred tax assets and liabilities are raised by the same tax authority for the same taxable entity. The assessment is based on the tax rates applicable in the year of reversal. Changes in tax rates are taken into consideration if these have been adopted. Pursuant to the temporary exception to the requirements regarding deferred taxes in IAS 12 as published by the IASB in May 2023, tax effects that could result from the future application of the regulations on global minimum taxation (Pillar II) are not taken into consideration when determining deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\n**Inventories.** Commodities are measured at average cost of purchase pursuant to IAS 2 (weighted average cost method). If necessary, the commodities are written down to the net realisable value. Besides the loss-free measurement, these write-downs take all other inventory risks into consideration. If the reasons that led to a write-down of inventories no longer exist, the impairment loss is reversed.\n\n**Contract assets** are claims to consideration for goods or services that Bechtle transferred to a customer before he made a payment or before the conditions for issuing an invoice and recognising a receivable are on hand. With respect to possible impairment, contract assets – like trade receivables – are subject to the expected credit loss (ECL) model introduced according to IFRS 9.\n\nA **contract liability** is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the group has already received consideration from the customer (or an amount of the consideration is due). A contract liability is recognised when a customer pays the consideration before Bechtle fulfils its performance obligation by transferring goods or services to the customer. Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the performance is rendered under the contract. This especially applies to services invoiced in advance, maintenance agreements, warranty extensions and expansions and advance payments received from third parties.\n\n**190**\n\n{190}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Trade receivables and other assets** are measured at amortised cost taking into consideration due write-down for all identifiable individual risks pursuant to IFRS 9 Appendix A. Non-current receivables with a residual term of more than one year are discounted on the basis of the relevant interest rates on the balance sheet date. The general credit risk is, where verifiable, also taken into consideration by means of appropriate impairments. By way of exception, the derivative financial instruments contained in the other assets are accounted for at fair value.\n\nAs a matter of principle, impairments of trade receivables are performed by means of allowance accounts. The decision whether to take a credit risk into consideration through an allowance account or through direct impairment of the receivable depends on the degree of reliability of the assessment of the risk situation. The individual portfolio managers are responsible for this assessment. Moreover, the general credit risk is accommodated under consideration of Euler Hermes ratings and corresponding probabilities of default in the scope of the ECL model introduced pursuant to IFRS 9. For trade receivables, receivables from finance leases and contract assets, the simplified model of IFRS 9 is applied to assess impairment on the basis of lifetime expected losses. The group determines the expected losses from these items using an impairment matrix, which is calculated on the basis of the historical losses per overdue status of the debtors and, if necessary, adjusted to current conditions and expectations of future economic developments.\n\nIn the Bechtle Group, trade receivables exclusively comprise financial instruments. The other assets also include non-financial assets. For these, no measurement at amortised cost is performed pursuant to IFRS 9.\n\n**Time deposits and securities.** Time deposits are measured as financial assets at amortised cost. They comprise time deposits and similar investments with banks and other financial service institutions, as well as investments in insurance policies with original maturities of more than three months from the date of purchase.\n\n**Cash and cash equivalents.** Cash and cash equivalents are measured as financial assets at amortised cost. They include current bank balances and cash on hand as well as short-term time deposits with initial maturities of less than three months from the acquisition date.\n\n**Pension provisions.** Pension liabilities are accounted for and measured pursuant to IAS 19. In this context, a distinction is made between defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans.\n\n{191}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the case of defined contribution plans, the employer has no obligations apart from the regular payment of defined contributions. As no actuarial assumptions are required to measure the liabilities or expenses, actuarial gains or losses cannot arise. Bechtle does not have any significant number of defined contribution plans.\n\nIn contrast, the obligations arising from defined benefit plans are to be measured on the basis of actuarial assumptions and calculations taking into account biometric assumptions. In this connection, actuarial gains or losses may occur, which must be recognised directly in equity, taking into account deferred taxes.\n\n**Other provisions** are formed where there is a current obligation to third parties arising from a past event. It must be possible to estimate the amount reliably, and it must be more likely than unlikely that an outflow of future resources will take place. Provisions are only formed for legal and constructive obligations to third parties. Provisions are recognised at the amount that, on the balance sheet date, represents the best possible estimate of the expense that will probably be necessary to fulfil the current obligation.\n\nOther provisions for warranties are formed for prospective claims on the basis of company-specific experience and the revenue. Non-current provisions with a term of more than one year are discounted on the basis of the relevant interest rates on the balance sheet date, provided that the interest effect is material.\n\n**Deferred income** includes all deferred other operating earnings, as in the prior year. This especially affected marketing grants from suppliers as well as rent income.\n\n**Financial liabilities** are recognised as expenses at amortised cost. In the Bechtle Group, financial liabilities exclusively comprise financial instruments. According to its substance, the convertible bond issued in the fiscal year is recognised as a financial liability and an equity instrument. The fair value of the liability component is determined as of the date of issue on the basis of the market interest applicable to comparable non-convertible instruments. This amount is accounted for as financial liability at amortised acquisition cost, applying the effective interest method until the fulfilment or maturity of the instrument. The conversion right classified as equity is determined by deducting the liability component from the fair value of the entire instrument. The resulting value – less income tax effects and associated transaction costs – is recognised as part of the equity and is thus not subject to measurement. The conversion right classified as equity remains in the equity until the conversion right is exercised.\n\n{192}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-192-0\"></span>**Other liabilities** contain both financial and non-financial liabilities and are recognised as expenses at amortised cost. Non-current liabilities with a term of more than one year are discounted on the basis of the relevant interest rates on the balance sheet date.\n\nBy way of exception, liabilities from acquisitions are measured at fair value (IFRS 3.39). Liabilities from acquisitions always represent debt capital, as these liabilities always entail, or could entail, a payment obligation.\n\n**Trade payables** are recognised as expenses at amortised cost. This item exclusively contains financial instruments. Non-current liabilities with a term of more than one year are discounted on the basis of the relevant interest rates on the balance sheet date.\n\n**Financial instruments** are contracts that result simultaneously in a financial asset for one company and in a financial liability or equity instrument for another. This includes both primary financial instruments (e.g. trade receivables or payables) and derivative financial instruments (transactions to hedge risks of change in value). Pursuant to IAS 32.11, an equity instrument is a contract that substantiates a residual interest in the assets of a company after deducting all of its liabilities. If the financial instrument results in payment obligations (even if only conditional), this represents debt capital, not equity.\n\nThe initial recognition of financial instruments takes place at fair value, if necessary adjusted by transaction costs that are directly attributable to the purchase or issue of the financial instrument. This does not apply to trade receivables without significant financing components; these are measured at the transaction price. The subsequent measurement takes place according to their measurement category pursuant to IFRS 9:\n\nSubsequent measurement of financial assets:\n\n- � According to IFRS 9, financial assets are allocated to the classification categories at amortised cost or fair value and measured accordingly. Where financial assets are measured at fair value, the expenses and income can either be recognised through profit or loss or through other comprehensive income.\n- Subsequent measurement of financial liabilities:\n- � Pursuant to IFRS 9, financial liabilities are measured either at amortised cost or at the fair value. The change in value is recognised at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n{193}------------------------------------------------\n\nEquity instruments:\n\n� All equity instruments pursuant to IFRS 9 are to be measured at fair value in the balance sheet. Value changes are to be recognised in profit or loss. In the case of an equity instrument not held for trading, the company may at initial recognition irrevocably decide to measure it at fair value through other comprehensive income. In this case, reclassification of the amounts in other comprehensive income, e.g. upon sale of the instrument, is no longer possible.\n\nFor financial assets that are measured at amortised cost as well as for assets that are measured at fair value and whose change in value is recognised in other comprehensive income, it is checked as of every balance sheet date whether impairment is on hand. Pursuant to IFRS 9, a risk provision is recognised for this purpose on the basis of the expected credit losses (ECL model). The assessment whether future losses are expected is performed on the basis of a creditworthiness analysis of the accounts receivable with the help of Euler Hermes ratings. Accordingly, expected valuation losses will henceforth be taken into consideration in addition to the losses that have already occurred. Once the reasons for the posted impairments no longer exist, the respective write-ups are applied. Due to the very short terms and the creditworthiness of our contract partners, no impairment is determined according to the ECL model for financial assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents.\n\nSee page 231 ff\n\nThe categorisation of the individual financial instruments within the balance sheet items is pre-[See page 231 ff](#page-230-0) sented in chapter VI. \"Further disclosures on financial instruments in accordance with IFRS 7\".\n\n> **Derivative financial instruments** are accounted for as assets or liabilities. All derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value according to the accounting policy on the settlement date. Fair values are determined with the aid of standardised mathematical models (mark-to-model method). The fair value is determined taking into account future cash flows over the residual term of the contract on the basis of current market data (interest rates, yield curve, forward prices). The creditworthiness of the debtor is determined with the help of an overhead percentage method taking into account the amount, the probability of default and the recovery rate in the event of inability to pay.\n\n> The Bechtle Group uses forward exchange contracts and currency options to mitigate the currency risk resulting from future exchange rate fluctuations for receivables and liabilities. For transactions to be classified as effective cash flow hedges, the changes of fair value are posted outside profit or loss, taking into account the applicable deferred taxes. Changes of the fair value that are attributable to the ineffective hedging instrument are recognised through profit or loss.\n\n{194}------------------------------------------------\n\nHedges of net investments in group companies abroad hedge the foreign currency risk from subsidiaries using functional currencies other than the group currency euro. Gains or losses from the hedging transaction that are attributable to the effective part of the hedging transactions are recognised outside profit or loss. Gains or losses attributable to the ineffective part of the hedging instrument are recognised in the income statement.\n\nGains and losses from the change of the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are not accounted for within the scope of the hedge accounting pursuant to IAS 39 are immediately recognised at their fair value in the income statement.\n\n#### DISCRETIONARY DECISIONS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires estimates and assumptions on the part of the Executive Board that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses in the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the disclosure of other financial liabilities and contingent liabilities. The uncertainty associated with these assumptions and estimates may yield results that necessitate substantial adjustments of the carrying amount of the affected assets and liabilities in future periods. All estimates and assumptions are based on the current knowledge and are made in good faith in order to provide a true and fair picture of the group's earnings, assets and financial position.\n\nDue to Russia's ongoing war of aggression on Ukraine, the conflict that has again flared up in the Middle East and the high inflation, estimates and discretionary decision remain subject to greater uncertainty. The actual amounts can differ from the estimates and discretionary decisions. Any available information about the prospective economic development was taken into consideration in the update of the estimates and discretionary decisions.\n\n#### The most important issues that are affected are as follows:\n\nThe **impairment test for goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment** requires estimates of future cash flows from assets or from the cash-generating unit to deter- [See page 206 ff](#page-205-0) mine its value in use as well as the selection of an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of these cash flows. For estimates of future cash flows, long-term revenue forecasts have to be made in the context of the economic setting and the development of the industry.\n\nThe measurement for the initial recognition of **customer relationships, customer service contracts, order backlogs and brands** acquired within the scope of acquisitions also involves esti- [See page 207 f](#page-206-0) mates for the determination of the fair value.\n\nImage /page/194/Picture/9 description: The image shows a book icon above the text \"See page 206 f\".\n\nImage /page/194/Picture/10 description: The image shows a book icon with the text \"See page 20\" below it.\n\n{195}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/195/Picture/1 description: The image shows a document icon on the right side and the text \"See page 20\" below it. The background is a light gray color.\n\nThe scheduled amortisation of **intangible assets** and the scheduled depreciation of **property, plant and equipment** require estimates and assumptions when determining the standardised use- [See page 207 ff](#page-206-0) ful life of assets for the group as a whole.\n\nImage /page/195/Picture/3 description: The image shows a book icon and the text \"See page 231 ff\".\n\nThe **financial instruments** recognised at fair value are allocated to a fair value hierarchy per IFRS 13. Allocation to the various levels is based on the market proximity of the valuation parameters used [See page 231 ff](#page-230-0) to determine the fair values. To the greatest extent possible, the relevant market data observable on the reporting date (e.g. exchange rates or interest rates) as obtained from recognised external market data providers (Level 2) were used as valuation parameters. Additionally, an internally determined credit value adjustment was used for receivables and liabilities (Level 3). For the convertible bond issued in the reporting period, the fair value is determined as the present value of future cash flows under consideration of yield curves and the respective rating-dependent credit risk premium (credit spread).\n\nMajor measurements are required to measure the **deferred tax** assets and liabilities of the group. In particular, the deferred tax assets on unused tax losses require estimates of the amount and dates [See page 209 f](#page-208-0) of future taxable income as well as the future tax planning strategies. Uncertainties also exist with respect to future changes in tax law. If there is doubt that it will be possible to realise the unused tax losses, these are not recognised or impaired.\n\nImage /page/195/Picture/7 description: The image shows a book icon above the text \"See page 21\".\n\nThe **inventories** contain impairments to the lower net realisable value. The amount of the impairments requires estimates and assumptions concerning the prospective realisable sales revenue. [See page 211](#page-210-0)\n\nImage /page/195/Figure/9 description: The image shows a book icon and the text \"See page 211 f\".\n\nProvisions are formed for **debts** in order to account for expected losses resulting from customers' inability to pay. The structure of the maturity of receivables, experience in connection with the proba- [See page 211 ff](#page-210-0) bility of default of external customer ratings, an estimate of the customer's creditworthiness and changes in payment performance form the basis for the assessment of the appropriateness of the provisions for bad debts.\n\nImage /page/195/Picture/11 description: The image shows a book icon on the top right and the text 'See page 218' on the bottom left.\n\nThe measurement of **pension provisions** is based on assumptions about the future development of certain factors. These factors include, among other things, actuarial assumptions such as the dis- [See page 218 ff](#page-217-0) count rate, expected increases in the value of plan assets, expected salary and pension increases, mortality rates and the earliest retirement age. Due to the long-term nature of such plans, such estimates are subject to considerable uncertainties.\n\nImage /page/195/Picture/13 description: The image shows the text \"See page 225\" in a bold font, with a small icon of an open book above the text. The book icon is simple, with several horizontal lines representing the pages.\n\nThe recognition and measurement of **provisions** rely heavily on estimates. The assessment of the quantification of the possible amount of payment obligations is based on the respective situation and circumstances. Provisions are recognised for obligations where there is a risk of losses, these losses are probable and their amount can be reliably estimated.\n\n{196}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-196-0\"></span>The inclusion of **hedging instruments** in the hedge accounting requires assumptions and estimates with respect to the underlying probability of occurrence of future transactions with hedged currencies [See page 235 ff](#page-234-0) and interest rates.\n\nTo determine whether an agreement constitutes a **lease,** it is necessary to assess whether the fulfilment of the contractual agreement depends on the use of a certain asset or certain assets and on [See page 252 ff](#page-251-0) whether the agreement grants the right to use the asset. Bechtle determines the lease term under consideration of the basic lease term that cannot be terminated as well as extension and termination options, provided it is reasonably certain that these options will be exercised in the future. In the case of an unlimited lease term in real-estate rental agreements, a useful life of five years is assumed.\n\nSee page 235\n\nImage /page/196/Picture/4 description: The image shows a book icon above the text \"See page 252.\"\n\nThe assessment of leases on the lessor side largely takes place on the basis of the criteria of the useful life as specified in the standard as well as the present value of the lease payments at the beginning of the lease.\n\nIn the context of the **revenue recognition and the assessment whether Bechtle is the principal or agent** when selling standard software licences without customising in the indirect business, Bechtle has applied the following accounting methods.\n\n**Pre-Sales consulting services.** In keeping with the agenda decision of the IFRS IC, Bechtle is of the opinion that pre-sales consulting is more in the nature of a sales service and therefore, no separate performance obligation can be identified. This is justified for various reasons, including by the fact that at the time of conclusion of the contract, the value-added reseller has already performed the consulting services. Though the consulting could have influenced the customer's decision to order a certain type and number of software licences, no effective contract between the value-added reseller and the customer is on hand prior to an order. If no software licences are purchased, Bechtle will, therefore, not be entitled to any compensation for the consulting services.\n\nMoreover, this estimation is supported by the following aspects:\n\n- � Compared to the value of the standard software licence, the pre-sales consulting overhead usually accounts for a minor share.\n- � A customer who knows which contract model would be suitable and exactly how many standard software licences he or she needs would not gain any added value from the pre-sales consulting.\n\n**Differentiation between installation and integration services.** With the sale of standard software, including customising and/or customer-specific integration of standard software, substantial discretionary leeway remains especially with regard to the question whether the mere installation of a software or complex customising and/or a customer-specific integration is on hand.\n\n{197}------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing an evaluation under consideration of the additional insight derived from the agenda decision of the IFRS IC, Bechtle came to the conclusion that stricter criteria must be applied for customising and integration services. Substantial customising and/or customer-specific integration must thus either � contain a significant customisation of the software (modification of the source code) or\n\n- � the function scope of the standard software licence must have been modified significantly, e.g. through\n- � creation of new interfaces or\n- � expansion/customisation of the existing interfaces.\n\nIf the installation or integration service does not include this scope, it is classified as (basic ) installation and does not meet the criteria for qualification as principal.\n\n**Estimates and assumptions. Gross versus net presentation.** The evaluation as to whether Bechtle should recognise revenue either in the amount of the consideration that Bechtle expects to receive for these goods and services (accounting as principal) or in the amount of the gross margin (accounting as agent) requires an analysis both of the legal form and of the economic content of contracts. After considering all relevant facts and circumstances of the individual case, the decision often involves a certain measure of discretion even if a uniform review pattern is applied throughout the group.\n\nRevenue from standard software licences without customising and/or customer-specific integration of the standard software continue to be generally accounted for as an agent and is presented in the amount of the gross margin. On the other hand, the evaluation of a significant integration service in connection with the sale of software licences is a complex issue for which the above-mentioned criteria need to be used in order to establish a qualification as principal. Basically, Bechtle assumes a qualification as agent. If however, proof of customising and or customer-specific integration is on hand or the performance took place by specialised Bechtle system houses, Bechtle will account for this sale as principal, presenting the gross revenue.\n\nDepending on the evaluation, significant differences may arise with regard to the amount of the revenue and expenses of the respective periods. However, operating income is not affected.\n\n[Company, Environment,](#page-76-0)  [page 77 ff](#page-76-0)\n\n**Effects of the climate change.** In the fields of climate change and shortage of resources, Bechtle [See Management Report,](#page-76-0) has not identified any risks to its business model. Therefore, Bechtle currently does not expect any significant effects of such risks on its business model or on the presentation of its earnings, assets and financial position. Further information on the fields of climate change and sustainability is available in the Group Management Report in the chapter \"Environment\".\n\n{198}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-198-0\"></span>**III. FURTHER EXPLANATORY NOTES ON THE INCOME STATEMENT**\n\n#### **1** REVENUE\n\nThe revenue amounting to €6,422,743 thousand (prior year: €6,028,175 thousand) includes the considerations charged to customers for goods and services less rebates and discounts.\n\nBased on the business volume as of the end of the year, the transaction price of unfulfilled performance obligations amounted to €2,146 million, just slightly below the prior-year figure of €2,452 million¹. Of this amount, the IT System House & Managed Services segment ac-counted for €1,913 million (prior year: €2,117 million¹), and the IT E-Commerce segment for €305 million (prior year: €407 million¹). The IT E-Commerce segment is characterised almost entirely by the conclusion of pure trading deals, usually with short order and deliv-ery times. In the IT System House & Managed Services segment, project deals can take anywhere from several weeks to one year. Especially in the field of Managed Services, which accounts for about one third of the order backlog, Bechtle often concludes framework and operating agreements with terms of several years. About half of these agreements are recognised as revenue in the 2024 fiscal year, and the rest in subsequent years. Contract terms for as-a-service models, e.g. for the procurement of software, can also be longer than one year.\n\nThe company grants the periods of payment that are customary in the respective industry and country (usually 10 to 60 days).\n\n|                    |                                             |                  |           |                                             |                  | €         |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------|\n|                    | 01.01–31.12.2023                            |                  |           | 01.01–31.12.2022                            |                  |           |\n|                    | IT System<br>House &<br>Managed<br>Services | IT<br>E-Commerce | Group     | IT System<br>House &<br>Managed<br>Services | IT<br>E-Commerce | Group     |\n| IT trading revenue | 3,007,318                                   | 2,056,049        | 5,063,367 | 2,666,3412                                  | 2,204,0942       | 4,870,435 |\n| IT service revenue | 1,282,762                                   | 76,614           | 1,359,376 | 1,114,007                                   | 43,733           | 1,157,740 |\n| Total revenue      | 4,290,080                                   | 2,132,663        | 6,422,743 | 3,780,3482                                  | 2,247,8272       | 6,028,175 |\n\nThe following table shows the breakdown of the revenue:\n\n2 Adjustment prior year, due to adjustment of PvA netting €97,820 thousand\n\nIn this context, the IT E-Commerce business segment mainly generates IT trading revenue that is recognised at a point in time.

The increase in financial expenses is the result of the higher interest rates and additional loans raised.\n\n{201}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **5** EARNINGS FROM INVESTMENTS MEASURED AT EQUITY\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method comprise interests in a joint venture. As of 31 December 2023, the carrying amount of this joint venture amounted to €32,497 thousand (prior year: €0 thousand).

Including the trade tax and solidarity surcharge, the tax encumbrance amounted to 30.1 per cent (prior year: 29.7 per cent) on average. The current taxes of subsidiaries abroad are determined on the basis of the respective national tax law and at the tax rate applicable in the country of domicile. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be valid at the time of realisation of the asset or fulfilment of the liability.\n\n{203}------------------------------------------------\n\n€k\n\nThe deferred tax expense from valuation differences in terms of time decreased due mainly to the different depreciation of leased assets. As a matter of principle, they are depreciated on the basis of the term of the leasing agreements. For tax purposes, the useful life is determined on the basis of the official tables describing allowances for depreciation. The shorter useful life of computer hardware and software applied in 2021 amplify this effect.\n\nFor the reporting period, the reconciliation between the actual tax expenses and the amount that arises taking into account a weighted domestic and foreign tax rate of approximately 27.9 per cent (prior year: 27.6 per cent) on the profit before income taxes was as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                  | 2023    | 2022    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Earnings before taxes                                                                            | 374,477 | 350,487 |\n| Expected tax expense                                                                             | 104,642 | 96,588  |\n| Tax expense of earlier years                                                                     | 7,255   | 22      |\n| Non-deductible expenses                                                                          | 5,236   | 2,693   |\n| Tax increase due to controlled foreign corporation rules                                         | 29      | 7       |\n| Unrecognised deferred taxes on unused losses for the current year                                | 21      | 637     |\n| Deconsolidation and other consolidation effects                                                  | 10      | 238     |\n| Earn-out components                                                                              | 0       | 182     |\n| Devaluation of previously recognised deferred taxes on loss carryforwards                        | 0       | 80      |\n| Allocation/addition deferred tax assets to valuation differences in terms of time                | 0       | −53     |\n| Devaluation of previously recognised deferred taxes on valuation differences<br>in terms of time | −23     | 469     |\n| Tax rate change for deferred taxes                                                               | −43     | 15      |\n| Tax-free income                                                                                  | −810    | −721    |\n| Allocation/addition deferred tax assets to loss carryforwards                                    | −1,181  | −626    |\n| Use of previously unrecorded loss carryforwards                                                  | −1,199  | −36     |\n| Tax income of earlier years                                                                      | −4,593  | −105    |\n| Others                                                                                           | −379    | −21     |\n| Actual tax expense                                                                               | 108,965 | 99,369  |\n\n{204}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **7** EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\nThe following tables the calculation of the earnings after taxes that are due to the shareholders of Bechtle AG:\n\nThe following table shows the basic earnings per share:\n\n|                                             | 2023        | 2022        |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Earnings after taxes €k                     | 265,512     | 251,118     |\n| Average number of outstanding shares shares | 126,000,000 | 126,000,000 |\n| Basic earnings per share €                  | 2.11        | 1.99        |\n\nAccording to IAS 33, the earnings per share are determined on the basis of the earnings after taxes (attributable to shareholders of Bechtle AG) and the average number of shares in circulation in the year. Treasury shares reduce the number of outstanding shares accordingly.\n\nSo far, the convertible bond issued in the reporting period has not affected the earnings per share, as the exercise price for the conversion in the reporting period was above the average price of the shares of Bechtle AG. Therefore, the diluted earnings per share corresponded to the basic earnings per share.\n\n{205}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-205-0\"></span>**IV.

Within the framework of the preparation of the annual financial statements as of 31 December 2023, the assumptions with regard to the impairment test did not undergo any changes.\n\n{206}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-206-0\"></span>Bechtle determines the recoverable amounts of its cash-generating units with the help of the discounted cash flow method. The risk-adjusted discount rates are determined on the basis of peer group information for beta factors, borrowing costs and the debt ratio. As of 30 September 2023, the cash-generating units had a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 8.9 per cent (prior year: 8.1 per cent) after taxes (WACC before taxes 12.9 per cent, prior year: 11.3 per cent). The cash flow forecasts used are based on individual revenue and cost plans for the coming year as approved by the management, which are thus also taken into consideration in the variable compensation systems for the executives and are in line with external information sources and experience gained. For the planning, both the expected growth and the profitability of the products and services are made use of. The cash flows for 2024 and 2025 have been derived on the basis of the as-is data and the target data in accordance with the above-mentioned factors, and the cash flow for 2026 has been extrapolated with assumptions based on long-term growth rates of 1 per cent. Sensitivity analyses have revealed that even in the case of substantially divergent key assumptions within a realistic framework, there would be no need for impairment of the goodwill. For example, there would be no need for impairment in the event of a reduction of the yearly free cash flow of the cash-generating units by more than 10.0 per cent each or an increase of the WACC to 12.0 per cent if the other input parameters remained unchanged.\n\nThe development of the goodwill is presented in Appendices B and C to the Notes.\n\n[See Notes,](#page-265-0)  [Appendices B and C,](#page-265-0) [page 266 f](#page-265-0)\n\n€k\n\n#### 9 OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\n|                               | 31.12.2023 | 31.12.2022 |\n|-------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Brands/licences               | 9,448      | 11,837     |\n| Customer bases                | 63,305     | 47,687     |\n| Purchased software            | 28,508     | 18,985     |\n| Internally developed software | 11,714     | 11,085     |\n| Customer service agreements   | 4,493      | 10,107     |\n| Other intangible assets       | 117,468    | 99,701     |\n\nThe Modus brand (carrying amount €1,900 thousand) has an unlimited useful life. This unlimited useful life is due to the fact that Modus Consult GmbH will continue to constitute a key element of the Bechtle Group along with its respective brands and the legal protection of the brand can easily be perpetuated over an extended period. In the prior year, the ARP brand (carrying amount €1,542 thousand) was reduced from a previously unlimited useful life to three years due to the reorganisation in the IT E-Commerce segment. The Inmac WStore brand (carrying amount €4,807 thousand) has a useful life of ten years. The ARP and Inmac WStore brands are allocated to the cash-generating unit IT E-Commerce and the Modus brand to the cash-generating unit IT System House & Managed Services.\n\n207\n\nFor information on the planning process\n\nand expectations, see [Management Report,](#page-46-0)  [page 47 ff](#page-46-0) and [Forecast Report,](#page-146-0)  [page 147 ff](#page-146-0)\n\n{207}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe discount rate used to determine the value in use for the brands within the scope of the yearly impairment tests is based on input parameters derived from the market and was set at 8.9 per cent (prior year: 8.1 per cent). The cash flow forecasts used are based on the revenue and cost plans approved by the management. Further growth rates are only assumed in the amount necessary to compensate for inflation. In the reporting period, as in prior years, the value in use that was determined for the brand surpassed the value in the balance sheet. Sensitivity analyses revealed that even in the case of divergent key assumptions within a realistic framework, there would be no need for impairment of the brand. The change in the carrying amount compared to the prior year is attributable to the scheduled amortisation of the Inmac WStore and ARP brands and currency translation differences.\n\n|                                                              | €      |        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|                                                              | 2023   | 2022   |\n| Customer bases                                               |        |        |\n| Carrying amount (31.12)                                      | 63,305 | 47,687 |\n| Remaining useful life (weighted average) (years)             | 4.6    | 5.3    |\n| Accumulated scheduled amortisation                           | 41,711 | 32,802 |\n| Scheduled amortisation                                       | 12,946 | 9,136  |\n| Currency translation differences of accumulated amortisation | 51     | 26     |\n\nInmac WStore SAS, which had been acquired in 2018, accounted for the greatest share of capitalised customer bases, totalling €27,113 thousand (prior year: €32,923 thousand).

This depends on the generation of future taxable profits in connection with which the tax valuation differences are reversed and unused tax losses can be asserted.\n\nUnder current tax provisions, unused domestic tax losses are regarded as unlimited. The restricted use of loss offsetting possibilities (minimum taxation) under German tax law and time limits of foreign tax losses were taken into consideration in the assessment of the impairment of deferred tax assets on loss carryforwards.\n\nIf a tax entity has a loss history in the recent past, deferred tax assets from loss carryforwards of this entity will be recognised only if there are sufficient taxable temporary differences or substantial indications of the realisation of such.\n\nFor the determination of the amount of deferred tax assets that can be capitalised, material assumptions and estimates of the management are required concerning the expected time of occurrence and amount of income subject to future taxation, as well as the future tax planning strategies. The capitalised deferred taxes on loss carryforwards at various companies that recorded losses in 2022 and/ or 2023 and that were not offset by netted deferred tax liabilities amounted to €0 thousand (prior year: €0 thousand). There were no netted deferred tax liabilities at these companies. Based on the planning of the companies and their current earnings performance, we believe that the deferred tax assets will be realised by means of adequate taxable profits.\n\nUnused tax losses for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised in the balance sheet amounted to €291 thousand (prior year: €4,848 thousand) for corporation tax, €746 thousand (prior year: €8,248 thousand) for trade tax and €142 thousand (prior year: €3,505 thousand¹) for losses of companies abroad.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, deferred tax liabilities on profits of Bechtle subsidiaries not transferred were recognised in the amount of €336 thousand (prior year: €248 thousand).\n\nThe temporary differences in connection with interests in subsidiaries for which no tax liabilities were recognised amounted to a total of €50,670 thousand (prior year: €44,556 thousand).\n\nImage /page/209/Picture/14 description: The image shows a simple line drawing of an open book. The book is upright, with the spine visible. Each page has several horizontal lines representing text. The book is centered and takes up a significant portion of the image.\n\nOf the deferred taxes recognised in the balance sheet, a total of €7,169 thousand were added to the goodwill and €1,492 thousand were deducted from the equity (prior year: €3,360 thousand were added to the goodwill and €7,210 thousand were deducted from the equity) outside profit and loss.

In accordance with the revenue structure, most of the presented receivables are receivables from the delivery of goods. The company is thus exposed to the risk of default up to the carrying amount. In the past, Bechtle suffered minor defaults of individual customers and customer groups. To hedge the general credit risk, reasonable provisions for bad debts are made on the basis of probabilities of default of a rating agency in the context of the ECL model. So far, the difficult political and economic circumstances have not resulted in any increased defaults. However, it remains to be seen how the default rate will continue to develop against the backdrop of the ongoing difficult economic situation. For this reason, the assumptions regarding the allocation of rating classes in order to accommodate the deteriorated economic forecasts in connection with the interest rate increases, the energy price crisis and new credit risks, which were the main reasons for the high impairment level, were the same as in the prior year. Compared to the prior year, the rating classes did not undergo any changes. The decline in impairment was due to the improved rating of our customers in rating classes with a lower probability of default. Due to the very low probability of default and the very high creditworthiness, no impairment is applied to receivables from public-sector clients. The probabilities of default and the gross carrying amounts per rating class are listed in the following table:\n\nExcept for the common lien on receivables from the delivery of goods, the company's receivables are\n\n| Euler-Hermes rating classes                 | Probability<br>of default | Gross<br>carrying<br>amount 2023 | Impairment<br>2023 | Gross<br>carrying<br>amount 2022 | Impairment<br>2022 |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| 01–05: Very high to medium creditworthiness | 0.8%                      | 712,183                          | 5,370              | 795,808                          | 7,002              |\n| 06: Increased risk                          | 4.0%                      | 165,365                          | 5,553              | 164,854                          | 5,991              |\n| 07: High risk                               | 6.5%                      | 63,963                           | 3,490              | 98,785                           | 5,834              |\n| 08: Very high risk                          | 10.0%                     | 31,210                           | 2,620              | 22,533                           | 2,047              |\n| 09: Not creditworthy                        | 18.0%                     | 5,823                            | 880                | 6,274                            | 1,026              |\n| 10: Insolvent                               | 100.0%                    | 4,577                            | 4,577              | 1,800                            | 1,800              |\n| Public-sector clients                       | 0.0%                      | 264,493                          | 0                  | 207,171                          | 0                  |\n| Total                                       |                           | 1,247,614                        | 22,490             | 1,297,225                        | 23,700             |\n\nThe impairment of trade receivables developed as follows:\n\n|                                         |        | €      |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|                                         | 2023   | 2022   |\n| Impairment situation as of 1 January    | 23,700 | 25,382 |\n| Exchange rate differences/consolidation | 1,127  | 46     |\n| Use                                     | 205    | 1,229  |\n| Reversal                                | 5,281  | 4,913  |\n| Allocations (impairment expenses)       | 3,149  | 4,414  |\n| Impairment situation as of 31 December  | 22,490 | 23,700 |\n\n{212}------------------------------------------------\n\nExpenses from the immediate write-off of trade receivables amounted to €1,929 thousand (prior year: €750 thousand).

Furthermore, increased due to strong year-end business, contract assets, which belong to other assets, increased from €49,944 thousand in 2022 to €100,777 thousand in 2023. In accordance with IFRS 9, a risk provision in the amount of €506 thousand (prior year: €250 thousand) was recognised for expected credit risks under consideration of the probabilities of default as calculated by a rating agency.\n\nAs of the reporting date, there were no indications that the debtors of assets overdue would not meet their payment obligations.\n\nFor the disclosures according to IFRS 7, financial instruments included in other assets are allocated to � \"other financial assets\" in the amount of €211,565 thousand (prior year: €140,082 thousand) and � \"financial derivatives\" in the amount of €3,089 thousand (prior year: €1,824 thousand).\n\n#### **16** CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n\nThe cash and cash equivalents in the amount of €435,756 thousand (prior year: €229,590 thousand) include current balances with banks and cash on hand amounting to €349,171 thousand and time deposits (with a term to maturity of less than three months) amounting to €86,585 thousand and are fully allocated to \"cash and cash equivalents\" for the disclosures pursuant to IFRS 7.

Each share has one vote. As of the balance sheet date, no shares had been utilised to service the convertible bond.\n\n**Authorised and contingent capital.** Pursuant to Article 4 (3) of the Articles of Incorporation of Bechtle AG, the Executive Board is authorised, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the company's issued capital by up to €18,900 thousand by issuing new bearer shares (author\n\n{214}------------------------------------------------\n\nised capital according to the resolution of the General Meeting of 15 June 2021) until 14 June 2026. In addition, the Executive Board is authorised in accordance with No. 4 (4) of the Articles of Incorporation of Bechtle AG to conditionally increase the company's issued capital by up to €6,300 thousand in order to issue convertible bonds in the amount of up to €350,000 thousand.\n\nCapital increases may occur against cash contributions and/or in-kind contributions. Subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board is authorised to exclude fractional amounts from the shareholders' subscription rights. Moreover, the Executive Board is authorised, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the subscription right if:\n\n� Case 1: the capital increase is performed against cash contributions, does not exceed €12,600 thousand at the time of the issue and the issue price is not significantly below the listed price or � Case 2: the capital increase is performed for the acquisition of companies or interests in companies.\n\nSubject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board is authorised to determine further details of the capital increases from the authorised capital.\n\n#### CAPITAL RESERVES\n\nCapital reserves mainly comprise the offering premium (agio) from capital increases and amounted to €66,913 thousand (prior year: €40,228 thousand). The change compared to the prior year reflects the equity component from the convertible bond.\n\n#### RETAINED EARNINGS\n\n**Accrued profits.** At the General Meeting on 25 May 2023, a resolution was adopted to pay a dividend of €0.65 per no-par share with dividend entitlement for the 2022 fiscal year (dividend total: €81,900 thousand). The dividend was paid out on 31 May 2023. In the prior year, a dividend total of €69,300 thousand had been paid out on 8 June 2022.\n\nDividends may only be paid from the net profit and the retained earnings of the company, as recognised in the Annual Financial Statements of Bechtle AG prepared in accordance with German commercial law. These amounts deviate from the total equity as presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS. The resolution for the payment of future dividends is jointly proposed by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of the company and adopted by the General Meeting. The decisive factors are in particular profitability, the financial position, capital requirements, business prospects and the general economic framework conditions of the company. Since Bechtle's strategy is geared towards internal and external growth, investments will be necessary for this purpose, which should – where possible – be equity-financed. The Executive Board has decided to propose to the Supervisory Board and to the General Meeting to appropriate the net profit of €88,200 thousand for the 2023 fiscal year for the payment of a normal dividend of €0.70 per no-par share with dividend entitlement.\n\n{215}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-215-0\"></span>Apart from the dividend paid out for the 2022 fiscal year, the retained earnings in the reporting period also changed by the comprehensive income of €259,508 thousand, consisting of earnings after taxes (€265,512 thousand) and other comprehensive income (minus €6,004 thousand). Accordingly, the retained earnings as of 31 December 2023 amounted to €1,549,699 thousand (prior year: €1,372,091 thousand). Apart from the dividend payment, a change from the comprehensive income amounting to €254,505 thousand had taken place in the prior year.\n\n**Accumulated other comprehensive income.** In terms of its accumulated balance as of the balance sheet date and its change during the reporting period, the other comprehensive income that is to be recognised in equity outside profit or loss is composed as follows:\n\n|                                                  |                 |                       |                |                 |                       | €              |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------|----------------|\n|                                                  | 31.12.2023      |                       |                | 31.12.2022      |                       |                |\n|                                                  | Before<br>taxes | Income tax<br>effects | After<br>taxes | Before<br>taxes | Income tax<br>effects | After<br>taxes |\n| Actuarial gains and losses on pension provisions | 7,956           | -2,128                | 5,828          | 17,748          | -3,526                | 14,222         |\n| Unrealised gains and losses on hedges            | 326             | 76                    | 402            | 857             | -18                   | 839            |\n| Hedging of net investments in foreign operations | -56,317         | 17,127                | -39,190        | -45,496         | 13,821                | -31,675        |\n| Currency translation differences                 | 60,269          | 0                     | 60,269         | 49,927          | 0                     | 49,927         |\n| Other comprehensive income                       | 12,234          | 15,075                | 27,309         | 23,036          | 10,277                | 33,313         |\n\n|                                                                             | 01.01–31.12.2023 |                       |                | 01.01–31.12.2022 |                       |                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------------|----------------|\n|                                                                             | Before<br>taxes  | Income tax<br>effects | After<br>taxes | Before<br>taxes  | Income tax<br>effects | After<br>taxes |\n| Items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods |                  |                       |                |                  |                       |                |\n| Actuarial gains and losses on pension provisions                            | −9,792           | 1,398                 | −8,394         | 6,894            | −1,430                | 5,464          |\n| Items that will be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods     |                  |                       |                |                  |                       |                |\n| Unrealised gains and losses on hedges                                       | −531             | 94                    | −437           | −514             | 84                    | −430           |\n| Gains and losses that arose in the current period                           | −307             | 94                    | −213           | −290             | 84                    | −206           |\n| Reclassifications to profit                                                 | −224             | 0                     | −224           | −224             | 0                     | −224           |\n| Hedging of net investments in foreign operations                            | −10,821          | 3,306                 | −7,515         | −18,877          | 5,918                 | −12,959        |\n| Gains and losses that arose in the current period                           | −10,821          | 3,306                 | −7,515         | −18,877          | 5,918                 | −12,959        |\n| Reclassifications to profit and loss                                        | 0                | 0                     | 0              | 0                | 0                     | 0              |\n| Currency translation differences                                            | 10,342           | 0                     | 10,342         | 11,312           | 0                     | 11,312         |\n| Other comprehensive income                                                  | −10,802          | 4,798                 | −6,004         | −1,185           | 4,572                 | 3,387          |\n\n{216}------------------------------------------------\n\nThus, the other comprehensive income amounted to minus €6,004 thousand (prior year: €3,387 thousand) of the comprehensive income in the reporting period. As in the prior year, the amount reclassified to the consolidated income statement (minus €224 thousand) was reclassified to financial expenses. The other comprehensive income as well as the comprehensive income is due in full to the shareholders of Bechtle AG.\n\n#### TREASURY SHARES\n\nBy resolution of the General Meeting on 27 May 2020, the Executive Board had been authorised, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to purchase treasury shares pursuant to Section 71 (1) no. 8 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The purchase of treasury shares must comply with the content of the resolution of the General Meeting. This authorisation is valid until 26 May 2025.\n\nIn the reporting period, there were no transactions in treasury shares. Thus, as was the case on 31 December 2022, the company did not hold any treasury shares as of 31 December 2023.\n\n#### CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\nWithin the scope of the capital management (IAS 1.134 f), Bechtle focuses on a sound capital structure with a high equity ratio, a high return on assets and a comfortable liquidity situation, and, in this connection, on cash flow-based indicators such as working capital.\n\nAt €1,742,612 thousand, Bechtle's equity as of 31 December 2023 reached a high value that represented a year-on-year improvement (€1,538,319 thousand). In the reporting period, the equity (+13.3 per cent) grew at a higher rate than the debt capital (+7.9 per cent), which is reflected in a higher equity ratio of 45.8 per cent (prior year: 44.6 per cent). The increase in debt capital resulted especially from higher financial liabilities due to the convertible bond, higher contract liabilities well as other liabilities, which include liabilities to employees. In the reporting period, the existing loans were repaid according to schedule. The higher dividend payout in the reporting period resulted in a lower return on equity of 17.24 per cent (prior year: 18.56 per cent). The return on assets dropped slightly to 8.4 per cent (prior year: 8.5 per cent).\n\nThe unchanged goal of Bechtle's capital management is to retain a strong equity base in order to maintain the trust of investors, lenders and the market, and to facilitate future internal and external growth. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may also adjust the dividend payments to shareholders, issue new shares or buy back treasury shares, and even retire shares if necessary.\n\n{217}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-217-0\"></span>The group's sound capital structure also forms the basis for financial flexibility and extensive independence from outside creditors, which is very important for Bechtle. The objective is to have a comfortable liquidity situation to ensure full solvency at all times. As of 31 December 2023, Bechtle had cash and cash equivalents as well as time deposits and securities amounting to €465,756 thousand (prior year: €289,590 thousand). With respect to the structure of these assets, quick availability is more important than maximum yield, e.g. in order to have access to cash and cash equivalents whenever necessary for acquisitions or large project pre-financing measures, thereby being able to benefit from such opportunities. The liquidity situation is managed and monitored by the central treasury.\n\nAgainst this background, cash flow-based key indicators such as the working capital, DSO and other capital tie-up periods are highly significant. Bechtle controls these indicators in order to tie up as little capital and liquidity as possible in its operational service creation process. The revenue growth and the relaxation in the procurement market resulted in a slightly lower working capital of €800,131 thousand (prior year: €976,564 thousand) as of 31 December 2023. Bechtle defines working capital as the balance of certain balance sheet items (inventories, trade receivables and accrued income for customer maintenance agreements) on the assets side and certain balance sheet items (trade payables, contract liabilities and deferred income) on the equity and liabilities side.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, respectively, no fundamental changes had been made to the capital management goals, guidelines and procedures.\n\n#### **18** PENSION PROVISIONS\n\nExcept for the pension plans in Switzerland, in France and of Bechtle Managed Services GmbH in Germany, the Bechtle Group has no defined benefit plans. As a matter of principle, these benefit commitments are presented under consideration of country-specific regulations (e.g. local law). The amount of the provision presented in the Annual Report of Bechtle AG represents the value of the pension obligation less the respective plan assets.\n\nThe main obligations from benefits plans exist in Switzerland. They account for 94.4 per cent (prior year: 93.6 per cent) of the group-wide pension obligation and 98.1 per cent (prior year: 97.6 per cent) of the corresponding plan assets.\n\n{218}------------------------------------------------\n\nDefined contribution obligations primarily derive exclusively from the statutory pension obligation. In the reporting period, employer contributions to the statutory pension fund in Germany totalled €44,466 thousand (prior year: €40,788 thousand). In France, the contributions to the statutory pension fund totalled €3,362 thousand (prior year: €3,516 thousand).\n\n**Pension plans Switzerland.** Although the pension plans of Bechtle Holding Schweiz AG and its subsidiaries are contractually agreed as defined contribution plans, they must, however, be accounted for as defined benefit plans pursuant to IAS 19, as a financial participation by the companies in the event of a shortfall in cover cannot be excluded.\n\nSince 1 January 2006, the Bechtle Holding Schweiz AG companies headquartered in Switzerland have made use of the semi-autonomous \"Bechtle Pension Fund\" (\"Bechtle Pensionskasse\") in Rotkreuz, a foundation as defined in Art. 80 ff of the Swiss Civil Code that is independent from the group. The pension fund fulfils the regulations of the Swiss Code of Obligations and of Swiss Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors' and Disability Pensions (OPA). The transparency required for accounting for the pension plans as defined benefit plans, pursuant to IAS 19, has, therefore, existed since then. For this reason, actuarial opinions have been regularly prepared since 1 January 2006. Subsidiaries of Bechtle Holding Schweiz AG that are not headquartered in Switzerland are covered by defined contribution plans of external state pension funds of the respective countries. According to the financing agreement of the pension fund, 40 per cent of the contributions are paid by the employees and 60 per cent by the employer.\n\nAs a result of the acquisitions performed in Switzerland in the 2019 fiscal year, the pension obligations have also been transferred to Bechtle. According to the financing agreement of the joint foundation, 50 per cent of the contributions are paid by the employees and 50 per cent by the employer.\n\nIn the event of a recapitalisation, Bechtle must pay at least 50 per cent of the deficit for both plans. Upon retirement, the insured can choose between a monthly pension whose amount largely depends on the capital paid in plus interest, or a one-time payment of the capital. The minimum interest is prescribed by the government.\n\nDuring the reporting period, actuarial losses of €9,230 thousand accrued. Taking exchange rate differences amounting to plus €137 thousand into consideration, the actuarial gains recognised as retained earnings as of 31 December 2023 amounted to €6,077 thousand (prior year: gain of €15,171 thousand), less deferred tax assets amounting to €1,260 thousand (prior year: €2,494 thousand).\n\n{219}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the reporting period, employer contributions exceeded the net pension expenses to be recognised by €1,559 thousand. This amount was posted to personnel expenses through profit or loss.\n\nAfter factoring in the other exchange rate differences amounting to plus €295 thousand, the total net obligation and thus the pension provisions to be accounted for as of 31 December 2023 amounted to €7,575 thousand.\n\nWith respect to the pension obligation, poor capital market performance and a change in legislation by the government represent potential risks for Bechtle. Moreover, longevity of the insured persons and an imbalance of beneficiaries versus actively insured persons could have a negative financial effect for Bechtle. To minimise these risks, attention is paid to broad diversification of the asset classes. The risk management of the Bechtle pension fund also involves the equal distribution of employee and employer representatives on the foundation board and a separate management.\n\n**Pension plans Germany.** The pension obligations of Bechtle Managed Services GmbH, Neckarsulm, are a result of the takeover of a partial business unit as of 1 October 2005 and, based on an actuarial opinion, were accounted for in the Bechtle Group for the first time as of 31 December 2005. In prior years, further obligations were taken over within the scope of takeovers of partial business operations of IBM. The employer contributions depend on the gross salary of the insured. The employee contributions are voluntary. Commitments have been made with respect to the guaranteed return on the retirement account. The performance depends on the gross annual salary and the service time. In most cases, the retirement plans provide for capital payment in one amount or in eight yearly instalments. Any underfunding must be fully borne by Bechtle alone.\n\nIn 2013, Bechtle decided to take out reinsurance for the obligations. Prior to 2013, the obligations of this defined benefit plan had been processed as direct commitments without the transfer of reserves.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the pension provision went up by €750 thousand to €6,159 thousand. In the course of the reporting period, actuarial gains amounting to €82 thousand accrued; thus, the actuarial gains recognised in retained earnings as of 31 December 2023 amounted to €142 thousand (prior year: gain of €60 thousand) less deferred tax assets amounting to €43 thousand (prior year: €18 thousand).\n\n{220}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the reporting period, net pension expenses to be recognised through profit or loss exceeded the employer contributions paid by €926 thousand. Accordingly, this amount was recognised as an increase of personnel expenses through profit or loss.\n\nPoor performance on the capital markets could have a negative effect on Bechtle with respect to these pension commitments. If the reinsurance failed to generate the surplus in the amount of the assured yield on the market, Bechtle would incur additional financial expenses. Bechtle endeavours to fulfil its commitments or settle them ahead of time, provided that the employee agrees. New commitments will not be made.\n\n**Pension plans France.** The legislator in France determines a minimum compensation that depends on the employee's seniority and compensation upon retirement due to old age. Moreover, requirements of the respective collective labour agreement may be applicable. The amount of the compensation mainly depends on the employee's seniority. An entitlement accrues from a seniority of ten years.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the pension provision amounted to €3,547 thousand (prior year: €2,518 thousand). In the course of the reporting period, actuarial losses amounted to €780 thousand (prior year: gain of €1,417 thousand). As of 31 December 2023, the actuarial gains recognised in retained earnings thus amounted to €1,737 thousand (prior year: €2,517 thousand), less deferred assets amounting to €825 thousand (prior year: €1,014 thousand).\n\nIn the reporting period, net pension expenses to be recognised through profit or loss exceeded the employer contributions paid by €249 thousand. This amount was posted to personnel expenses through profit or loss.\n\nPoor performance on the capital markets could have a negative effect on Bechtle with respect to these pension commitments. If the reinsurance failed to generate the surplus in the amount of the assured yield on the market, Bechtle would incur additional financial expenses. Bechtle endeavours to fulfil its commitments or settle them ahead of time, provided that the employee agrees. New commitments will not be made.\n\n**Net obligation for the group.** In total, the pension obligations that were recognised as pension provision in the consolidated balance sheet as of 31 December 2023 amounted to €17,282 thousand (prior year: €7,927 thousand).\n\n{221}------------------------------------------------\n\n€k\n\n|

FURTHER EXPLANATORY NOTES ON THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT**\n\nThe cash flow statement for the 2023 reporting period and the prior year was prepared in accordance with IAS 7 and reports the development of cash flows broken down by cash inflows and outflows from operating, investing and financing activities. The cash flow from operating activities is determined using the indirect method.\n\nAs in the prior year, cash and cash equivalents included cash on hand, cheques and bank balances with an original term to maturity of no more than three months and correspond to the balance sheet item \"cash and cash equivalents\". Effects from the currency translation of cash and cash equivalents are shown separately in the calculation.\n\n#### **2 5** CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES\n\nThe cash flow from operating activities in the amount of €459,031 thousand (prior year: €116,651 thousand) was indirectly derived from the earnings before taxes. The indirect calculation takes into account the financial earnings, depreciation and amortisation and other non-cash expenses and income as well as the change in selected material balance sheet items and other net assets.\n\nAs in the prior year, other non-cash expenses and income include changes in provisions and impairments.\n\nThe changes in balance sheet items are adjusted for assets and liabilities taken over from acquisitions and for influences from currency translation.\n\n#### **2 6** CASH FLOW FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES\n\nIn 2023, net cash used for investments in the amount of €282,553 thousand (prior year: €224,323 thousand) primarily consisted of payments for investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment as well as for the acquisition of companies.

loss\n\n{231}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-231-0\"></span>Pursuant to IFRS 13, the material parameters on which the measurement is based must be disclosed for all financial instruments whose fair value is presented or that are accounted for at fair value. The assessment methods are divided into the following three levels:\n\nLevel 1: Measurement at prices (not adjusted) quoted on active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2: Measurement of the asset or liability takes place either directly or indirectly on the basis of observable input data, which do not represent quoted prices as stated in Level 1.\n\nLevel 3: Measurement is based on models using input parameters not observable on the market.\n\nThe cash flows of the **financial derivatives** accounted for as hedges will occur within a period of two months of the balance sheet date.\n\n**Convertible bond.** In the reporting period, an unsecured and non-subordinated bond of a total nominal value of €300 million with conversion rights was placed in new and/or existing no-par shares of Bechtle AG. The convertible bonds with a denomination of €100 thousand each are issued and repaid at 100 per cent of the nominal amount. The term to maturity is seven years. The initial conversion price of €54.99 was determined with a conversion premium of 30 per cent over the reference share price of €42.30. The convertible bonds are subject to a nominal interest rate of 2.0 per cent. Termination of the outstanding convertible bonds by Bechtle is possible after five years, at the earliest, if the share price has not reached 130 per cent of the applicable conversion price. Termination of the outstanding convertible bonds by Bechtle is possible at any time if the total nominal amount of the convertible bonds has dropped to 20 per cent or less of the total nominal amount originally issued. Holders of the convertible bonds have the right to demand premature repayment of their convertible bonds at the nominal amount after five years. The accounting took place using the effective interest method.\n\n**The liabilities resulting from acquisitions** are conditional, additional purchase price payments (earn-outs) for acquisitions (IFRS 3.58). The fair value was determined with the help of the DCF method. Apart from the planned business development of the unit taken over, a discount rate that is appropriate for the period was used. The creditworthiness of the debtor Bechtle (IFRS 13.42 ff) was taken into account via an overhead percentage method taking into account the amount, the probability of default and the recovery rate in the event of inability to pay. The difference between the fair value and the amount to be paid at maturity according to the contract is €4 thousand, which only contains an insignificant change of the credit risk. The factor that has the greatest impact on the fair value is the planned business development, which is based on earnings-oriented key indicators. In the event of a reduction of the target achievement to 90 per cent of the target achievement assumed at the acquisition, the liabilities from acquisitions would drop by about 100 per cent; in the event of an increase to 110 per cent of the target achievement assumed at the acquisition, the liabilities would not increase. In the event of a payout, the liabilities will be repaid by the end of 2024.\n\n{232}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe fair value of **time deposits, loans** and **non-current trade receivables** and **non-current trade payables** corresponds to the present value of the cash flows under consideration of the riskweighted interest rates appropriate for the periods plus creditworthiness impairment. The fair value of time deposits, loans and non-current trade receivables and non-current trade payables corresponds to the present value of the cash flows under consideration of the risk-weighted interest rates appropriate for the periods plus creditworthiness impairment. In the event of an increase (reduction) of the discount for the credit risk of the counterparty by 5 per cent, the fair value of the non-current trade receivables would be €23 thousand lower (€23 thousand higher), and the non-current lease receivables would be €66 thousand lower (€66 thousand higher). In the event of an increase (reduction) of the discount for the own credit risk by 5 per cent, the fair value of the non-current lease liabilities would be €5 thousand lower (€5 thousand higher), and the fair value of the loans would be €24 thousand lower (€24 thousand higher).\n\nFor all current financial assets and liabilities, the carrying amount corresponds to the fair value (IFRS 7.29). This comprises **current trade receivables, other financial assets, current trade payables, cash and cash equivalents, time deposits** and **other financial liabilities.** \n\nDuring the reporting period, there were no reclassifications between measurements at fair value of Level 1 and Level 2 and no reclassifications to or from measurements at fair value of Level 3.\n\nThe development of the financial instruments in Level 3 as measured at fair value is as follows:\n\n|                                                |            | Total gains and losses                 |

The trade payables contain receivables from suppliers in the amount of €9,907 thousand, and the receivables from suppliers contain liabilities in the amount of €11,395 thousand. Based on contractual agreements, these customers of Bechtle are entitled to net these items against each other. These items are principally bonus revenues that suppliers pay out to Bechtle and that Bechtle pays out to its customers.\n\n{234}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-234-0\"></span>DISCLOSURES ON RISK MANAGEMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n**Currency risk.** Receivables, liabilities and cash and cash equivalents that are not transacted in the functional (local) currency used by the companies are exposed to currency risks from financial instruments. In the Bechtle Group, currency risks from financial instruments denominated in foreign currency arise from the intercompany trade and, to a small extent, trade with external suppliers and customers.\n\nHedges serve to protect against exchange rate risks affecting receivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currency. The Bechtle Group uses forward exchange contracts, currency swaps and currency options as hedges.\n\nIn the Consolidated Financial Statements (EUR), exchange differences arose from the conversion of foreign currency financial statements of subsidiaries abroad. These differences are carried and recognised separately directly in equity. In the reporting period, Bechtle made use of the following currency futures in order to compensate most of these currency translation differences outside profit or loss and to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation (IAS 39, IFRIC 16):\n\n|                          | 2023                                       |                                           |                      | 2022                    |                                            |                                           |                      |                         |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Currency<br>relationship | Nominal<br>amount<br>hedging<br>instrument | Hedge<br>gain/loss<br>(entered<br>in OCI) | Income<br>tax effect | Average<br>hedging rate | Nominal<br>amount<br>hedging<br>instrument | Hedge<br>gain/loss<br>(entered<br>in OCI) | Income<br>tax effect | Average<br>hedging rate |\n| EUR/CHF                  | 277,960                                    | -8,618                                    | -2,633               | 0.97                    | 413,338                                    | -19,437                                   | -5,867               | 1.03                    |\n| EUR/GBP                  | 97,713                                     | -1,527                                    | -467                 | 0.88                    | 18,688                                     | 699                                       | 211                  | 0.85                    |\n| EUR/PLN                  | 4,076                                      | -534                                      | -163                 | 4.91                    | 3,595                                      | -135                                      | -41                  | 4.87                    |\n| EUR/HUF                  | 779                                        | -135                                      | -41                  | 449.03                  | 962                                        | 32                                        | 10                   | 391.34                  |\n| EUR/CZK                  | 442                                        | -7                                        | -2                   | 24.90                   | 503                                        | -36                                       | -11                  | 25.91                   |\n\nOn the other hand, the consolidated equity underwent a positive effect in the amount of €10,342 thousand (prior year: €11,312 thousand) from currency translation differences. These were largely caused by EUR/CHF conversion.\n\nAlongside the above-mentioned hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, Bechtle made use of other hedges to hedge its business operations. The loss of €248 thousand (prior year: gain of €59 thousand) that corresponds to the effective part of the currency hedges (cash flow hedge) was recognised in other comprehensive income outside profit or loss, taking into account deferred taxes (€76 thousand; prior year: €18 thousand). For this, an average EUR/USD rate of 1.09 was hedged (prior year: 1.07).\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-235-0\"></span>Apart from the said individual cases that are accounted for as hedges, hedges with terms of up to two years and individual volumes of up to €2 million, in most cases, are regularly concluded for operational purposes within the ordinary course of business.

The changes in the fair values of the financial assets and liabilities in foreign currency recognised as of the respective balance sheet date due to the changed exchange rate are taken into account. The hedges existing as of the balance sheet date are taken into consideration in the sensitivity analysis. Exchange rate differences from the translation of financial statements into the group's currency are not taken into account.\n\n{236}------------------------------------------------\n\n€k\n\n€k\n\n<span id=\"page-236-0\"></span>\n\n|                                                               | 2023   |          | 2022    |           |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|---------|-----------|\n| Effects of a 10% value loss (or increase) of the euro against |        |          |         |           |\n| USD                                                           | +6,266 | (-6,266) | +14,155 | (-14,155) |\n| CHF                                                           | -4,693 | (+4,693) | -3,111  | (+3,111)  |\n| SEK                                                           | +2,143 | (-2,143) | +1,592  | (-1,592)  |\n| NOK                                                           | +1,140 | (-1,140) | +175    | (-175)    |\n| CZK                                                           | -183   | (+183)   | -66     | (+66)     |\n| GBP                                                           | +160   | (-160)   | +219    | (-219)    |\n| HUF                                                           | -65    | (+65)    | -67     | (+67)     |\n| PLN                                                           | +24    | (-24)    | -294    | (+294)    |\n| TWD                                                           | +17    | (-17)    | +10     | (-10)     |\n| CAD                                                           | +1     | (-1)     | 0       | 0         |\n\nThe following sensitivity analysis illustrates the impact a decrease (or increase) in the euro exchange rate could have on other comprehensive income (outside profit or loss).

The interest rate risks of the Bechtle Group are centrally analysed, and the resulting measures are actively managed by the central finance department. The approach to this area is subject to regular review as determined by the management.\n\nApart from this, the group has only a minimal position – and thus an insignificant interest rate risk – in variable-rate financial instruments, which are exposed to cash flow risks from a possible deterioration in interest rates. There is also an insignificant interest rate risk for fixed-interest financial instruments with fair value risk due to the fluctuating fair values of non-current receivables and trade liabilities depending on interest rates.\n\n{237}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe sensitivity analysis was conducted for the Bechtle Group's cash and cash equivalents, and time deposits as of the balance sheet date, taking into account the relevant interest rates in the relevant currencies. A hypothetical decrease or increase in these interest rates from the beginning of the reporting period by 100 basis points or 1.0 per cent a year (assuming constant exchange rates) would have led to a decrease/increase in interest income by €4,658 thousand (prior year: €2,896 thousand).\n\n**Liquidity risk.** The liquidity risk from financial instruments results from future interest payments and redemption payments for financial liabilities and from derivative financial instruments. The tables below show the non-discounted payment obligations for the relevant balance sheet items as of the balance sheet date and the prior year's balance sheet date in accordance with IFRS 7. Bechtle has credit lines that can be used both for cash loans and for guarantee credit. Detailed information on this is presented in (20) Financial liabilities.\n\n€k\n\nLiquidity risk is managed and monitored weekly with the help of a 14-day liquidity preview.\n\n[For disclosures

In the case of bank deposits in the European Union, we make sure that the balance at a bank or group of banks with the [For further disclosures](#page-141-0) same deposit guarantee does not exceed the respective deposit guarantee cap. Approximately 38 per cent of the cash and cash equivalents are held with banks that belong to the liability association of the Savings Banks Finance Group. Thus, a risk could arise from the default of several banks belonging to this guarantee arrangement. The Swiss group companies hold about 30 per cent of the group's cash and cash equivalents at large Swiss banks, which only offer a low statutory deposit guarantee.\n\n**Credit Risk.** The carrying amounts of the financial assets correspond to the maximum credit risk. There are no hedges except for common liens for all trade receivables as well as country-specific deposit guarantee funds for all cash and cash equivalents and time deposits. Any credit risks identified in the financial assets are recognised in the form of impairments. Except for lenders in connection with buildings, Bechtle provides virtually none of its creditors with collateral.\n\nImage /page/238/Picture/4 description: The image shows a book icon above the text \"For further disclosures on the risk management, see page 142 f\".\n\n{239}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-239-0\"></span>With regard to the investment of excess liquidity, quick availability is more important than maximum yield, e.g. in order to be able to access available cash and cash equivalents in the event of acquisitions or major project pre-financing measures. Thus, purely financial goals – such as the optimisation of the financial income – are subordinate to the acquisition strategy and the company growth. This financial flexibility forms the basis for success in a highly consolidating market. The liquidity situation is centrally managed and monitored by the treasury.\n\nInvestment business was only conducted with investment-grade debtors. For time deposits within the European Union, investments with a deposit guarantee are preferred. As such a guarantee only exists to a limited extent in Switzerland, investments in this country are only made at banks with an excellent credit rating.\n\nTo avoid risk concentrations, customer-specific credit lines are determined by means of ongoing creditworthiness checks.\n\n### **VII. SEGMENT INFORMATION**\n\nSegment information is reported in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, as in the prior year.\n\nThe Bechtle Group is currently active in two business segments, the IT System House & Managed Services segment and the IT E-Commerce segment. The two segments differ in terms of the areas of activity involved as well as with regard to the processes applied for IT product trading purposes. The strategic alignment and expansion strategy pursued are also different.\n\nIn the **IT System House & Managed Services** segment, Bechtle's services cover the entire IT value chain ranging from IT strategy consulting services, hardware and software, project planning and implementation, system integration, IT services and training to complete IT operation. Bechtle prepares individual offers involving a range of different services in combination with hardware and software directly reflecting the needs and preferences of each and every customer. In this segment, Bechtle operates in Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and, since recently, in France, ensuring special customer proximity by means of its decentralised organisation with more than 100 locations for wide geographic coverage.\n\n{240}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe **IT E-Commerce** segment comprises the group's online shop and telesales trading activities. As an IT specialist with more than 36,000 products in the web shop – ranging from hardware and standard software products to peripherals and accessories – Bechtle covers all common IT areas. The Bechtle direct brand is currently established in 14 European countries and focuses on classic hardware and software from market-leading vendors. The Bechtle Comsoft and Inmac WStore brands are active in France only. In the Netherlands, Bechtle is also active with the ARP brand. The software licensing business of the Bechtle Comsoft brand is present in two European countries.\n\nCompanies of the Bechtle Group mainly exist in Germany. Group companies exist abroad in Argentina, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, UK and the USA.\n\nThe administration and the strategic management of the individual companies are centralised primarily at Gaildorf and Neckarsulm, where the parent company Bechtle AG and the group's Executive Board are based.\n\nAs a general rule, the same reporting methods and accounting policies are applied for the segment information as for the Consolidated Financial Statements. Internally, no transition to the changed principal versus agent (PvA) accounting is performed. Rather, the management takes place on the basis of the business volume (gross revenue). A combination of the business segments has not been drawn up.\n\nThe chief operating decision-maker (CODM) as defined in IFRS 8.7 is the Executive Board of Bechtle AG, which comprises the Chairman of the Executive Board, the Member of the Executive Board responsible for IT System House & Managed Services and the Member of the Executive Board responsible for IT E-Commerce. This CODM is responsible for the cross-departmental, group-wide monitoring and management of the group success and resource allocation. Strategic decisions concerning the allocation of resources to the two segments and the measurement of their earning power are made exclusively at Executive Board meetings of Bechtle AG in close coordination with the Supervisory Board. The Executive Board member responsible for IT System House & Managed Services and the Executive Board member responsible for IT E-Commerce serve individually as the segment managers (IFRS 8.9) for the respective business segment. In this capacity, they are in charge of the resource management and the assessment of the efficiency of the segments under their supervision. The segment manager also coaches the Executive Vice Presidents and Managing Directors in his segment. Vis-à-vis the CODM, the segment managers are responsible for their segments and maintain regular contact with the CODM, e.g. at Executive Board meetings, in order to report on and discuss the activities, results and plans of their segment.\n\n{241}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe segment information presented below is based on the same indicators as those employed for the internal reporting and controlling system that are used above all by the group management/CODM for success evaluation and resource allocation purposes. As previously, management is based on business volume. It contains all income and expenses as well as the assets and liabilities of the central units/functions of the Bechtle Group in accordance with the relevant services provided or used in the two IT System House & Managed Services and IT E-Commerce segments. The earnings before interest and taxes and before acquisition-related depreciation and amortisation represent the earnings-related key performance indicator for the segments. The depreciation and amortisation from acquisitions relate to customer bases, customer service agreements and brands resulting within the scope of acquisitions. Financial earnings are not consolidated as the segments are primarily funded via the central units where external interest expense and income are mainly incurred. For this reason, financial earnings and expenses are reported together as financial income merely at group level as shown below. This results in the earnings before taxes in the Bechtle Group and subsequently, taking into account the taxes at group level, the earnings after taxes in the Bechtle Group.\n\nThis results in asymmetric allocation (IFRS 8.27) insofar as the assets and liabilities reported for the segments include interest-bearing assets and liabilities as well as tax receivables and payables. In the case of symmetric allocation, segment assets and segment liabilities would be correspondingly lower and the earnings-related key performance indicator of the segments would include financial income, financial expenses and tax.\n\nTransactions are only conducted between the two segments to an insignificant extent. They are accounted for at market prices and, for the purposes of completeness and transparency, are shown below explicitly in respect of the business volume as well as receivables and payables. The consolidated revenue comprises the total revenue of both segments with parties outside the group. The same applies to the receivables and payables as well as the assets and liabilities of the two segments and of the Bechtle Group as a whole.\n\nThe investments, depreciation and amortisation reported relate to intangible assets as well as to property, plant and equipment.\n\nImage /page/241/Picture/5 description: This image contains text that reads: \"For disclosures on the composition of the revenue, see page 199 f\".\n\nIn the segment reporting by region (domestic or abroad), revenue is allocated to the country in which the subsidiary concerned has its registered office. From the perspective of the given subsidiary, revenue is generated exclusively in its own country. Only revenue via parties external to the group is reported. Accordingly, assets, liabilities and investments are allocated to the domestic market (Germany) or abroad on the basis of the location of the given company's registered office.\n\n{242}------------------------------------------------\n\n€k\n\n<span id=\"page-242-0\"></span>\n\n|                                                    | 2023

internal management does not take place on the basis of the changed PvP accounting, but rather continues to focus on the business volume (gross revenue). For this reason, a reconciliation with the external revenue is necessary for the presentation of the group as a whole. Depreciation and amortisation concern the ongoing depreciation and amortisation of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.\n\nNo unscheduled depreciation or amortisation was carried out in the two segments beyond the scheduled depreciation and amortisation.\n\n|                                                  |                                             |                  |           |                                             |                  | €k        |  |  |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------|--|--|\n|                                                  |                                             | 2023             |           |                                             |                  | 2022      |  |  |\n| By segments                                      | IT System<br>House &<br>Managed<br>Services | IT<br>E-Commerce | Group     | IT System<br>House &<br>Managed<br>Services | IT<br>E-Commerce | Group     |  |  |\n| Total segment assets                             | 2,504,475                                   | 1,306,577        |           | 2,388,251                                   | 1,070,055        |           |  |  |\n| less intersegment receivables                    | −7,186                                      | −677             |           | −9,344                                      | −1,090           |           |  |  |\n| Assets                                           | 2,497,289                                   | 1,305,900        | 3,803,189 | 2,378,907                                   | 1,068,965        | 3,447,872 |  |  |\n| Thereof shares in investments measured at equity | 32,497                                      | 0                | 32,497    | 0                                           | 0                | 0         |  |  |\n| Total segment liabilities                        | 1,437,051                                   | 631,389          |           | 1,351,081                                   | 568,906          |           |  |  |\n| less intersegment liabilities                    | −677                                        | −7,186           |           | −1,090                                      | −9,344           |           |  |  |\n| Liabilities                                      | 1,436,374                                   | 624,203          | 2,060,577 | 1,349,991                                   | 559,562          | 1,909,552 |  |  |\n|                                                  |                                             |                  |           |                                             |                  |           |  |  |\n\n{243}------------------------------------------------\n\n€k\n\n|  | By regions                       |  | 2023      |           |           | 2022      |           |           |\n|--|----------------------------------|--|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|  |                                  |  | Domestic  | Abroad    | Group     | Domestic  | Abroad    | Group     |\n|  | Revenue                          |  | 3,996,199 | 2,426,544 | 6,422,743 | 3,731,733 | 2,296,442 | 6,028,175 |\n|  | Investments                      |  | 164,509   | 35,323    | 199,832   | 94,138    | 49,230    | 143,368   |\n|  | Investments through acquisitions |  | 1,687     | 207,404   | 209,091   | 1,648     | 95,507    | 97,155    |\n\nOf the consolidated revenue generated abroad, France accounted for €690,754 thousand (prior year: €718,245 thousand), Switzerland for €378,755 thousand (prior year: €390,557 thousand) and the Netherlands for €558,117 thousand (prior year: €477,639 thousand).

Founded in 1997, the company enjoys an excellent reputation and is well known in the industry. Its core business comprises hardware procurement including plug-and-play services and software licensing. Security and network services as well as lifecycle management supplement the product portfolio. Together with Bechtle direct UK, major vendor partners will benefit from an even stronger interface to customers in the British B2B market.\n\nApart from the assets and liabilities already recognised by the acquired companies, whose carrying amounts corresponded to their fair value, customer relationships (€11,542 thousand) were newly recognised as identifiable assets with a useful life of five years and measured at fair value as of the acquisition date.

components of the consideration for Tangible Benefit Ltd. (€4,209 thousand), the consideration paid for the companies acquired in 2023 (€220,593 thousand) resulted in an outflow of cash and cash equivalents of €186,941 thousand.\n\nIn the course of the acquisitions, transaction costs amounting to €2,090 thousand were incurred and recognised in administrative expenses.\n\n{249}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-249-0\"></span>Since their acquisition, the companies have contributed a total of €102,431 thousand to the revenue (thereof Tangible Benefit Ltd. €51,506 thousand, Fondo ICT Professionals B.V. €15,515 thousand, SGSolution AG €2,822 thousand, Prosol Ingenieria S.L. €2,413 thousand, Prosol Iscat S.L. €722 thousand, sastema GmbH €756 thousand, Executive IT SAS Group €28,697 thousand) and €4,891 thousand to the earnings after taxes (thereof Tangible Benefit Ltd. €2,398 thousand, Fondo ICT Professionals B.V. €974 thousand, SGSolution AG €261 thousand, Prosol Ingenieria S.L. minus €82 thousand, Prosol Iscat S.L. €141 thousand, sastema GmbH minus €1 thousand, Executive IT SAS Group €1,200 thousand). Had the companies been acquired at the beginning of the reporting period, the revenue of the Bechtle Group for the reporting period would have amounted to €6,535,528 thousand (thereof Tangible Benefit Ltd. €68,986 thousand, Fondo ICT Professionals B.V. €27,329 thousand, SGSolution AG €3,330 thousand, Prosol Ingenieria S.L. €8,404 thousand, Prosol Iscat S.L. €2,083 thousand, sastema GmbH €1,864 thousand, Executive IT SAS Group €103,220 thousand).\n\n**Acquisition after the reporting date.** As of 22 February 2024, Bechtle acquired the Apple reseller iDoo Tech S.L., headquartered in Saragossa. iDoo Tech mainly focuses on the B2B sale of Apple products along with consulting, training and support. The plan is to handle Bechtle's entire Apple business in Spain via iDoo Tech. The objective is to gain Apple Authorised Enterprise Reseller status in order to be able to offer an even more extensive service and solution portfolio in the field of IT E-Commerce apart from the sale of products to business customers. The company has 13 employees. The consideration associated with the acquisition amounted to €2,488 thousand and resulted in an outflow of cash and cash equivalents in the amount of €448 thousand. The purchase agreement provides for conditional purchase price payments amounting to €2,040 thousand.\n\n### **IX.

The total remuneration paid to former members of the Supervisory Board amounted to €24 thousand (prior year: €0 thousand).\n\nAll disclosures concerning the Supervisory Board that are required due to statutory regulations are summarised in Appendix D to these Notes.\n\n### **X. OTHER DISCLOSURES**\n\n#### BECHTLE AS LESSEE\n\nAs a lessee, Bechtle accounts for leases for the following agreement types:\n\n- � Buildings\n- � Motor vehicles\n- � Job bicycles (head lease & sublease)\n- � Furniture, fixtures and fittings\n- � Office equipment\n- � Customer equipment (head lease & sublease)\n\nFor the agreement types buildings, motor vehicles, office machines and furniture, fixtures and fittings, right-of-use assets are accounted for and amortised over the individual useful life. The normal period for buildings ranges from three to ten years. Motor vehicle leasing agreements have a general term of two to three years. The agreement periods for furniture, fixtures and fittings are one to five years.\n\n{252}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the agreement types job bicycles and customer equipment, Bechtle acts both as lessee and as lessor in the context of finance leases. For this, no right-of-use assets are capitalised, but a lease receivable is recognised against the business partner. The lease receivable is measured on the basis of the present value of the lease payments and is repaid over the term. The following figure shows the right-of-use assets accounted for, which are allocated to the individual assets:\n\n|                                                                     |            | €          |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Assets with assigned rights of use in property, plant and equipment | 31.12.2023 | 31.12.2022 |\n| Buildings                                                           | 137,838    | 108,070    |\n| Furniture, fixtures and fittings                                    | 364        | 263        |\n| Vehicle fleet                                                       | 40,778     | 30,592     |\n\nThe amortisation amounts for the right-of-use assets that are attributable to the reporting period are presented in the following table:\n\n|                                     | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Amortisation of right-of-use assets |        | €      |\n| Buildings                           | 33,428 | 28,552 |\n| Furniture, fixtures and fittings    | 222    | 181    |\n| Vehicle fleet                       | 23,438 | 19,245 |\n\nWith regard to buildings, Bechtle mainly rents offices, storage space and parking places. Motor vehicle leases are concluded especially for the sales department.\n\nExtension and cancellation options were taken into consideration upon recognition and measurement of the lease liabilities if Bechtle was reasonably certain that these options would be exercised in the future. Thus, the depreciation takes place over the contractually agreed lease term or, if Bechtle exercises its lease extension option, over the contractually agreed lease term plus the period of the lease extension option. Lease liabilities in the amount of €57,190 thousand (prior year: €51,424 thousand) were recognised under other current liabilities and €136,336 thousand (prior year: €98,451 thousand) under other non-current liabilities.\n\nIn 2023, expenses for short-term and minor leases amounted to €949 thousand (prior year: €1,190 thousand). Renewal and termination options result in potential cash outflows of €68,721 thousand (prior year: €41,499 thousand).\n\n{253}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### <span id=\"page-253-0\"></span>BECHTLE AS LESSOR\n\n**Operating leases.** In connection with operating leases, Bechtle also acts as lessor. Most of the agreements concerned relate to the leasing of IT products. Generally, the leasing agreements are concluded for terms of three to five years. The respective minimum lease payments from these agreements are as follows:\n\n| €                      |        |        |  |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|--|\n|                        | 2023   | 2022   |  |\n| Due within one year    | 7,881  | 5,210  |  |\n| Due in 1 to 2 years    | 6,061  | 4,267  |  |\n| Due in 2 to 3 years    | 4,552  | 1,204  |  |\n| Due in 3 to 4 years    | 3,068  | 570    |  |\n| Due in 4 to 5 years    | 1,219  | 242    |  |\n| Minimum lease payments | 22,781 | 11,493 |  |\n\nIn the year under review, leasing income from operating leases amounted to €7,173 thousand (prior year: €4,840 thousand).\n\n**Finance leases.** In connection with finance leases, Bechtle also acts as lessor. Bechtle Financial Services AG operates as a group-internal sales financing provider for the end-customer business of the system houses. It offers rent and leasing models for direct leasing and refinancing of the system houses as well as hire purchases. The refinancing of the financing transactions takes place in the form of forfeiting (non-recourse factoring) via various external refinancing partners. For agreements newly concluded in the 2023 fiscal year, non-guaranteed residual values exist in the amount of €696 thousand (prior year: €2,925 thousand).\n\nAs of the closing date, the trade receivables contained leasing receivables amounting to €84,197 thousand (prior year: €77,021 thousand).

STATEMENTS AND OF THE COMBINED MANAGEMENT REPORT\n\n**Audit opinions.** We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Bechtle Aktiengesellschaft, Neckarsulm, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which consist of the consolidated balance sheet as of 31 December 2023, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated cash flow statement for the fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, as well as notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of key accounting methods. In addition, we have audited the Group management report of Bechtle Aktiengesellschaft, Neckarsulm, for the fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, which is combined with the management report of the parent company. In accordance with the German statutory regulations, we did not audit the content of the summarised corporate governance statement referred to in the \"Corporate governance\" section of the combined management report, the summarised non-financial statement included in the combined management report, the \"Corporate governance\" and \"Effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system\" sections of the combined management report, cross-references in the combined management report to websites of the company and the information referred to by those cross-references.\n\nAccording to our assessment based on the findings gained in our audit,\n\n- � the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB (German Commercial Code) and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as of 31 December 2023 and of its financial performance for the fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and\n- � the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides a suitable view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the combined management report does not cover the content of the statements referred to above, the sections \"Corporate governance\" and \"Effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system\" of the combined management report, the cross-references referred to above or the information to which the cross-references relate.\n\nPursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report.\n\n{270}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Basis for the audit opinions.** We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") and under consideration of the accepted German accounting principles as set forth by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer, IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) Lit. f of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\n**Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements.** Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional discretionary judgement, were of the greatest significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nBelow, we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters:\n\n- 1. Impairment of goodwill\n- 2. Recognition of revenue\n\nWe have structured our presentation of these key audit matters as follows:\n\n- a) Description of the situation (including reference to the respective disclosures in the consolidated financial statements)\n- b) Audit procedure\n\n#### 1 . IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL\n\na) In the consolidated financial statements of Bechtle Aktiengesellschaft as of 31 December 2023, the balance sheet item \"Goodwill\" discloses EUR 732.3 million, which corresponds to 19.3 per cent of the consolidated balance sheet total.\n\nThe legal representatives of Bechtle Aktiengesellschaft subject the capitalised goodwill to impairment tests at least once a year or whenever necessary. The company has identified the reportable segments IT System House & Managed Services as well as IT E-Commerce as cash-generating units. The recoverable amount is determined on the basis of the value in use, using a discounted cash flow model. This is based on the present values of the expected future cash flows, which are based on the medium-term planning prepared by the legal representatives and extrapolated using assumptions about long-term growth rates. The discounting takes place via the weighted capital costs of the respective cash-generating unit.\n\n{271}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe result of this measurement greatly depends on the assessment of future cash inflows of the respective cash-generating unit by the legal representatives and the applied discount rate, the long-term growth rates used and thus involves uncertainties. Against this backdrop and due to the complexity of the applied measurement model, this matter was of special importance in the context of our audit.\n\nThe disclosures of the legal representatives concerning the impairment testing of the goodwill are presented in the sections \"II. Summary of Key Principles of Accounting and Consolidations\" and \"IV. Further Explanatory Notes on the Balance Sheet – (8) Goodwill\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nb) Within the scope of our audit, we reviewed the procedure of the company's legal representatives in conducting the impairment tests with the involvement of our internal measurement specialists as well as the determination of the weighted capital costs. On this basis, we evaluated the entire measurement model, especially its methodological and mathematical accuracy. Moreover, we evaluated to what extent the measurement can be influenced by subjectivity, complexity or other inherent risk factors, and we evaluated the methods, assumptions and data used.\n\nWe were convinced of the appropriateness of the future cash flows used in the measurement, among other things, in the course of our recording and critical assessment of the planning process. To evaluate the quality and reliability of the medium-term planning, we compared the planning of selected fiscal years with the earnings actually achieved and analysed individual material deviations (planning reliability).\n\nWe checked whether the planning on which the impairment tests were based was consistent with the medium-term planning approved by the legal representatives and whether the data derived from this were correctly transferred to the measurement model used. In addition, we asked the legal representatives or persons appointed by them about the material assumptions of the medium-term planning and checked their plausibility, taking into account external macroeconomic and sector-specific market expectations.\n\nBecause a significant portion of the respective value in use results from forecast cash flows for the period after the medium-term planning period, we critically assessed the sustainable growth rate recognised for this phase in particular on the basis of general and industry-specific market expectations. Furthermore, we validated the parameters used to determine the WACC rate used for discounting, questioned the appropriateness of the peer group and compared the market data used with external evidence.\n\nFurthermore, we audited the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as required by IAS 36.\n\n{272}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 2 . RECOGNITION OF REVENUE\n\na) In the consolidated financial statements of Bechtle Aktiengesellschaft as of 31 December 2023, revenue of EUR 6,422.7 million is reported in the income statement.\n\nThe portfolio of Bechtle Aktiengesellschaft includes customer consulting services regarding the design of the IT infrastructure, the supply of the necessary hardware and software, related installation and integration services and handling of the complete operation of the customer's IT (managed services). The performance obligations are partially based on complex contractual arrangements with regard to the sale of IT products and the performance of further installation and integration services.\n\nIn the context of the accounting for the revenue, the legal representatives need to classify the performance obligations by assessing whether the performance obligations consist of delivering the goods or services as a principal or of arranging for the delivery or service by another party as an agent.\n\nThe classification of the performance obligation and the assessment of whether revenue is to be recognised as of a point in time or over time requires significant discretionary judgement on the part of the legal representatives with regard to the application of the relevant criteria of IFRS 15 and against the backdrop of the findings of the agenda decision of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC), which is why the recognition of revenue was classified as a particularly important audit matter. The disclosures of the legal representatives concerning the revenue are presented in the sections \"II. Summary of Key Principles of Accounting and Consolidations\" and \"III. Further Explanatory Notes on the Income Statement – (1) \"Revenue\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nb) We differentiated the revenue of Bechtle Aktiengesellschaft by their type (sale of hardware and software, performance of services) and their associated internal processes. On this basis, we first obtained an understanding of the design of the respective internal processes and controls for revenue recognition, including the accounting controls for the identification of performance obligations and the determination of individual sales prices. For this, we traced the respective process flow and performed analytical audit actions. Based on the process understanding we gained, we evaluated the design and setup of identified internal controls with a view to the revenue recognition. Where we wanted to rely on the effectiveness of identified controls, we additionally subjected them to a functional check. Moreover, we evaluated whether and to what extent the revenue recognition was influenced by subjectivity, complexity or other inherent risk factors, and we evaluated the methods, assumptions and data used.\n\n{273}------------------------------------------------\n\nWith regard to the revenue, we also audited individual cases with respect to statements made. We verified the revenue recognition at a point in time or over time on the basis of samples via value-weighted random selection. We also took the company's procedure for the classification of the performance as principle or agent on the basis of the criteria of IFRS 15 and the insights of the agenda decision of the IFRS IC into consideration in order to check whether the accounting policies have been complied with. In this context, we examined the contractual arrangements to check whether Bechtle Aktiengesellschaft acts as principal or agent and whether the resulting revenue has been recognised in the full amount (Bechtle as principal) or in the amount of the gross margin (Bechtle as agent).\n\nFinally, we audited the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as required by IFRS 15.\n\n#### O T H E R I N F O R M AT I O N\n\nThe legal representatives and/or the Supervisory Board are responsible for the other information.

In all other respects, the legal representatives are responsible for the other information.\n\nOur audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of audit conclusion regarding this information.\n\n{274}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information\n\n� demonstrates material inconsistencies with the consolidated financial statements, with the audited content of the combined management report or our knowledge obtained during the audit, or\n\n� otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\n### R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y O F T H E L E G A L R E P R E S E N TAT I V E S A N D T H E S U P E R V I S O R Y B O A R D F O R T H E C O N S O L I D AT E D F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S A N D T H E C O M B I N E D M A N A G E M E N T R E P O R T\n\nThe legal representatives are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with the IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German law pursuant to Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB), and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and earnings position of the group. In addition, the legal representatives are responsible for such internal controls as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e. manipulation of the accounting or damage to assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the legal representatives are responsible for assessing the group's going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to the going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting, unless there is an intention to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative to do so.\n\nIn addition, the legal representatives are responsible for the preparation of the combined management report, which as a whole provides an appropriate view of the group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Furthermore, the legal representatives are responsible for the precautions and measures (systems) that they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a combined management report in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the combined management report.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report.\n\n{275}------------------------------------------------\n\n### A U D I T O R ' S R E S P O N S I B I L I T I E S F O R T H E A U D I T O F T H E C O N S O L I D AT E D F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S A N D O F T H E C O M B I N E D M A N A G E M E N T R E P O R T\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee, that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or as a whole, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users made on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and combined management report.\n\nWe exercise professional discretionary judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. Furthermore,\n\n- � we identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the overriding of internal controls.\n- � we obtain an understanding of the internal control system relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the combined management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate for the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- � we evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the legal representatives and the reasonableness of estimates made by the legal representatives and related disclosures.\n\n{276}------------------------------------------------\n\n- � we draw conclusions on the appropriateness of the legal representatives' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention to the information concerned in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management report in the auditor's report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or circumstances could endanger the group as a going concern.\n- � we evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the group's assets, liabilities, financial position and earnings position in compliance with the IFRS as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German law pursuant to Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB).\n- � we obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the accounting information of the entities or business activities within the group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- � we evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the group's position it provides.\n- � we perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the legal representatives in the combined management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the legal representatives as a basis for the prospective information and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and, where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\n{277}------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine the matters that were of the greatest significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n#### OTHER STATUTORY AND OTHER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n### **Report on the audit of the electronic reproduction of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report prepared for publication purposes in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB**\n\n**Audit opinion.** We have performed an audit in accordance with Section 317 (3a) HGB to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the reproduction of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report (hereinafter also referred to as \"ESEF documents\") contained in the file with the SHA-256 value a6a3569e47f67a0dcdcc0ec41bc1971932333ef966e3f5eb3e1d20b144528e8f and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB concerning the electronic reporting format (\"ESEF format\") in all material respects. In accordance with German legal requirements, this audit only extends to the conversion of the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report into the ESEF format and therefore does not extend to the information contained in these reproductions or any other information contained in the above-mentioned file.\n\nIn our opinion, the reproduction of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report contained in the above-mentioned file and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format.

Our responsibilities under that standard are further described in the \"Group auditor's responsibilities for the assurance work on the ESEF documents\" section.

We exercise professional discretionary judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. Furthermore,\n\n- � we identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section 328 (1) HGB, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n- � we obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the assurance on the ESEF documents in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the given circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.\n- � we evaluate the technical validity of the ESEF documents, i.e., whether the electronic file containing the ESEF documents meets the requirements of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 in the version valid as of the reporting date on the technical specification for this electronic file.\n- � we evaluate whether the ESEF documents enable an XHTML reproduction with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report.\n- � we evaluate whether the labelling of the ESEF documents with Inline XBRL technology (iXBRL) in accordance with Articles 4 and 6 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 in the version applicable at the reporting date provides an adequate and complete machine-readable XBRL copy of the XHTML reproduction.\n\n{279}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Other disclosures pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation.** We were appointed as group auditor by the Annual General Meeting on 25 May 2023.

The consolidated financial statements and combined management report converted into ESEF format - including the versions to be entered in the company register - are merely electronic reproductions of the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report and do not replace them. In particular, the ESEF report and our audit opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the assured ESEF documents made available in electronic form.\n\n**Responsible Auditor.** The auditor responsible for the audit is Marco Koch.\n\nStuttgart, 12 March 2024\n\nDeloitte GmbH, auditing firm\n\nAuditor Auditor\n\nMarco Koch Andreas Himmelsbach\n\n{280}------------------------------------------------\n\n### <span id=\"page-280-0\"></span>**RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT BY THE EXECUTIVE BOARD**\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, and in accordance with the applicable reporting principles for financial reporting, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the earnings, asset and financial position of the group, and the Management Report of the group includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the group, together with a description of the principal opportunities and risks associated with the expected development of the group,\n\nNeckarsulm, 11 March 2024\n\nBechtle AG The Executive Board\n\nThues Ole of\n\nAntje Leminsky\n\nT.
