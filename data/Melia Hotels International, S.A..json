BUSINESS MODEL**\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### CONTENTS **Continued expansion in the year that consolidated the recovery**\n\nDespite being a year marked by an international context of uncertainty and intensifying geopolitical tensions, an inflationary crisis, the climate emergency and a shortage of talent in the industry, 2023 will be remembered as the year that consolidated the recovery. Today, it is safe to say that the trend observed in 2022 has continued, and 2023's evolution has been \"from good to better\", with global tourism demand continuing to grow despite constraints, and closing at close to 90% of pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn contrast to this trend, hotel investments showed a significant decrease (30%) worldwide, according to *JLL Research's 2023 Global Hotel Investment Outlook*. An environment laden with high interest rates resulted in historically low portfolio transaction results, as well as a reduction in transaction size. However, in the case of Spain, investments in the hotel sector led the way in 2023 with close to € 4.1 billion, accounting for 36% of the total amount transacted, according to CBRE. 2023 was thus the year with the second highest transacted volume of hotels, behind only 2018. It was the only real estate sector to grow (+31%) compared to 2022. Investors continue to favour highend hotels due to their more resilient and inelastic nature, accounting for 85% of the total amount transacted.\n\nIn this environment, we experienced significant growth, setting major milestones in various regions worldwide. We continued to grow by opening 12 hotels and 2,000 rooms, a key step in our global expansion and further consolidating our position as leaders in the hospitality industry. Our objective is to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and hotel value proposition through less capital-intensive formulas and by enhancing luxury brand penetration. And, in terms of our geographic strategy, we have focused on holiday destinations in South East Asia, the Mediterranean and the Caribbean.\n\nIn line with our targets, 92% of our openings in 2023 followed the asset light model, driving new contracts under the management modality, and in geographic terms were evenly distributed across the EMEA, CUBA and APAC regions. Our focus on continuing to grow qualitatively also stands out with significant milestones in the expansion of our luxury brands including Gran Meliá and *The Meliá Collection*, and our premium brands INNSIDE and Meliá.\n\nOn the other hand, it is important to highlight the following openings in the expansion of our brands:\n\n- **Gran Meliá Palazzo Cordusio:** Milestone for the Gran Meliá brand as it is the first in Milan.\n- **ZEL Mallorca:** This is the first hotel under our Mediterranean essence brand promoted together with Rafael Nadal.\n- **Paradisus Gran Canaria and Paradisus Salinas Lanzarote**: The first hotels in Europe under the Paradisus by Meliá brand, our Destination Inclusive Luxury Resorts brand.\n\n### **Future evolution**\n\nOur Company will continue to advance on the Roadmap we adopted on leaving the pandemic that runs to 2024. It sets out 4 major priorities: to be bigger and better managed, more profitable and resilient, more efficient and digital, and more sustainable. This strategy has helped us keep on growing (with 25 new hotels signed in 2023). As for our outlook for 2024, we are approaching it with caution, as is always advisable.\n\nOf particular importance is the momentum we will give to the expansion of our luxury brands, which will account for one out of every three planned openings between 2024 and 2027. We expect to open the following facilities in 2024:\n\n- **Gran Meliá Torre Melina:** This urban resort located in Barcelona will see the light of day after the complete renovation of the former Hotel Rey Juan Carlos I.\n- **ME Lisbon:** This will raise the luxury lifestyle proposal in Lisbon to a new level, following the brand's success in other major cities, including London, Milan and Dubai.\n- **ME Malta:** This will be the city's new social and cultural epicentre, located in Saint Julians on the east coast of the island, it will offer an exclusive, personalised and immersive experience.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/31/Picture/1 description: The image shows a house icon next to the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\".\n\nIn this regard, our *pipeline* at year-end 2023 totals 64 hotels, mainly comprising hotels under *asset light* management models (97%), with a commitment to our brands' *luxury* (33%) and *premium* (53%) segments. We are continuing to strengthen our international vocation, with 90% of our future incorporations being outside Spain.\n\n### **Roadto2024**\n\nIt has been two years since the launch of our *Roadto2024* Strategic Plan. 2023 was the year of the tourism industry's recovery after the COVID-19 crisis, with a return to pre-pandemic results and figures in some cases even higher than in 2019.\n\nOur strategic vision is based on four strategic pillars, shown in the chart below, and a firm commitment to advancing the principles that underpin the *Roadto2024* strategic vision: economic excellence, operational efficiency, and economic, social and environmental sustainability, as essential precepts for consolidating our position in the market and meeting present and future challenges.\n\nThis strategic vision required supporting this transformation with a cultural and organisational transformation plan to strengthen the commitment and engagement of all our teams, with a new structure conceptualised under the premises of consolidating a more efficient and responsible management model, including digital transformation with a 360º vision.\n\nImage /page/31/Figure/7 description: The image shows a diagram of 4 strategic pillars. The first pillar is \"more profitable\", the second pillar is \"more efficient\", the third pillar is \"more management\", and the fourth pillar is \"more sustainable\".\n\nThis report reflects all the progress made and achievements realised, as well as detailed information on the initiatives launched in 2023 and their impact. We are aware that in this last year, 2024, of the *Roadto2024*, we need to work to achieve the targets set and ensure the key principles that the strategic vision set out: being more profitable, better managers, more efficient and more sustainable.\n\n|                   | MANAGEMENT<br>MODEL                                                                                                                                                                                             | MANAGEMENT<br>EFFICIENCY                                                                                                                                                                                                | RESPONSIBLE<br>COMPANY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| OBJECTIVE         | Leverage our brands, our<br>talent, our sales channels,<br>our management skills<br>and ability to generate<br>revenue to generate<br>qualitative and<br>sustainable growth<br>through asset-light<br>formulas. | Leverage the flexibility<br>provided by a more agile,<br>digital and efficient<br>operating model to<br>improve our teams'<br>productivity and<br>analytical capabilities and<br>thus enhance the Group's<br>reporting. | Lead the transformation of<br>tourism towards a more<br>sustainable model that includes<br>ESG criteria in the business<br>model and the generation of<br>short, medium and long-term<br>economic, environmental and<br>social value.                                                                                                                           |\n|                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| KEY<br>MILESTONES | • Signing of 25 new<br>hotels<br>• 12 new openings<br>• Progress on the F&B<br>strategy<br>• Growth in the luxury<br>segment                                                                                    | • New consolidated<br>structures<br>• Promotion of Data<br>Analytics<br>• Continuity of the 360°<br>digital transformation<br>process                                                                                   | • Environmental Taxonomy<br>• 1st scenario of Internal Control<br>System for Non-Financial<br>Information (SCIINF)<br>• Consolidate the positioning in<br>terms of Sustainability<br>• Sustainability visibility in the<br>eyes of customers<br>• Strengthening of the<br>organisational structure in two<br>key destinations: Mexico and<br>Dominican Republic |\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.

Consequently, we have promoted the certification of our portfolio by *GSTC-endorsed* bodies to ensure that our establishments meet the required standards.\n\nWe recognise that corporate sustainability is not only an ethical responsibility, but also a competitive advantage, as companies that demonstrate a commitment to sustainability tend to gain the trust and loyalty of consumers, employees and investors.\n\nDuring 2024, the last year of our Responsible Business strategic pillar, we will undertake various actions to reinforce our model under the three areas of sustainability, also keeping economic sustainability very much in mind.\n\n### **Environmental sustainability**\n\n• Continuing to adopt measures to reduce the negative impact on the planet, advancing in the fulfilment of our public commitments aligned to the SBTi criteria and reducing waste generation with the operation as the key player. We will also undertake a climate risk analysis to identify each hotel's vulnerability, and we will conclude with the requirements of Environmental Taxonomy.\n\n### **Social sustainability**\n\n- Strengthening our commitment to promoting diversity, equality and inclusion, and reinforcing our positioning regarding impact on local communities.\n- In addition, we will update two topics of relevance to the Company, namely the Human Rights CSA (*Control Self Assessment*) and the double materiality assessment, an initial exercise from a financial perspective.\n\n### **Governance sustainability**\n\n• We will adapt our management report and reporting model to the new sustainability regulations, aligned with the *CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive)*. On the other hand, we will strengthen our reporting system by making progress in identifying new targets for the main sustainability-related indicators.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.

This model requires us to raise awareness among the owners of these new properties to be managed by the Company. Providing a vision of the importance of sustainability in the model requires us to develop an attractive and profitable value proposition, and to showcase our best practices in our own assets to demonstrate the economic, social and environmental impact generated.\n\n### **Strategic vision**\n\nGiven the current context, the promotion of our responsible management model with a long-term vision takes on special relevance as we aspire to consolidate ethical, transparent and responsible management in our business model.\n\nWe want to be a benchmark in the transformation towards a new tourism model in which sustainability takes precedence as a strategic management criterion, enabling us to contribute minimising our impact on the planet, as well as promoting economic and social development at all the destinations where we have an active presence. This approach is embodied in a programme we have called Responsible Business.\n\nIt is the result of a process of learning and maturity that we began more than a decade ago. A process that has led us to promote the integration of sustainability as a key lever for value creation in our *core business*. Only from this understanding of sustainability will we be in a position to advance in our sustainable strategy, which takes as a reference our Vision 2030, to position ourselves among the world's leading hotel groups in the medium and high end, urban and leisure segments, consolidating our leadership in leisure and *bleisure* hotels, and being recognised as a global benchmark for excellence, responsibility and sustainability.\n\n### **Transition to sustainability**\n\nBeing aware that the drive for sustainability must be understood as a balanced advance across all its areas, the current reality sets us a priority challenge: to advance in the decarbonisation of our business and evolve towards a more efficient, responsible and sustainable tourism model. We have taken on this commitment throughout our value chain with the ambition of allocating the necessary financial resources to meet the targets set.\n\nGiven the current complex regulatory context, in 2022 we updated our carbon footprint reduction objectives with targets for 2025 and 2035, taking 2018 as the base year.\n\nWith the aim of progressing towards the decarbonisation of a business that we operate in more than 38 countries based on a third-party asset management model, we have considered it appropriate to focus our efforts on a financial, rather than operational, perimeter, to be validated under the criteria of the *Science Based Targets initiative* (SBTi) in 2023.\n\nAlong these lines, in 2022 we decided to align the public commitments to our global integration perimeter and adjust our decarbonisation ambition under the financial control model. This change in no way conditions our determination to work resolutely and continuously towards the longed-for decarbonisation of our business model, which has to involve our entire value chain.\n\nWe have also continued with projects and initiatives focused on reducing emissions from our activity. On the one hand, our efficiency in terms of natural resource consumption is increasing as a result of investment and efficiency and innovation measures that leverage technology. Moreover, our business is less intensive in terms of the consumption of energy and water resources. We are also identifying opportunities to promote circular economy and food waste reduction initiatives, as well as initiatives in other areas.\n\nIn addition, we have renewed our commitment to transparency in environmental matters with our eleventh consecutive participation in *CDP Climate Change*, the international benchmark ranking on climate change and environmental management, and have maintained a B rating.

ANNEXES**\n\n### **Introduction**\n\n### **1.1 General section**\n\nOne of the most important purposes of the EU Action Plan on Sustainable Finance is to channel cash flows towards sustainable investments. Within this context, the EU Taxonomy Regulation came into force in mid 2020 and established some new obligations that companies must fulfil.\n\nThe Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 18 June 2020, on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment (henceforth, \"the Taxonomy\" or \"the Regulation\") aims to serve as a standard and obligatory classification system for determining which economic activities are considered \"environmentally sustainable\" in the EU.\n\nAt present, the EU has published a catalogue of sustainable activities that encompass the six environmental objectives: climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, pollution prevention and control, the transition to a circular economy, the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. Thus, each year companies must report on the classification of their activities as environmentally sustainable in accordance with the EU Taxonomy. To this end, an initial distinction between Taxonomy-Eligibility and Taxonomy-Alignment is required.\n\nFirstly, it is necessary to examine if an activity is eligible. The eligibility of an activity is based on its similarity to the descriptions detailed in the delegated acts of the Taxonomy, which establish the technical criteria and requirements for each environmental objective. These descriptions are linked to a series of NACE codes which aim to guide the exercise of eligibility analysis.\n\nA second step requires analysis of whether the taxonomy-eligible activities previously identified can be considered to be aligned with the Taxonomy, and thus, environmentally sustainable. For an eligible activity to be considered aligned, it is necessary to simultaneously meet three criteria:\n\n- The activity should make a substantial contribution (SC) to an environmental objective,\n- The activity should do no significant harm (DNSH) to the other environmental objectives; and,\n- The company should respect a series of minimum safeguards.\n\n## **1.2 Objective and scope**\n\nAccording to its article 1.1, Regulation (EU) 2020/852 is applicable to companies that are subject to the obligation of publishing a non-financial statement or a consolidated non-financial statement in accordance with article 19 bis or article 29 bis of the Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, respectively.\n\nIn accordance with the aforementioned regulatory obligations, Meliá Hotels Internacional S.A. (henceforth \"the company\" or \"Meliá\") is obliged to comply with Regulation (EU) 2020/852, and to report on the specific key performance indicators in relation to the eligibility and alignment of its activities, in the planned form and substance.\n\nTherefore, in accordance with the aforementioned regulatory requirement, and based on analysis of the economic activities carried out by Meliá, this document reports the percentage of the turnover/ CapEx /OpEx eligible and\n\n191\n\n{198}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONTENTS aligned in accordance with the Taxonomy in their respective totals for the 2023 tax year. The calculation of these KPIs has been carried out for the consolidated Group and the companies that are part of it, taking into account that they meet the criteria established by the regulation on the information used as a basis for all the indicators.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6. ANNEXES**\n\nThis year, the study carried out by Meliá has taken into account the regulatory developments that apply to the data of the 2023 tax year, which include the obligation to analyse, in addition to the eligibility and alignment of the activities of the objectives of Mitigation of climate change and the Objectives of Adaptation to Climate Change, the eligibility of the four remaining objectives: Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, Transition towards a circular economy, Prevention and control of pollution, and Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. Thus, as shall be indicated in the following sections, it has been identified that the main activity of Meliá is included as eligible in taxonomic activity 2.1 of the objective for the Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems: Hotels, holiday resorts, camping grounds and similar accommodation.\n\n### **2. Main results**\n\n### **2.1 KPIs**\n\nIn the year corresponding to the 2023 tax year, Meliá recorded a total turnover of €1,733 Mn (+15%) with a total CapEx of €77 Mn (-24%), and a total OpEx of €159 Mn (+28%). The significant variation in these figures is mainly due to the revival of the hotel operation in a year of recovery for the tourist sector.\n\nThe eligibility analysis has concluded that, from the aforementioned figures, the following are eligible:\n\n#### **TAXONOMY SUMMARY TABLE**\n\n| INDICATOR  | REF. | BREAKDOWN              | 2022             | 2023             |\n|------------|------|------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| A.

Hotels, holiday resorts, camping grounds and similar accommodation\" in the COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2023/2486, of 27 June 2023, completing l Regulation (EU) 2020/852 by establishing the technical selection criteria for determining the conditions in which an economic activity will be considered to substantially contribute to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, to the transition towards a circular economy, to the prevention and control of pollution, or to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nIn this regard, given the nature of the Company's economic activities and considering what is outlined in the \"Commission Notice on the interpretation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of EU Taxonomy Regulation on the reporting of eligible economic activities and assets (2022/C 385/01)\", specifically in section 3 which defines what a taxonomy-eligible economic activity is, the increase of the reference volumes that may be adapted in the future is undeniable.\n\n{199}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **2.1.1 Turnover (Revenue)**\n\n| ABOUT THIS<br>REPORT                | Figures in EUR million                                                                            |                                                                   |       |               |                       |                                 |                                 | SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION                            |                                          |                                     |                                                                    |                                 |                                 | ABSENCE OF SIGNIFICANT HARM                         |                                          |                                     |                                                                    |                    |                                                               | MS               |                     |  |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------|--|\n| 1.

ANNEXES**\n\n## CONTENTS **2.2 Accounting policy**\n\nIn compliance with point 1.2.1 of Annex I of Commission Delegated Regulation supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852, the way in which the turnover, investments in fixed assets and operating expenses were determined and assigned to both the numerator and denominator of each reported indicator is described below.\n\nIn this regard, the calculation of the amount and percentage of the eligibility of the activities of Meliá within the different indicators, has used the full amount of the specific turnover, CapEx and OpEx required by the regulation for the different activities in accordance with their eligibility.\n\n### **2.2.1 Turnover**\n\nIn the case of the turnover indicator, based on the income statements, the accounts to process have been selected based on the Delegated Regulation (EU) of the Commission, as well as the *Final Report- Advice on article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulatio*n published by the ESMA on 26 February 2021.\n\nThus, the income accounts recognised for accounting purposes have been selected in accordance with IAS 1, paragraph 82, letter a): ordinary income, indicating separately interest income calculated according to the effective interest rate method. This income includes:\n\n- the ordinary income from contracts with customers recorded in accordance with IFRS 15;\n- income from leases registered in accordance with IFRS 16, both income from operational leases and income from financial leases, income from interest on accounts receivable from financial leases and other accounts receivable calculated using the effective interest method; and,\n- other sources of income, when applicable.\n\nFor the calculation of the denominator, the income statement of Meliá is used, selecting only the accounts according to the pre-defined accounting criteria. These accounts are as follows: (a) sale of rooms, (b) sales of food, (c) sales of beverages, (d) sales of different services, (e) sales of derivative activities, (f) sale of real estate assets, (g) returns on sales, (h) provision of different services, (i) billing for commissions from loyalty programmes, and (j) income from franchise fees.\n\nThe final figure will be the sum total of these accounts in the consolidated result after adjustments, as they all comply with the criteria of the European Union Regulation.\n\nFor the calculation of the numerator, the same income statement of Meliá is used as the one that was used to calculate the denominator, but only the items that were considered eligible based on their analysis in relation to the Taxonomy are included. To this end, an initial differentiation is carried out evaluating the economic activity of each company that makes up the Group's result. Having determined the companies whose activity is considered eligible according to the regulation, the results are identified which are linked to Assets Owned or Rented which are part of the processes of activity \"2.1. Hotels, holiday resorts, camping grounds and similar accommodation\"\n\n### **2.2.2 CapEx**\n\nFor the calculation of this KPI, the detail of the CapEx per project has been extracted from analytical accounting. Based on this data and, following the criteria defined in Annex I and II, section 1.1 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) of the Commission, the types that must be included according to the regulatory mandate have been selected, i.e. those that have been registered in accordance with International Accounting Standards (henceforth, IAS). The types defined for these purposes are: (a) Expansion – rebranding and pre-opening, (b) IT, (c) Business, (d) Operations, (e) Strategic Plan, and (f) Risks.\n\nWhen applying the international financial reporting standards (IFRS) adopted by Regulation (EC) No. 1126/2008, the Group will include the costs posted to accounts in accordance with:\n\n{203}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n- **1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n- **2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n- **3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6. ANNEXES**\n\n- CONTENTS \n IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, paragraph 73, letter e), items i) and iii);\n\t- IAS 38 Intangible Assets, paragraph 118, letter e), item i);\n\t- IAS 40 Investment Property, paragraph 76, letters a) and b), (for the fair value model);\n\t- IAS 40 Investment Property, paragraph 79, letter d), items i) and ii), (for the cost model);\n\t- IFRS 16 Leases, paragraph 53, letter\n\t- Additionally, the capital expenditure carried out through joint ventures has been considered as CapEx.\n\nThe calculation of the denominator is based on a list of group projects with consolidated information after adjustments, taking into account those that can be considered CapEx in accordance with article 8, and indicating whether the project should be chosen based on the accounting criteria established by the Regulation. The total sum of the amounts in these projects constitutes the denominator.\n\nThe calculation of the numerator uses the same list of group projects, but this time only including the projects that are considered eligible in accordance with the criteria established by the Taxonomy. In addition to this list, the taxonomy CapEx linked to activity 2.1 of Annex IV of the objective on the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems has been added. Hotels, holiday resorts, camping grounds and similar accommodation.\n\n### **2.2.3 OpEx**\n\nFor the OpEx indicator, the Group's consolidated income statements after adjustments have been used as the base information in order to avoid duplication.\n\nIn accordance with the regulations, (Annex I, paragraph 1.1 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU); and *Final Report- Advice on article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation* published by the ESMA on 26 February 2021) the accounts that need to be taken into consideration for the calculation have been selected. Thus, the OpEx calculation will only include non-capitalised direct costs recorded in the income statement for the year relating to:\n\n- Research and development expenses.\n- Short-term lease expenses.\n- Maintenance and repairs, as well as other direct related expenses that are required to guarantee the continued and efficient operation of said assets.\n- The aforementioned operating expenses carried out through joint ventures will also form part of the OPEX. However, the operating expenses of joint ventures will not be considered as such.\n\nThe calculation of the denominator is based on the income statement of Meliá, taking the following accounts selected according to the pre-defined criteria, which are as follows: (a) Other Rentals, (b) Other Rentals IFRS16, (c) High or Low Value Rentals, (d) Low Value Rentals, (e) Royalties and others, (f) Off-Shore Rentals, (g) Repairs and Maintenance, (h) Rentals from Hotels, (i) Rental from Hotels IFRS16. Meliá does not have an account item relating to R+D.\n\nTherefore, the OpEx denominator consists of the sum of these accounts for the companies in the consolidated Group.\n\nThe calculation of the numerator of the OpEx indicator is based on the figure obtained from the calculation of the denominator, but including only those accounts and items that are considered eligible in accordance with the Taxonomy Regulation and following the same criteria described in the previous sections, i.e. that they are assets that are intrinsically linked to the activity: Hotels, holiday resorts, camping grounds and similar accommodation.\n\n### **2.2.4 Double counting**\n\nWith the aim of avoiding double counting of the figures of the aforementioned activities, the organisation has established the necessary supervision and control measures in order to ensure the consistency and reliability of the information extraction and transformation, and thus ensure the integrity and traceability of the information from its origin to the reporting of the calculated indicators.

Thus, the taxonomy analysis of this fiscal year, 2023, concluded that 89% of Revenue, 97% of the CapEx and 29% of the OpEx of Meliá Hotels International will be eligible within activity 2.1.\n\nAccording to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486, of 27 June 2023, completing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the eligibility and alignment results relating to the information corresponding to the 2023 financial year relating to the objectives of Mitigation of climate change and of Adaptation to climate change, and only the eligibility of the four new objectives should be included.\n\nDue to the above and in view of the low participation in eligible economic activities linked to the objectives of Mitigation of climate change and of Adaptation to climate change, this analysis will focus on the eligibility of activity 2.1. Hotels, holiday resorts, camping grounds and similar accommodation, and a pre-assessment of the future alignment.\n\n### **2.3.2 Substantial contribution criteria (SCC)**\n\nWith regard to the substantial contribution, as we have stated, the activity Hotels, holiday resorts, camping grounds, and similar accommodation naturally becomes the one of greatest relevance. Therefore, we will further our analysis of the criteria for the contribution to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems in future years with the objective of achieving the alignment of our activities where possible.\n\nThis analysis will result in extending the assessment that we present in the section Management of biodiversity and ecosystems, and also identifying and approaching organisations responsible for the conservation of the zones close to the tourist destinations that house our accommodation in order to establish collaboration agreements.\n\n### **2.3.3 Do no significant harm (DNSH) criteria**\n\nOn the other hand, regarding the criteria of doing no significant harm relating to activity, specifically those relating to the adaptation to climate change, while it is true that, during 2021 we aligned Meliá's climate change management to the recommendations guide prepared by the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) working group, we have decided to apply conservative criteria when evaluating the alignment of our activities and we believe we need to analyse each particular asset in the assessment of the risks and opportunities related to climate change and the way we manage them. In view of the foregoing, and due to the aforementioned need, we believe that at present our activities cannot be considered to be aligned in accordance with the criteria established in the Regulation.\n\nIn view of what has been outlined, and in accordance with what is described in the section on Climate change and Energy, this review takes on even greater importance and encourages us to update and improve the analysis of climate risks associated with our property portfolio in 2024.\n\n{205}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\nCONTENTS On the other hand, we will analyse the remaining DNSH criteria in order to establish a plan that eventually enables us to adapt our assets in order to do no harm to the mitigation of climate change and to none of the other objectives established in these regulations.\n\n> It is worth highlighting the Company will face a significant challenge to achieve alignment, requiring strategic and sustained efforts to attain it. Although it is important to acknowledge that immediate success may not be attainable in the short-term, the approach that we adopt gives us confidence in eventual favourable results.\n\n**2.4 Information regarding minimum safeguards** GRI: 206-1; 416-2; 417-2; 417-3; 418-1\n\n### **2.4.1 Introduction**\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6. ANNEXES**\n\nIn addition to complying with a series of objective technical criteria for each of its activities, alignment depends on compliance, by the Company, with a series of minimum safeguards.\n\nEssentially, the purpose of the Minimum Safeguards (MS) outlined in Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council consists of preventing an investment being classified as sustainable if it entails negative impacts on:\n\n- Human Rights, including the rights of workers.\n- The fight against corruption and bribery\n- Tax matters.\n- Competition law.\n\nThese minimum safeguards do not contradict the application of more stringent requirements in terms of health, safety, etc. provided it is applicable under European Law.\n\n### **2.4.2 Declaration of compliance.**\n\nThe requirements outlined in this analysis have been interpreted based on the guidelines provided by the European Union Platform on Sustainable Finance in the document *Final Report on Minimum Safeguards* of October 2022.1\n\n### **a. Human rights**\n\nMeliá Hotels International has spent years working on the consolidation of a management and governance system for human rights, the process began with the publication of its Human Rights Policy, approved by the Board of Directors in July 2018 and which expressly outlines its express commitments in relation to this field.\n\nThe Company has assumed the universal cornerstones for the protection and defence of these rights, such as the Principles of the Global Compact —an entity it has been a member of since 2008— and the Human Rights of the United Nations. It also follows and applies other international reference frameworks in the business sector (the International Charter of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as well as the Fundamental Principles of the ILO, the Tripartite Declaration of Principles on Multinational Enterprises and the Social Policy) as well as the specific agreements of the tourist industry, as publicly outlined in the aforementioned corporate policy.\n\nRespect for human rights in accordance with international regulation is inseparable from the way that Meliá Hotels International understands management and its origins as a family business. This leads Meliá to put its commitments into practice in order to further their integration into its entire value chain.\n\nTo this end, Meliá uses its own Code of Ethics– general framework for both employees and suppliers and stakeholders–, of the aforementioned corporate policy as well as other specific approaches, also public, through its adherence to the Modern Slavery Act in the United Kingdom.\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONTENTS necessary information on competition before undertaking their work at the company.

Therefore, the\naccompanying NFIS does not include comparative information on eligibility in relation to the other\nenvironmental objectives indicated above or to the new activities included in the climate change\nmitigation and climate change adaptation objectives.

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nTo the Shareholders of Meliá Hotels International, S.A.,\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of Meliá Hotels International, S.A. (\"the Parent\") and its\nsubsidiaries (\"the Group\"), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2023, and the\nconsolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement\nof changes in equity, consolidated statement of cash flows and notes to the consolidated financial statements for the\nyear then ended.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nconsolidated equity and consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and its consolidated\nresults and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting\nStandards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRSs) and the other provisions of the regulatory financial reporting\nframework applicable to the Group in Spain.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the audit regulations in force in Spain. Our responsibilities under those\nregulations are further described in the *Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial*\nStatements section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements, including those pertaining to\nindependence, that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in Spain pursuant to the audit\nregulations in force. In this regard, we have not provided any services other than those relating to the audit of financial\nstatements and there have not been any situations or circumstances that, in accordance with the aforementioned\naudit regulations, might have affected the requisite independence in such a way as to compromise our independence.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the\nconsolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of\nthe consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a\nseparate opinion on these matters.\n\n{2}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs described in Note 1 to the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements, the Group engages\nin the management and operation of 350 hotels\n(owned, leased, managed and franchised) in 38\ncountries, and had assets associated with the hotel\nactivity with an aggregate carrying amount of EUR 3,178\nmillion at 31 December 2023, with this amount\nincluding goodwill, property, plant and equipment,\nintangible assets, right-of-use assets and investment\nproperty.\n\nAt least at each year-end management performs an\nimpairment test in order to determine the recoverable\namount of these assets.\n\nFor each cash-generating unit (\"CGU\"), the Group's\nManagement has calculated the value in use of each of\nthem based on the estimate of future cash flow\ngeneration, taking into account economic and\ngeopolitical aspects, and applying specific growth and\ndiscount rates for the CGUs in each country where the\nGroup operates, also adjusting discount rates to be\nconsistent with the underlying cash flows.\n\nAs a result of the test carried out, an expense has been\nrecognised under the headings \"Depreciation and\nimpairment Property, Plant and Equipment and Other\nintangible assets\", \"Depreciation and impairment Right\nof use\" and \"Results from assets sale\" of the\naccompanying consolidated profit and loss account for\nthe year 2023, for a total amount of €5.5 million.\n\nIn this context, the circumstance described represents\na key audit matter, given the significance of the carrying\namount of the assets associated with the hotel activity\nin the consolidated balance sheet, and given that the\nvaluation methods used require the use of significant\nestimates involving a significant degree of uncertainty,\nsuch as certain operating assumptions, such as\noccupancy rate and revenue per room, and financial\nassumptions such as the discount rate, the long-term\ngrowth rate and, in the case of owned assets, the exit\nyield.\n\nOur audit procedures included, among others,\nevaluating the accounting policies for determining the\nrecoverable amount of the assets associated with the\nhotel activity described in Notes 2 and 3 to the\naccompanying consolidated financial statements for\n2023, in order to evaluate their consistency with the\napplicable regulatory financial reporting framework.\n\nAlso, in order to identify possible bias in management's\nassumptions, we retrospectively reviewed the\nestimates made in the previous year, evaluating the\ndegree to which they were realised, as well as those\nmade in prior years, checking them against historical\ninformation.\n\nOn the other hand, we have obtained the impairment\ntests of the Group's hotel assets carried out by the\nManagement of the Parent Company, verifying their\narithmetic correctness and the adequacy of the\nvaluation methodology used in each case, with the\ninvolvement of our internal valuation specialists. In\naddition, we have obtained the latest budgets approved\nby the directors of the Parent Company adapted to the\ncurrent circumstances of the markets in which the\nGroup operates, and evaluated the reasonableness of\nits main operating assumptions against macroeconomic\nand sector forecasts, taking into account economic,\ngeopolitical and climatic aspects, as well as long-term\nprojections compared to historical hotel data prior to\nthe pandemic. We have also analysed the\nreasonableness of the long-term discount rates and\ngrowth rates and, for owned assets, the exit yields\napplied, with the assistance of our valuation specialists,\nand reviewed the sensitivity analyses carried out by\nmanagement with respect to these assumptions.\n\nLastly, we evaluated whether the disclosures made by\nthe Group in relation to these matters, which are\nincluded in Notes 7.1, 7.5, 10, 11, and 17 to the\naccompanying consolidated financial statements,\ncontained the information required by the applicable\naccounting regulations.\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Group sells timeshare rights for specific holiday\ncomplex units. The revenue recognised in the\naccompanying consolidated statement of profit or loss\nfor 2023 arising from this vacation club activity\namounted to EUR 69 million, and the amounts\ncontracted, net of related expenses but not yet\nrecognised in profit or loss, which are recognised under\n\"Capital grants and other deferred income\" in the\naccompanying consolidated balance sheet as at 31\nDecember 2023, total EUR 264 million.\n\nThe recognition of revenue from the exercise of the\nrights of use by the customers, as well as for\ncancellations of the package of rights contracted,\nalthough not complex, involves a specific casuistry\nassociated with the different conditions signed with the\ncustomers and contains a manual registration\ncomponent. In addition, the Group recognises club\nrevenue from unexercised customer rights in\nproportion to the customer's usage pattern, and\nprovided that the likelihood of the customer exercising\nits remaining rights becomes remote, requiring the use\nof relevant estimates and judgments by management.\n\nAccordingly, this matter was a key audit matter in our\naudit.\n\nOur audit procedures included, among others, the\nreview of the accounting policies for the recognition of\nrevenue from the Group's vacation club, which are\ndescribed in Note 3.11 to the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements for 2023, in order to\nevaluate whether they were in conformity with the\napplicable regulatory financial reporting framework, as\nwell as checking the design and implementation and the\noperating effectiveness of the relevant controls\nidentified in the process of recognising revenue from\nthe vacation club.\n\nWe have also carried out substantive procedures\nconsisting of verifying, for a randomly selected sample\nof sharing rights exercised during the year, as well as\ncancellations, the consistency of the accounting record\nwith the associated contractual documentation and its\nadequacy to the terms and obligations of the program\ncontracted by the club's client. In addition, we have\nobtained the calculation made by the Management of\nthe income recognized by unexercised customer rights,\nevaluating its arithmetic correctness, as well as the\nmost relevant hypotheses, particularly the percentage\nof unused rights, based on historical information.\n\nLastly, we evaluated the reasonableness of the\ndisclosures contained in Notes 7.1 and 16.1 to the\naccompanying consolidated financial statements on the\nrevenue from the Group's vacation club.\n\nThe other information comprises only the consolidated directors' report for 2023, the preparation of which is the\nresponsibility of the Parent's directors and which does not form part of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the consolidated directors' report. Our\nresponsibility relating to the consolidated directors' report, in accordance with the audit regulations in force, consists\nof:\n\n) Solely checking that the consolidated non-financial information statement, certain information included in the\nannual corporate governance report and the annual directors' remuneration report, to which the Spanish Audit Law\nrefers, have been furnished as provided for in the applicable legislation and, if this is not the case, reporting this fact.\n\nb) Evaluating and reporting on whether the other information included in the consolidated directors' report is\nconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, based on the knowledge of the Group obtained in the audit of\nthose consolidated financial statements, as well as evaluating and reporting on whether the content and presentation\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\nf this section of the consolidated directors' report are in conformity with the applicable regulations. If, based on the\nwork we have performed, we conclude that there are material misstatements, we are required to report that fact.\n\nBased on the work performed, as described above, we observed that the information described in section a) above\nhad been furnished as provided for in the applicable legislation and that the other information in the consolidated\ndirectors’ report was consistent with that contained in the consolidated financial statements for 2023 and its content\nand presentation were in conformity with the applicable regulations.\n\nThe Parent's directors are responsible for preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements so that they\npresent fairly the Group's consolidated equity, consolidated financial position and consolidated results in accordance\nwith EU-IFRSs and the other provisions of the regulatory financial reporting framework applicable to the Group in\nSpain, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated\nfinancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Parent's directors are responsible for assessing the Group's\nability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going\nconcern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have\nno realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Parent's audit and compliance committee is responsible for overseeing the process involved in the preparation\nand presentation of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole\nare free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our\nopinion.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with\nthe audit regulations in force in Spain will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can\narise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be\nexpected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements is included in the\nAppendix to this auditor's report. This description, which is on the following pages, forms part of our auditor's report.\n\nWe have examined the digital files in European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) of Meliá Hotels International, S.A. and\nits subsidiaries for 2023, which comprise the XHTML file including the consolidated financial statements for 2023 and\nthe XBRL files with the tagging performed by the Group, which will form part of the annual financial report.\n\nThe directors of Meliá Hotels International, S.A. are responsible for presenting the annual financial report for 2023 in\naccordance with the format and markup requirements established in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU)\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\n2019/815 of 17 December 2018 (\"ESEF Regulation\"). In this regard, the annual corporate governance report and the\nannual directors' remuneration report were included by reference in the consolidated directors' report.\n\nOur responsibility is to examine the digital files prepared by the Parent's directors, in accordance with the audit\nregulations in force in Spain. Those regulations require that we plan and perform our audit procedures in order to\nascertain whether the content of the consolidated financial statements included in the aforementioned digital files\ncorresponds in full to that of the consolidated financial statements that we have audited, and whether those\nconsolidated financial statements and the aforementioned files were formatted and marked up, in all material\nrespects, in accordance with the requirements established in the ESEF Regulation.\n\nIn our opinion, the digital files examined correspond in full to the audited consolidated financial statements, and these\nare presented and have been marked up, in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements established in\nthe ESEF Regulation.\n\nThe opinion expressed in this report is consistent with the content of our additional report to the Parent's audit and\ncompliance committee dated 27 February 2024.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting held on 22 June 2023 appointed us as the Group's auditors for a period of one year from\nthe year ended 31 December 2022, i.e., for 2023.\n\nPreviously, we were designated pursuant to a resolution of the General Meeting for a period of 1 year and have been\nauditing the financial statements uninterruptedly since the year ended 31 December 2019.\n\nDELOITTE, S.L.\nRegistered in ROAC under no.

As you know, global tourism demand has resurged and continues to show \"extraordinary resilience\" in the words of the Secretary-General of the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), which, like the sector's other institutions and experts, has just once again revised upwards its forecasts for the closing of this year. This is despite the complex context that has conditioned the exit from the crisis, marked by geopolitical insecurity, the inflation crisis, the climate emergency and the shortage of talent in the industry.\n\nIn the case of Meliá Hotels International, 2023 will be remembered as the year in which we consolidated the recovery curve that began in 2022, capitalising on the positive situation to grow and get stronger by following our strategic roadmap, while also mitigating the worst impacts of inflation and the polycrisis. We are continuing to keep more alive than ever the commitments made in our *Roadto2024*, with the ambition of being \"more profitable, better managers, more sustainable and more efficient\", commitments on which we have been underpinning our progress and building our achievements.\n\n### **Growth and transformation**\n\nThe tailwinds of international tourism demand have undoubtedly helped our Company meet targets such as exceeding 2019's revenues by 7.8%, and achieving EBITDA excluding capital gains of 486.5 million, above the commitment made at our last Annual General Shareholders Meeting. But along with the current situation, our strategy has also been fundamental for consolidating our portfolio's growth and promoting greater efficiency in our management. This has contributed to maintaining our margins despite the inflationary context, while giving us a leading competitive factor for expansion through less capital-intensive formulas, including management and franchising, under which we have already incorporated more than 65 hotels in the last 6 years.\n\nOur Roadmap has helped us to continue progressing in areas such as technology, and we now have a top-rate suite of solutions to manage our hotels and third-party hotels more efficiently, while we keep on evolving our distribution platform's digital assets. While last year we updated our B2C melia. com website, this year the investment has been focused on the B2B Meliá PRO platform, laying the foundations for significant growth in demand from this very important segment which, following a strong recovery after the pandemic, now accounts for 5.3% of our global turnover.\n\nTechnology with a global approach that follows the customer throughout their 'journey' by means of a more efficient and digital relationship model, wherever the customer needs it and during their stay, putting at their fingertips our hotels' entire offer in a user-friendly way, to make their stay a true experience.\n\nIn the area of innovation, we have continued committing to knowledge and personalisation of the offer to our customers with the aid of our loyalty programme, *MeliáRewards*. Turning 30 in 2024, this programme welcomes new members every day and, like the other parts of the Company, is essential on the path of growth and expansion.\n\nOn the subject of expansion, together with our management and distribution capacity as competitive levers, Meliá's growth is strongly linked to our\n\n2\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/13 description: A man with dark hair and a beard is shown from the chest up.

Significant advances include the consolidation of our unique luxury hotel brand Meliá Collection, which already has 8 hotels in operation and 8 to be opened in the future, the debut of the ZEL brand, created in collaboration with Rafael Nadal, with an increasing pipeline of openings for the coming years, and the launch in Europe of the Paradisus by Meliá \"Destination Inclusive\" resorts brand, specifically in the Canary Islands with Paradisus Salinas Lanzarote and Paradisus Gran Canaria. 2024 will be a pivotal year for the ME brand, with the planned openings of ME Malta, ME Sayulita, ME Guadalajara in Mexico and ME Lisbon (Portugal).\n\nIn 2023, our Company signed a total of 26 new hotels and 12 new openings, some as major as the Gran Meliá Palazzo Cordusio (Milan), the ZEL Mallorca hotel, our first Gran Meliá in Southeast Asia, Gran Meliá Nha Trang (Vietnam) or the Innside Bangkok in the capital of Thailand. I would also highlight our return to growth in countries like Mexico and our consolidation in holiday destinations with significant potential for growth, such as Albania and Malta.\n\nOur portfolio's current evolution already reflects the positive tendency created by our luxury strategy, a segment which accounts for 13% of the portfolio and to which one in three of the group's new openings belong. As the segment with the highest demand and the most resilient to cycles and crises, the growing focus on luxury hotels and rooms has given us a clear competitive strength over the years. It is also helping to consolidate an increasingly qualitative RevPAR, prioritising quality over quantity and at the same time minimising risks and negative impacts on resources and communities in the destinations where we operate.\n\n### **A responsible business**\n\nOur sustainability strategy, or responsible business, as we designed it in *Roadto2024*, encompasses the three dimensions of the ESG acronym (environmental, social and governance), and I am pleased to report that *S&P Global ESG* has recognised us in its *Sustainability Yearbook 2024* as Europe's most sustainable company in the *Hotels, Resorts & Cruises Lines* sector. However, this milestone should not cause us to overlook the countless challenges posed by the climate situation and social demands, both nationally and internationally, all under a regulatory environment of governance and regulation promoted by the European Economic Community with the ambition of making progress in the face of the challenges set out in the *New Green Deal.*\n\nThe 2023 Climate Change Conference (COP28) held in Dubai concluded with a hopeful agreement to boost the energy transition, with an express call to abandon fossil fuels, with the mission of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nUnder these premises, Meliá continues to work on reducing its carbon footprint and promoting the use of renewable energies, as well as ensuring an efficient environmental management system that contributes to meeting the targets set to reduce our emissions by 71.4% by 2035 (vs 2018).\n\nDuring the year, we resumed environmental certifications with the aim of completing this process in 2024 for our entire portfolio of owned, leased and managed properties. On the other hand, given the situation of water stress that many hotels are experiencing, mainly in Spain and other countries in the Mediterranean basin, last year we launched the Magnum project, an initiative in partnership with two other business entities to measure the water footprint, applying *Building Information Modelling (BIM)* technology and the creation of a platform that integrates current and future data in a structured way. This project is scheduled for completion during 2025 and will give the Company a level of detail on the hotel's water performance and conclusions to be incorporated into new hotel constructions.\n\nRegarding the social dimension, Meliá is meeting its target of recovering its pre-pandemic workforce levels and achieving *TOP Employer* recognition in eight countries (Spain, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Italy, France, United Kingdom and Germany), which together represent no less than 96% of the Company's total workforce. Together, this certification, the new vision of its *Very Inspiring People* employer brand, presented this year, and the extraordinary results of the Culture and Engagement Study, with an average rating of engagement and sense of belonging of over 87%, ratify Meliá's internal and external reputation as an employer and support our competitiveness in an environment of increasing shortage of and competition for talent.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nThirdly, in terms of governance, Meliá continues to get stronger with a more independent (54.54%) and more diverse Board, maintaining its 36.36% percentage of women. In 2023, the most significant milestone was undoubtedly the culmination of the succession process for the Executive Chairmanship, planned since 2016 following the resignation of our founder and current Honorary Chairman.\n\n### **Strength and trust**\n\nGlobal tourism demand's shining moment, which according to estimates and booking indicators will continue in 2024, should not obscure the significant challenges that our industry continues to face. After providing an example of resilience and commitment in the face of disruption, the current transition period requires us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet to restore the healthy debt levels and value generation prior to the pandemic, and to capitalise on our strengths and leadership as our industry continues to grow in the coming years.\n\nTo achieve this, along with cash generation, the growth and improvement of our portfolio and efficiency improvements, we are continuing to promote other levers such as the turnover of certain non-strategic assets and the consolidation of corporate alliances with leading entities in the market, such as the agreement signed with Banca March for three hotels located in Ibiza and Fuerteventura, and the two operations linked to the *Abu Dhabi Investment Authority* (ADIA).\n\nI would like to conclude by reiterating that without trust there is no growth, no investment and no future. For this reason, Meliá Hotels International would like to thank you for the privilege of having kept the trust of our shareholders, partners and collaborators during such difficult times. Safeguarding this trust and continuing to contribute to the generation of shared value with our stakeholders is, and will assuredly be, our priority in the new era of growth and consolidation that we now begin, guided by our Roadmap 2030.\n\n**Gabriel Escarrer Jaume** Chairman and CEO\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\n| 01.

On 1 June 2011, the Annual General Shareholders Meeting approved the change of name to Meliá Hotels International, S.A. The Company moved its registered office to 24 Calle Gremio Toneleros, Palma de Mallorca in 1998.\n\nMeliá Hotels International, S.A. and its subsidiaries and associates (hereinafter, the \"Group\" or the \"Company\") form an integrated group of companies engaged mainly in tourism activities in general and, more specifically, in the management and operation of owned, leased, managed or franchised hotels, as well as vacation club operations. The Group is also engaged in the promotion of all kinds of businesses related to the tourism industry and the hotel sector and to leisure, entertainment and recreational activities, as well as participating in the creation, development and operation of new businesses, establishments and entities in the tourism industry and hotel sector and any leisure, entertainment and recreational activities.\n\nWith more than 65 years of history behind it, Meliá Hotels International has consolidated its international presence with 350 hotels in 38 countries, mainly in Spain, Latin America, the rest of Europe and Asia.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/1 description: The image shows a house icon next to the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\".\n\n**ABOUT THIS REPORT**\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n### **Scope of the report**\n\nThe period covered by the report corresponds to the financial year beginning on 1 January 2023 and ending on 31 December 2023.\n\nThe information reported is aligned with the consolidation perimeter used in the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements (full consolidation method). Consequently, this report includes information on all entities over which the Group exercises effective control, which is generally accompanied by a shareholding of more than half of the voting rights.\n\nDetails of the companies included in the consolidation perimeter as at 31 December 2023 are provided in Annex 1 and Annex 2 of the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements, classified into subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe changes in the presentation of the current report are due, on the one hand, to the recent publication of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, or CSRD, which governs the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, or ESRS, to be transposed during 2024 and, therefore, applicable for next year's reporting. On the other hand, said changes are also due to our ambition to be a benchmark in the transformation towards a new tourism model in which sustainability takes precedence as a strategic criterion in management. In this way, we have taken the first steps towards adapting the structure and content required under the new Directive, while still meeting the requirements of current mercantile legislation (Act 11/2018 of 28 December on diversity and non-financial reporting).\n\nAs at the date when this report was prepared, no errors have been detected that would entail the rectification of previous publications.\n\n### **External verification**\n\nIn order to ensure the transparency and reliability of the information, Meliá Hotels International has submitted its non-financial reporting to verification by an independent external auditor since 2010. The 2023 non-financial information has been verified by the firm Deloitte with a limited level of assurance, obtaining an independent review report, based on the essential GRI standards, including the process scope and objectives, as well as the verification procedures used and their conclusions.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances**\n\n#### **ABOUT THIS REPORT**\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n### **Time horizons**\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nIn the specific case of the assessment carried out in 2021 in which we identi-\n\nfied climate change risks and opportunities, in line with the *Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)* recommendations, time horizons were used that deviate from those defined by the regulations to come into force in 2024.\n\nThe following time horizons were used in this case:\n\n- Short term: 0 to 5 years.\n- Medium term: 6 to 15 years.\n- Long term: 16 to 30 years.\n\n### **Sources of uncertainty in estimation and results**\n\n### **Waste generation**\n\nWe consider it relevant to mention that, given the scaling of our reporting system for waste generated (37% of the active portfolio) as well as the limited knowledge of its treatment by the managers of the same in the different destinations where the company operates, the information reported in this area includes a significant degree of estimation.\n\nIn this regard, the calculation of waste generated by business units that do not report data is carried out by multiplying each of these business units' number of stays each month by the ratio of kilograms of waste generated per stay and type of waste of the business units that do report data.\n\nOn the other hand, concerning the treatment of the waste generated, our calculation assumes that the treatment of the company's waste behaves in the same way as the statistical information reported by each country annually for each type of waste. Consequently, the treatment will depend on the location of the business unit and the type of waste generated.\n\nWe plan to further consolidate our waste management system in the coming years so we can identify both the waste generation and the waste treatment at the business unit level and thus eliminate any uncertainty in this regard.\n\n**Queries**\n\nShould you have any queries or suggestions relating to this report, please contact us directly at:\n\n- FINANCIAL INFORMATION: Investor Relations Department (investors.relations@melia.com)\n- NON-FINANCIAL INFORMATION: Sustainability Department (sustainability@melia.com)\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n2023 Management Report Meliá Hotels International\n\nTABLE OF \nCONTENTS\n\n1.

In response to the growing demand for ESG information from investors, regulators and other stakeholders, we are responding to specific requests and participating in specialised rankings to understand the robustness of our performance in the three areas: environmental, social and governance.\n\nBy listening, measuring and assessing, we identify areas for improvement in our Company with the aim of implementing measures to improve our performance and meet our stakeholders' expectations.\n\nFor more than 10 years, we have been participating in some of the most prestigious indices and frameworks internationally with the goal of endorsing our progress and ensuring that the roadmap we have designed is aligned with expectations.\n\nThe S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook 2023 has once again recognised us as the most sustainable hotel company worldwide in the Hotels, Resorts & Cruise Lines segment, regaining the leadership awarded for the first time in 2020.\n\nMeliá received the highest rating in the industry in governance and finance, standing out in the areas of risk management, in terms of the environment in the areas of climate change and environmental indicators and, finally, in the social field in the areas of human rights, human capital development, team management indicators and, lastly, management with our customers.\n\nBeing recognised, once again, as a market leader in terms of sustainability requires us to continue promoting our firm commitment to the integration of ESG criteria in our business model, and is an additional incentive to consolidate a more sustainable and responsible tourism model.\n\n### **ESG MONITORS 2023**\n\n| ENTITY            | RATING             |                        | ASSESSMENT CRITERIA                               | FROM |\n|-------------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------|\n|                   | 2023               | 2022                   |                                                   |      |\n| S&P Global ESG    | 3rd position       | 1st position           | 0-100 points                                      | 2018 |\n| ISS ESG           | B- Prime           | B- (Prime)             | D- a A+                                           | 2022 |\n| ISS Quality Score | E:1 / S:1 / G:6    | E: 1 / S: 1 / G: 3     | 1-10 (lower to higher risk)                       | 2018 |\n| Sustainalytics    | 25.7               | 23.6                   | 0-40 points (higher score, higher risk)           | 2018 |\n|                   | (Medium Risk)      | (Medium Risk)          |                                                   |      |\n| MSCI ESG          | A                  | A                      | CCC - AAA                                         | 2018 |\n| FTSE 4 Good       | ESG Score: 3.7     | ESG Rating: 3.6        | 0-5 (the higher the score, the better the rating) | 2009 |\n|                   |                    | (E: 3.3 / S: 3 / G: 5) |                                                   |      |\n| EcoVadis          | Bronze (60 points) | Gold (64 points)       | 0-100 points                                      | 2020 |\n| CDP Climate       | B                  | B                      | D - A                                             | 2015 |\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **Rankings and other monitors**\n\nInspired by our vocation for continuous improvement, we also participate in benchmark rankings and monitors in areas aligned with the company's needs, material issues and strategic priorities.

BUSINESS MODEL**\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n# CONTENTS **International context and the impact on the tourism industry**\n\nGRI: 2-6\n\nAfter global growth of 3.5% in 2022, growth in 2023 closes at around 3%, with the prospect of remaining at these levels in 2024. The forecast for 2024- 2025 is lower than the historical average of 3.8% (2000-2019) in the face of monetary policies of high interest rates to combat inflation, the withdrawal of fiscal support, in an environment of heavy indebtedness that is dampening economic activity and low underlying growth in productivity.\n\nDespite a complex global context in 2023, marked by the acceleration of technological change, the vulnerability of cyberspace, economic uncertainty, extreme weather events and armed conflicts between states, international tourism made headway to reach nearly 90% of pre-pandemic levels, almost 38% more than what was observed between January and September 2022, according to the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). This thus confirms the sector's resilience, with a return to pre-pandemic levels in terms of employment, high occupancy and adaptation to the new requirements and expectations of visitors.\n\nAccording to data from Amadeus, a leader in travel technology, global hotel occupancy levels up to the end of August 2023 showed 10% growth compared to 2022. It estimated that for the fourth quarter 2023, booking growth would remain at similar growth rates to those mentioned. International tourism is expected to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels in 2024, with initial estimates pointing to growth of 2% compared to levels achieved in 2019. These figures are a source of optimism for the global hotel sector for the coming year.\n\nWith regard to our main market, Spain consolidated its recovery in 2023 after a successful last quarter, which raised tourism's contribution to the Spanish economy to 12.8%, a record high. An industry that stands as the main driver of real economic growth, according to Exceltur's tourism assessment. This evolution is mainly based on the strength of demand, in a context of improving salaries, consumers' preference for travel experiences and the return of the meetings and conferences segment, as well as an increase in prices that reduced the impact of the increase in energy, supplies (9.6%), financial (+18.9%) and wage (7.3%) costs. This situation has reduced the capacity of companies in the sector to increase their financial results.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, the global economy is in better condition than a year ago: the risk of a global recession has reduced, but rising geopolitical tensions could create new dangers in the short term. The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) is optimistic and indicates that it is on track to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels in 2024, despite economic challenges such as high inflation and weak global production, as well as significant geopolitical tensions and conflicts.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, global headline inflation is projected to fall to 5.8% in 2024 and 4.4% in 2025. In the face of this disinflation and firm growth, the likelihood of a hard landing has receded, and risks to global growth are broadly balanced. On the positive side, faster disinflation could lead to a further easing of financial conditions and looser fiscal policies, bringing with it a temporary increase in growth and a boost to productivity. On the other hand, more spikes in commodity prices as a result of geopolitical upheavals (such as the ongoing attacks in the Red Sea) and supply disruptions, or further persistence of core inflation, could prolong tight monetary conditions.\n\nMeliá is facing these forecasts with optimism, focused on moving forward our *Roadto2024* strategy, with the ambition of meeting all the targets set in this final year of our 2022-2024 strategic plan. We ended 2023 by being recognised as the most sustainable European hotel company according to *S&P Global ESG*.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/25/Picture/1 description: The image shows the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\" in a light gray color.

The tourism industry, and especially leisure tourism, in which we are leaders, is on the one hand particularly sensitive to environmental and social issues. On the other hand, our industry plays an essential role in the fight against climate change and its contribution to promoting the conversion of some mature destinations, established at the beginning of the holiday tourism boom.\n\nOur passion for hospitality drives us to respond to our world's global challenges, approaching sustainability as a fundamental lever to transform the tourism model and ensure a positive legacy for our society and our planet.\n\nWe have a far-reaching potential to influence people. On the one hand, through the training and engagement of our employees and partners (true ambassadors for sustainability). On the other hand, by raising awareness among the millions of customers we welcome each year of the importance of taking care of our environment.\n\nImage /page/28/Picture/6 description: This image shows a long, rectangular swimming pool at a resort or hotel, with palm trees and other greenery surrounding it.

While the Real Estate area brings together under its responsibility very significant areas in terms of sustainability, primarily: works & maintenance, procurement and energy and water consumption management.\n\nIn 2023, this governing body set the objective of holding monthly meetings to ensure the transformation and adaptation of our business model to sustainability standards, in an increasingly demanding regulatory context which requires more agile and effective decision-making and implementation.\n\nThis Committee also reports to the Company's Senior Executive Team (SET) and maintains a close link with our Board of Directors through direct reporting to the Appointments, Remuneration and Sustainability Committee and the Audit & Control Committee on non-financial *reporting*.\n\n### **Governing bodies**\n\nThe Company has developed an organisational and governance structure that assigns and allocates specific responsibilities in terms of sustainability to the different executive bodies and committees of our Board of Directors. The Board of Directors approves and oversees the sustainability strategy, including that related to climate change, and delegates different sustainability roles to its two committees.\n\nThe **Remuneration, Appointments and Sustainability Committee** is the governing body that has been delegated the roles in this area and is responsible for the application of the policy and its public commitments, for ensuring progress in sustainability and for monitoring the strategy and practices concerning sustainability and the environment, as well as the progress that the Company is making in its hotel portfolio in terms of climate risks.\n\nLikewise, to reinforce the Company's commitment to sustainability and climate change, a **Sustainability Committee** was set up in June 2020, chaired and vice-chaired by two members of the Company's senior management and made up of different corporate and operational departments that are key to driving progress in this area. This Committee assumes a key essential role: to ensure the integration of sustainability at all levels of the organisation and make sure that our roadmap contributes to fulfilling the public commitments assumed in terms of ESG from a global, integrated perspective, and to address the main challenges of Agenda 2030.\n\nNine sessions were held in 2023, all incorporating information related to climate change, the environment or climate risk management, a topic that has been very much present at all the Committee's meetings.\n\nOn the other hand, the Company has strengthened its organisational structure in terms of sustainability, particularly in the fight against climate change, giving the Sustainability Department roles and responsibilities in relation to all (1) public commitments associated with the carbon footprint, (2) the promotion of the conclusions identified in our analysis of climate-related risks and improving our management by applying the recommendations of the *Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures* (TCFD), and (3) waste management and the drive towards a circular economy.\n\nFinally, the Sustainability Department has expanded its structure in two of the Company's key destinations, Mexico and the Dominican Republic, with the aim of becoming a benchmark in environmental and biodiversity issues.\n\nImage /page/35/Picture/20 description: The image shows the text 'SUSTAINABILITY TRAINING (HOURS PAX)' in green, followed by the number '1.3' in a larger, gray font.

BUSINESS MODEL**\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### CONTENTS **Integrating sustainability into remuneration models**\n\nOur short- and medium-term variable remuneration model includes a set of non-financial targets, including one related to sustainability. Meeting this target depends on the Company's position in the various internationally-recognised ESG indices. These indices assess environmental, social and governance areas, and each of these categories has sub-indicators and parameters used to evaluate a company's performance.\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023 At Meliá, we recognise that our participation and performance in the different rankings are a catalyst for continuous improvement, fostering a culture of sustainability and promoting responsible business practices that have a positive impact on the company and the destinations where we operate.\n\nIn terms of scope, the remuneration model is applicable both to the Company's senior management and to executives with corporate or business responsibilities and key profiles.\n\nOn the other hand, there are areas within the business units that are working on reducing energy and water consumption, setting targets to enhance their management and control, and ensuring the promotion of initiatives to reduce the carbon footprint and improve hotel facilities.\n\nImage /page/36/Picture/7 description: The image shows a panoramic view of a row of modern, white villas situated along a coastline. The villas are interspersed with palm trees and lush greenery, creating a tropical ambiance. A sandy beach is visible in front of some of the villas, while others appear to be built directly on a rocky outcrop that extends into the turquoise water. The sky is blue with scattered clouds, suggesting a sunny day. The overall scene evokes a sense of luxury and tranquility.\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n# TABLE OF CONTENTS **Economic - Financial Report**\n\n### ABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n## **Financial and business results**\n\n### **Global hotel business**\n\n| 1.

BUSINESS MODEL**\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n2023 was the first year of complete normality and the recovery of tourism, a year that went from good to better. The trend seen throughout the year in our hotels stands out for the gradual recovery of occupancy rates. Our leisure hotels are closer to pre-pandemic occupancy figures, with a higher margin in our urban hotels. Both rates, although still below the pre-Covid period year on year, show an upward trend in the main key destinations. This strong demand, together with the company's work to position itself increasingly towards the luxury sector, enabled a positive contribution of the qualitative RevPar. In general terms, customer demand shows increased lead time accompanied by cancellation figures that are already at pre-pandemic levels. In terms of outbound markets, we are pleased to note that our customers' mix of nationalities during the year was similar to the Company's historical records, indicative of our brands' value, our positioning in a global market and the good health of tourism.\n\nIn terms of segments, we would highlight the performance of our direct channel, Melia.com, which accounted for 46% of centralised sales during the year. The company's commitment to strengthening the direct channel and our digital tools has become key in the current environment, marked by constant transformation and evolution. In this regard, our *MeliáRewards* loyalty programme now has more than 15 million registered members and is celebrating its 30th anniversary in 2024. We are pleased to see that our direct channel's positive performance is accompanied by the excellent performance of our partners, such as the tour operators that are so important to the industry and to a global company as is Meliá Hotels International.\n\n### **Prospects at the beginning of 2024**\n\nThe start of 2024 looks positive, with demand continuing to show signs of strength and no sign of slowing down. Despite the increased anticipation of demand, the *last minute* component remains significant, therefore entailing current visibility focused on the short/medium term. It is noteworthy that *On the Books* bookings are continuing the positive trend, surpassing by double digits the figures for the same dates recorded in the previous year.\n\nIn short, the coming months will see a solid leisure and bleisure segment, accompanied by MICE and a calendar that promises good performance from major events, with an undoubted highlight being the Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\nHowever, the environment is not immune to the geopolitical and macroeconomic tensions. Recent conflicts around the world have not adversely affected our bookings, although a possible spread of hostilities to other countries could threaten the global supply chain, potentially leading to an increase in inflation and a possible extension of high interest rate monetary policies. These factors could affect demand, although for the time being the current strength encourages cautious optimism for the coming year.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **Hotel Business by region**\n\n#### **SPAIN Region**\n\n|                                                         | OWNED & LEASED<br>(millions of €) | 2023  | 2022  | Δ%     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------|-------|--------|\n| ABOUT THIS<br>REPORT                                    | Owned & Leased Hotels revenues    | 755.5 | 670.1 | 12.8%  |\n|                                                         | Owned                             | 252.5 | 222.6 | 13.4%  |\n| 1.

These good figures are accompanied by a record number of tourist arrivals in our country, standing at more than 84 million, with an increase in average expenditure per stay.\n\nIn relation to urban hotels, the start of the year was positive, recording a significant growth in revenues. This trend has continued throughout the year, with rates increasing and volumes gradually recovering. During the year as a whole, there was a balanced distribution by segment; tour operators, MICE and *Corporate* showed clear signs of recovery and strength. Major conferences that were held during the year in cities such as Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Seville and Palma de Mallorca contributed to this segment's good performance.\n\n2023 saw positive results in our leisure hotels, mainly driven by the recovery in the first quarter after the negative impact of the Omicron variant in the first months of 2022. In general terms, the mix of nationalities has returned to historical figures, with British and Spanish customer numbers being the fastest growing at our hotels. On the other hand, the increased booking lead time and lower cancellation rate, close to pre-pandemic figures, are also noteworthy. By segment, direct customer and tour operators account for the largest increases, while at the MICE and groups level we are already exceeding the figures for 2019, especially with the attraction of many groups at the beginning and end of the season. The summer season was particularly positive, with our Coastal and Balearic destinations performing the best. The good pace of demand and pleasant weather also made it possible to extend the season. Year-end was led by the positive performance of our hotels in the Canary Islands, which materialised the good prospects that were forecast. Special mention should be made for 2023 in terms of our products, with the launch of the ZEL brand developed together with tennis player Rafa Nadal, and the opening of Paradisus Salinas, which will become the second Paradisus hotel in Europe.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n### CONTENTS **Outlook for the start of 2024**\n\nIn Spain, forecasts for urban hotels are positive. We estimate growth in both rates and volumes right from the beginning of the year. By destination, Barcelona and Madrid are the cities with the highest growth, combining the good year-end for corporate customers and a significant MICE events calendar. In the case of Barcelona, the Gran Meliá Torre Melina will open in January, which together with the Palacio de Congresos will undoubtedly contribute a positive combination of bleisure, Corporate and MICE segments. Meliá Hotels International's commitment to innovation and positioning of its urban products will undoubtedly be significant in 2024 and the coming years.\n\n**2.

In other regions such as our Coastal hotels, groups confirmed for the start of the season allow for positive occupancy and rate forecasts. By segment, it is our Direct Channel that shows the strongest growth in revenues, and also contributes the largest increase in rates. It is worth highlighting the fact that some hotels that have historically closed in winter have not done so this year, a factor that adds to the plan to bring forward the opening of hotels in the Balearic Islands to the end of March for the second year in a row.\n\nImage /page/42/Picture/10 description: The image shows a modern, angular building with a distinctive design. The building is primarily white with horizontal bands of dark gray or black that run along the facade, accentuating the rows of windows. The building's shape is somewhat triangular, with one side rising to a sharp point. The name \"INNSIDE\" is visible near the top of the building. The building is situated next to a body of water, possibly a river or canal, with a stone embankment. There are tables and chairs with white umbrellas set up along the water's edge, suggesting an outdoor seating area. In the water, there are some inflatable pink flamingo pool floats. In the background, there are trees and a bridge, adding depth to the scene. The sky is blue with scattered white clouds, indicating a clear day.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **EMEA Region**\n\n| ABOUT THIS |\n|------------|\n| REPORT     |\n\n|  | 1.

Overall, the main bleisure destinations have had very good traction across all segments. In addition, on the dates of major events such as Wimbledon, the Rugby World Cup and top level concerts, the number of visitors has been very positive, generating demand in our hotels. The MICE segment has also performed well, with significant visitor numbers. Although some events were not held in 2023, mainly in Germany, overall the evolution is positive. One of the levers that maintains growth potential is the purely *Corporate* segment which, despite maintaining a positive evolution throughout the year, has not recovered its pre-pandemic volumes year on year. By area, performance by country year on year is as follows:\n\nIn Germany, the start of the year was marked by the different performance of cities in the north of the country more linked to the business customer and cities with a more bleisure component. In the first case, the lack of *Corporate* customers meant a lower base occupancy in hotels in the north, while cities with a bleisure component saw a better evolution in destinations such as Berlin and Hamburg. However, all segments show marked growth compared to 2022. The positive note is presented by the MICE events held, which led to an improvement in average prices on the days of the events, although a lower number of stays was noted.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, 2023 recorded a positive balance sheet, thanks to an improvement mainly in occupancy compared to 2022, accompanied by an increase in rates. The beginning of the year was marked by strikes and the macroeconomic situation, which affected demand in the domestic and European market. However, the positive note at the start of the year was the *Corporate* segment, showing resilience and sustaining demand. Our hotels in London saw positive year-on-year evolution thanks to a balanced contribution from all segments, with traction from international customers, benefiting from special events such as the Coronation of Charles III. Concerning our hotels in the north of the country, the MICE and *Corporate* segments had the best performance, along with the celebration of concerts and events such as Eurovision, with a large number of visitors.\n\nIn France, a positive year, with a remarkable increase in Revpar that exceeds figures for 2022 by double digits. Despite some negative events during the year, such as strikes and riots in the capital, almost all months saw improved figures compared to the previous year. By segment, tour operators performed well, mainly thanks to US customers, which have become the main nationality for our hotels in the centre. Regarding major events and the MICE segment, the evolution is positive, with Roland Garros and the Rugby World Cup generating additional demand. It is important to highlight the performance of the hotels converted to the Meliá Collection brand, which provides\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.

Especially in the summer season, the country, and in particular Rome, saw a significant increase in visitor numbers, mainly from the United States. As respects Milan, domestic, US and British customers allowed for an increase in rates, with the end of the year marked by the gradual return of Asian customers. As is recurrent in the city, events enabled the recovery of revenues following the renovation of the Meliá Milano, which was finished in June. Special mention should be made of the opening of a new property in the city at the end of the year, the Gran Meliá Milano Palazzo di Cordusio, an iconic hotel located on Piazza Cordusio, demonstrating the company's commitment to the luxury sector in major European cities.\n\n> 2023 in the region marks the continuation of our expansion in Albania. This year we opened two new hotels, with a further 13 to be opened, totalling more than 3,000 rooms together with the hotels already in operation. This expansion demonstrates the company's commitment to opening up new markets; it is already the leading hotel operator in the country.\n\n### **Outlook for the start of 2024**\n\nIn EMEA, Germany expects to record year-on-year growth thanks to the strong performance of the *Corporate* and MICE segments, which at the start of 2023 still showed room for improvement. With a much more solid base in these segments and significant growth in direct customers, the outlook is positive. In addition, some major sports events and concerts will generate demand which will be capitalised on through specific commercial strategies.\n\nIn the UK, trends are positive, although the start of the year is proving to be softer than expected, mainly in London hotels. This is mainly due to reduced demand from the *Corporate* segment and the slowdown in tour operators. Hotels in the north of the country are operating at a higher rate than in the same period in 2023, with a considerable drop in MICE but that is more than recovered with increases in the other segments.\n\nIn Italy, the good trend is expected to continue, with demand particularly strong in Milan. Thanks to a solid MICE events base, complemented by direct customer and tour operators, revenue is expected to increase compared to 2023. Regarding Rome, the start of the year is in line with the city's low season. In 2023 it was supported by some events that generated additional demand, which is not expected to be repeated in 2024.\n\nFrance maintains a good *On the Books* position with increases in RevPar across all hotels. In general, 2024 aims to begin with a less tense social climate than that experienced in 2023, without threats of new strikes or protests for the time being. Special mention should be made of the upcoming Paris 2024 Olympic Games, which will start in June. At the moment, bookings are limited, pending full control over the inventory of current bookings that the organisation and delegations are making. Overall, all segments are performing well, with increases in both volume and rates.\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **AMERICAS Region**\n\n| ABOUT THIS<br>REPORT |  |  |  |  |  |\n|----------------------|--|--|--|--|--|\n|                      |  |  |  |  |  |\n|                      |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n| 1.

However, during the third quarter, the country felt a slowdown in US demand for the destination. This demand shifted to European destinations, which is why this quarter recorded worse performance compared to 2022. In the fourth quarter, the pace of demand for the country recovered its good prospects, demonstrating that this occurrence is circumstantial, rather than structural. Indicative of this is the significant increase in air traffic, which has grown considerably compared to 2022. By segment, there is positive evolution across the board, with the MICE segment standing out as having the highest growth during the year.\n\nThe Dominican Republic as a destination has finished a good year in terms of tourist arrivals, surpassing the target of 10 million tourists per year, with the region's air connectivity standing out. In particular, the Canadian market has seen a 20% increase in air capacity over the previous year. In terms of segments, UK, Canadian and US customer tour operators led the year, with increases in rates. On the other hand, Direct Customer has played an important role in the rate increases, with demand for superior rooms also increasing. Finally, the MICE segment has performed well during the year, especially at Paradisus Palma Real, which has hosted major medical conferences.\n\nWith respect to the United States, the year, although positive overall, showed different evolution in the two cities in which we are present. On the one hand, in New York, 2023 presents the highest production to date since opening, demonstrating a solid post-pandemic recovery in both *Corporate* and Leisure customers, with room for leeway in prices compared to other establishments in the area, with this being one of the levers that show potential. In the case of Orlando, after a strong start to the year, the city has seen a final quarter with softer domestic demand following 2022, a year that benefited greatly from ramp-up demand.\n\n41\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n### CONTENTS **Outlook for the start of 2024**\n\nNorth & South America: In Mexico, the strategy for the beginning of the year is to maintain a good base occupancy, allowing for an increase in rates for *last minute* bookings, which prevail among local customers. Regarding the segments, all show a good evolution in terms of occupancy and rate maintenance. In the case of MICE, the year will be challenging as 2023 was particularly positive, with many companies holding large and small events for their employees and customers.\n\n**2. BUSINESS MODEL**\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, this first quarter is presented with an *On the Books* position for all our hotels higher than 2023. The start of the year stands out for the high degree of air connectivity, which allows us to forecast a strong start to the year in terms of occupancy and also allows for an increase in rates. The country continues to be one of the main destinations in the Caribbean for the Canadian market, and thanks to the collaboration with our main partners, it allows us to lay the foundations in occupancy required to improve rates at the destination. Regarding the European market, the presence of German, Spanish and French customers also supplements the demand. By segment, direct customers and tour operators show increases in volumes and rates. With regard to the MICE segment, good prospects were recorded in all hotels, with Paradisus Palma Real once again accounting for the majority of revenues from this segment.\n\nThe United States shows good prospects in New York, where leisure customers continue to show month-on-month increases, coupled with large group bookings for January and February. For the time being, demand in the city is expected to be strong and allow for growth in RevPar. In the case of Orlando, January and February show a drop in rates due to the strategy taken to recover occupancy, which is below expectations. March is traditionally a month of high demand in the city, so it is expected that the rate of bookings will recover from then.\n\nImage /page/48/Picture/11 description: A picturesque outdoor swimming pool is captured on a sunny day, framed by lush greenery and a clear blue sky.

In 2023, the region's recovery was notable and although it has not recovered pre-pandemic metrics, it is laying a solid foundation on which to build growth. By country, China started to recover from the beginning of the year, with the turnaround starting with the Chinese New Year. Year on year, an increase in Revpar was recorded thanks to the recovery of part of the lost occupancy, but more significantly, due to the increase in rates. By segment, all segments show solid recovery, combining leisure demand, city events and *Corporate* customers. It should be noted that for the moment the demand is mainly local and from neighbouring countries. International air connectivity figures remain well below 2019, both in terms of inbound tourists and outbound nationals. In 2024, the major airline associations plan to increase air capacity gradually throughout the year.\n\nWith respect to Southeast Asia, in general, the easing of entry conditions to some destinations has favoured regional demand. Destinations such as Bali have recorded a year of growth in volume and increased rates, in which air connectivity has been key. The return of direct flights to major destinations generates additional demand. In the case of Thailand, tourists are primarily Asian and local, with other nationalities being less relevant at the moment. In terms of segments, the participation of tour operators stands out, increasing revenues while creating brand presence among local and international customers. In destinations such as Koh Samui, the performance of groups and events was also positive. In the case of our hotels operated in Vietnam, demand has mainly been focused on the domestic and nearby international markets (Korea and Australia). Chinese travellers have not recovered their pre-pandemic volumes year on year due to competition from other destinations and the easing of entry conditions through visa waivers. In terms of segments, performance varies from city to city. Hanoi, for example, has performed well in MICE and Corporate, while other destinations are more dependent on tour operators.\n\n### **Outlook for the start of 2024**\n\nIn the Asia region, following the clear turnaround after the pandemic, 2024 should be a year of consolidation and growth in the region. One of the main levers with growth potential lies in international air connectivity, which remains below pre-pandemic capacity, especially in the case of China. The expected gradual increase in international air capacity should be a catalyst for demand in the region from tourist arrivals, as local travellers go abroad, feeding back into demand in other regions. In the case of China, the outlook indicates growth in revenues due to tour operators and the MICE segment, with both showing double-digit growth compared to 2023. In the case of Southeast Asia, demand is generally solid. In destinations such as Bali, the strategy is focused on growth via rates, as there is more readiness for experiences. In Thailand, the region expects to benefit from the growth in Chinese demand, generating a higher volume of *last minute* demand. The segments benefiting the most are direct customers and tour operators, controlling the volume of inventory for tour operators. In the case of Vietnam, the start of the year shows On the Books bookings higher than in 2023; in destinations such as Phu Quoc, the contribution of customers from the Czech Republic stands out. Regarding destinations with a higher number of events such as Hanoi, MICE demand remains solid.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **CUBA Region**\n\n|                   | OWNED & LEASED (millions of €) | 2023 | 2022 | Δ%   |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| ABOUT THIS REPORT | Owned & Leased Hotels revenues | N.A. | N.A. | N.A. |\n|                   | Owned                          |      |      |      |\n|                   | Leased                         |      |      |      |\n|                   | Of which Rooms Revenues        | N.A. | N.A. | N.A. |\n| 1.

In general, visitor arrivals from the major foreign outbound markets grew, with diversification and growth in air capacity contributing positively. The Canadian market continues to lead the region, with more than 50% increase over 2022. By segment, tour operators remain the main source of stays generasituation and the consequent devaluation of the Cuban peso.\n\nImage /page/52/Picture/4 description: The image shows the text \"2.

The negative note this year was the domestic market, which saw a large reduction in stays in the region. The main reason is the country's economic **Outlook for the start of 2024** In Cuba, the beginning of the year shows good prospects thanks to increased booking lead time, resulting in a better *On the Books* position. The international market continues to lead the way, with major markets such as Russia, Germany, Argentina and France having a good rate of bookings. With respect to the Canadian market, it continues to lead the destination despite a slight decline in On the Books bookings compared to the previous year, which is compensated by a higher average rate. The opening of the Meliá Trinidad Península, the first 5-star hotel at the destination, stands out in this period. Another highlight is the opening of the Sol Turquesa Beach, located in Holguín.\n\nImage /page/52/Picture/10 description: A serene outdoor scene features a large, inviting swimming pool in the foreground, its turquoise water reflecting the clear blue sky above. The pool's surface is subtly textured with the pattern of the tiles beneath. Beyond the pool, a row of white cabanas with draped curtains offers shaded relaxation areas, each furnished with blue lounge chairs. Tall palm trees sway gently in the background, adding a tropical ambiance to the setting. To the right, a building with a light pink facade and a red-tiled roof can be seen, suggesting a resort or hotel. The overall composition evokes a sense of tranquility and leisure.\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **Value for our shareholders**\n\n### **Shareholding Distribution**\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, our shareholding is structured as follows:\n\n**SHAREHOLDING STRUCTURE**\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n|  |                                      | NO.

This policy is compatible with the top priority given to maintaining a level of equity that guarantees investments for the Company's future growth and ensures value creation.\n\nAfter 2023, a year of normal operations throughout the year and following the suspension of dividend distributions in recent years to strengthen the balance sheet, the Board of Directors resolved on 29 February 2024 to propose to the Annual General Shareholders Meeting a resumption of dividend distributions against FY 2023.\n\n## **Stock Market Evolution**\n\nDuring 2023, Meliá Hotels International shares have recorded a 30.2% increase in value, while the IBEX-35 has appreciated by 22.8%. The stock's performance was particularly positive in the first half of the year, after fears of the onset of a recession at the beginning of 2023 dissipated. The strength of demand and the good prospects for the different seasons that have materialised throughout the year have met market expectations. On the other hand, to contain the increase in inflation, the European Central Bank and the FED in the United States have raised interest rates throughout the year. In the final stretch of the year, however, stock markets in general rose across the board, partly on the back of expectations of the end of the restrictive cycle and the rising interest rates.\n\n**STOCK MARKET EVOLUTION**\n\nImage /page/53/Figure/14 description: The image is a combination line and bar graph.

GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe following changes have taken place in the Board's specialised committees:\n\n• Appointment of Ms. Montserrat Trapé Viladomat (Independent External) as a member of the Appointments, Remuneration and Sustainability Committee. • Appointment of Ms. Cristina Aldamiz-Echevarría González de Durana (In-\n\ndependent External) as member of the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\n### **Diversity**\n\nBoth the Appointments, Remuneration and Sustainability Committee and the Board are aware of the 40% target established in the CNMV's Good Governance Code of Listed Companies and the Diversity Directive. Consequently, they underscore their determination to include more women on the Board in future selection processes.\n\nIn this regard, since 2021 the Board of Directors of Meliá Hotels International has comprised four (4) female directors, out of a total of eleven (11) members, representing 36.36% women on the Board. Moreover, the specialised Board Committees have a composition of more than 40% women (the Audit and Compliance Committee is made up of 60% women and the Appointments, Remuneration and Sustainability Committee, 40%).\n\nFurthermore, in June, the Board of Directors approved a **new** *Diversity Policy*, setting new and more ambitious targets in this area. The Policy establishes the principles, guidelines and main lines of action on diversity and inclusion that will govern the Company's strategy, ensuring equal opportunities and non-discrimination on grounds of race, colour, sexual orientation, age, gender, culture, work, disability, ideology, religion, or any other characteristics, with diversity and inclusion defended as values to be protected and consolidated in the workplace. In addition, the *Director Selection Policy* was amended in June 2023, updating the Board's gender diversity target: **40% women by 2024.**\n\n#### **Evaluation of the Board of Directors**\n\nGRI: 2-18\n\nThe Board of Directors annually evaluates the functioning and composition of the Board itself and its committees, as well as the Company's chief executive. The Appointments, Remuneration and Sustainability Committee is responsible for approving and initiating this process. The report with the results of the 2023 evaluation will be presented to the Board of Directors in the first quarter of the following financial year (2024), when the corresponding action plan, if any, will be discussed and approved.\n\nIn connection with Recommendation 36 of the Good Governance Code of Listed Companies, which refers to the assistance of an external consultant in the Board evaluation process, the Appointments, Remuneration and Sustainability Committee was advised in 2022 by the consultancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers in the review of the assessment questionnaires for the Board of Directors and the chief executive.\n\nAs a result of the 2022 self-assessment process, during 2023 the Board has had a training plan in place for new technologies (artificial intelligence), strategy and cybersecurity. The selection of the training provider was led by the Appointments, Remuneration and Sustainability Committee as part of the process to monitor the Board evaluation.\n\n### **Competency matrix**\n\nGRI: 2-17\n\nDuring 2023, the competency matrix has continued to be used as a tool for the selection and re-election, where applicable, of Directors, as set out in the *Director Selection Policy*, as well as in the preparation of the Board's training plan.\n\n#### **Conflicts of interest**\n\nGRI: 2-15\n\nThe Honorary Chairman of the Board (Gabriel Escarrer Juliá), the Chairman and CEO (Gabriel Escarrer Jaume), as well as the Directors whose re-election or appointment has been submitted for approval by the AGM, have abstained\n\n52\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Short-term variable remuneration**\n\n**Remuneration in kind and other benefits** \n\n#### TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.

We also follow the remuneration studies prepared by external consultants.\n\nIn 2021, the *Board Remuneration Policy* for 2022 to 2024 was approved to incorporate the latest recommendations of the Good Governance Code of Listed Companies and the new requirements resulting from the latest reform to the Spanish Companies Act regarding long-term shareholder involvement.\n\nThe remuneration of the Directors in their capacity as such consists of:\n\n- **Fixed annual allowance** for carrying out their supervisory and joint decision-making roles.\n- **Per diems** for attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors and Committees of which they are members.\n\nIn addition to the above, the Chairman of the Board and the CEO's remuneration package includes:\n\n- Fixed annual remuneration.\n- Short-term variable remuneration.\n- Long-term variable remuneration.\n- Remuneration in kind and other benefits.\n\n### **REMUNERATION STRUCTURE OF THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO**\n\nImage /page/59/Figure/16 description: The image shows two diagrams illustrating director remuneration systems.

The title of the image is \"DIRECTOR REMUNERATION SYSTEM\".\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs part of this remuneration structure and in compliance with the Spanish Companies Act, the Board of Directors submitted for approval by the 2022 Annual General Meeting the long-term remuneration system, partially indexed to the Company's share price, for the Executive Director, leadership and other professionals of the Group.\n\nmuneration Report, which will be submitted for approval by the 2024 AGM.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.

GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe transversal management of intangibles is becoming increasingly important due to new regulatory environments and the interest of investors, customers and consumers etc., with an increased focus on transparency and rigour in non-financial reporting.\n\nThe European Commission presented on 23 February 2022 a proposal for a Directive on corporate sustainability due diligence. The proposal aims to promote sustainable and responsible business behaviour throughout the value chain. It requires companies to play a key role in building a sustainable economy and society, requiring them, where necessary, to prevent, contain or mitigate the adverse effects of their business activity on human rights and the environment. This issue is not only becoming increasingly important in the regulatory environment, but also in our stakeholder materiality matrix, the issue of labour and human rights protection is positioned in the TOP 5.\n\nThe new regulation sets new lines of work, consequently, we assume universal pillars, such as the Principles of the Global Compact - an entity of which we have been a member since 2009 - and United Nations Human Rights, and we apply international frameworks in the business sphere: the International Bill of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Fundamental Principles of the ILO, the Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy, as well as other specific conventions concerning the tourism industry.\n\nUsing the documents available from the European Commission, the Global Compact good practices and the recently published CSRD, the Group is working to make our process for identifying, preventing, mitigating and taking accountability for actual and potential negative effects on people and the environment ever more robust. We are driving this commitment throughout our value chain, including all kinds of suppliers, who provide a service in line with our customers' expectations.\n\nAt Meliá Hotels International, we have been working for years to consolidate our human rights governance and management system, driven by the publication of the global *Human Rights Policy*, approved by the Board of Directors in July 2018.\n\nIt is also worth highlighting the launch of our first Human Rights **Self-Assessment** in 2019, which was updated in 2022. The due diligence process is aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\n### **Human Rights control and management system**\n\nRespect for human rights, in line with international regulations, is inseparable from our way of understanding hotel management and our values as a family-founded company.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **A LOOK BACK AT 17 YEARS OF PROGRESS**\n\nImage /page/65/Figure/3 description: This image is a timeline of events. Starting on the left, the first event is in 2006, the ECPAT Code of Conduct for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation in Travel and Tourism. In 2008, the Principles of the Global Compact. In 2011, the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism. In 2013, Social dialogue and labour rights. In 2015, The Paris Agreement. In 2019, Prevention of sexual harassment. In 2021, UNESCO Sustainable Travel Pledge. In 2022, Commitment letter to the G20 countries to accelerate the Paris commitments.\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nGiven the Company's growth and the opening of new markets and countries, the Company has designed a risk assessment model by country under ESG criteria, where it may potentially be conducting negotiations but to date has no hotels operating under any management system. This assessment evaluates different dimensions, including areas related to the degree of defence or violation of human rights.\n\nOn the other hand, new hotel incorporations include in their contractual documentation a specific clause to ensure the integration of ESG criteria in the future of the relationship and compliance with Meliá Hotels International's ethical management system.\n\nWe translate our commitment to human rights into practice and are working to ensure their integration throughout the value chain. All our suppliers must sign our *Supplier Code of Ethics*, assuming our ethical commitments to respect their own people and to protect human rights. Likewise, they actively undertake to promote and respect the principles of the UN Global Compact on labour and human rights in their business. In this regard, we have the power to at any time verify that the obligations assumed in this clause are being met. While our contract with the supplier is in force, we may also request documentation to demonstrate that the supplier is complying with the commitments set out in the clause and, in the case of non-compliance, initiate termination of the contract, without prejudice to any other appropriate compensatory actions.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### **A robust governance model**\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, drafted by representatives with different legal and cultural backgrounds from all regions of the world, represents the first universal recognition of the basic rights and fundamental freedoms inherent to all human beings, inalienable and applicable in equal measure to all people, regardless of our nationality, place of residence, gender, national or ethnic origin, skin colour, religion, language or any other condition.\n\nThis key principle requires the business world to respect human rights in its activities and operations, avoiding negative impacts or violations and, at the same time, promoting actions that contribute positively to the targets set in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nThe Company has different tools, channels and control systems in place, available to both its external stakeholders and its employees, to respond forcefully to any violation of human rights and minimize any impacts that may occur in any country in which it has presence and operates, whatever the nature may be: general, labour or linked to corruption.\n\n### **Risks arising from our activity**\n\nSince 2021, our Global Risk Map has included **potential impacts on human rights protection** as a specific risk since we operate in 14 countries in which rights may not be fully guaranteed or there may be threats of systematic violations. This risk specifically analyses breach of labour rights, staff not covered by a Collective Agreement, human trafficking, respect for the environment, slavery, discrimination, harassment, bullying and mobbing, taking into account the level of probability and impact.\n\nWe monitor this model each year to compile all the behaviours that could threaten the dignity, equality, freedom, health or safety of people, as well as impacts on the environment and issues related to corruption. As part of our Crime Prevention and Detection Protocol, we have identified 23 criminal offenses, 8 of them associated with impacts on human rights, related to be-\n\n### **Governance**\n\nThe various governing bodies assume the functions and powers associated with this area.\n\n### Board of Directors Appointments, Remuneration\n& Sustainability Committee Auditing & Compliance Committee Executive Committee (SET) Sustainability Committee Ethics Committee\n\nCode of Ethics Supplier Code of Ethics Corporate Policies **Auditing & Compliance Committee** Regulatory body that strengthens the general framework defined in our Human Rights Policy.\n\n> Equality Plan Dhaka Principles\n\n**Management tools**\n\nocused on the integration, protection and resolution of incidents in this area.\n\n### Code of Ethics Oice\n\nComplaints Channel\n\nCrime Prevention Model\n\nGlobal Risk Map & ESG\n\nSupply Chain Due\nDiligence\n\nControl Self-Assessment\n(CSA) Human Rights\n\nInternal Audits\n\nCrime Prevention Model\n\nCollective Bargaining Agreements\n\nWorks Councils\n\nOccupational Health & Safety Committee\n\nhaviours that could breach workers' rights, possible environmental impacts and behaviours linked to corruption.\n\nThe analysis conducted with the participation of the 242 hotels involved, as well as the management of the 28 complaints received, leads us to confirm that our management system operates correctly, with no risk situations having been identified in any of the areas covered by the exercise, and concluding that there is a high level of protection and low probability of situations involving a breach of human rights.\n\n60\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\nSince 2020, we have identified groups whose rights, mainly labour related, are not guaranteed or are systematically violated in countries in which we operate and where there could be a risk, taking as a reference the Global Labour Rights Index of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) and Human Rights Watch.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.

Each year our Internal Audit and Occupational Health teams check the correct implementation of these systems and occupational health and safety protocols.\n\nOn our path of continuous improvement and anticipation of potential risks, we periodically verify our internal control systems. Lessons learned and opportunities for improvement are integrated into the Company's management so our performance can be seen by our stakeholders in a transparent, rigorous manner.\n\nImage /page/67/Figure/13 description: The image shows three donut charts with labels above them. The first chart is labeled \"Labor Practices\" and has values of 6.2% and 98.4%. The second chart is labeled \"Environmental Practices\" and has values of 11.2% and 83.1%. The third chart is labeled \"Anti-corruption Practices\" and has values of 5.4% and 97.5%.\n\n**LEVEL OF PROTECTION AND PROBABILITY OF BREACH**\n\n% Degree of protection % Probability of violation\n\n### **Human rights self-assessment**\n\nThree years after our first self-assessment, in 2022 we reviewed and updated our Control Self-Assessment (CSA) to identify new risks and criteria in this area in our operations. This new document incorporated the highest standards and added the Dhaka Principles of Responsible Recruitment and the Modern Slavery Act (UK) guidelines to the approaches already covered in our first self-assessment, mentioned above. With the aim of going further in our requirements, when updating the self-assessment we also incorporated new vulnerable groups, such as migrant workers, women discriminated against on the basis of gender, women who are victims of violence, children, indigenous communities, the unemployed, refugees and LGTBIQ+ groups.\n\nWith this update, we covered different areas relating to labour rights, such as staff selection, remuneration and recruitment, occupational health and the working environment, social dialogue, the supply chain, the environment, recognised as a commitment in our policy, and anti-corruption. In each of them, we measured the perception of protection and the probability of breach of these rights in the business units, as well as management's management capacity, aware of the potential negative impact of a possible breach on our business.\n\nGiven the importance of this issue and our international presence, 242 hotels were invited to participate in 2022 across 26 countries (84% of the active owned, leased and managed portfolio), with the exception of Cuba, China and other hotels that were not operational during the period). All the hotels responded to the questionnaire, giving us a global vision of the level of management, control and assurance that exists in our portfolio.\n\nThe exercise included one hundred questions and was conceptualised from an integrated view of our public commitments. It covered the Company's different policies in areas related to: human rights, anti-corruption, climate change and the environment, procurement and contracting of services, human resources, occupational health and safety, and sustainability. To supplement the process, we analysed other areas with additional specific questions related to harassment, impact on communities, discrimination, labour rights, free movement, ethics, right to privacy and the fight against child labour.\n\n61\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **SELF-ASSESSMENT**\n\nImage /page/68/Figure/3 description: This image shows a world map with hotel locations and a pie chart.

Of the 8 complaints received this year through this channel, all have been related to different areas relating to human rights at 7 hotels. None of the complaints received were linked to breaches of the rights of indigenous peoples or operations that involved child labour. 100% of complaints were analysed, investigated and closed during 2023.\n\n### **2024 Challenges**\n\nThe Company is committed to launching a new Control Self-Assessment (CSA) during the first half of 2024, taking into account all the aspects incorporated in the new corporate sustainability due diligence directive: to protect the environment and human rights.\n\nWe will strengthen our teams' knowledge in this area with specific training, and a particular focus on the highest risk destinations, as well as updating our internal website with specific content on human rights.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n# CONTENTS **Listening to our stakeholders**GRI: 2-29; 3-1; 3-2; 3-3; 207-3\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### **Committed to listening**\n\nGRI: 2-29\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023 **2.** BUSINESS MODEL **3.

For this reason, we include all our relevant stakeholders as well as the subgroups identified in our mapping. It is important to highlight the increase in average participation we achieved in our last exercise, with a response rate of 27% compared to 25% in 2019.\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n#### **3.

This approach has enabled us to identify where the main differences lie between our performance and our stakeholders' views, with the aim of using this learning, coming about from dialogue, and integrating it into our sustainability strategy.\n\nImage /page/71/Figure/13 description: This image is a stakeholder map. The map is divided into three concentric circles labeled \"Internal (Priority 1)\", \"Environment (Priority 2)\", and \"Context (Priority 3)\". The stakeholders are listed around the circles. The stakeholders are Customers, which include B2C (individuals), B2B (corporate), Travel agents, and Intermediaries, OTAs and TOs. Suppliers include Of products and Of services. Shareholders & Investors include Institutional investors, Minority shareholders, Vote advisers, Financial entities, Financial analysts, Rating agencies, and Sustainability analysts. Owners & Partners include Asset owners and Partners - Joint Ventures. Employees include Employees. Industry & Competitors include Regulatory bodies, Tourism industry (competitors), Private business associations or organisations, Public-private organisations, and Lobbies. Public Administration includes National, regional or local administrations, Public entities, and Public-private organisations. The Media is also listed as a stakeholder.

They all have their own channels and spaces for dialogue, which enriches the discussion to ensure that the framework of material issues incorporated by the Group into its materiality analyses is complete, with the premise of incorporating the issues and concerns of the different stakeholders.\n\nThe external analysis also considered the standards and criteria established under international frameworks, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and specific standards for the hotel sector, as well as the main global trends and regulations in the field of sustainability and the industry.\n\n### **Evaluation of the issues identified**\n\nThe materiality survey incorporated the 19 selected material issues and the different internal and external stakeholder groups and subgroups in order to obtain results from an internal perspective (employees, owners, partners, shareholders and investors) and an external perspective (customers, suppliers, industry and competitors, public authorities, media and society), which would enrich the information gathered.\n\n#### **Prioritisation of issues and validation**\n\nIn line with the specific weight given to each stakeholder group, we prioritised the issues in order of relevance. This exercise was subsequently submitted to the Company's Executive Committee and the Appointments, Remuneration and Sustainability Committee, with delegated sustainability functions, for validation.\n\nThe results of the process help us obtain a matrix and catalogue the material issues according to their relevance, the results and importance of the issues, differentiating the issues under three scales, critical, high and medium.\n\nImage /page/72/Figure/11 description: The image shows information about sources used, surveys, and outlooks. Under the title \"SOURCES USED\" are six numbered items: 1) Issued evaluated by ESG analysts and industry investors, 2) GRI and SASB universal and industry reporting standards, 3) Industry analyses, 4) Requirements under law 11/2018 on non-financial information and diversity, 5) WEF Global Risk Report 2021, and 6) 2030 Agenda. The image also states that 1,184 surveys were carried out with 8 stakeholders / 20 subgroups. There are 12 countries participating in the listening. Under the title \"INTERNAL OUTLOOK\" it states that there are 224 employees. Under the title \"EXTERNAL OUTLOOK\" it states that there are 960 people. The image also lists the following: Owners and partners, Shareholders and investors, Customers, Suppliers, Industry and competitors, The media, and Society.\n\n#### **MATERIALITY MATRIX**\n\nImage /page/72/Figure/13 description: The image is a scatter plot with two axes labeled \"EXTERNAL OUTLOOK\" and \"INTERNAL OUTLOOK\". There are several data points plotted on the graph, each represented by a circle and a label. The data points are colored green, red, or light-blue, which are labeled as \"Medium\", \"High\", and \"Critical\" respectively. The data points and their labels are as follows: \"Responsible supply chain\" (green), \"Biodiversity management\" (green), \"Diversity, equality and inclusion\" (green), \"Positive impact on destinations\" (red), \"Responsible water management\" (red), \"Climate action\" (red), \"Waste management and circular economy\" (red), \"Energy efficiency\" (red), \"Trust & Reputation\" (red), \"Sustainable business model\" (red), \"Commitment to employees\" (red), \"Training and development\" (red), \"Regulatory Environment\" (red), \"Digital transformation & Culture of innovation\" (light-blue), \"Protection of human and labour rights\" (light-blue), \"Business ethics, integrity and transparency\" (light-blue), \"Cybersecurity & data protection\" (light-blue), \"Safety, health and well-being of employees and customers\" (light-blue), and \"Customer experience\" (light-blue).\n\n#### **MATERIALITY ANALYSIS PROCESS**\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe chart shows that the most relevant area is governance, with cybersecurity, data protection, business ethics and labour and human rights protection identified as the most relevant areas. There is considerable consensus among external and internal stakeholders on the importance of these issues.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n#### **3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nIt is worth mentioning that in its first strategic sustainability plan, designed in 2008, the Company promoted the governance dimension as a fundamental pillar to ensure a solid governance model, integrated into the business model, so a culture of ESG risk management based on a long-term view prevails.\n\nThe issues associated with the social dimension are the next most important block, taking into account the impact on the different external and internal stakeholders of many of the issues assessed.\n\nWe are aware that the road is long and there is still a long way to go. That is why we have redoubled our efforts to close the gap on the issues that showed a lower level of perception.\n\n### **2024 Commitment**\n\nDuring the first half of the year, we will update our materiality exercise, including the recommendations of the new European Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), incorporating the double materiality perspective, as well as the materiality assessment guidelines set out by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) and the ESRS.\n\nIn this study, we will assess the impact of the company's business activities on stakeholders, society, human rights and the environment, as well as the impact on the company itself from the point of view of the financial impact of each of the risks and opportunities assessed.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n# CONTENTS **Ethics and integrity**\n\n#### ABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nTABLE OF\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nMeliá Hotels International continues with its firm commitment to promoting a more responsible, ethical and transparent tourism industry. Under these principles, we are committed to offering a value proposition that allows us to build long-term relationships of trust and mutual benefit with all our stakeholders and society as a whole, while ensuring the preservation of the environment for future generations.\n\nManaging the business under the premise of ethics, integrity and transparency is a priority for all of us at Meliá Hotels International. We believe that ethical and responsible behaviour reinforces our value proposition in order to convey the trust that our stakeholders place in us.\n\nFurthermore, working with conviction on these areas contributes to ensuring a responsible, solid and strong business model that we aspire to build day by day. We understand integrity as a guiding principle of our strategy and, therefore, of our operations. Consequently, we are committed to always meeting the highest and most demanding standards of business behaviour.\n\nAt Meliá, we live business ethics in our day-to-day work. This is expressed through our corporate values, principles of action, codes of conduct and whistleblowing and dialogue mechanisms which, taken as a whole, define our organisation's operating culture. We are working to ensure that these approaches go beyond mere regulatory compliance, aspiring to promote a culture that encourages exemplary behaviour from all our collaborators and fostering a sense of shared responsibility among all of us at the Company.\n\nFrom the highest levels of its leadership, Meliá promotes continuous work focused on encouraging and facilitating our teams' ethical conduct and behaviour. This commitment is made possible by having a strong, consistent and comprehensive set of rules and regulations on the fight against corruption, fraud, money laundering and respect for human rights, as well as direct, transparent and honest dialogue with our stakeholders. Providing a common, coherent and consistent framework. We also have transparent, public and reliable whistleblowing mechanisms in place, which help to ensure that any possible cases of non-compliance with our ethical principles are dealt with appropriately.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **Code of Ethics**\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe *Code of Ethics* is the cornerstone of our governance model and incorporates all the principles and public commitments that we assume as a Company, as well as a set of guidelines that organise and give meaning to our culture and values.\n\nOur commitment is to consolidate a model of responsible hotel management committed to the common good. Consequently, the Code of Ethics includes the main standards and models of business behaviour and industry conduct of reference throughout the world.\n\nAmong our commitments, it is worth highlighting those that determine how we do business:\n\n- To comply with applicable legislation and regulatory obligations in Spain and at an international level.\n- To act rigorously and forcefully against any practice involving corruption, fraud or bribery.\n\nThe Code of Ethics guides the behaviour of all our executives, middle management, employees and suppliers, laying the foundations for ensuring alignment among all of the Company's internal policies, rules, processes and procedures. It is the compass that guides us in our relations with our stakeholders, based on ethics and compliance with the commitments we have assumed with them.\n\nAll our employees must accept and sign our Code of Ethics.

Its mission is to be an instrument of cohesion for the principles and values that the Company trusts are shared by all its suppliers, besides complying with applicable legislation, internalising and applying it with the conviction and peace of mind that comes from doing the right thing.\n\nOur suppliers are any company, corporation, entity or individual, including their employees, subcontractors, agents and other third-party representatives, that enters into a business relationship for the sale of goods or provision of services with any Meliá Hotels International Group company. The Code provides a common, coherent and consistent framework for all our stakeholders.\n\n#### **2.** BUSINESS **GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY 4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST Professional ethics Human rights and the eradication Safety, health and hygiene at work Product quality and service Protection of the environment Protection of information **SUPPLIER CODE OF ETHICS**\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nIn the supplier registration process, the contract includes a specific obligation to sign this Code or demonstrate the alignment of their Code, as well as a specific Sustainability Clause for the stakeholder group.\n\nof child labour\n\nAll our suppliers have available to them a specific whistleblowing channel through which they can report any conduct contrary to this Code.

GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nResponsible for providing guidance in the interpretation and application of the Code of Ethics, this is an advisory body for resolving any issues, questions or concerns that may arise in the day-to-day business of the organisation. During 2023, several working meetings have been held between the executives that comprise it: Sustainability, Corporate Governance, Organisation & Compensation and Risk Control and Compliance, with the aim of promoting and ensuring awareness of this office and its roles and responsibilities within the organisation. It has also ensured a swift response to all questions and queries that are reported to an email address set up for this purpose.\n\nDuring the coming year, 2024, it will continue to review the current Code of Ethics, as well as the Supplier Code of Ethics, to propose an update to the Company's governing bodies.\n\n### **Whistleblowing Channels**\n\nThe aim of the whistleblowing channels is to facilitate the reporting of any behaviour, action or event that could constitute a breach or violation of the Code of Ethics, the internal rules, laws or external regulations. It is a fundamental tool for ensuring compliance with the company's criminal compliance management system.\n\nIn order to comply with the provisions of European Directive 2019/1937 on the protection of persons who report breaches of EU law, as well as its transposition in Spain in Act 2/2023 regulating the protection of persons who report breaches of regulations and the fight against corruption, Meliá Hotels International has developed its *Whistleblowing Channel Policy*, approved by the Board of Directors in June 2023, in line with the provisions of our Code of Ethics and the Company's principles and commitments regarding the whistleblowing channels set up.\n\nThe management system at all times guarantees the confidentiality and impartiality of the process, as well as the absence of reprisals of any nature. Moreover, it reinforces the figure of a manager who carries out their work in an objective, independent and autonomous manner within the organisation, as well as establishing guarantees for the protection of informants or whistleblowers, guaranteeing confidentiality and expressly prohibiting reprisals,\n\nImage /page/77/Figure/17 description: The image shows a diagram that describes the mission and description of the Code of Ethics Office, Complaints Channel, and Ethics Committee. The Code of Ethics Office acts as a coordinating committee for all activities that take place regarding the Code of Ethics. It is a channelling body which represents all the areas involved in the monitoring, implementation and operation of the Code. The Code of Ethics Office interprets and resolves doubts, makes the required updates, provides support to the areas, and provides permanent advice. The Complaints Channel is the most important channel for issues and complaints related to compliance with the Code of Ethics, applicable law, issues related to regulatory non-compliance or situations or events that may require the attention of senior management. The Complaints Channel guarantees objectivity and the confidentiality of complaints, which are received and stored by an independent third party. The complaints go directly to the Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Compliance Officer. The Ethics Committee is an independent collegiate body entrusted with managing and resolving complaints. The Ethics Committee ensures the correct implementation and operation of the Complaints Channel, manages all complaints in line with the procedure defined, responding to all the parties involved and managing any corrective measures, guarantees confidentiality, and analyses complaints, classifying them by relevance and type, and reporting periodically to the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nincluding threats and/or attempts at reprisals, and enabling anonymous complaints, where applicable.\n\nThe commitment is also assumed to periodically review the processes and systems associated with the whistleblowing channel and, if necessary, adapt them as required. On the other hand, it reinforces the need to provide clear and accessible information on how they work and to raise awareness of their use. To this end, the Company has established in its annual training plan the requirement to run a training course on the Code of Ethics & Compliance, including a specific part that incorporates information on the use of the channel, the nature or type of complaints, their processing and the process and follow-up of the same.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\nThere is a *specific whistleblowing channel regulation* governing its operation, which has been updated and approved by the Audit and Compliance Committee. In addition to specifying the situations or irregularities that can be reported, this document also establishes the procedure for managing the complaints and the measures in place to protect whistleblowers, such as confidentiality and the prohibition of reprisals.\n\n### **Ethics Committee**\n\nThis is a collegiate and **independent** body whose main function is to ensure the proper management of the complaints reported. The *Compliance Officer* reports periodically to the Audit and Compliance Committee on areas relating to the whistleblowing channel, as they report directly to this Committee. In addition, the *Chief Legal & Compliance Officer*, head of the Legal & Compliance area and member of the Executive Committee, is also the Secretary of the Audit and Compliance Committee, and attends all the meetings held.\n\nAs indicated in the Whistleblowing Channel Policy, the *Compliance Officer* (head of the Risk Control & Compliance department) acts as Secretary of the Ethics Committee. This body has delegated to the *Compliance Officer* the powers to manage the channel and process the investigation files until they are resolved or closed. The average time between the investigation and the resolution of admissible communications was 35 days for communications sent by employees and 31 days for those sent by third parties.\n\nThe *Ethics Committee has its own Regulation* governing its operation, which was also reviewed, updated and approved by the Audit and Compliance Committee in June 2023. All information relating to these control and management bodies is available on the Company's intranet to ensure the greatest possible awareness and dissemination.\n\n**PROCESSING OF COMPLAINTS**\n\nImage /page/78/Figure/8 description: The image shows a diagram of the process for submitting a complaint. The first step is that the person submits the complaint. The second step is that the Ethics Committee decides whether to accept or reject the complaint. If the complaint is accepted, the third step is that the Committee appoints an investigator and the investigation process begins. The fourth step is that the investigator submits a report and proposes courses of action. The fifth step is that the Ethics Committee analyses and, where applicable, validates the proposal. The sixth step is that the Committee, if appropriate, informs the party concerned about the actions taken. The image also shows how to submit a complaint. One way is through Meliá Home (employee portal), in the \"Code of Ethics\" section, clicking on \"Complaints Channel\". Another way is through the Meliá corporate website. If the complaint is rejected, one way to submit a complaint is by visiting the URL http://melia.xperta.es/incidencias/crear.

Responsibility for compliance falls on all employees within their area and level of action, and even more so still on the executive team, who should be a benchmark for Meliá's principles and values and always act ethically, with integrity and responsibility in their work.\n\nThe model's governance structure includes the following governance bodies, as well as the key elements to ensure its implementation and compliance:\n\n- The Board of Directors, through the Audit and Compliance Committee, is the body that oversees the Risk and Compliance function.\n- The *Risk Control & Compliance* department, headed by the Company's *Compliance Officer*, reporting directly to the Audit and Compliance Committee, is responsible for developing the internal Compliance Model and overseeing the validity of the controls with a particular focus on criminal compliance, as well as promoting a global and proactive view of compliance risks to thus ensure their management and control.\n- The Code of Ethics of Meliá Hotels International and its rules and regulations, comprising the policies, rules and processes that develop it, including the Supplier Code of Ethics.\n- The Ethics Committee, which ensures the proper management of incidents reported through the whistleblowing channels established by the Company.\n\nThe Company's executives, considered to be staff that are particularly exposed, twice a year sign the Executive Behaviour Regulation, aimed at establishing the criteria for behaviour in matters such as conflicts of interest, confidential information, use of resources, related-party transactions, family relationships and staff management. Through this document, executives also express and communicate their commitment to comply with and enforce the Code of Ethics, policies and rules.\n\n### **Crime Prevention Protocol**\n\nThe Crime Prevention Protocol is the establishment of a system comprising policies, regulations, procedures and controls, the aim of which is to reasonably ensure that the risks of commission of crimes to which the Company is exposed in the course of its business are adequately identified, documented, assessed, controlled and mitigated. This is undertaken in an environment of continuous review, updating and improvement, with the goal of preventing or reducing the risks of commission of crimes, especially those that entail the legal entity's criminal liability.\n\nIn accordance with legal requirements and the UNE 19601 standard, this document is available on the *Meliá Hotels International corporate website*.\n\niuriscert\nCOMPLIANCE PENAL\nUNE 19601\n**AENOR**\nconform\n\nThe Protocol is made up of the different elements needed to guarantee an adequate organisational and management model for the prevention of criminal risks:\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.

Meliá has currently identified 25 such risks, adding two new offences in 2023 (compared to the 23 in the previous year).\n- The Company's **Set of Rules and Regulations** and the **General Measures and Controls** that help to prevent and detect the commission of crimes.\n\n• The **Specific Controls** identified for each of the criminal risks concerned. At year-end 2023, there are a total of 377 identified controls, which are verified annually to ascertain their degree of adequacy and suitability, with the evidence of said controls being documented.\n\nThe Crime Prevention Protocol is reviewed annually. The review carried out in 2023 resulted in the elimination of 30 controls as well as the identification of 48 new controls, going from 359 in 2022 to 377 in the current year, as well as the inclusion in the Protocol of two new offences to which the Company is exposed.\n\nThe reporting model designed enables us to periodically communicate the reports and results of the analysis and review of the Crime Prevention and Detection Protocol to the Executive Committee, the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Board of Directors, as well as to all relevant managers.\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, internal and external audits were conducted to verify compliance with the UNE 19601:2017 standard on Criminal Compliance Management Systems. The external audit carried out by AENOR in April 2023 led to the renewal of the certification which accredits that our Criminal Compliance Management System meets the requirements established by said Standard, demonstrating our solid commitment to best practices in terms of ethics and compliance.\n\nAs has been mentioned, the Crime Prevention Protocol includes the applicable criminal risks in line with Article 31 bis of the Criminal Code. However, due to the importance of the fight against corruption, fraud and bribery, as well as the prevention of money laundering, more detail and information in this respect is provided below.\n\n### CONTENTS **Prevention of corruption, fraud and bribery**\n\nGRI: 2-23; 2-24; 3-3; 205-1; 205-2; 205-3; 415-1\n\nThe aim of the *Anti-Corruption Policy*, approved by the Board of Directors in November 2021, is to prevent, detect, report and rectify the implementation of any actions that, in accordance with the applicable legislation, may be classified as corruption or bribery, both active and passive, in line with the principle of zero tolerance towards any of these practices.\n\nThis Policy enforces compliance with anti-corruption laws around the world, in particular laws prohibiting active or passive bribery and private-to-private corruption. It is part of, and approved in line with, the provisions of the Code of Ethics of Meliá Hotels International whereby the Company assumes the following commitments, as well as others:\n\n- To comply with legislation and regulatory obligations in Spain and at an international level.\n- To establish the mechanisms for the oversight and control of our principles, values and commitments, ensuring the condemnation of irregular conduct, and in particular taking action against any practice of corruption, fraud and bribery.\n- To reject gifts and courtesies from third parties if they exceed the reasonable value of mere courtesy, nor accept any type of economic consideration, gift or invitation from our suppliers that, due to its value, may exceed the symbolic or mere courtesy.\n\nThe Board of Directors is the body responsible for approving all the Company's policies and working to ensure their application, periodically assessing their effectiveness and adopting the appropriate measures to remedy any possible shortcomings, making any changes it deems necessary.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nBusiness corruption is one of the criminal offences included in our *Crime Prevention Protocol*. In order to mitigate this criminal risk, a total of 120 specific controls have been identified in the Protocol, which are assessed annually. Last year there were 102 identified controls linked to this crime.\n\nThe *Internal Hotel Control and Management Regulation*, integrated into the aforementioned Protocol and accessible to all employees through the intranet, has specific sections on accounts payable and treasury that set out clear guidelines to prevent corruption and fraud in some critical processes that occur in the business units, mainly in the areas of reception, validation and posting of invoices:\n\n- Payments to third parties\n- Cash flow and cash management\n- Bank reconciliation\n- Opening and managing bank accounts\n\nWe also have other internal policies and rules that establish guidelines to prevent corruption, including the *Philanthropy Policy*, which expressly prohibits contributions to political parties or their foundations, no matter what type (financial or in kind); this Policy extends to trade unions, individuals and private initiatives. In this regard, in compliance with this obligation, in 2023 no contributions were made on behalf of the Group to **political parties or their foundations**.\n\n#### **Prevention of money laundering**\n\nGRI: 2-26; 3-3\n\nThe Company has a Money Laundering Prevention Manual which establishes the work done to prevent this crime, as well as the due diligence measures that have to be applied in establishments that offer currency exchange.\n\nAs indicated in the Manual, there is a Collegiate Internal Control Body that oversees the application of internal control procedures aimed at preventing money laundering in currency exchanges, which is accessible to all the Company's employees through the intranet.\n\nThis offence, included in our Criminal Offences Prevention Protocol, has a total of 70 controls in place to prevent this criminal offence, compared to 61 in 2022.\n\nIn addition to the external audit conducted by AENOR based on the UNE 19601 certification, our Internal Audit Department, acting as a third line of defence, annually reviews the Crime Prevention Protocol with the aim of ensuring the appropriate and effective implementation of the controls established in the Protocol and linked to criminal offences.\n\nIt also reviews the Internal Control over Financial Reporting System (ICFR), as well as the appropriate implementation in the business and corporate units of the provisions of the internal policies, rules and processes, including those indicated.\n\nEach year, the Internal Audit department prepares different reports on the audit processes carried out, which have a global scope and coverage in the Company's different regions, areas and businesses. A total of 199 reports were produced in 2023 (compared to 160 in the previous year).\n\nAs a result of these reviews, and based on the result of the internal audits conducted, no practices have been detected that could expose the Company to a crime of corruption, fraud or money laundering.\n\nDuring this financial year, 2023, no cases of corruption, fraud or money laundering have been confirmed, received through the Whistleblowing Channel or by any other means, consequently, no remedial actions have been required in these areas.\n\n### **AUDIT PROCESS REPORTS** 199 (2022: 160)\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **Consolidating a culture of ethics and compliance**\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.

In addition to doing the training, it is also necessary to pass the final test and achieve the results set.\n\nThis training is supported by videos and infographics to facilitate learning and, as well as a reference document, includes three modules focusing on:\n\n- **Code of Ethics and Whistleblowing Channel:** Specific training on the Code, its content and objectives, as well as the operation of the Whistleblowing Channel.\n- **Compliance:** Offering a concrete approach to compliance, the function and culture of compliance adapted to the reality of Meliá Hotels International, as well as the specific role and responsibilities of the *Compliance Officer*.\n- **Main Offences:** Training module that covers some of the main criminal offences to which the Company is exposed, including corruption and money laundering, with more extensive content, as well as the behaviours and situations that could involve the commission of these offences and the mechanisms designed and implemented to prevent and report them.\n\nThis training course has a global reach and goes out to more than 23,000 people, including employees at managed and franchised operations. This total includes employees considered to be staff particularly exposed to criminal risks, including the Executive Committee, Senior Management, Corporate Executives and Hotel Managers and Assistant Managers. In terms of the consolidated scope, particularly exposed staff amounted to 932 Executives in 2023, of whom more than 73% have already completed the course or are in the process of doing so as at year-end (consolidated scope).\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, other compliance dissemination/training actions were carried out at a global level, including the following highlights:\n\n- Participation in the podcast series *In Good Company*, in which *Risk Control & Compliance* explained in detail the main features and elements of the Crime Prevention Protocol and the operation of the Whistleblowing Channel. This podcast can be viewed by all employees on the intranet.\n- Participation in *Onboarding Sessions*, meetings in which the main roles and responsibilities of the different departments are explained to employees. A session for the *Legal & Compliance area was held in April 2023.*\n\nAs a result of the Company's commitment to ethics and compliance and the good practices implemented in terms of ethics and compliance, Meliá Hotels International has achieved **second place in the Transparency and Good Governance Ranking** (tied with another company), developed by the Haz Foundation. This achievement demonstrates that our Company has implemented the highest standards in this area among IBEX 35 companies.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n# CONTENTS **Fiscal transparency and responsibility**\n\nGRI: 2-23; 2-24; 2-25; 3-3; 207-1; 207-2; 207-4\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nTABLE OF\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.

It aims to define our approach to taxation on the basis of three core values: transparency, rigour and good governance. Its scope of application includes all companies controlled by Meliá Hotels International, regardless of their geographical location, and is particularly important to the Board of Directors, the Audit and Compliance Committee, the Senior Executive Team (SET) and the Tax Department.\n\nThe Company develops this Tax Strategy on the basis of the following guiding principles:\n\nOur *Tax Strategy* is actively disseminated to ensure awareness and effective\n\ncompliance by all the Company's executives and employees, and is made available to stakeholders on our corporate website.\n\nMeliá Hotels International has a Tax Risk Management and Control System in place to monitor risks relating to large investments and operations, the creation or acquisition of shareholdings in special purpose vehicles or entities domiciled in countries considered to be non-cooperative jurisdictions, and transactions with board members or shareholders.\n\nThis system is part of the function developed by the tax department and with the participation and commitment of all business units, rolled out under the premise of compliance with applicable tax legislation, internal policies and, clearly, the Tax Strategy.\n\n**Regulatory compliance and responsible tax management** in all the countries in which we operate.\n\n**Development of cooperative relationships with the tax authorities and the internal control and management systems** that guarantee compliance with our tax obligations.\n\n**Tax efficiency, the effective defence of our tax positions and transparency** to create value for stakeholders and transparently report our tax contribution at the Group level.\n\nOversight over this system is the responsibility of the Audit and Compliance Committee, which works on all tax risks inherent in the business activities and processes of Meliá Hotels International. Our tax department reports directly to the Board of Directors through this committee on a recurrent basis (at least once a year) and whenever there is an issue considered to be of particular importance.\n\nWe also have a Whistleblowing Channel available to suppliers and the entire workforce, regardless of their hierarchical, functional or geographical position, to report any tax irregularities that run contrary to our Code of Ethics.\n\n78\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/85/Picture/1 description: The image shows a house icon next to the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\".\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.

Such approval is a non-delegable power. Similarly, any presence in non-cooperative jurisdictions must be based on legitimate economic grounds.\n\nMeliá Hotels International carries out hotel business activities in some countries which, without being considered non-cooperative jurisdictions under Spanish law, are considered by certain external observers to be jurisdictions that enjoy a more favourable tax system than Spain, such as Panama, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. In any case, our presence in these jurisdictions is in the development of genuine business activities and all these jurisdictions have signed a double taxation avoidance agreement with Spain, with an information exchange clause.\n\nMeliá also has an entity, Sol Meliá Funding, domiciled in the Cayman Islands. Although this territory has not been on the EU's blacklist of non-cooperative jurisdictions since 2020, it is included in the list of countries and territories with non-cooperative jurisdictions. This company carries out residual business activity relating to the former vacation club and applies the general criteria and procedures of management control and administration set by the Group, cooperating with the authorities concerned to provide the information they deem necessary.\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nImage /page/86/Picture/7 description: This image shows a view from a hotel room window overlooking a busy city street.

GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nRisk management is a transversal and global core concept in the Company's governance model. Our risk management culture comprises a set of values intrinsic to all our operations and business activities, which are shared and lived by all our employees.\n\nWe firmly believe that a strong risk management culture brings significant benefits to any business organisation, not only in financial terms but also in areas relating to the long-term sustainability of our business. Our risk management culture promotes accountability, helps prevent irregularities and contributes to strengthening the company's due diligence procedures, among other benefits.\n\n### **Risk governance**\n\nSince 2009, the Company has fostered a risk management culture from both an external and internal perspective, associated with the hotel business model. This culture is promoted by the Risk Control & Compliance Department, which reports directly to the Audit and Compliance Committee, a delegated committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nMeliá Hotels International's Risk Management and Control System is aimed at ensuring the Company's targets are achieved, identifying all possible risks that could threaten the Group's strategy and the achievement of the targets set. This management model, consolidated over a 15-year period, is based on different levers to mitigate or reduce the impact on the hotel business model:\n\nA *Risk Management and Control Policy*, approved by the Board of Directors in October 2020, which establishes the basic principles and general framework for action in terms of risk management. Article 5 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors assigns to the Board the general oversight function and, in particular, the identification of the Company's main risks, particularly tax risks. Article 14 of said regulations assigns to the Audit and Compliance Committee the functions of overseeing the effectiveness of the Company's internal control, internal audit services and risk management systems, including tax risks, as well as supervising and assessing non-financial risks: operational, technological, legal, social, environmental, political and reputational risks. This Policy is developed by an internal regulation that establishes the rules, guidelines and criteria to be followed by the risk management system for it to be fully aligned with the strategy.\n\n- The segregation and independence of functions followed by the three lines of defence model enables us to provide comprehensive and integrated management to every division of the Company, with the Board of Directors holding ultimate responsibility.\n- **First line:** made up of various divisions and departments that are incorporated into the different areas of the organisational structure: (Corporate Services, Hotel Services and Operations). They are responsible for identifying, evaluating and managing risks.\n- **Second line:** Risk Control & Compliance Department, which is responsible for i) Guaranteeing compliance with the Risk Control Policy and Internal Regulation, ensuring that the Risk Management System is implemented and functioning correctly; ii) Supporting the identification, analysis and evaluation of risks; iii) Managing and monitoring key risks; iv) Reporting to the Company's Governing Bodies.\n- **Third line:** *Internal Audit Management, whose role is to oversee the Risk Control and Management model to ensure it functions correctly by supervising the first and second lines of defence.*\n\nAn organisational structure and governing bodies with specific functions and responsibilities assigned to ensure the Group's risk management model is as solid and rigorous as possible.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONTENTS Both the second and third line of defence report directly to the Audit and guarantees maximum independence in the management and empower-Compliance Committee at Meliá Hotels International, which ensures and ment of a risk culture.\n\nguarantees maximum independence in the management and empower-\nment of a risk culture.\n\nImage /page/88/Figure/4 description: This image shows a diagram of risk management governance. The diagram is divided into three sections: Board of Directors, Audit and Compliance Committee, and Executive Committee (Senior Executive Team). The Board of Directors is responsible for supervising internal controls and risk management systems, approving the Group Risk Map, and presenting, on a detailed and recurring basis, reports on the company's TOP risks. The Audit and Compliance Committee is responsible for supporting the inclusion of risk management in critical processes and assigning appropriate ownership of risks. The Executive Committee (Senior Executive Team) is responsible for approving the Risk Control Policy. The diagram also shows the three lines of defense: 1st Line of Defense (Business and Organisational Units), 2nd Line of Defense (Risk and Compliance Department), and 3rd Line of Defense (Internal Audit). The 1st Line of Defense is responsible for identifying, assessing, and managing risks, and defining and implementing the necessary mitigation measures. The 2nd Line of Defense is responsible for guaranteeing compliance with the Policy and Regulation and operation of the System, supporting in identifying, analysing and assessing risks, controlling and monitoring of Key Risks, and reporting to Governance Bodies. The 3rd Line of Defense is responsible for supervising first and second line of defense, auditing the risk control and management process, and aligning the Annual Audit Plan with the Risk Map. The diagram also includes the words \"Guidelines\" and \"Information\" with arrows pointing to the different lines of defense.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **Risk management model**\n\nOur Risk Management Model, based on the COSO framework, is applied at every level of the organisation: in 2023 it involved the participation of 66 executives from all the divisions and organisational structures mentioned above.\n\nImage /page/89/Picture/4 description: The image contains the words \"ABOUT THIS\" and \"REPORT\" stacked on top of each other.\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe identified risks are consolidated into six different categories, according to their nature. This risk inventory is reviewed and updated every year and serves as a basis for updating the Risk Map, where we analyse both external sources (reports and expert publications) and the internal vision of key areas of the organisation (SET, Strategic Planning, Sustainability, etc.).\n\nAfter identifying external and internal factors throughout the year, we perform an annual review of the current map, which is evaluated to include any factors that are considered important to the Company.\n\nExecutives involved in the evaluation receive guidelines or instructions through training, to ensure that the process is as consistent as possible. The scale used to evaluate impact not only includes financial perspectives (revenue, costs, EBITDA), but also operational factors, such as impact on strategy, reputation, processes and human resources. This methodology enables us to subsequently produce a sensitivity analysis, as well as a risk profile.\n\nWe have seen a reduction in the average value of identified risks, bringing us back to pre-pandemic levels. If we look at categories, we see that, aside from financial risks, which are becoming more prominent in the Map, the other categories are falling slightly, particularly global risks, which are dropping significantly. This latter category includes the pandemic risk, which has become considerably less significant in comparison to previous years.\n\n35 **operational risks** related to failures that may occur in internal processes and operations. 14 **business risks** derived from variables intrinsic to the business such as strategy, competition, the market, etc. 8 **compliance risks** as a result of both internal and external regulatory changes and potential non-compliance. 7 **financial risks** that aect financial variables in the business: liquidity, credit, debt, interest rates, etc. 5 **information risks** related to events caused by the improper use, generation and communication of information. 9 **global risks** related to events beyond our control and for which management capacity is more limited (natural catastrophes, geopolitical risks, etc.).\n\n**RISK IDENTIFICATION MODEL**\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n**3.

The first line chart shows the average value top 20 and average value for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The average value top 20 is 17.43 in 2021, 17.22 in 2022, and 15.85 in 2023. The average value is 11.38 in 2021, 11.50 in 2022, and 10.92 in 2023. The bar chart shows the compliance, financial, global, information, business, and operations for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The compliance is 8.3 in 2021, 7.9 in 2022, and 7.9 in 2023. The financial is 10.8 in 2021, 11.0 in 2022, and 12.1 in 2023. The global is 16.4 in 2021, 16.8 in 2022, and 14.6 in 2023. The information is 9.6 in 2021, 9.9 in 2022, and 8.6 in 2023. The business is 11.6 in 2021, 11.5 in 2022, and 11.0 in 2023. The operations is 11.1 in 2021, 11.3 in 2022, and 10.7 in 2023.\n\n### **Primary risks**\n\nIn addition to the Company's Global Risk Map, in 2023 we also produced 85 other maps, one for each of the participating divisions, according to the aforementioned organisational structure, plus individual maps for each participant.\n\nCreating individual maps enables each management team to understand their own situation and their primary risks, helping them to establish initiatives to mitigate and reduce their exposure.\n\nThe results of the Group's Risk Map update are analysed by the Executive Committee (SET), the Audit and Compliance Committee and, finally, by the Board of Directors, with a particular focus on the TOP 20 risks.\n\nThe Risk Map is also used as one of the essential inputs, both for establishing our strategy and for setting variable compensation targets, ensuring that our strategy and the process for setting annual targets are designed to mitigate the Company's primary risks. To ensure this process runs smoothly, the Compensation & Benefits Department sends guidelines every year for setting targets that will reduce our exposure to the risks identified by each division.\n\nImage /page/90/Figure/9 description: The image shows the text \"RISK MAP 2023\" in a light gray color.\n\nImage /page/90/Figure/10 description: The image is a risk assessment matrix with four quadrants labeled Global, Business, Financial, and Operational. The matrix plots various risks based on their potential impact and likelihood. In the Global quadrant, risks include natural disasters, commodity prices, geopolitical risks, pandemics, and health crises, as well as economic uncertainty. The Business quadrant contains industry restructuring, portfolio distribution, and changes in market trends. The Financial quadrant includes financial risks. The Operational quadrant features emerging technology risks, management model, expansion and growth, and talent and human resources. The proximity of each risk to the center of the matrix indicates its degree of criticality.\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### CONTENTS **RISKS BY CATEGORY: IMPLICATIONS AND STRATEGIC ROADMAP**\n\n|                                                         | CATEGORY   | RISKS                                | ESG                                      | POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | TREND | MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL MEASURES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ABOUT THIS<br>REPORT                                    | GLOBAL     | Pandemics, health crises             | <span style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">✔</span> | • Inability to adapt or respond to minimise the impact of this type<br>of crisis at a local or global level, a crisis whose effects could even<br>include interruptions or full halts to our business.                                      | ❯     | STRATEGIC ROADMAP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|                                                         |            | Economic uncertainty                 |                                          | • National or international economic crises or uncertainty                                                                                                                                                                                  | ❯     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| 1.

We presented three reports detailing risks related to business and operations, outlining the primary risks included in these categories. Many of these risks involved some aspect that was associated with sustainability. These deep-dive analysis reports included the following:\n\n- A risk context and evolution analysis.\n- Identification of indicators for managing, monitoring and measuring risks.\n\t- Action plans for mitigating identified risks, all of which are integrated into the strategic pillars.\n\nAll the members of the Board of Directors, including the Non-Executive Directors, have training sessions in their annual agenda on matters that are relevant to their role as directors, including risk management, due to the wide range of risks involved (technological, climate, financial, etc.), among other reasons. This year, the training was largely focused on cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.\n\nFinancial risks are included in the agenda of every Audit and Compliance Committee session, where they are looked at in great detail. When it comes to technological risks, the head of the technology division reports to the Board of Directors on a constant basis regarding the current situation and any updates on this issue, with a particular focus on cybersecurity.\n\n### **ESG risks (environmental, social and governance)**\n\nThe Company's risk management model identifies all risks that are directly or indirectly related to sustainability or ESG criteria, in order to classify risks on the map that may impact the Company's sustainability strategy. Accordingly, of the Company's 78 global risks, a total of 37 are associated with ESG risk criteria.\n\nIdentifying and integrating the acronym into the risk management model enables us to obtain a second map specific to sustainability matters, which will be reported to the Sustainability Committee, which is responsible for monitoring and controlling the Group's sustainability strategy, and the Appointment, Compensation and Sustainability Committee, which has been delegated this responsibility by the Board of Directors.\n\nBeing part of the Group's Global Risk Map, the same management and control model also applies to these risks, as does the means of identifying measures to minimise said risks.\n\nImage /page/92/Figure/12 description: The image shows a circular diagram divided into three sections representing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors. The Environmental section includes factors like climate change, catastrophes or natural disasters, and commodity prices. The Social section includes talent and human resources, pandemics and health crises, and social media and communication. The Governance section includes management model, expansion and growth, and contract risk. Each section has a corresponding icon: a plant for Environmental, people for Social, and gears for Governance.\n\n**PRIMARY ESG RISKS**\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### CONTENTS **Emerging risks**\n\nIn such a globalised, turbulent and ever-changing world, we need to take care when navigating a landscape of dynamic risk, which is evolving ever faster and often materialises in unexpected ways. These changes may modify existing risks, create new risks and open up new opportunities. The *Global Risk Report* published in 2024 by the World Economic Forum talks of a world \"plagued by a duo of dangerous crises: climate and conflict\". These threats also exist within a context of rapid technological change and economic uncertainty.\n\nOur world today is less predictable, and more impulsive and chaotic. In addition to wars and armed conflicts, we are also exposed to influences, risks and threats of various kinds that will lead to a greater number of disputes, increased social polarisation, less consensus and more unilateral decisions than we have seen in previous decades.\n\nIssues such as climate change, cyberattacks or major technological changes will take on greater significance in our day-to-day lives. Faced with this situation, Meliá Hotels International also has to monitor another kind of risk, generally instigated by external actors, with potential effects that could have a significant impact on our business.\n\n### **Geopolitical Risks**\n\nTourism companies are increasingly exposed to risks related to international transfer of supplies, currency exchange and movement and safety of employees and customers, as a result of the geographical environment they operate in and the increase in transnational business. As a result, it is a good idea to analyse how all these factors interact to develop a risk management plan that can mitigate any potential damages.\n\nThis interrelation between countries and destinations, at a global level, and situations and changes within a country may have a significant domino effect on travelling patterns, not only in that specific country but throughout the world. That is why it is important to quantitatively and qualitatively analyse contingencies, to subsequently study potential solutions in each case and also opportunities to take advantage of benefits in the long term.\n\nGeopolitical tensions in different parts of the world create an ever-changing dynamic that may evolve quickly and will foreseeably continue to lead to sources of instability that will influence not only those countries directly affected, but also the rest of the world. As such, it is highly likely that the hotel sector will be one of the first to feel the impact of geopolitical changes.\n\nThe potential impacts of this kind of risk may affect various factors, with the most notable including drastic decreases or slowdowns in travel, which would have a direct effect on the flow of tourists and, consequently, revenues for tourism companies; changes to customer habits; raw material price increases; or other significant socioeconomic impacts.\n\n### **Cybersecurity**\n\nCyber insecurity remains towards the top of the list of primary global risks, both in the short- and medium-term. To reduce the risk and improve their resilience, companies are developing their own techniques for managing cybersecurity risk, assigning economic and human resources to respond to cyber threats.\n\nThis is why it is important to promote risk management and good governance throughout the organisation and within the Board of Directors, to ensure that resources and investments are applied to manage those cyber risks that are most significant due to their impact and financial, commercial and operational consequences.\n\nNew technologies enable greater digital interaction with customers and add another level of complexity to the cyber vulnerability we may be exposed to. The potential impacts of this risk are related to loss or theft of sensitive or confidential information; identity theft; paralysis of sales; reputational damage; or loss of confidence among consumers.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\nThe Group is constantly working to monitor emerging risks, analysing all available information with two goals in mind: on the one hand, identifying the cause-effect relationships with other types of risks, and on the other, determining the protocols and mechanisms necessary to mitigate negative impacts should they materialise in the future.\n\n### **2024 Challenges**\n\nClimate-related threats predominate in the 10 primary risks faced by global populations, with substantial price increases being the reality for many due to extreme climates or climate-related disasters. Similarly, multinational companies will need to implement plans to mitigate and adapt to climate change and prevent or prepare for any adverse effects produced by the climate crisis.\n\nissues that will need to be faced over the coming years.\n\nWith this in mind, next year the Company will perform an analysis of its portfolio, hotel by hotel, within the scope of its global integration process. The purpose of this is to understand the climate risks that each hotel asset is exposed to and to design an informed and robust transition plan that minimises the potential financial impacts. Along these same lines, the first double materiality assessment will be performed to determine the sustainability\n\n**3.

GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### **Working together towards a culture of cybersecurity**\n\nCybersecurity is one of the most relevant and important issues on the agendas of governing bodies at companies all over the world right now. This is reflected in the *Global Risks Report 2023*, published by the *World Economic Forum*, which clearly highlighted cyberattacks as one of the emerging risks with the greatest short-term and medium-term impact. For managing directors in Spain, cyberattacks are second on their list of concerns, only surpassed by their worries regarding the ever-changing economic climate.\n\nNew regulatory frameworks require companies to develop cybersecurity prevention models, alongside specific training plans on these matters, to inform employees about the importance of using both systems and data in an appropriate manner.\n\nThe exponential and global growth of digitisation in companies and the transition towards a hybrid working model, driven by the pandemic, has significantly changed the landscape of cyber threats, as an increase in interconnectivity inevitably leads to greater vulnerability. This has triggered greater awareness among organisations regarding the risks of a potential cyber attack.\n\nMeliá Hotels International prioritises cyber security in all its operations, as it does in its relationships with various stakeholders. Indeed, it is one of the top 5 risks on our 2023 Risk Map.\n\n### **Robust governance for efficient and consolidated management**\n\nGRI: 2-23; 2-24; 3-3\n\nAt Meliá Hotels International we are firmly committed to tackling risks related to information security. It is for this reason that we have developed a series of regulations contained within the global *Information Security Policy*, which is based on the international **ISO 27001** standard and is implemented alongside the principles of the **Good Governance Code for Cybersecurity** from the CNMV. It was approved by the Board of Directors in 2017 and updated in October. The purpose of this Policy is to establish security objectives and critical areas, ensuring compliance with the necessary levels of protection and the principles of confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity and online traceability, in line with the Meliá strategy.\n\nThe Policy applies to the Company and to its Group, including all employees and partners who work with Meliá, regardless of their position or role they perform, and it may extend to any other natural or legal person related to the group in any way, such as suppliers, stakeholders or third parties who need to process information or use Meliá information systems. The Company is responsible for motivating and training all members of the organisation to ensure they are aware of and comply with this Policy, and it also makes said Policy available to interested parties through its website.\n\nThe Company has implemented a robust governance model regarding this matter, with the Board of Directors as the main body responsible for supervising the application of this Policy, periodically assessing its effectiveness, adopting suitable measures to resolve any shortcomings and making any changes it deems necessary.\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\nCONTENTS The Board of Directors assigns the Audit and Compliance Committee with the responsibility of supervising and ensuring compliance with the principles and commitments established by this Policy, with support from the Cybersecurity Committee, as the body responsible for adopting any relevant resolution related to information security that may substantially affect the Company's activities, while continuously monitoring the commitments and principles established in this Policy. This Committee will report directly to senior management and the Board of Directors on matters of cybersecurity.\n\n> Furthermore, given the importance of this issue, the Board of Directors shall be updated annually on cybersecurity matters, with the support of expert advisers from this field, along with the *professional expertise of Carina Szpilka Lázaro*, an independent adviser who has worked with Meliá Hotels International since March 2016, offering extensive professional experience in the field of technology.\n\nThe organisational structure of this area has been enhanced by new profiles and teams, to minimise any negative impacts within this field. María Baeza, the *Head of Security*, is responsible for coordinating, monitoring and ensuring the implementation of and compliance with regulations, processes and procedures related to information system security, both in relation to company employees and any other actors within our value chain, such as suppliers, subcontractors and third parties.\n\n**INFORMATION SECURITY GOVERNANCE**\n\nThe guiding principles that shape our Information Security Policy are concentrated around the following matters:\n\n#### **GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF THE INFORMATION SECURITY POLICY**\n\nImage /page/96/Figure/8 description: The image shows a pyramid-shaped diagram illustrating different levels of security measures. At the top of the pyramid is \"Good Governance and Cybersecurity Committee\". The next level down contains \"Protection of personal data and credit cards\" and \"Business continuity and backups\". The next level contains \"Audit and compliance\", \"IT Damage and Security Incident Management\", and \"Access management and proper use of technological resources\". The bottom level contains \"Information classification and document management\", \"Prevention of information leakage\", \"Training and awareness raising\", and \"Supply chain security\".\n\nThe Policy is also reinforced by the System Security Regulation, approved by the Executive Committee in September 2020. The purpose of this regulation is to establish the security criteria and principles that govern the protection of information at Meliá Hotels International and cover the following aspects:\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nImage /page/96/Figure/11 description: The image shows three sections describing the roles of different groups in cybersecurity. The first section, titled \"Cybersecurity Committee,\" states that it makes decisions on cybersecurity, follows up on established commitments and principles, and reports to Senior Management.

To manage and guarantee this protection, we have put in place all the structures, security plans and control mechanisms that are required in line with the current legislation and regulations of each country. This Policy is available to all interested parties on our *company website*.\n\n### **Centralised management**\n\nGRI: 3-3\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThanks to the good practices implemented in relation to cybersecurity, we are able to respond quickly and safely to the demands and risks in our environment. The aim is for all stakeholders to be able to take advantage of the optimal security guarantees offered by our work centres.\n\nMeliá Hotels International offers a Security Operations Centre (SOC), with support from our technology partner. The SOC supervises and manages cybersecurity at a global level, through security prevention, monitoring and control in all our various technological environments. The goal is to detect, analyse and resolve security incidents, and to do this we rely on specialised tools and services that enable us to monitor all the security incidents that have been reported.\n\nFrom this centre we also analyse activity on networks, servers, databases, applications and websites in search of any anomalies that may indicate an incident or a threat to security. If an anomaly is identified, the SOC will help to provide a specific response based on our action plans, to ensure that any potential security incidents are identified, assessed, blocked and reported appropriately.\n\nBelow we have listed some of the specific capacities of our SOC and its scope of management/responsibility:\n\nImage /page/98/Figure/14 description: The image shows a diagram of SOC (Security Operations Center) services. The word \"SOC\" is in the center of the diagram. Surrounding the word \"SOC\" are the words \"SISAP Sistemes Aplicativos\". Radiating outward from the center are the following services: Report, Monitoring of Security and Suspicious Activity, Risk and Vulnerability Management, Cyberthreats, Bitsight/Third-Party Risks, PCI DSS, Malware Detection, Antispam, SDWAN, Managed Security, Threat Intelligence, and Cloud MSS.\n\n**CAPACITIES OF OUR SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTRE (SOC)**\n\n### **Guaranteed cloud solutions (Cloud MSS)**\n\nCloud solutions provide the necessary security measures to ensure technological alignment with data security, risk management and regulatory compliance. We perform regular security reviews on our various solutions across all divisions, starting with the most critical.\n\nThe objective of these reviews is to periodically and systematically ensure that all the security controls are aligned within each environment, measure any identified risks, and establish and implement specific action plans.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/99/Picture/1 description: The image shows a house icon next to the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\".\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n### CONTENTS **Maximum security in the supply chain (Bitsight/third-party risks)**\n\nAfter developing a new platform for suppliers, which the Company implemented in order to streamline the procurement process for products, goods and services throughout the supply chain, as part of our supplier contract management system we analyse security requirements in terms of access to data and/or technological environments.\n\nThe key objective of this analysis was to ensure compliance with the Company's regulatory framework. We also implemented a framework for managing technological risks with third parties, providing visibility and allowing us to verify information security indexes and technological environments throughout the entire supply chain.\n\n### **Personal data protection in payment systems (PCI DSS)**\n\nIn line with the organisation's commitment to protect and manage credit card information, in 2023, for the thirteenth year running, we renewed the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for booking environments.\n\nWe also applied best security practices to ensure that all the different payment methods offered to customers function correctly.\n\n## **Contingency plans against cyberattacks**\n\nGRI: 418-1\n\nIn 2023 we did not detect nor were we informed of any cyberattack, but Meliá Hotels International does have a procedure in place that establishes the necessary steps and individuals responsible for communicating, managing and recording any security incidents. The primary objective of this procedure is to minimise the impact of any potential incidents and avoid loss of or damage to any data that has been entrusted to the Company.\n\nThis procedure must be followed by everyone within the Company, including any internal and external employees who may have access to data and information that is under our care at Meliá.\n\nWe did not receive any customer complaints this year related to privacy violations, nor did we receive any reports through our whistleblower channel or via any other means. Similarly, we did we identify any leaks, theft or loss of customer data.\n\nTraining and employee awareness of cybersecurity matters is one of our key defences against emerging risks and ongoing cyberattacks. This compulsory training is provided on a yearly basis and is a key lever within the scope of cybersecurity and PCI to minimise and contain risks.\n\n0.8 (2022: 0.9) **CYBERSECURITY TRAINING** \n\n**INFORMATION SECURITY TRAINING (HOURS PER PERSON)**\n\nImage /page/99/Picture/15 description: The image shows the number of employees, which is 4,934.\n\nImage /page/99/Picture/16 description: The image shows the text \"PCI TRAINING (EMPLOYEES)\" in green, above the number \"3,266\" in gray.\n\nImage /page/99/Picture/17 description: The image shows the text \"GDPR TRAINING (EMPLOYEES)\" in green, above the number \"11,514\" in gray.\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nImage /page/99/Figure/19 description: The image contains the words \"TRAINING SNIPPETS (USERS)\" in a teal color.

Each of the snippets focuses on different topics related to cybersecurity, such as secure passwords, phishing, the use of corporate accounts and devices, public WiFi, protecting your devices and managing incidents, among others.\n\nIn line with the contingency plan against cyberattacks, audits are carried out every year to assess the security, effectiveness and good practices of the Company's computer systems, which are crucial for carrying out day-to-day tasks and operations within the organisation. Below you will find the life cycle implemented at Meliá Hotels International for managing and responding to security incidents, which we put into action with the help of our technological partner.\n\n#### **1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nImage /page/100/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram of a four-step process.

GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\nThroughout 2023, the Company continued responding to all the challenges that arose during the pandemic, some of which even intensified this year as a result of both global and local factors.\n\nHowever, we have a long way to go before we can return to the normality we knew a few years ago. We are still suffering from product and raw material shortages, which is a constant challenge for numerous industries. Factors such as production interruptions, transport problems and demand fluctuations contribute towards the unavailability of certain goods, which has a direct impact on the supply chain of international hotel companies like ours.\n\nFuel price increases, port congestion, transport limitations and geopolitical challenges lead to incertitude in our value chain as they affect the margins of companies, producers, distributors and consumers, and have a significant impact on the hotel sector specifically. At a global level, this leads to higher financial and logistics costs, which, aggravated by increased inflation rates, triggers price increases and reduced operating margins.\n\n### **ESG risk management**\n\nGRI: 308-2; 407-1; 408-1; 409-1\n\nAt Meliá, we work continually to identify and monitor potential short-term and medium-term risks that we may be exposed to in the various geographical areas where we operate that require constant attention, such as the price of commodities, a direct risk that may considerably impact our supply chain.\n\nIn 2018, Meliá Hotels International performed an exhaustive analysis of the risks related to its supply chain, which has served as the basis for the unique monitoring and control process carried out on a regular basis in countries with a particularly high level of risk. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the risk level of our key suppliers according to ESG criteria (environmental, social and governmental), where we evaluate all issues related to human rights, occupational health and safety, talent, diversity, vulnerability, adaptive capacity to climate change, availability of natural resources, biodiversity, institutional relations and corruption. This analysis provides greater visibility on our level of exposure to ESG risks in the countries where we operate, enabling us to put in place the necessary measures to minimise their impact and occurrence.\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/102/Figure/2 description: This image shows an ESG risk map of the world, with different countries colored according to their risk level. The risk levels are: very low risk, low risk, medium risk, high risk, and very high risk. There is a legend that shows the colors associated with each risk level. The image also shows the total number of tier 1 suppliers, critical tier 1 suppliers, and non-critical tier 1 suppliers. The total number of tier 1 suppliers is 6,548 (2022: 6,633). The number of critical tier 1 suppliers is 18 (2022: 20). The number of non-critical tier 1 suppliers is 54 (2022: 164).\n\n#### **5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nFor 2024, the Company has planned to launch a new risk assessment for all the countries identified as critical, to bring the 2018 exercise up to date.\n\nWe have also dedicated financial and human resources to consolidating our technological tool in Spain, preparing future facilities in our key markets (France, Italy, the UK, Germany, Mexico and the Dominican Republic) and designing an evaluation model that, with technological support, we hope to launch in Spain and the Dominican Republic during the first quarter of next year.\n\nThis tool will enable us to strengthen the due diligence that the company already adopts for governance, *compliance*, financial and operational matters when onboarding suppliers, to evaluate alignment levels and their commitment to environmental and social issues, thus enhancing supplier profiles.\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **Supply chain governance**\n\nties on the company website.\n\nGRI: 2-23; 2-24; 2-25; 3-3; 308-1; 414-1\n\nThe *Purchasing and Service Procurement Policy* is a regulatory framework that integrates our key commitments related to the procurement of goods and services and guides our commercial practices, guaranteeing not only operational efficiency, but also responsibility and sustainability throughout our entire supply chain.\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.

This policy was approved\n\nThe company recognises the importance of promoting solid and ethical supplier relations based on trust, respect and mutual commitment, continuously meeting all obligations related to compliance with internal regulations at\n\nMeliá, particularly the standards established in the *Supplier Code of Ethics.*\n\nby the Board of Directors in July 2020 and is available for all interested par-\n\nWe expect our suppliers to commit to actively promoting and respecting the principles of the United Nations Global Compact on human rights, labour and the fight against child labour, exploitation of labour and forced labour. In response to environmental pressures and the struggle against climate change, we expect our suppliers to procure clean products, equipment, services and technology, promote good practices that support the fight against climate change, and sign the mandatory sustainability clause.\n\nImage /page/103/Figure/14 description: The image shows a diagram outlining ethical and sustainability commitments. It includes the following points: \"Comply with legislation\", \"Do not tolerate slavery\", \"Prohibition of child labour\", \"Freedom of opinion and association\", \"Ensure safe working environments\", \"Respect for the environment\", \"Non-discrimination\", \"Do not tolerate abuse or coercion\", \"Responsible supply chain\", and \"Fair wage\". Additionally, the image presents data on \"SUPPLIER CODE OF ETHICS SIGNATURES/ACCEPTANCES\" with a current value of 2,493 (2022: 1,881) and a 2024 target of 100%.

While our contract with the supplier is in force, we may also request documentation to demonstrate that the supplier is complying with the commitments they have accepted and, in the case of non-compliance, request termination of the contract, without prejudice to any other appropriate compensation.\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023 As part of its desire to promote and reinforce supplier relationships based on dialogue and seamless communication, the Company has established direct and two-way communication channels at a frequency that it deems appropriate, according to the characteristics of the supplier.\n\n> It has also developed an incident-management model based on a ticketing system, for receiving notifications related to the provision of the contracted service. This channel is provided to users both to accommodate new requirements for the service and to report any incidents, recording all related information and response times, and assigning a responsible party to manage the incident until it is resolved. The entire process is logged on the platform. This channel is currently in the implementation phase and will be available at all hotels that have the appropriate tool.\n\n### **Commitment to excellence and sustainability**\n\nGRI: 3-3; 308-2; 414-2\n\nWith the current global climate and the worldwide presence of Meliá Hotels International, it is more important than ever to not only have a supply chain that is resilient and efficient, but to consolidate a robust model, optimise all our processes and move towards a management system that is based on excellence, sustainability and digitisation.\n\nThe considerable advances we have made in supplier management not only reflect our commitment to quality and efficiency in the procurement of goods and services, but also highlight our responsibility towards sustainability, ethics and strong partnerships throughout our supply chain. These pillars are key to our success and help us to make a positive contribution both to the business community and to the global environment in which we operate. Our management model is based on the pillars shown in this graphic.\n\n#### **PURCHASING STRATEGY**\n\nImage /page/104/Figure/10 description: The image shows a diagram with text descriptions around a semi-circle. The text descriptions are: \"Digital transformation to ensure greater agility, control and efficiency in our processes.\", \"Investment in training and the development of digital skills.\", \"Integration of sustainability criteria in the selection and evaluation of suppliers.\", and \"Excellence in the operating model to maximise savings and service quality, both in the purchase of goods and in contracting services.\"\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\nCONTENTS This transformation of our purchasing management model has enabled us to move towards a vision based on an ordering process with a focus on supplier management, approval and contracting, with the aim of consolidating an efficient, robust, agile and digital model that integrates global management of products, goods and services.\n\n> We have also incorporated sustainability factors into the supplier profile, to ensure that they are in line with our expectations in this area. In addition, with the new model we have modified product and service sheets to include attributes related to ESG parameters, along with packaging information.\n\n> With the aim of furthering the commitment we made in 2020 to purchase free-range eggs, the Company now consumes only this type of product at all its hotels in Germany, Austria, Holland and the United Kingdom. To meet the target we set ourselves for 2025, we will focus our efforts on all our hotels located throughout Spain and the rest of Europe, within the scope of global integration.\n\n> Our management model also extends to all suppliers and actors in our value chain who work in or provide services to any of our business units, with the following obligations:\n\n- All suppliers, contractors or other entities that provide services to our facilities must abide by our Occupational Health and Safety Policy.\n- Preventive criteria must be incorporated into work, service and supply contracts, with the appropriate channels being provided for business coordination on this matter.\n- Coordination measures must be followed to avoid any accidents at the Company's facilities.\n- All third parties must be informed about risks and preventive measures.\n\nWith the implementation of our tool in Spain, we have significantly improved several elements of our management model:\n\n- Data analysis is carried out with a comprehensive vision of expenses, deepening our awareness in various dimensions.\n- Processes have now been automated, making them faster, more accessible and more efficient for users.\n- The interface improves hotel operations and supplier relations.\n\nadapted to each hotel and destination's specific circumstances.\n\n• We are able to expand the range of services available to all areas of the Company.\n\nWith its broad portfolio of suppliers, the Company can now offer a value proposition to our owners and partners at destinations such as Europe and the Caribbean, providing a comprehensive best-in-class service that is\n\n53.64 (2022: 59.91) **COUPA SAP SCOPE (IG)**\n\n**AVERAGE SUPPLIER PAYMENT PERIOD (IG)**\n\nImage /page/105/Picture/16 description: The image shows the number 61 in a light gray color, followed by the text '(48% of portfolio)' in a smaller font size and the same light gray color.\n\nSCURA GAP SCORE (HOTEL)\n\n#### **COUPA SAP SCOPE (HOTEL MANAGEMENT)**\n\nImage /page/105/Picture/19 description: The image shows the number 54 in a large font, followed by the text '(33% of portfolio)' in a smaller font.\n\nImage /page/105/Picture/20 description: The image shows the percentage of local purchases.

COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe consumption of fossil fuels has led to an increase in the level of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing towards an acceleration in global warming, rising sea levels and ocean acidification, among other issues. This triggers more frequent extreme natural phenomena, which impact the sustainability of the planet and consequently society as a whole.\n\nClimate change is one of the most significant challenges that humanity is facing in present times. It is important to act now and combine forces to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and meet the obligations undertaken by the states that signed the Paris Agreement. To do this we need to adopt policies and make investments that enable us to meet our targets over the next ten years and avoid passing the threshold of 1.5ºC, as proposed at the last Climate Change Conference in 2023 (COP28), where it was suggested that all parties progressively reduce their use of carbon-based energy, move towards energy systems with net-zero emissions, triple global capacity of renewable energy and eliminate inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, among other key points.\n\nAlong these lines, within its corporate strategy, Meliá has included a commitment to make further progress in the fight against climate change, minimising its environmental impact. This is in addition to the obligation it has undertaken to tackle the risks and opportunities resulting from climate change, strengthening its risk-based culture and long-term financial performance.\n\n### **Governance of climate change and the environment**\n\nGRI: 2-23; 2-24; 2-25; 3-3\n\nThe aim of our *Climate Change and Environment Policy*, which was approved in 2017 and updated in 2021 by our Board of Directors, is to establish our action principles at Meliá Hotels International and the Group as a whole in relation to its commitment to combat climate change and protect the environment, promoting efficient, responsible and sustainable management throughout its value chain.\n\nIn terms of its scope, compliance is compulsory and it applies globally and directly to all corporate offices and business units managed by Meliá. The contents of the policy are established as a minimum requirement, without prejudice to any additional and specific regulations that may be approved related to this issue.\n\nIt was reviewed within the scope of our *Roadto2024* Strategic Plan, as part of a lever focused on the decarbonisation of our business model, in order to ourselves with the Paris Agreement. Along these lines, Meliá has incorporated into its strategy a commitment to move forward with this transition, with the conviction to integrate sustainability and climate change into our investment decisions and hotel assets, making them more sustainable and resilient.\n\n### **Risks and opportunities resulting from climate change**\n\nGRI: 2-23; 2-24; 2-25; 3-3; 201-2; 203-1; 203-2\n\nOur Global Risk Map identifies the primary risks that we face as a Company. The map is reviewed on an annual basis and the results are submitted to the Audit and Compliance Committee, whose responsibilities involve supervising the risk management systems, including those covered by the acronym ESG.\n\nIn the specific case of risks related to climate change, the \"Natural catastrophes or disasters\" risk, which refers to damage to physical assets or interruption of operations as a result of extreme climate events, is number 11 in the Company's list of top 20 risks. This risk has climbed to a higher position than in 2022, which demonstrates the Company's awareness of its exposure to climate events, as well as the conclusions reached in the study carried out by the TCFD.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4. COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nTherefore, and in line with future regulations that will require sustainability reports to include an estimate of the financial impact of climate change-related risks, this vision has become even more relevant and encourages us to update and improve the analysis of climate risks associated with our property portfolio in 2024.\n\n### **Climate scenarios and scope**\n\nThe exhaustive analysis of the climate risks included in the Global Risk Map served as the starting point for identifying their impact on our activities in four main geographical areas, selected for their present and future strategic relevance: Spain, Mexico, the Dominican Republic and the United Kingdom.\n\nWithin this scope, in 2021 we identified risks and opportunities related to climate change in line with the guidelines issued by the *Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)*. This process involved studying various climate scenarios, taking into account different pathways, both physical and socioeconomic, as well as climate scenario models, primarily the following: *Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) or the International Energy Agency (IEA)*.\n\nAfter combining the RCP and SSP pathways established by the IPCC, we took four specific climate scenarios and used them to perform a risk and opportunity analysis that met the TCFD technical criteria and was in line with our own commitments in this area.\n\nOf the four scenarios, we prioritised the risk and opportunity analysis on the scenario involving a society with intermediate sustainable development that manages to prevent its temperature from increasing by over 2 ºC by the end of the century: scenario SSP2 – RCP 2.6. This scenario is in line with our emission reduction targets, which were approved by the *Science Based Target Initiative* (SBTi), and is also in tune with the objective to prevent the global temperature from increasing beyond 1.5 ºC.\n\n### **Identifying and assessing risks and opportunities**\n\nOur process for identifying and assessing risks is structured around four clearly differentiated stages:\n\n- Establishing and evaluating our value chain.\n- Establishing and classifying our universe of risks and opportunities. During this stage, we also analysed current and future regulatory requirements for the four selected geographical areas.\n- Selecting climate scenarios.\n- Assessing climate risks and opportunities based on impact, probability of occurrence and time horizon.\n\nThe valuation scales and time horizons used have been established to adapt, on the one hand, to the terminology employed in the global risk assessment and, on the other hand, to the timescale of the expected impacts according to the selected scenario and the service life of our various infrastructures. The maximum time horizon we used for this analysis was 2050.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **Climate risk matrix and ranking**\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nOur map identifies 26 climate risks, divided into 9 physical risks and 17 transition risks. The most significant, according to their severity value (probability x impact), are those of a physical nature, both current and medium-term. Furthermore, 65% of the transition risks identified are likely to materialise in current times or in the near future. This initial step, carried out in 2021, will serve as the basis to reveal the climate risks that will affect each hotel asset, leading to a more sustainable and resilient portfolio.\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**6**\n\n**7**\n\n**2**\n\n**1**\n\n[10](#page-10-10) [11](#page-10-11)\n\n**Unknown N/A**\n\n**Physical risks Transition risks**\n\n### **1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n### **2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.

COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### CONTENTS **Plan to mitigate climate change**\n\nGRI: 2-23; 2-24; 2-25; 3-3; 305-5; 305-7\n\nAs a leader in sustainability within the hotel sector, we have made firm commitments to further adapt our business and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. In 2021, we reaffirmed our emission-reduction targets, in line with the *Science Based Targets* initiative (SBTi), to prevent the global temperature from increasing beyond 1.5 ºC. We are establishing and implementing various initiatives to help us reach two different targets by certain dates: a reduction of 29.4% by 2025 and a reduction of 71.4% by 2035, with respect to the base year of 2018.\n\nWithin this context, as part of its Responsible Business Strategy, Meliá has made the following commitments:\n\n- Adapt to climate change: Respond to the risks and opportunities resulting from climate change.\n- Mitigate climate change: Combat climate change and minimise our environmental impact and footprint, recognising the potential impact on tourist destinations.\n\nThe European Climate Law, approved in June 2021, establishes Europe's target to become climate-neutral by 2050 and provides a framework that will further efforts to adapt to the impacts of climate change, requiring all member states to put in place strategies and plans to adapt and mitigate their carbon footprint.\n\nIn our sector, the greatest potential for carbon lock-in is concentrated in hotel infrastructure. The acquisition of fossil-fuel-intensive assets could slow down our progress towards a decarbonised business model. At Meliá we are aware of this situation and it is for this reason that the management team in our Real Estate Department has been set an objective to reduce our emissions and make progress on the commitment we have made.\n\nIn line with the Company's vision, the design and construction manuals for the various brands in the portfolio include the integration of sustainable criteria into any new construction projects, renovations or major refurbishments that we carry out each year, and we raise awareness among our partners on the importance of designing assets where sustainability is a standard. As such, we incorporate the following into our investments: efficient facilities, the use of renewable energies or the generation of green energies, and the use of materials that help to reduce consumption and protect the environment.\n\nOur decarbonisation plan requires the management of two different scenarios in our portfolio. Firstly, there is the scenario mentioned above, with major construction and renovation projects, and then we have the other, involving hotels that are already in operation, with no investment planned in the near future.\n\nImage /page/111/Picture/12 description: The image shows the 2035 emission-reduction target for scope 1 and 2, which is 71.4% versus the base year of 2018.\n\n**2025 EMISSION-REDUCTION TARGET SCOPE 1 AND 2**\n\n(versus base year of 2018) 29.4%\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Company has identified three key levers that will enable us to move towards decarbonising our business model:\n\n• **Optimising energy consumption**\n\nEnergy efficiency plays a major role in reducing carbon emissions. These measures effectively contribute towards reducing emissions by limiting the amount of energy required for different activities, which makes us less reliant on fossil fuels and reduces overall carbon intensity.\n\n• **Migration towards renewable energy sources**\n\nRenewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydraulic and geothermal, generate electricity without producing greenhouse gases. As opposed to fossil fuels, which emit CO2 and other pollutants when they are burned to produce energy, renewable energy sources significantly reduce emissions.\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n### CONTENTS • **Raising awareness of our value chain**\n\nThe objective to reduce scope-3 emissions is without a doubt one of our greatest challenges in the struggle against climate change. To achieve this, it is essential that we involve our customers and all the key actors in our value chain. We are convinced that the right path to meeting our commitments is by raising awareness through a range of products and services that offer sustainable options to our stakeholders.\n\nFor each of the decarbonisation levers mentioned above, we have launched a series of projects related to the objective and the identified risks.\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.

In 2018, the emissions scope 2 (SBTi) was 361,101. In 2023, the emissions scope 2 (SBTi) was 299,804. The intensity ratio per stay emissions scope 2 (SBTi) decreased by -17% from 2018 to 2023, with a value of 0.011 in 2023.\n\n**Optimising energy consumption**\n\nGRI: 302-1; 302-3; 302-4; 302-5\n\n### **Environmental management system (SAVE)**\n\nDesigned internally by our engineers in 2007, according to ISO 14001 Environmental Management criteria, and updated most recently in 2019, this management system integrates new requirements, ensures constant analysis of our management and that of our technical service teams, and reinforces the importance of measuring and managing environmental indicators related to energy and water consumption and waste production at a global level.\n\nImage /page/112/Picture/17 description: The image shows the text 'EMISSIONS REDUCTION SCOPE 1 AND 2' in green font at the top. Below this text is a large number '19.6%' in gray font. Underneath the percentage is the text '(Target 21%)' in gray font.\n\nThis system also enables us to analyse detailed information from various operational departments in our hotels and identify improvement opportunities, in addition to monitoring our progress towards meeting the annual targets we have set ourselves. Once the opportunities have been identified, we carry out technical and economic viability studies to prioritise those investments that have a greater impact at an environmental and economic level.\n\n### **Sustainable tourism certifications**\n\nIn 2023, we relaunched our hotel certification processes, focusing on those entities renowned throughout Spain and the rest of the world, and endorsed by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) or the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC). Each hotel receives its own individual certification, enabling us to identify improvement opportunities and establish an action plan to improve its positioning and reputation with respect to sustainability, an attribute that is of major importance to customers and tourism intermediaries these days.\n\nOur choice of partner has helped to provide greater consistency to our model, providing both internal and external benchmarking, with other comparable hotels that offer similar products and services, and giving us the opportunity to promote improvements and opportunities for our business. We have certified 110 owned or leased hotels, plus 29 managed hotels.\n\n\\*The company's entire portfolio of owned, leased and managed properties.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\n| ENVIRONMENTAL CERTIFICATIONS |     |\n|------------------------------|-----|\n| AMERICA                      | 8   |\n| EMEA                         | 42  |\n| SPAIN                        | 60  |\n| TOTAL                        | 110 |\n\nBuilding and running sustainable buildings continues to be a key element in the environmentally friendly management of our hotels.

This initiative was complemented by a report that detailed the Company's entire inventory of energy consuming equipment, with key technical properties such as power or year of manufacture, to monitor the life cycle of equipment and facilities.\n\nImprovement opportunities and energy saving measures were also identified for each hotel. All of this information enables us to prioritise and plan investments, reduce our consumption in the short and medium term, and extend the service life of our facilities.\n\n### **CO2PERATE Project**\n\nSince its launch in 2019, the primary objective of this project has been to optimise energy consumption from air conditioning. By integrating artificial intelligence into cooling systems, this system allows the systems to adapt their consumption to operational and thermal needs on a given day, improving control and management of the main energy-consuming installations.\n\nDue to its success, this initiative has now also been implemented in numerous hotels managed by Meliá, with a total of 16 hotels now using this technology.\n\n| GLOBAL INTEGRATION |       | 2020      | 2021      | 2022       | 2023      |\n|--------------------|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------|\n| Hotels             | #     | 87        | 85        | 81         | 69        |\n| Savings            | €M    | 0.5       | 1         | 1.9        | 1.2       |\n| Energy savings     | kWh   | 5,085,267 | 9,505,337 | 12,626,675 | 8,140,432 |\n| Emissions avoided  | TnCO2 | 2,809     | 3,951     | 4,172      | 2,791     |\n\nImage /page/113/Picture/18 description: The image shows the percentage of hotels with energy certifications in Spain.

This initiative uses technology to calculate the carbon footprint of our MICE segment (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions), a niche market that is expected to close the year with a total turnover of around 12 billion euros.\n\nDeveloped in partnership with the technology company Creast, which specialises in measuring, reducing and offsetting the environmental impact of events, the project calculates emissions at two crucial moments: the quoting stage and the end of the event. The tool is connected to and integrated into the hotel management systems and enables measurements to be made based on the specific details of each hotel, taking the consumption data and the hotel surface area (m<sup>2</sup>) and then applying each country's emission factor to calculate the carbon footprint for scopes 1 and 2.\n\nAs a new addition, all menus have now been updated to include the footprint per product, giving us a view of a scope 3 category, providing detailed information of the carbon footprint behind each menu.\n\nOur commitment is to offset the entire carbon footprint, whether that be directly through Meliá Hotels International or the customer, if they decide to offset in projects of their choice. The emissions generated in the 198 events measured during the development of the technological tool were offset at the beginning of 2024, to reach the figure of 372 TnCO2.\n\nThis initiative was developed to find improvement opportunities that would help us towards the goal of achieving carbon neutrality in events and to respond to increasing demand from professionals in the sector. We aim to implement this initiative in approximately 40 hotels over the next two years.\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/116/Picture/1 description: The image shows a house icon next to the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\".\n\n### CONTENTS **The Planet We Love**\n\nhouse gas emissions.\n\nextended throughout our value chain.\n\nA project launched worldwide in June 2021 with the aim of involving customers in the fight against climate change.

The logo for ClimateTrade is also visible, indicating a partnership or commitment to carbon offsetting or climate action.\n\n**Adapting our economic activities to mitigate or adapt to climate change**\n\nThe analysis carried out internally, following the recent publication of the activities associated with the last four environmental objectives included in the European Union's Environmental Taxonomy, which expressly include economic activity - 2.1 Hotels, resorts, campsites and similar accommodations - leads us to conclude that the alignment which may exist between our economic activities and the objectives to mitigate and adapt to climate change, which classifies the investments and economic activities resulting from our activity as sustainable, is neither significant nor material.\n\nImage /page/116/Picture/13 description: The image shows the text \"OFFSET EMISSIONS (TNCO2) 379 (2022: 441)\". The words \"OFFSET EMISSIONS\" are in green, and the number 379 is in a larger font size than the other text.\n\nThis review and classification process has been carried out over the past three years under the parameters of six objectives: mitigation of and adaptation to climate change; sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; transition to a circular economy; prevention and control of pollution; and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. The process determines that the most appropriate decision shall be to focus all of our efforts and economic and human resources on analysing our alignment with the objective related to biodiversity, its protection and its restoration, a decision that will be understood by analysts and investors, as well as by our customers and society as a whole.\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **Our results**\n\nGRI: 302-1; 302-3; 302-4\n\nABOUT THIS\nREPORT\n\n#### **ENERGY TABLE**\n\n|                                                            | INDICATOR                                                         | UNIT                 | 2020       | 2021       | 2022       | 2023       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                                                            | Non-renewable fuels (A+B+C)                                       | GJ                   | 292,024    | 329,889    | 480,190    | 433,140    |\n| 1.

COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT CHANGE**\n\nWater resources are essential to ensure quality tourism activities, and for certain holiday destinations, water forms an intrinsic part of their appeal. The sustainability of these destinations where we operate is affected by the availability and enjoyment of this element. At Meliá we are well aware of the importance of responsible water consumption.\n\nThat is why the first step in any management system always involves under-\n\nstanding the situation with this resource and its availability in our portfolio.\n\nOn an annual basis, we analyse the location of all the hotels we manage to determine whether they are located in areas suffering from water stress, using the Acueduct Water Risk Atlas tool.\n\nThis exercise provides us with greater visibility of our portfolio located in high-risk areas and enables us to establish strategies to promote a culture of risk management and develop action plans to mitigate this risk in the short term.\n\n**LOCATION OF HOTELS IN WATER-STRESSED AREAS (OWNED AND LEASED)**\n\nImage /page/118/Figure/12 description: This image shows a world map with some countries highlighted in green. To the left of the map are the words \"4. COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\", \"5. SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\", and \"6. ANNEXES\". To the right of the map are two text boxes. The first text box says \"HOTELS IN WATER-STRESSED AREAS (IG)\" and the number \"52\" with \"(2022: 50)\" underneath. The second text box says \"HOTELS IN AREAS WITH RISK OF FLOODING (IG)\" and the number \"15\" with \"(2022: 18)\" underneath. In the middle of the map, there is a table with the following data: Spain 48, Mexico 2, Italy 1, Peru 1, Total 52.\n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONTENTS To evaluate the risk of water stress and determine whether it is significant or not, we analyse our portfolio with a focus on two key parameters: probability and magnitude of impact. By combining both factors, we are able to calculate the potential financial impact of the risk of water stress.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4. COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nWe perform the probability evaluation in accordance with the results of the analysis, which assigns a score of 3.5 to hotels in high-risk areas and 4.5 points to hotels in extreme-risk areas.\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023 The magnitude of impact is determined by looking at each hotel located in a risk area and determining its importance to our business, based on business volume. If the financial impact is above the significance threshold (>3% of total annual turnover), it is determined that the hotel could have a significant impact on our performance.\n\n### **Water management system**\n\nAn essential part of our commitment to responsible consumption of water resources is the promotion of proactive water management and the implementation of measures to ensure efficient water consumption. The summer season sees the highest levels of water consumption, whether this be by residents or by visitors. This is also the period with the highest volumes of international tourism, with people visiting destinations that may be suffering from water scarcity or restrictions.\n\nIn 2023, certain regions suffered more intense levels of water stress than they had experienced in recent years. The Company is aware of its responsibility to further reduce its water footprint and implement measures to consume water more efficiently and responsibly in its hotels.\n\nBy continuously monitoring our consumption and controlling the operations at our facilities, we can reduce our water consumption and strengthen our commitment to guarantee responsible management of this resource. The investments we have made to improve our facilities and the good practices we share with our customers and partners are key pillars that contribute towards better water management.\n\nAt Meliá we also work with a tool that helps us to identify and analyse the primary operational risks associated with water extraction and spillages, which is a part of our Environmental Management System (SAVE). Aside from helping to ensure efficient water management, this tool is also able to anticipate potential risks and impacts, and ensure that our water is treated in accordance with existing regulations.\n\nThe majority of our business units have implemented various initiatives to mitigate water consumption, such as limiting water flow in taps and showers, which can reduce usage by up to 50%; installing dual-flush cisterns; informing customers about the frequency of washing towels and sheets; and replacing table cloths with disposable and recyclable alternatives.\n\n### **Magnum Project:** *platform for digital management of water footprint in tourism*\n\nNext Generation is an initiative launched to provide financial support to EU member states through loans given out between 2021 and 2026. The goal is to support investment and achieve resilient and sustainable recovery.\n\nAt Meliá we are constantly looking for ways we can contribute towards meeting the European Union's objectives. This drive led us to respond to the RETOS Programme's call for initiatives involving public-private partnerships that promote advances in scientific knowledge, with an innovative project focused on measuring and optimising global management of water footprints.\n\nThe aim of the project is to integrate BIM technology *(Building Information Modeling)* and artificial intelligence to manage water footprints. Its purpose is to improve the management of water footprints from different perspectives, as well as the implementation of operational recommendations in real time, enriching our data with disaggregated information on consumption, implementation of control systems, occupation and use of services and optimisation of operational management, among others, to enhance our water management from a global strategic and operational management point of view.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4. COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe project has been designed with the support of a consortium of companies that specialise in the fields of management, water, data, technology and facilities, where every party takes on a specific role. Meliá acts as a promoter partner with a participation of 24%, and is supported by CETAQUA and IDP as technological partners (39% and 19% participation, respectively) and AQUATEC as a marketing partner (18% participation).\n\nThree hotels in Spain may participate in the project: Gran Meliá Palacio de Isora (Santa Cruz de Tenerife), Meliá Palma Marina (Palma de Mallorca) and Gran Meliá Don Pepe (Marbella).\n\nIn 2023, all efforts were concentrated on producing the prototype, according to the unique characteristics of Gran Meliá Palacio de Isora, a hotel that serves as a particularly complex case study due to the variety of water sources it uses. This hotel has already been digitally redesigned and recreated, and over the next few months technological devices will be installed to measure consumption in certain rooms and points in the hotel that consume the most water.\n\nFurthermore, as part of this project we have developed a tool that enables us to calculate the water footprint of materials purchased for carrying out our activities, enabling us to identify water-efficiency opportunities that we can incorporate into our purchasing processes. This also enables us to involve and inform our customers and partners of the importance of responsible water consumption.\n\nIncorporating technology will improve data collection and improve awareness of water consumption from various perspectives, enabling the implementation of operational recommendations in real time and visibility of data with disaggregated information on consumption.

In our case, considering our portfolio in global integration, our water mainly comes from public or private water suppliers (41%), fresh groundwater through wells (56%) and a very small amount of saltwater from desalination plants (3%). Well water is consumed primarily by our hotels in the Dominican Republic (51% of the total m3 consumed), as there is no other source of water available in this country.\n\nWastewater is discharged into the public sewer system (45%) or wastewater treatment plants (55%).\n\nIt is important to point out that no significant water spillages were reported in 2023.\n\n#### **2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\nImage /page/121/Figure/9 description: The image shows two graphs and a pie chart. The first graph shows the total water extraction from 2020 to 2023. In 2020, the total water extraction was 4,572. In 2021, the total water extraction was 5,654. In 2022, the total water extraction was 7,758. In 2023, the total water extraction was 8,578. The second graph shows the water use intensity ratio from 2020 to 2023. In 2020, the water use intensity ratio was 1.195. In 2021, the water use intensity ratio was 0.889. In 2022, the water use intensity ratio was 0.651. In 2023, the water use intensity ratio was 0.655. The pie chart shows the origin of the water. 56% of the water is taken from municipal water supply, and 3% is taken from other water utilities.\n\n### **WATER CONSUMPTION (IN THOUSAND M3)**\n\n#### **WATER CONSUMPTION BY SOURCE AND DISCHARGE BY DESTINATION**\n\nImage /page/121/Figure/12 description: The image shows two pie charts, one titled \"ORIGIN OF THE WATER\" and the other titled \"WATER DISCHARGE\". The \"ORIGIN OF THE WATER\" pie chart shows that 41% of the water is taken from municipal water supply (or other water utilities), 56% is extraction of fresh groundwater, and 3% is extraction of salt water. The \"WATER DISCHARGE\" pie chart shows that 45% of the water goes to public sewers and 55% goes to a treatment plant in the hotel.\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n# CONTENTS **Management of biodiversity and ecosystems**GRI: 2-23; 2-24; 2-25; 3-3; 304-1; 304-2; 304-3\n\n#### ABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nTABLE OF\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4. COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, loss of biodiversity is the third greatest risk to the global economy in the medium term. This risk has been climbing the ranking since 2019 and is now approaching the same risk level of climate change and extreme weather phenomena. Over the next years, it is predicted that loss of capital will accelerate, with social, regulatory and financial demands and monitoring metrics related to this issue also increasing at the same time.\n\nIn the report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the United Nations highlighted the direct effects of human activities on the marine environment and the need to reduce our impact on endangered species. In relation to this, the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) published guidelines to help companies identify three different categories of risks: physical, transition and systemic.\n\nThe need to protect natural capital is becoming a requirement for companies, either because of the impact they may have on ecosystems, or because certain activities, such as tourism, make many destinations more attractive, a positive effect that also improves economic, social and environmental wellbeing.\n\nAt Meliá Hotels International, we are aware of the important role we play in material matters for our various stakeholders. Although biodiversity is currently only at a medium level of criticality, it is also associated with other more critical issues that require special attention due to their impact on ecosystems. These issues include waste management and the circular economy, responsible water management, promotion of a sustainable supply chain and climate action related to our activities.\n\n### **Our Commitment**\n\nDue to the unique location of some of our hotels, in 2017 the Board of Directors approved our Climate Change and Environment Policy, which established a series of principles to implement ethical, responsible and sustainable management, combat climate change by identifying opportunities to implement measures that help to protect biodiversity and habitats from the effects of climate change, and adopt measures to protect native fauna and flora by preserving biological diversity and the natural heritage of our tourist destinations.\n\nOne of our key focuses is to preserve ecosystems and protect native fauna and flora. We strive to mitigate the potential impact of our activities and to use natural resources in a responsible and efficient manner. As part of our commitment to biodiversity, we adopt measures that help in the struggle against climate change, minimise our impact and respond to the risks and opportunities resulting from said impact.\n\nWe look at biodiversity protection in a holistic manner, as a consequence of our Environmental Management System, which involves the design and construction of our hotels, the training of our teams and, finally, raising awareness among our customers.\n\nWe would like to move towards a hotel management model based on circularity, where we endeavour to reduce, recycle, reuse and/or progressively eliminate waste, while raising awareness and preserving our most valuable environments. Our current approach is mostly preventive, and we are well aware that in the near future we will need to take on a much more proactive role.\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\n| TABLE OF<br>CONTENTS                      | SCOPE                         | PREVENTATIVE MANAGEMENT                                                                                                                                                                                                 |  |  |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|\n|                                           | Compliance                    | • Compliance with applicable urban planning and environmental regulations                                                                                                                                               |  |  |\n| ABOUT THIS<br>REPORT                      | Infrastructure<br>& equipment | • Design and construction under sustainable criteria<br>• Efficient lighting systems with a low-energy and light impact<br>• Design of gardens and wooded areas that respecting local diversity                         |  |  |\n| 1.

Our ESG Risk Map takes into consideration the protection of biodiversity and maritime and inland areas when incorporating new assets. Tourists are also becoming increasingly aware of environmental protection, preferring to stay in hotels that adopt sustainable practices, such as the use of renewable energies, the reduction of waste and the implementation of environmentally friendly practices.\n\nSome tour operators, such as Booking or Expedia, ask us to update our offer in relation to sustainability, in order to enhance the profile of our business units and attract customers who are willing to choose hotels based on other criteria and even pay a higher price. That is why we participate in the Booking Sustainability Programme, which offers the following advantages:\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.

This certification integrates areas related to water quality, environmental information and education, safety, services and facilities, and environmental management, with the goal of keeping beaches and marine environments in optimal condition. In 2023, all our hotels in the Dominican Republic and two of our hotels in Mexico renewed their certifications.\n\nThe beaches are also cleaned every day to keep them in good condition and we continuously maintain our green areas and gardens, taking care of the habitats for the species that live there, carrying out inspections and environmental monitoring of the water, noise and atmospheric quality, informing the public about the year-long fishing ban, and demonstrating our commitment to preserving biodiversity through firm actions.\n\nThe beaches in the Dominican Republic are affected by large colonies of natural floating macroalgae (Sargassum) that are transported by ocean currents and wash up on the shores. As a result of this natural phenomenon, we need to clean the beaches on a daily basis at certain times of the year to help preserve the marine ecosystem. Once removed, this algae is used as an organic fertiliser in the hotel gardens as it is fantastic for promoting plant growth and stimulating germination, and it is also an effective acidity and mineral regulator.\n\n| INDICATOR               | UNIT | 2022    | 2023    | DIFF.  |\n|-------------------------|------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Volume collected        | m3   | 1,541   | 1,400   | -9.1%  |\n| Mass                    | Kg   | 690,369 | 582,400 | -15.6% |\n| Landscaping (refilling) | m3   | 375     | 468     | 24.8%  |\n\n### **Special Protection Areas**\n\nGRI: 304-1; 304-2; 304-3\n\nMany of the primarily holiday-based destinations where we operate offer significant natural wealth. As such, we work particularly hard to care for and protect these environments. We also see it as our responsibility to inform our customers about this natural wealth, helping them to understand and respect it through specific initiatives. Our teams also of course receive training with assistance from expert organisations to ensure they respect the ecosystems we come into contact with on a daily basis.\n\nWe use Protected Planet, the world's most comprehensive source of information about protected areas, to annually update the analysis of our hotels located in special protection areas, or those located nearby (no more than 2 km for holiday resorts of 0.5 km for city hotels).\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\nCONTENTS Although all special protection areas should be protected, the areas we focus the most on, whether it be through positive direct impacts or by minimising potential negative impacts, are our holiday resorts. These ecosystems are actually a key part of the appeal of these destinations and the direct area of influence of our hotels, which are particularly attractive due to their natural capital. A great example of this are the Balearic Islands, with their protected land and maritime areas that are home to invaluable biodiversity and a number of specially protected species of birds.\n\n> The Company focuses on 6 areas with particularly high levels of risk and impact: Tenerife, the island of La Palma, Fuerteventura, Ibiza, Mexico and the Dominican Republic. We operate 24 hotels across these destinations, which make up 18.9% of our owned and leased portfolio.\n\nWe see Mexico and the Dominican Republic as particularly important destinations, which is why we have installed specialist sustainability teams to guarantee the protection of native species and local biodiversity.\n\nIn 2023, our portfolio of owned and leased hotels occupied an estimated total surface area of 2,858,628 m<sup>2</sup>, 25.3% of which are located in protected areas or near to special protection areas.\n\nWhen providing our services, we always endeavour to use sustainable products and materials: cellulose and furniture made with certified and guaranteed wood, and environmentally friendly cleaning products.\n\n**HOTELS IN PROTECTED AREAS**\n\nImage /page/125/Figure/8 description: The image shows a world map and a table with data about hotels and surface area. The table is divided into two categories: Urban and Leisure. Under the Urban category, there are 8 hotels in total with a surface area of 31,089. Germany has 4 hotels with a surface area of 5,154. Spain has 1 hotel with a surface area of 1,822. Italy has 1 hotel with a surface area of 1,100. Venezuela has 2 hotels with a surface area of 23,013. Under the Leisure category, there are 27 hotels in total with a surface area of 691,600. Spain has 21 hotels with a surface area of 375,811. Mexico has 6 hotels with a surface area of 315,789. The overall total is 35 hotels with a surface area of 722,689.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4. COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### CONTENTS **Protection programmes**\n\nThe Company works hard to protect and preserve biodiversity, relying on the support of expert organisations in each field. In destinations where biodiversity is of particular importance, we form partnerships to ensure we meet our commitments. Below are two of our most notable initiatives:\n\n### **Welcome to Life**\n\nAward-winning programme for the protection and conservation of endangered species in Mexico. Since 2017, our partners, guests and their families have actively participated in the programme to learn about and protect biodiversity. To make this possible, we work alongside the government, local NGOs, suppliers and specialists in the management and monitoring of plant and animal species.\n\nWe also count on the support and participation of the local community, with volunteering activities and special events. Some of the key elements of the programme include training our teams on biodiversity protection, monitoring beach environments, relocating nests in risk areas, caring for hatchlings during their first five hours of life and recording the release of hatchlings for the birth census.\n\nIn Mexico we promote the Sea Turtle Protection Programme, to protect, conserve and recover this endangered species by protecting nests, promoting environmental awareness among our guests and employees, managing lighting, establishing nocturnal patrols to safeguard the nests, and ensuring that we comply with all applicable environmental regulations. Our dedication and hard work makes a significant contribution towards the preservation of this species.\n\nOur Paradisus Cancún and Meliá Cozumel hotels in the Mexican Caribbean actively participate in the conservation of sea turtles in the area and every year from May to November they launch an internal programme. In 2023, 160 guests, partners and local students volunteered to help us protect 250 nests and 26,973 eggs, and release 25,236 loggerhead sea turtle hatchlings (also known as Caretta caretta), figures that were confirmed by the local government and the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources.\n\nMeliá Puerto Vallarta and Paradisus Los Cabos also work to conserve and protect sea turtles, ensuring appropriate lighting on the beach to avoid distracting the hatchlings. In 2023, a total of 235 nests were protected, 22,571 eggs were relocated and a total of 13,665 hatchlings were released.\n\nAt Meliá, we recognise the importance of preserving bees, particularly in parts of the world with high levels of biodiversity. That is why, as part of the Welcome to Life project, Meliá Cozumel has formed an alliance with the Bee Friendly Cozumel Foundation, which has been recognised by the Government of Quintana Roo and the Secretariat of Environment. This initiative has led to the rescue of two honey-producing Mayan bee honeycombs within the hotel facilities. Throughout the course of the year, the hotel has collected over 620 kg of honey for consumption or use in its spa and wellness treatments.\n\n### **IMPACTS OF THE WELCOME TO LIFE PROJECT**\n\nImage /page/126/Figure/12 description: The image shows turtle conservation statistics for three resorts: Paradisus Cancun Resort, Paradisus Los Cabos, and ME Cabo. For Paradisus Cancun Resort, 6,500 turtles (White Loggerhead) are protected, and there are 1,256 volunteers (guests, staff, and students). For Paradisus Los Cabos, 13,000 turtles are released, 180 nests are protected, and 19,067 eggs are relocated. For ME Cabo, 11 turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) are protected, 2,855 hatchlings are released (+1,168 in situ), 37 turtle nests are protected (+13 nests in situ), and 1,454 eggs are relocated.\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **Environmental awareness**\n\nAs part of our drive to excel, we wanted to raise awareness about the importance of biodiversity in our most vulnerable environments. At two hotels in Mexico, we launched initiatives to raise awareness about the environment, involving 70 children in deprived areas from pre-school age to year 6 of primary school.\n\nAn environmental awareness presentation was given at the Dar Community Centre for the Niños de la Sierra, teaching them about sea turtles, their char-\n\nAt the end of the presentation, the children were given stuffed whales made from reused textiles by hotel employees, along with letters containing information about the whales, to teach the children about environmental issues.\n\nOur commitment for 2024 is to make further progress with biodiversity, aligning ourselves with the environmental taxonomy, whose objective is to\n\nincrease the importance of biodiversity within the tourism sector.\n\nacteristics and importance, and how to help protect them.\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE,\nETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.

COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nIn accordance with the Green Pact and the target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, in March 2022 the European Commission proposed the first series of measures to accelerate the transition towards a circular economy, including promotion of sustainable products, consumer awareness initiatives, a review of regulations on construction products and a sustainable textile strategy.\n\nOur *Climate Change and Environment Policy* sets out the following commitments to work towards a circular economy:\n\n- Implement a strategy to optimise the management of product life cycles through the development of measurement processes and the promotion of programmes to identify new alternatives for reducing food waste and single-use products, working in collaboration with our partners.\n- Optimise the life cycle of products, materials and resources, reducing the production of waste and its environmental impact, promoting a circular, sustainable and resource-efficient model, and fostering responsible management of waste generated through our hotel activities.\n\nWe are convinced that transitioning the hotel sector towards circularity is necessary to ensure a sustainable future for all our destinations. But we are also well aware of the challenges and opportunities involved in this area, both at an operational level and in terms of its impact on our business. Some of the main challenges we have faced so far are as a result of the highly fragmented nature of our company, involving various destinations and circumstances, along with the different ownership structures and the heterogeneity of actors.\n\nIf we want to respond to all the major challenges and make progress in terms of circularity and recycling, we need to identify the key actors in all the countries where we operate and coordinate efforts at every level, involving employees, customers and waste managers, to ensure that we identify opportunities and share the same objectives. It is undeniable that the transition towards a circular economy requires actors in the value chain to be committed and focused, offering the Company resources and solutions to promote a green economy.\n\nOur commitment is primarily focused on minimising waste generated through our activities, and identifying those activities that produce the most waste within the scope of hotel operations. Most improvements inevitably revolve around transforming the way we handle materials, from the purchase of goods to our construction processes and how we use materials in our activities.\n\nWe have implemented a reduction circular ecosystem, which is key to us transitioning towards a more sustainable business model, with the ability to generate economic and inclusive growth in the areas where we operate and to reduce our environmental footprint and impact, contributing towards the public commitments we have taken on.\n\nHazardous waste is generally collected on a regular basis by the suppliers themselves, as they are responsible for managing and recycling it. This year we also launched a bidding process in Spain to not only manage and ensure the circularity of this kind of waste, but also to measure the volume generated. It is worth noting, however, that the volume of this type of waste is minimal when compared to the volume of non-hazardous waste produced.\n\nIn our case, the Group's hotels carry out a range of activities that can largely be grouped into the accommodation and *food & beverage (F&B)* categories, with the waste generated being managed in accordance with the laws in the countries where we operate.\n\n122\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/129/Picture/1 description: The image shows a house icon next to the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\".\n\nImage /page/129/Figure/3 description: This image is a flowchart that illustrates the destination of waste. The flowchart starts with four categories: Food, F&B, Packaging, Construction, and Cleaning. Food waste comes from the Kitchen and includes Organic Leftovers, which are sent to Compost. F&B waste comes from Restaurants, including A la carte and Buffet, which produce Organic Leftovers, Excess exposed, and Excess NOT exposed waste, all of which are sent to Compost. Packaging waste is divided into Single use and Reusable, which are sent to Recycling. Construction and Cleaning waste are divided into Dangerous and Not Dangerous, with the Not Dangerous waste being sent to Recycling. The Destination of Waste section includes Glass, Plastic, Paper/Carboard, Organic, and Reject, which are sent to Recycling, Compost, and Waste, respectively. The Recycling Bins section includes Recycling, Compost, and Waste.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n### CONTENTS **Progress and opportunities**\n\nAt Meliá, we are working to establish a strategy that will help us promote a circular model, aligning us with the European target to recycle 55% of all urban waste in 2025. We also assess opportunities to form partnerships that can support us through this transition process, one key example being our participation in the Circular Hotels initiative.\n\nWe view circularity as an essential part of our transition towards a more\n\nin nature.

In recent years, our commitment in this area has evolved towards a much more global and strategic approach, adapted to the context in which we live.\n\nOur organic waste is primarily generated during the production and preparation of our food products, consisting of leftovers of products that have been prepared and not consumed. Aside from being an ethical imperative, we must also tailor our offer and service to take into account the consumption habits of our customers.\n\nOur goal is to manage a responsible and sustainable production chain, and to improve our production processes to **reduce waste**. In this respect, we are working on a number of initiatives aimed at balancing supply with demand and, consequently, minimising food waste.\n\nAs a result of the need to make progress in this area, Meliá has launched various initiatives designed to **reduce food waste** and has established a model of good practices to minimise the impact of our activities:\n\n- Adjusting production to the number of guests and the service being offered.\n- Reducing packaging by purchasing compostable coffee beans and coffee capsules.\n- Developing training on food waste, with preventive plans and production control tools.\n- Adapting and standardising products used to optimise stock and analyse production ratios for events and groups.\n- Receiving feedback from customers about our culinary offer, to avoid wastage\n- Putting up posters with messages to promote awareness.\n- Managing and measuring our food services to customers who have paid for board.\n- Establishing central kitchens to improve efficiency and consolidating critical processes.\n\nImage /page/131/Picture/26 description: The image shows a statistic related to TGTG HOTELS (KG).

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nBy consolidating our globally recognised employer brand, we offer a more unique employee experience, seeking to provide a culture and values that set us apart from our competitors, and strengthening our team's connection with the Company's purpose.\n\nIn recent years, people management has undergone a real revolution; trends have changed and employees require greater flexibility, job satisfaction and training. Used to reactively managing business demands, human resources is regaining its position in the management structure and is making a major contribution to the company's results.\n\nWithin this new context, business growth, profitability and sustainability are closely linked to our ability to attract, retain and manage talent. With our management tools, we aim to provide a rapid, agile, effective and optimal response to our employees. We use technology to offer a service based on quality and agility standards for our employees. We use platforms that help us to simplify and streamline critical operational processes, we have designed a reporting system or dashboard with the main indicators that offer a range of possibilities for analysis, management and control, and most importantly a People Analytics tool that helps us to interpret such important indicators for human resources management as turnover and absenteeism. Social media and new platforms allow us to 'disintermediate' with the recruitment market and directly access the very best professionals.\n\nWithout a doubt, our greatest challenge and concern right now is the \"war for talent\", which involves every industry. This is exacerbated within tourism as the sector has become less appealing due to the considerable loss of talent during the pandemic. Against this backdrop, we also have housing shortages and the rising cost of living, especially in successful holiday destinations.\n\nAll these factors have increased the degree of exposure to risks related mainly to ensuring adequate global and comprehensive talent management, from attracting and retaining talent to minimising talent drain and consolidating an organisational structure that allows for development and growth.\n\n### **Governance and organisational model**\n\nAt Meliá Hotels International, we have implemented a global *Human Resources Policy*, which was approved by the Board of Directors in June 2019. It outlines the basic principles for respecting workers' rights, guaranteeing a suitable work environment, preventing occupational hazards and managing talent to enable employees to develop professionally.\n\nIt is framed and approved in accordance with the specific commitments the Company has made to its employees in the Code of Ethics. The Company must also comply with all regulations in force in each of the countries where it operates, striving to make constant improvements in this area, in line with our corporate values. This Policy is available to all interested parties on the company website.\n\nWe also have our own *Human Rights Policy***,** which was approved by the Board of Directors in July 2018. It reinforces all of the Company's commitments contained within the Code of Ethics and other corporate policies that have a direct or indirect impact on human rights. Its approval and publication strengthen the Company's governance model, which it developed in 2008, integrating various essential principles established by different universal texts.\n\n128\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn June 2023, the Board of Directors approved the Diversity Policy, which establishes the principles, guidelines and main lines of action in matters of diversity and inclusion that should guide the governance of the Company, ensuring equal opportunities and non-discrimination on grounds of race, skin colour, sexual orientation, age, gender, culture, work, disability, ideology, religion, or any other characteristics, with diversity and inclusion declared as values to be protected and consolidated in the workplace.\n\n### **A more business-focused organisation**\n\nIn 2022, we launched an ambitious organisational and cultural transformation programme as part of our *Roadto2024* strategic roadmap to transform our work environment and job roles, and to make certain improvements that were needed, leading to a more inclusive, diverse and equitable society.\n\nThe programme groups the priority actions into three main pillars: Organisational Model, Culture with Purpose and Value Proposition. All three involve initiatives that aim to transform the organisation into a more agile, efficient and interconnected company, enhancing our value proposition to motivate and strengthen our teams.\n\nA framework aimed at the Company's leaders that integrates a wide range of actions in the field of human resources management, to strengthen our employer brand, enhance our leadership in training and development, and empower our teams to improve agility, digitisation and operational efficiency.\n\n### **Consolidating the Leading a New Future organisational model**\n\nThis new structure will significantly change how we work, interact, behave and organise ourselves, enhancing our agility and boosting profitability in a world that is becoming increasingly competitive and demanding. It integrates our corporate vision into the hotel business under the same umbrella, with the goal of consolidating a service culture with a focus on our hotels, placing the customer and the hotel at the centre of our organisational model.\n\nImage /page/135/Figure/9 description: The image shows four text boxes arranged horizontally. The first box is titled \"Hotel and Customer Centric\" and contains the text \"Hotels and customers at the heart of the organisation This focus on the business will determine the way the rest of the structure is organised.\" The second box is titled \"Agile and Profitable\" and contains the text \"An agile and profitable organisation in an industry that is increasingly competitive and always changing.\" The third box is titled \"Hotel Services Oriented\" and contains the text \"Corporate areas have been reorganised to provide a more agile and efficient service to the business.\" The fourth box is titled \"Digital and Analitycs\" and contains the text \"A total transformation as part of a digitalisation process we have named Be Digital 360.\"\n\n**ORGANISATIONAL MODEL BASED ON 4 PILLARS**\n\nThis new approach lays the foundations to consolidate a more efficient, digital and competitive organisation, preserving the immutable principle developed through our 65 years of history: vocation of service. This hallmark is reflected in the daily work of all the company's employees.\n\nThis model is strengthening our capacity as managers, by prioritising the quality service provided by our Hotel Services teams. Our commitment to an expansion focused on management and franchising requires the Hotel Services areas to put together specialist teams that are functionally focused on the development of innovative projects and solutions, to provide greater value to the business, alongside teams located in certain areas/destinations that guarantee the implementation of our management system.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n#### **3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nCONTENTS The model enables us to adapt to the specific nature of our industry and respond quickly and efficiently to any new needs that may be identified.\n\n> This transformation was born out of the desire to promote a new philosophy in our management model based on fluid and direct communication between our hotels and operations centres. The Company currently has a total of 25 centres in operation.\n\nA Role Model has also been established, to develop professional development pathways for the main operational areas. This informs teams about growth opportunities and can be found on our intranet.\n\nIn addition, under the Operations framework, the hotel structures and positions (Job Descriptions) for each job have been reviewed, adapted, standardised and published on the intranet, and a catalogue has been created with all the current positions.\n\n### **Organisational model in business units**\n\nWith this new structure, we needed to inform our teams about the updated organisational model and promote transparency, knowledge and understanding. The objective is for our employees to lead the change and it is important that the approved model be clear and credible, including the catalogue of services that the different Hotel Services areas must provide to the hotel.\n\nThere have been many significant advances made this year, consolidating the new organisational model, moving us towards a more agile, efficient and responsible organisational structure, and reinforcing our focus on service, a value that is essential for successful hotel management.\n\nTo measure our progress against the objectives we have set ourselves, we designed a new Internal Service Survey. The main objective of this is to obtain feedback on the services provided by the different departments attached to Hotel & Corporate Services and our business areas. The purpose of this survey is to identify our strengths and areas for improvement, which will help to guide and develop an action plan to continually improve our service. The 2nd Service Survey is scheduled for release in early 2024 and will allow us to see the progress we have made since the last survey.\n\nTo support this ambitious and transformational organisational change we needed to promote a number of initiatives or projects, which will minimise any lack of understanding and ensure that the model is integrated into each affected role, with the goal of bringing our corporate areas closer to the real heart of our business: our hotels.\n\n#### **HOTEL AND CORPORATE RELATIONSHIP INITIATIVES**\n\n### **\"In Good Company\" Podcast**\n\nA new internal communication format to raise awareness about the leaders of the new organisational structure and the functions in each area so that people can see what they do and the services they oer our hotels.\n\n#### **\"The human side of change\" programme**\n\nAimed at company executives to assist them in the transformation process and strengthen their relationships. Networking as a key tool in ensuring internal unity in the face of strategic challenges, working on change management, psychological safety, trust and coherence.\n\n### **\"Destination Meliá, a journey to service\"**\n\nProgramme for all the Hotel Services and Corporate Services teams to make a service vocation the genuine hallmark of our people's identity.\n\nThe programme will continue in 2023, using specific tools to strengthen service behaviours in each department and with special attention to the owners of managed or franchised hotels.\n\n### **\"Discover our hotels\"**\n\nMonthly webinars to learn more about the company's key hotels and most notable new hotel openings led by the operations teams and the teams from each hotel. They raise awareness about hotel operations, the value they contribute to the company's portfolio and the challenges faced by their teams.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n### CONTENTS **Characteristics of our workforce**\n\n#### GRI: 2-7; 401-1; 405-1\n\nThe tourism sector is a lever for generating opportunities and employment, offering possibilities to a wide range of profiles to cover all the needs within hotels and corporate structures. Hotel companies require a wide array of different talents, so they employ people from a varied range of backgrounds. This creates a very rich and diverse work environment.\n\nAs of the end of 2023, the Company is active in 14 countries, operating 127 hotels with a total of 31,870 rooms.\n\nAs a result of the Group's new organisational structure, the incorporation of new hotels and the repositioning of some business units to a segment or brand with higher added value, our workforce has continued to grow over recent years, increasing by 8.7% in comparison to 2022.\n\nThe information below shows an improvement in the key indicators related to workforce characteristics.\n\nThe Company operates a total of 166 hotels under one management model, implementing its system according to the same principles, policies, standards and criteria that are common to all the hotels owned by the Group. Our international presence strengthens our position as a management company and our understanding of the sector, given our presence and experience in\n\nOur strong international presence offers many opportunities to all of our employees, enabling them to develop their career anywhere in the world.

This has become an effective, efficient and essential source of recruitment to find the best talent and an opportunity to begin a career in a sector that is constantly growing.\n\nWe know how important it is to take advantage of the talent we find through internships, which is why we offer opportunities for them to continue working for our organisation after their training.\n\nWe also endeavour to ensure that our COUPA platform registers all workers and service providers, who carry out work in our hotels under a service provision contract, reinforcing health and safety criteria both in the supplier approval process and during the provision of the service in our hotel facilities.\n\nOur commitment for 2024 is to get even better at recording this information, to improve the integration of service providers into COUPA.\n\n### **Value Management System**\n\nGRI: 2-23; 2-24; 3-3\n\nThe culture at Meliá Hotels International is based on our mission and our values, which are central to the Company's identity. These values encapsulate our corporate slogan, *Leisure at heart, business in mind*, expressing this perfect harmony that defines our philosophy: the balance between heart and mind, between the exceptional hospitality we offer and our excellent and rigorous management.\n\n- SERVICE VOCATION born from our background in hospitality.\n- EXCELLENCE AND CONSISTENCY, because we like to do things well, with professionalism and efficiency.\n- CLOSENESS, because we love to share, listen and feel.\n- INNOVATION, because we think ahead and innovate to be better every day.\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/23 description: The image shows the number of employees in the value chain (FTES).

Our human resources processes support our employees throughout the employment life cycle: talent attraction, hiring, training and development.\n\nWe maintain a close relationship with our employees to identify and mitigate any potential impact on our management model, opening various communication channels to ensure we are always aware of any concerns coming from our teams.\n\nWe ensure that our employees can carry out their work in an environment free of exploitation, without exception, and offer the following guarantees, among others: compliance with minimum working age, fair treatment in hiring processes, access to training and development opportunities, equal pay and non-discrimination, work-life balance options, respect for labour rights and holidays, safe working environments and access to social benefits of various kinds.\n\nTo establish a culture of respect and protection of human rights, the involvement of employees is key. This is something we are well aware of, which is why our intranet includes a section with specific human rights information. We want all of our partners to be aware of, understand and share not only our commitments and how they are integrated into our management model, but also our perspective of an issue that is so fundamental to achieving a better future.\n\nWith this objective in mind, through our online eMeliá platform, we train our entire workforce on issues that affect human rights, such as ethics, compliance, anti-corruption, equality, diversity, and occupational health and safety, among others.\n\nImage /page/138/Figure/15 description: The image is a graphic with the title \"Our heart: vocation for service\" in the center.

This discussion centres around strengths, areas of improvement and the implementation of our values, with the key moment being when both parties come up with a development plan together for the employee. Our talent development section provides development programmes that include performance reviews and support for all employees.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONTENTS For the second year running, this process has been rolled out globally to all employees who have been with the company for at least 6 months, using the Human Resource Department's global management tool.\n\n> In 2023, we looked at how to incorporate new challenges into those already faced by our leaders, as well as the essential levers used in the leadership\n\n> We added the 180º Evaluation to this process for our leaders, updating the usual yearly development discussion with an assessment from their manager and feedback from their hierarchical and functional team, to identify strengths and opportunities for improvement, helping them to grow both personally and professionally.

And the tourism industry has not escaped this dilemma. As a result of the pandemic, it has suffered a significant loss of talent and must now look for profiles with a more diverse and technology-based skill set, to meet the needs of the transformation process it is currently undergoing.\n\nThere are a number of measures that can and should be adopted to respond to this new challenging reality. Some of them will of course have a direct impact on human resource management, to bring management in line with the business, supporting both the employees and the business, and maintaining both the human and digital sides of the company.\n\n133\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.

To achieve this, we endeavour to offer an appealing value proposition that meets employee expectations, without forgetting to emphasise our competitiveness as an employer brand, rooted in our values and culture. This approach aims to highlight what we can offer and to help the tourism sector recover, making it more appealing for professionals from other sectors, as an industry where they can work and develop professionally.\n\n> The decision taken to design our image as an employer with a focus on the importance of marketing to attract and develop valuable candidates for our company has enabled the Group to not only position itself as an attractive employer in the labour market, but also to often beat the competition in the race to attract the best candidates and triumph in the famous War for Talent.\n\n> We began our growth journey in 2022 and this year we have managed to double the figure we achieved last year, reflecting the growing interest in and recognition of our value proposition. We are proud of having made it to the finals of the Hospitality Awards and winning the title of TOP EMPLOYER in eight different countries and at the Best in Travel awards, strengthening our commitment to excellence in talent management and our reputation within the hotel sector.\n\n> With our vibrant and modern visual identity, our employees are the key focus at every stage, from recruitment to professional development and visibility of internal opportunities. Through these actions we aim to inspire employees and offer the best possible experience at every stage of their journey with Meliá.\n\n> We established a series of targets to measure the impact of our employer brand in channels such as Instagram and LinkedIn, with the following objectives:\n\n- Establish a framework for filling vacancies with both external and internal candidates, offering clarity, transparency and order to hiring managers who need to recruit talent in their departments.\n- Standardise recruitment processes, making them more rigorous, agile, efficient and aligned with internal regulations.\n- Support the company's evolution and ensure sustainable development of its activities.\n- Promote internal growth of employees, ensuring that professional opportunities are communicated throughout the company, with equal opportunities.\n\nMeliá *Careers* is our new brand and platform for communicating our talent needs worldwide. Its end goal is to make the candidate the core focus of our talent search and recruitment activities, just as our marketing and sales departments put customers at the centre of their processes.\n\n(2023 target: 5%) **LINKEDIN ENGAGEMENT** 4.77%\n\n(2023 target: 8%)\n\n**INSTAGRAM ENGAGEMENT**\n\n5%\n\nThis year, the Company has developed three initiatives designed to attract talent with the best skill sets and create loyalty.\n\nImage /page/141/Figure/21 description: The image shows a circular diagram with the words \"MELIÁ CAREERS\" at the top.

Its objective is to enhance the appeal of the tourism sector, while also highlighting the unique nature of our Company's proposal.\n\nAll of our employees perform their roles with great enthusiasm and help us to strengthen our brand image, boost the commitment of our team and promote internal development. To inspire candidates, we link the brand proposal and employee experience to the core essence of the Company: travel and passion.\n\n#### **Talent Days**\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5. SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nLargescale recruitment events that generate a major impact and improve our hiring processes. They enable us to evaluate and hire a large number of candidates over a short period of time, streamline the selection process and increase our temporary workforce, which is essential to the hotel industry due to seasonal fluctuations in demand.\n\nIt is essential to carefully manage key processes such as planning and execution, not only to ensure we hire quality candidates and effectively manage new employees, but also to guarantee a positive impact and provide the opportunity to visualise certain behaviours by fostering team dynamics.\n\n#### **Inbound and Outbound Talent**\n\nThis initiative is focused on recruiting employees for seasonal hotels, attracting and retaining employees who work during certain periods of the year and offering them the opportunity to continue their careers in positions both in Spain and abroad.\n\nThis initiative offers a wide range of benefits, such as the flexibility of being able to assign employees according to the fluctuating demand at different locations; employee mobility, with opportunities for professional growth and development; stronger commitment to the Company; a greater retention ratio; and a more diverse set of skills, as employees gain experience working for different brands and/or in different countries.\n\nIt also contributes towards organisational cohesion by promoting a unified company culture and sharing best practices in different locations. When implementing the initiative, it was crucial to manage this mobility with a balanced approach to avoid any potential logistical challenges and ensure that employees feel supported during their transition.\n\n### **Inspiring Friends**\n\nAn initiative to engage employees as brand ambassadors to identify and attract new talent. Participating employees receive financial compensation for referring friends and acquaintances that meet certain performance criteria and are available for the required period.\n\nThe successful implementation of this initiative has had many positive effects on the organisation:\n\n- Stimulating participation and commitment from employees by offering financial incentives for their help in searching for talent.\n- Improving the quality of recruitments, as employees tend to refer people that they know well and that will fit in with the company culture.\n- Strengthening the internal professional network by promoting an environment with collaborative and solid relationships between colleagues.\n- Streamlining the recruitment process by providing a constant flow of recommended candidates.\n- Guaranteeing equality and preventing conflicts of interest through the development of clear and transparent policies.\n\nImage /page/142/Picture/24 description: The image shows the text 'VERY INSPIRING PEOPLE CVS RECEIVED' in green, followed by the number '51,215' in gray, and then '(+2,180%)' in gray.\n\nImage /page/142/Picture/25 description: The image shows the number of people who attended Talent Days.

With this in mind, we cultivate a culture of continual growth that promotes constant improvements to individual performance. The aim is to prepare our employees to respond to challenges effectively and to promote innovation in a proactive way, thus fostering commitment to the organisation. All of this should make us more competitive as a company and elevate our people.\n\nTo achieve this, we use tools for identifying and evaluating talent, along with professional development and growth programmes.\n\n### **Identifying and evaluating internal talent**\n\nWe have launched a number of on-demand processes for identifying and evaluating employees who have worked with us for at least a year, a system meticulously designed to expand knowledge and stimulate professional growth among our employees.\n\n#### **Talent Map**\n\nThis map is designed to identify entry-level and middle-management employees with exceptional performance and clear potential for promotion, transfer or incorporation into task forces in key projects. It offers employees in middle or lower ranking positions the opportunity to be recognised, evaluated and included in development and growth programmes.\n\n### **Talent Meeting**\n\nThe performance review process plays a key role in identifying and establishing talent development objectives. As part of our constant drive to optimise development and promotions, we are taking this process one step further to calibrate the results obtained in the performance review through Talent Meeting sessions.\n\n| OBJECTIVE                   | TOOLS                          | PROGRAMMES                     | FOCUS                                                                         | BENEFITS FOR<br>EMPLOYEES                                                       | BENEFITS FOR<br>MELIÁ                                                                                                       |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| EVALUATE<br>INTERNAL TALENT | TALENT<br>IDENTIFICATION       | TALENT MAPPING                 | Identification<br>of department<br>managers and entry-<br>level profiles      | Access to<br>development and<br>growth programmes                               | Identification of<br>high-value profiles<br>Fill hotel vacancies                                                            |\n|                             |                                | TALENT MEETING                 | Talent ranking for<br>hotel executives<br>and managers and<br>corporate staff | Fair evaluation<br>process<br>Access to<br>development and<br>growth programmes | Annual talent<br>evaluation<br>Identification of<br>potential successor<br>for key positions<br>Creation of action<br>plans |\n|                             | POTENTIAL TALENT<br>EVALUATION | TALENT<br>ASSESSMENT<br>CENTER | Evaluation<br>of motivated<br>employees with high<br>potential                | They can start a<br>career in their area of<br>interest                         | Fill vacancies with<br>high-potential<br>profiles                                                                           |\n\n**EVALUATING TALENT**\n\nWe use these sessions to compare and contrast reviews performed by different evaluators, applying a global approach. The goal is reduce individual bias and promote equality and transparency throughout the entire process. This approach reaffirms our commitment to apply rigorous and fair talent management processes.\n\nImage /page/143/Picture/13 description: The image shows the text 'CVS' in green, followed by the number '104,126' in a large, gray font. Below the number, the text '(+136%)' is displayed in a smaller font size.\n\nThe results enable us to make decisions and optimise our activities in the area of talent management, providing growth opportunities to employees that offer high potential and have achieved an impressive level of performance. This comprehensive approach improves the quality and suitability of our team, optimising their performance and alignment with the company's objectives.\n\nWithin this framework we identify and evaluate three key factors: experience, potential and passion. By assessing these three areas, we are able to plan talent development initiatives.\n\nWe have identified over 100 employees who are capable of taking on new responsibilities and we are developing succession plans for these valuable, high-potential profiles.\n\n**TALENT MAP** 681\n\nImage /page/143/Figure/18 description: The image shows the text \"VALUABLE PROFILES\" in green, followed by the number \"54%\" in gray.\n\nImage /page/143/Picture/19 description: The image contains the text \"HOTEL AND CORPORATE EXECUTIVE PROFILES\" in a teal color.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe talent calibration process is accompanied by an action plan that helps us to make progress in areas where employees need to improve or develop additional skills. This action plan is divided into training and development activities, offering a structured framework that covers specific areas of improvement and promotes continuous development. This strategy significantly helps us to improve both the individual and collective performance of our workforce.\n\n### **Development programmes**\n\nProgrammes carefully designed to expand knowledge and promote professional growth. They take into consideration the unique characteristics of each role, anticipate future needs and develop specific and transferrable skills. They also offer internal growth opportunities to fill vacancies, whether they be at business units or corporate offices.\n\nIn 2023 we strengthened our commitment to talent development by setting ourselves the target of including 2% of our employees in development initiatives, using the average annual workforce at hotels and strategic destinations as a reference.\n\nDue to the Group's continuing growth and expansion, the Company needs to attract and hire new talent to meet its current and future needs. To do this, we develop programmes directed at young talent and recent graduates with the aim of attracting people to join our teams who can bridge gaps within the company and enrich it with new skills and abilities.\n\n### **Executive Graduate Programme**\n\nDesigned exclusively for recent graduates, with the goal of offering participants the opportunity to develop specific leadership and management skills. Its main objective is to facilitate a fluid transition from academic life to the professional world, through practical experience that will provide the necessary skills to enable them to take on roles with greater responsibility and advance quickly along their professional career.\n\nThis programme prepares eleven future talent profiles, enabling us to anticipate and cover vacancies in the medium and long term.\n\n#### **PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT**\n\n| OBJECTIVE                   | INITIATIVE                                                            | PROGRAMMES

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe first MBA promoted by the Company to train participants through a study plan. In partnership with the *Vatel Hotel & Business School*, we teach\n\nour students the essential skills and expertise they will need to effectively lead and manage hotel companies from a data-analysis perspective. The study plan combines a range of courses related to business and information technology.\n\nThe six participants will develop skills in key areas such as statistics, data analysis, data visualisation, business modelling, business strategy and leadership. They will also explore aspects specific to the hotel industry, including customer experience management, pricing and supply chain management.\n\n#### **Job Training Plan**\n\nA programme designed for entry-level employees who achieve optimal performance when performing their functions and responsibilities at the hotel. The primary objective is to ensure that these employees with potential are trained in all areas of their respective departments, improving their current performance to ensure their employability in the long term.\n\n### **Professional Development Plan**\n\nWhen young talent joins us, we review their performance to determine their future within the company. Along these lines, the *Professional Development Plan* provides training for employees with potential, helping them grow and take on roles with greater responsibility. This plan includes an operational roadmap, a skill development plan and an online training itinerary, available on the e-Meliá training platform. This programme encompasses various areas related to hotel operations and management.\n\nThe performance and/or progress of participants is reviewed periodically, to ensure that they are reaching their established goals and can progress in their professional career. All of this provides a solid basis for internal leadership while disseminating our culture and values to new generations. In 2022, we performed a review of the Plan with our hotels, resulting in higher participation in the system this year.\n\n### **Initiating the Journey**\n\nIntended for department managers who have been identified as having potential to start a career in Hotel Management, offering them a meticulously designed action plan to expand their global vision of business and introduce them to the key functions involved in hotel management.\n\nThese evaluations are critical in our talent management model, providing a clear understanding of the skills, qualities, ambitions and goals of our employees, reducing the talent leak and giving us a view of our internal talent pool of experienced candidates who are aligned with the expectations of our employees.\n\nParticipants who successfully make it through the Assessment Center process are included in the Hotel Management Talent Pool, a career programme that enables them to obtain a management position.\n\n48% of the group in Development is promoted in 2023 or is ready to be promoted.\n\n1.8% of our total workforce is currently participating in development programmes, and our objective is to reach 2% in 2024.\n\n#### **Developing Executive Talent**\n\nWe have launched a number of on-demand processes for evaluating employees who have worked with us for at least a year, a system meticulously designed to expand knowledge and stimulate professional growth among our employees.\n\nImage /page/145/Picture/25 description: The image shows the text 'JOB TRAINING PLAN PARTICIPANTS' in green, followed by the number '139' in a larger, gray font.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nAn annual process to promote a culture of continual feedback through dialogue between employees and managers. This discussion centres around strengths, areas of improvement and the implementation of our values, ending with both parties coming up with a development plan together for the employee.\n\n### **Designed for established department managers and entry-level staff**\n\nThe programme offers a personalised work plan for each participant based on three fundamental pillars, which together form a development plan: experimentation and practice, developing skills and applying new expertise.\n\n### **Hotel Management Development**\n\n### **Hotel Management Talent Pool**\n\nThe programme fosters internal rotation to offer participants broad experience about the different hotel types, segments and brands, which will help to give them a global understanding of the organisation. They will receive training where they will learn specific skills, be mentored by an experienced executive and participate in strategic projects, along with other learning opportunities.\n\nThe programme offers a personalised work plan for each participant based on three fundamental pillars, which together form a development plan: experimentation and practice, developing skills and applying new expertise.\n\n22 new participants joined this programme in 2023, with 69% of them being promoted or transferred.\n\n### **Support Programmes**\n\nThese programmes serve two purposes. Firstly, they offer support and guidance during the implementation and consolidation of our new organisational model, and secondly, they offer personalised counselling and orientation for our leaders. The main objective is to develop and strengthen the skills and abilities of our leaders, enabling them to achieve their professional goals, whether that be in their current role or for future roles.\n\n### **Mentoring**\n\nThis programme has two objectives: firstly, to support the work of Hotel Managers who are Mentors for our Management Talent Pool, and secondly, to guide Mentees (members of the Talent Pool) in their development process as future Managers at MHI.\n\nThis 12-month programme begins with a pair of 2-day workshops for mentors and mentees to inform participants about the key aspects involved in a mentoring programme, the expectations and the practical tools they will use for their respective functions.\n\nThe mentor will also receive personalised support from a coach throughout the programme to help resolve any queries that may arise from the process, and once a month they will receive a newsletter with topics of interest for them to reflect on and share with their mentees.\n\n### **DRIVE Programme**\n\nAn internal initiative designed to support and motivate our best leaders, in both hotel and corporate environments. The main objective is to adapt executive talent to new competitive requirements and emerging roles.\n\nThrough comprehensive analysis of their profile, we create a personalised roadmap for each leader, with training programmes, cross-exposure training, and personalised coaching and/or mentoring sessions.\n\nImage /page/146/Picture/27 description: The image contains the words \"HOTEL EXECUTIVES AND CORPORATE PERSONNEL IN PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT\" in green font.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nCONTENTS One unique aspect of this programme is the ability to objectively evaluate the skills of participants through the use of psychometric testing. These tests enable us to compare the strengths of the participant against an ideal profile, enabling us to precisely identify areas of growth. This methodology also establishes measurable indicators to evaluate individual progress and a clear vision of the return on investment of our actions. Five hours are dedicated to assessing the participant and providing feedback on results. An individual action plan is then established, adapted to their needs and the results obtained.\n\n> This programme involves participation from prestigious partners, who provide the executive talent with a view of the market and ensure continuous and sustainable growth, making it one of the most popular programmes among our internal employees.\n\n### **Coaching Programme**\n\nDeveloped in partnership with *CoachHub* to improve the performance of participants and develop the skills they need for their current role. The programme includes occasional participation from managers, turning some coaching sessions into three-way interactions that ensure effective alignment with organisational objectives.\n\nDuring a period of 4-6 months, participants will have access to limited sessions with a coach of their choice, where they can discuss key aspects relating to professional growth, emotional wellbeing, stress management, change management, performance enhancement and new skills, among others. This personalised approach provides comprehensive support for individual development and success.\n\n### **Senior and Junior Development Workshops**\n\nInteractive and practical sessions that combine theory, practical exercises, group discussions and, in some cases, feedback activities, to teach participants new skills or enhance their current abilities.\n\nFor our senior management talent, we have developed the Leading Diversity workshop, which includes the development of skills and abilities that participants will need to lead diverse teams effectively and with sensitivity.\n\nTo foster personal awareness and promote practical tools for both personal and professional growth, we promote self-knowledge to guide participants in the exploration of their skills, motivations, emotions and areas of development.\n\n### **Hotel Leadership Group**\n\nThe performance and/or progress of participants in development programmes is reviewed periodically, to ensure that they are reaching their established goals and can progress in their professional career. All of this provides a solid foundation to guarantee return on investment while also ensuring these actions are aligned with our strategic objectives.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning another series of actions that have a global impact on our company culture.\n\n### **We see training as a major lever for retaining talent**\n\nGRI: 2-23; 2-24; 2-25; 3-3; 404-2\n\nOur talent training and development division offers programmes designed to help employees adapt continuously to the needs of our business, as well as the current multicultural, digitised and ever-changing environment we find ourselves in. The aim is to provide every employee with the tools they need to develop key skills that will promote both personal and professional growth, including technological and digital skills, communication, emotional intelligence and transformational leadership.\n\nTo support this mission, our plan was to invest 0.6% of our social cost in training and talent development initiative, an objective that we achieved. We aim to increase this percentage to 1% over the next two years, reaffirming our commitment to the training and development of our internal talent. This is calculated based on the total investment made, divided by the Company's total social cost.\n\nImage /page/147/Picture/18 description: The image shows the text \"DRIVE PROGRAMME PARTICIPANTS\" in green, followed by the number \"76\" in gray.\n\n(NPS 79) *COACHING PROGRAMME*  **PARTICIPANTS**\n\nImage /page/147/Picture/20 description: The image shows the number 110 in a large font, followed by the text \"(Rating 4.9/5)\" in a smaller font.\n\nImage /page/147/Picture/21 description: The image shows the number of workshop participants.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe results are obtained by adding the total positive responses (7 to 10) to the total responses in the Commitment Index.\n\nOnce the feedback collection process has been completed, the results are shared with each centre or department and the manager commits to fulfil the action plan themselves, ensuring that the team's identified objectives are achieved. The report with the overall responses also serves as a basis for developing a global action plan, to improve the variables with the lowest rating.\n\nAs a result of the feedback collected in the survey, we identified the need to enhance agility, effective communication and wellbeing in our daily lives by focusing on managing meetings and emails in a more efficient way. As a result we launched Meliá Talks, an initiative that offers guidance and recommendations to foster a culture of continuous improvement, making both meetings and emails key levers for good performance and managing the wellbeing of our teams.\n\nAnother initiative developed to generate a positive atmosphere is the Meliá Celebration calendar, which fosters a sense of belonging among our employees through weekly themed celebrations and international days, with global awareness activities and local events. This year we celebrated two themed weeks: Meliá *Diversity Week* and Meliá *Wellbeing Week*. They promoted messages such as the importance of a healthy diet and lifestyle (nutrition, exercise and our \"My Wellbeing\" programme), with options ranging from nutritional advice to therapeutic sessions.\n\nFinally, as another part of our constant feedback ecosystem, we implemented a standardised procedure for employees who choose to leave the company, with an Exit Interview designed to find out their personal reasons for leaving. To support line managers and the Human Resources Department, support guides have been designed with recommendations for the interview, to guide the conversation in a satisfactory way for both parties, creating a comfortable environment where the employee feels comfortable and safe to express their opinions and share their feelings freely, and, for its part, the Company will receive feedback to make decisions and avoid similar departures, thus improving the employee experience.\n\n### **Equality, Diversity and Inclusion**\n\nGRI: 2-23; 2-24; 2-25; 3-3\n\nIn recent years, the principles of equality, diversity and inclusion have proved to be essential factors in the competitiveness of a company, with a wealth of initiatives being developed to further integrate these principles into business strategies and models.\n\nAt Meliá, diversity has always been a powerful driver for competitiveness, as reflected by the Company's fantastic performance in this area. We believe that accepting and including a diverse range of talents enriches us and offers different perspectives and management styles, helping us to be more innovative and grow in a more responsible way.\n\nWe endeavour to improve our internal processes and adopt the necessary measures to tackle any form of inequality based on gender, race, ethnicity, religion, disability, age, sexual orientation, identity, beliefs or anything else, and our Code of Ethics also expresses our firm commitment to combat all kinds of violence or harassment in our work environment.\n\nIn the 2022 Management Report, one of our goals was to implement an Equality Plan that covered all the requirements in this area. Another target was for women to hold 40% of management positions by 2030, no more than two levels below the positions of Chairman and CEO.\n\nIn June 2023, the Board of Directors approved our Diversity Policy, to be applied globally. It encompasses the following compromises, which act as levers to promote our various initiatives.\n\n- Commitment to hire, retain and develop women in senior management positions.\n- Implementation of policies and public commitments to combat harassment and discrimination, with training and channels for handling employee complaints.\n- Progress towards reducing the wage gap, providing criteria to measure said gap and developing transparent and rigorous action plans.\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\n- ABOUT THIS REPORT\n- **1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n- **2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n- **3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n- **4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n- **5. SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n- CONTENTS Promotion of programmes to achieve an inclusive work environment where employees feel valued and have access to the same opportunities, ensuring that inclusive leadership constitutes a core part of our leaders' behaviours.\n\t- Stakeholder awareness of our commitments and progress in the Company, particularly with our services.\n\nWe realise that making advances in this area will expose us to new challenges. This year we received 8 harassment and discrimination complaints. As a result, in 2023 we implemented a series of specific measures designed to guarantee and promote equality, diversity, equity and inclusion in our corporate culture, and to integrate groups at risk of exclusion.\n\n### *Meliá Diversity Week*\n\nTo coincide with the \"World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development\", launched by the European Commission on 21 May, promoting \"Diversity Month\" under the slogan \"Building Bridges\", the Company launched its first \"Diversity Week\", a series of communication and advocacy activities focusing on aspects such as generational, cultural, sexual and gender diversity and raising awareness of disabilities and inclusion.\n\nTo highlight the value of diversity in the workplace and make it a source of pride for all our employees, we focused on a range of different areas, such as gender, sexual and functional diversity, to raise awareness about the different practices in the market and share the thoughts and aspirations of our most affected employees, members of minority groups who have felt out of place or forgotten at times.\n\nOur commitment is to communicate the challenges that we must continue to address to make progress regarding equality of opportunities and training and employability of vulnerable groups, and to ensure that companies better reflect today's society, so that everyone feels seen and represented.\n\n### **CEO Action for Diversity**\n\nDiversity and inclusion have a direct impact on the brand's image, our performance and the achievement of corporate objectives. It is one of the most important factors when establishing an employment brand to attract the best talent. In 2021, the Company joined the CEO Action for Diversity, whose mission is to bring together the heads of leading Spanish companies around a common and innovative perspective of diversity and inclusion (D&I), as drivers of these challenges in their companies, to promote business excellence strategies that foster talent and reduce inequality and exclusion in Spanish society.\n\nLed by the Adecco Foundation and the CEOE Foundation, it is based on a rigorous research and analysis process with 79 questions, which enable the development of a model built around five strategic blocks: identity and strategy, cultural change, competitiveness, equality and equity, and inclusion in society and the workplace. This year, we worked on various areas: D&I trends, homeworking, collaborative models, mental health, psychosocial risks, workplace inclusion and senior talent.\n\n### **Equality Plan**\n\nIn 2023, Meliá Hotels International made progress with its commitment to equality and, alongside the two biggest unions in Spain and in the Group, UGT and CC.OO, it ratified its third Equality Plan. The previous plan, signed in 2019, strengthened the Company's commitments to its employees, and this new plan establishes the roadmap for the next four years.\n\nThe measures and commitments included in this new Plan are grouped into 9 essential aspects or areas of action to consolidate the Company's equality principles, from a global and holistic vision: organisational culture and management, selection and recruitment process, professional classification, training, professional promotion, working time/work-life balance, under-representation of women, remuneration, prevention of sexual and gender-based harassment, gender-based violence, occupational health and communication, information and awareness-raising.\n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5. SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nCONTENTS Through 12 different blocks, the plan is introducing 136 measures to be implemented in Spain, across 16 work areas. The targets are set per quarter and will be incorporated into the plan's monitoring, compliance and implementation system over the next four years.\n\n> To summarise, below we outline the main commitments that will be our key focus while the plan is in force:\n\n> • Hiring people according to the principle of equality, in addition to promoting training and raising awareness regarding issues related to equality throughout every level of the Company. One of the key measures of the plan is our commitment to monitor the professional categories where women are underrepresented, with the aim of, where necessary, implementing appropriate measures to identify possible causes and solutions.\n\n• Strengthen guidance and education on equality issues to make this the main foundation of the entire employee journey, beginning with the hiring processes, developing a specific training and awareness-raising plan for the people involved in these processes, along with measures that will support them through the various stages of their career within the company. Along these lines, the Company has committed to design a specific professional development plan for women, which will support and empower their leadership, with specific resources assigned for this purpose.\n\n• Develop a communication plan to enhance awareness and dissemination, creating a section about equality on the intranet, including all the information produced on this matter and any advances we have made.\n\n• This new plan will also continue providing improvement measures to help working people and, particularly, people who have dependents in their care, giving them the opportunity to reconcile their professional and personal lives. In addition to previously implemented measures, such as the possibility for employees to specify their working hours after the birth of a child, by mutual agreement with the company (without the need to reduce their working hours), we have also added a number of new measures, such as the possibility of paid leave for serious illness, surgery or hospitalisation.\n\n• Finally, continuing the progress made in our previous plan, specific measures have been established to combat sexual harassment and support victims of gender violence, for whom the Company has committed to enable adapted working hours and shift changes, and to provide other specific resources.\n\nTourism by its very nature is a great way of connecting cultures and people within the Meliá family, and we are proud to employ people of over 137 different nationalities, who speak more than 58 languages. This melting pot we have created is without a doubt one of our greatest achievements as a company.\n\n### **Integration of groups at risk of exclusion**\n\nWe appreciate that talent should be encouraged regardless of its origins, which is why we continue to offer employment opportunities by working with social associations and experts in this field.\n\nIn partnership with La Caixa Foundation (Spain), with its Incorpora Programme, and the Pinardi Foundation, we promote the employment of people at risk of exclusion at selected hotels throughout Spain.\n\nIn 2023, we made a total of 55 job offers, achieving a recruitment rate of 76%. We have made significant progress in recruitment, reaching a ratio of 71.43% of permanent contracts.\n\nAnother group that we work with is disabled people. We advocate for equality of opportunities and strive to contribute actively to creating a more inclusive and diverse environment. Aside from employing people with disabilities, we are also aware of the need to train our teams to provide a better service to this group of people as customers as well. As a result of our commitment, in 2023 we worked with the ONCE Foundation (Spain) to sign a Partnership Agreement, which was ratified on 24 January 2024 and will remain in force for five years, with the objective of promoting the direct employment of people with disabilities. Some of its key goals are as follows:\n\n**FEMALE EMPLOYEES** 46.6% (+1.4pp)\n\n> **JOB OFFERS** 31\n\n**PEOPLE HIRED** 18\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5. SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n- Promoting direct employment of people with disabilities.\n- Promoting training of people with disabilities.\n- Promoting employability and employment opportunities through various internship programmes.\n- Promoting indirect labour integration by encouraging procurement from Special Employment Centres.\n- Promoting the production of accessible goods and services.\n- Promoting initiatives to raise awareness in society.\n\n### **Social Dialogue**\n\nGRI 2-29; 2-30; 402-1\n\nMeliá recognises the following principles at an international level: freedom of association, protection of the right to unionise, collective bargaining, the elimination of forced or compulsory labour, the abolition of child labour, and the elimination of discrimination based on employment or occupation. We respect freedom of thought and the right of employees to form and join unions. This is all reflected in our Code of Ethics, which is based on the guidelines of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), adopted by the Company in 1998. In 2013, we signed an agreement with the IUF (International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations) to defend the aforementioned rights, among others, and this was reinforced in 2019 with the signing of a Specific Agreement to combat sexual harassment and workplace bullying.\n\nCollective bargaining plays a very important role in maintaining smooth industrial relations and agreeing on fair wages and adequate working conditions. In Spain, all our employees are subject to a collective agreement. Collective bargaining in Spain has its greatest exponent in the Framework Agreement, a state-wide labour agreement for the Hotel and Catering sector (ALEH), which is the result of collective bargaining in this sector and, together with the Autonomous Regional Hotel and Catering Collective Agreements, constitutes the foundation of the framework of sustainability and trust on which the reciprocal interests of companies and workers are based.\n\n**43.26%** of the workforce is located in Spain, where the rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining are recognised by the Constitution and enshrined by Organic Law 11/1985, on Freedom of Association.\n\nIn its Code of Ethics, approved by the Board of Directors in October 2012, the Company states its commitment to offer the best opportunities for professional development, based on the stability of a family business and the resilience of a leading international company, which knows how to recognise commitment, talent and achievements fairly, highlighting the following premises in the area of talent management:\n\nImage /page/154/Picture/21 description: The image shows the text \"WORKFORCE COVERED BY COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT\" in green, followed by the number \"94.9%\" in gray.\n\n- Protecting employees as they carry out their work and ensuring an adequate work environment that provides all necessary measures to guarantee employee health and safety.\n- Working to achieve commitment from our employees and ensure their wellbeing through active listening.\n- Promoting constant training and professional development.\n- Promoting a training policy that makes the company more competitive and provides professional development for our employees.\n- Ensuring that all our employees feel proud to be part of a company that puts people at the heart of everything it does.\n\nThe Company works to promote constructive social dialogue, exploring solutions that enable its employees to exercise their right to work in the best conditions possible. This dialogue establishes several key pillars, including but not limited to the following: equal treatment in regard to remuneration and working conditions, elimination of discrimination in all its forms, protection of people's health and workplace safety, social and working conditions for its employees. These commitments are reflected in the aforementioned Code of Ethics and the Human Rights Policy, and extend to the labour rights of our suppliers, who endorse these commitments by signing the Meliá Hotels International Code of Ethics.\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONTENTS We also maintain constant dialogue with unions to discuss relevant matters, such as the establishment of a negotiating table for the third Equality Plan, for which discussions began in 2023, or the promotion of initiatives with the IUF to combat sexual harassment in the workplace.\n\n> In Spain, this year the Company attended meetings with the main trade unions to report on developments within the business, played an active role in collective bargaining agreement negotiations for the hotel industry in the Balearic Islands and Madrid, directly monitored collective bargaining agreement negotiations for the hotel industry in Las Palmas and Tenerife, and reached agreements with local trade unions in relation to the wage agreements included in the collective bargaining agreement for the sector in the Canary Islands.\n\n> In relation to communication with our employees, we use a number of different channels, such as the corporate intranet, which offers spaces where employees can access information on their contracts, pay slips, social benefits, education and training, occupational health and safety programmes and advice, and, of course, all the Company's latest news.\n\nMeliá also offers a whistleblowing channel to all stakeholders, which can be used to report any rights violations.\n\nA Joint Training Committee was established in 2019 to promote a training policy designed to make the Company competitive and provide professional development for our employees, through continuous training programmes to enhance skills and expertise. This body meets at least once every six months and its primary mission is to plan, organise and manage training activities, using the funding provided for this purpose by the Spanish state foundation for employment training. Representing employees in Spain for any centres associated with the Commission (approximately 10,000 employees), the commission enables employees to raise any queries with the RLT related to their training and development within the Company.\n\n### **Representation of employees and other workers**\n\nAt Meliá, we are firmly committed to respecting the working rights of our employees all over the world, particularly regarding their right to participation and representation, which is an essential element of the governance model.\n\nThis commitment is reflected in the Meliá Hotels International Code of Ethics, which applies globally to all employees of the Group and incorporates our adherence to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Guidelines, which promote respect for and promotion of the principles and rights of freedom of association and the right to unionise, and effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of forced or compulsory labour, the abolition of child labour and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment or occupation.\n\nIn Spain, we maintain and strive for peaceful relations and social dialogue with all the main unions, which we work towards in a number of different ways. Firstly, we collaborate with union organisations that represent employees in each work centre (Company Committees or Staff Delegates), holding joint meetings to discuss any relevant workplace issues, along with subsequent follow-up meetings. And secondly, we hold regular meetings to provide information about any labour developments that could directly impact the company, to ensure that employee representatives receive consistent labour standards, which will help to avoid conflict later on. Lastly, Meliá is present in the negotiation of Collective Agreements in the sector, either directly or through different Associations from the Hotel industry in Spain.\n\nAt an international level, it is worth highlighting that in 2013 Meliá signed an agreement with the IUF (International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations), which internationally recognises the principles of freedom of association, protection of the right to form unions, collective bargaining and declares that it respects freedom of thought and the right of employees to form and join Unions. The aforementioned agreement was strengthened in 2019 with the signing of a specific agreement to combat sexual or workplace harassment.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nTABLE OF\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### CONTENTS **Decent wages**\n\nThe *human rights policy* approved by the Board of Directors in July 2018, established the guiding principle of offering fair and decent working and remuneration conditions. Under this premise, the Company establishes criteria for remuneration, compensation, and benefits that are decent, fair and appropriate for the work carried out by its employees, in a way that is aligned with their training, education, and level of responsibility, and in strict compliance with the applicable labour legislation in accordance with the laws of the country where they are operating. Also, it offers opportunities focused on achieving a work-life balance, it provides its employees with measures that enable this balance without undermining the Company's own needs and the reality of the sector it operates in.\n\nIn an increasingly globalised world, where people have access to international opportunities, it is important for companies to display their commitment to offering decent wages. At Meliá Hotels International, we not only provide access, we also encourage the international rotation of our employees with decent compensation for their work in order to ensure that they have a feeling of security and stability, and increase job satisfaction, productivity, and loyalty.\n\nThrough this commitment which seeks to align salaries according to the value of the work carried out, we continue to strengthen the vocation of service of our employees and encourage excellence.\n\nRewarding our employees fairly is essential to ensure that our staff feel part of a responsible and sustainable company, focused on teamwork in order to encourage the Company's innovation and efficiency.\n\nFor next year, 2024, our human resources team has planned a project to assess wages and the cost of local life, in the places where we operate, in order to assess where we can implement new initiatives that could improve the quality of life of our teams.\n\n### **Benefits for our employees**\n\nGRI: 2-20; 2-21; 2-23; 2-24\n\nThe *Human Resources Policy* of Meliá Hotels International, approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018 and with a global scope, outlines the need to promote a model of social benefits in accordance with the needs and demands of each working environment.\n\nOur aim is to encourage a more enriching work environment focused on the overall well-being of employees, by promoting different initiatives, with the aim of enriching the value proposal for our teams.\n\n## **My MeliáBenefits**\n\nThe implementation of *My MeliáBenefits* represents a significant step forward towards the creation of a more enriching work environment and one focused on the overall well-being of its employees. This platform not only offers tangible benefits such as My Flexible Remuneration, which adapts remuneration to individual needs, and My Discounts, which provides exclusive discount, but it also tackles essential aspects of daily life through sections such as My Insurance, My Finances, My Wellness, and My Social Responsibility.\n\nImage /page/156/Picture/14 description: The image shows the text 'PAY GAP' in green, followed by the number '1.05' in a large, gray font.

Likewise, the increasing adoption of cognitive technologies and the digitalisation of processes (automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence systems) are transforming the workforce and organisations are redesigning their jobs in order to take advantage of these technologies.\n\nAfter two years of teleworking, as a consequence of the pandemic, we were aware of the importance of analysing the opportunities that a hybrid work approach could offer us.\n\nDuring 2023 the methods of teleworking implemented in the Spanish enterprises were consolidated with the deployment of different work tools to strengthen communication and interaction between people, operation centres and hotels.\n\nTeleworking: 1 day and one afternoon Teleworking: 4 days At the workplace: 100% This hybrid work approach is aligned with our acknowledgement and respect of the right to digital disconnection in the workplace of our teams, so that, outside of the work time that is legally or conventionally established, their time for rest, leave, and holidays is respected, along with their personal and family privacy. Our commitment on this matter is included in the Human Resources Policy.\n\nAlso, in order to encourage respect and compliance we have a digital awareness course, which includes the obligatory training pathway that our employees must undertake in order to know the legal measures and policies adopted.\n\nWe ensure that employees are aware of the implications of hyperconnectivity and the impact it has and we encourage digital disconnection, always considering the well-being of our employees and ensuring that they have an appropriate work-life balance.\n\nWe also support work-life balance measures for employees who have children or who look after dependents, introducing greater flexibility in the support for school tutoring, medical appointments, shift changes and the\n\nImage /page/158/Figure/10 description: The image shows three different work models: Office First, Remote First, and Office. Office First is for employees with roles and responsibilities linked to the company's strategic vision, both with respect to design, definition, and implementation. Remote First is for those employees whose activity is highly specialized, standardized, and recurrent, which allows their activity to be monitored without requiring regular.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nAt Meliá Hotels International we have an Occupational Health and Safety Policy, with a global scope, which is aimed at establishing the principles and commitments within the framework of occupational health and safety and the well-being of employees, in all processes for the provision of service. This Policy was approved in 2018 by the Company's Board of Directors and updated in 2021. It is based on the ISO 45001:2018 standard, the certification we obtained in 2021, and renewed in 2022 and 2023, as well as the model of the World Health Organisation (WHO) for a Healthy Workplace. This policy is available to all interested parties on the *company website*.\n\n### **Management system for occupational health and safety**\n\nThe Company has an Occupational Health and Safety Policy, in accordance with ISO 45001:2018 certification, with a global scope that ensures compliance with legal, regulatory and contractual requirements, as well as compliance with the objectives set, providing the necessary tools to strengthen control, the measurement of progress and the identification of areas of improvement. This model includes the following instruments:\n\n- The manual for the Management System for Occupational Health and Safety and the Healthy Workplace Programme, designed according to ISO 45001:2018 and the parameters and recommendations of the World Health Organisation (WHO), ensuring a comprehensive plan that encompasses physical, mental, and cognitive health, and providing the necessary requirements to establish, implement and consolidate the established system.\n- The Occupational Health and Safety Procedures (OHSP), which describe the specific way of carrying out an activity or process within the Occupational Health and Safety System, in order to ensure compliance with the management system, facilitating the work of the teams affected.\n\n#### **MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY**\n\nImage /page/159/Figure/16 description: The image is a circular diagram illustrating different aspects of management. The diagram is divided into seven sections, each representing a different area of focus. The sections are labeled as follows: Definition & Objectives, Risk Management, Operational Management, Audit & Control, Communication & Publication, Resources & Investment, and Constant Improvement. Each section contains a list of related activities or considerations. For example, the Definition & Objectives section includes context of Melia and stakeholders, definition of objectives, goals and programmes, and planning and preventative management. The Risk Management section includes risk and opportunity assessment, health monitoring, emergency response, specific actions for particularly sensitive groups, and especially dangerous work. The Operational Management section includes operational management and control, documentary control and management, preparation, review and approval of procedures, and operating instructions for safety and health at work. The Audit & Control section includes external audit, internal audit, development and preventative review, investigation of incidents, verification of preventative activities, and management of regular inspections. The Communication & Publication section includes consultation and participation, information and constant training, and internal communication and distribution. The Resources & Investment section includes definition of required resources, acquisition of machinery, work equipment and products, and management of personal protective equipment. The Constant Improvement section includes change management, management of non-conformities, corrective and preventative actions, coordination of interdepartmental activities, and integration of new projects and modifications.\n\nEach procedure establishes different mitigation actions, by determining the object, scope, definitions, allocation of responsibilities, implementation of the procedure and records if applicable.\n\nBy way of example, in Health Monitoring (OHSP 11) control and monitoring of the health of staff is established in order to detect the symptoms of illnesses deriving from work and suggest measures to reduce the likelihood of damage, and in order to also carry out epidemiological analysis that enables us to\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONTENTS find out the effects of risks. The incident investigation procedure (OHSP 23) defines all the responsibilities, obligations, analysis and investigation methods and corrective measures to ensure that those incidents (occupational accidents and illnesses) do not occur again. In all of them, they are carried out for each of the incidents that occurred.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\nfollowing graphic:\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.

It is worth highlighting that each business unit is responsible for establishing its preventive action plans for the correction of measures established as a consequence of the result of the risk assessments and investigation of incidents relating to work (occupational accidents and illnesses).\n\nThese integration plans include a description of the scope of each action, the deadline, as well as information about the defined action. Also, each business unit is responsible for providing the financial resources needed to mitigate risk.\n\nThe *Risk Control & Compliance Department* also ensures the allocation of the financial resources needed for investments relating to this matter, with the *Health & Safety Director also participating.*\n\nIn 2023 we retained the certification of our Healthy Workplace Programme, which fulfils the required principles, including both individual and organisational actions to create healthy, safe, and stable working environments over time, where possible with the participation of all staff. The measures taken notably include the following:\n\n- The strengthening of training on wellbeing, healthy habits and occupational health and safety.\n- The improvement of spaces for carrying out activities focused on staff wellbeing (mindfulness, relaxation, etc.).\n\nImage /page/160/Figure/17 description: The image shows a diagram of business processes.

During 2024, this management model will be extended to all hotels in Mexico and the Dominican Republic.\n\nLastly, it is worth mentioning the celebration of our first Wellbeing Week, coinciding with World Mental Health Day. An initiative that included different activities to inspire, encourage a healthy and balanced lifestyle, as well as incorporating other topics such as financial health. The first activity was provided by the renowned speaker Dr. Mario Alonso Puig, under the title \"Keys to success to achieve our wellbeing at work\" with the attendance of 42% of the people registered.\n\n### **Assessment of risks and opportunities**\n\nAccording to the materiality analysis carried out by the Company, the health and safety, and wellbeing of staff is considered a highly relevant matter and positioned in the TOP 5 of the materiality matrix globally and for 40% of the participant stakeholders, which is why we work to consolidate our business model, by evaluating possible risks and developing measures to mitigate them.\n\nThe Company has consolidated a monitoring system aimed at the early identification of risks relating to this matter, as well as their evaluation and control, along with measures for the detection and assessment of opportunities. Responsibility for the management of the prevention of these risks lies with the entire Company and at all of its hierarchical levels. In particular, the *Health & Safety Director*, who directly reports to the *Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO)*, is the contact person and holds overall responsibility for the definition, management, and control of the Company's health and safety protocols globally. They are the manager responsible for creating, in certain destinations, a support structure to strengthen the prevention and care of customers and employees, and ensure alignment with the management system established by the global management. Specifically, this management has been strengthened with teams located in Mexico and the Dominican Republic, managing a volume of staff that amounts to 42.5% of the Group's total workforce.\n\nOn a regular basis, the technical team of the department of occupational health is supported by experts on this matter, as well as Consultancy firms and internal Health and Safety Commissions or Committees for the different business units. These commissions or committees are formed by the legal representation of company staff and representatives, they carry out a process of risk analysis in the different business units. These assessments include an analysis of the jobs at each hotel, the tasks assigned to each manager and the environment and facilities affected. Particularly in Spain, specific assessments are also carried out for occupational safety, industrial hygiene, ergonomics and psycho-sociology. In the other regions, there are external consultants or advisors who determine how these activities are implemented based on what is stipulated in current legislation.\n\nAlso, based on prevention and control plans, activity is monitored on a preventive basis. These services, assigned to the hotels, establish the frequency of the evaluations, always agreed with the consultation and participation bodies.\n\n**WORKFORCE REPRESENTED ON OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH & SAFETY COMMITTEES IN SPAIN**\n\nImage /page/161/Picture/14 description: The image shows the text \"88.8%\" in a large font, with the text \"(2022: 85.6%)\" in a smaller font directly below it.\n\n# **TRAINING HOURS**  47,416\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/162/Picture/1 description: The image shows the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\" in gray, with a small gray house icon to the left of the words.\n\n### CONTENTS **Progress in terms of health**\n\nGRI: 403-9; 403-10\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nOur ambition is to fulfil all the commitments and principles incorporated in this Policy, with the mission of ensuring the greatest levels of physical, mental, and cognitive health, even beyond compliance with the duties and obligations established by legislation, maximising the reduction of the number of occupational accidents and illnesses of our own and external employees.\n\nOn the other hand, to create and maintain a healthy workplace, it is essential to tackle the absenteeism caused by health conditions and problems. At the start of this year, we established goals with the aim of minimising the increase in cases of occupational contingency (occupational accidents and illnesses) and common contingency cases (common illnesses and non-workplace accidents), maintaining levels at under 8%.\n\n#### **OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH RATES - EMPLOYEES**\n\n|                                                                                                                   |        | OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENTS |       |       | PROFESSIONAL ILLNESS |      |      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------------|-------|-------|----------------------|------|------|\n| INDICATOR                                                                                                         | GENDER | 2021                   | 2022  | 2023  | 2021                 | 2022 | 2023 |\n| RATE/INCIDENCE RATE                                                                                               | M      | 33.96                  | 45.86 | 32.84 | 1.60                 | 0.11 | 0.00 |\n|                                                                                                                   | F      | 45.47                  | 50.51 | 54.39 | 2.64                 | 0.53 | 1.18 |\n|                                                                                                                   | TOTAL  | 38.81                  | 47.96 | 42.83 | 2.04                 | 0.30 | 0.55 |\n| RATE/FREQUENCY RATE                                                                                               | M      | 18.53                  | 25.55 | 18.33 | 0.87                 | 0.06 | 0.00 |\n|                                                                                                                   | F      | 25.20                  | 28.23 | 30.76 | 1.46                 | 0.29 | 0.67 |\n|                                                                                                                   | TOTAL  | 21.32                  | 26.76 | 24.05 | 1.12                 | 0.17 | 0.31 |\n| RATE/SEVERITY RATE                                                                                                | M      | 0.36                   | 0.45  | 0.34  | 0.02                 | 0.00 | 0.00 |\n|                                                                                                                   | F      | 0.46                   | 0.49  | 0.71  | 0.10                 | 0.02 | 0.04 |\n|                                                                                                                   | TOTAL  | 0.40                   | 0.51  | 0.51  | 0.05                 | 0.01 | 0.02 |\n| Nº OF OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENTS/<br>PROFESSIONAL ILLNESSES Nº<br>OF OCCUPATIONAL INCIDENTS/<br>PROFESSIONAL ILNESSES | M      | 212                    | 421   | 322   | 10                   | 1    | 0    |\n|                                                                                                                   | F      | 207                    | 383   | 461   | 12                   | 4    | 10   |\n|                                                                                                                   | TOTAL  | 419                    | 804   | 783   | 22                   | 5    | 10   |\n\n#### **ABSENTEEISM**\n\n|  | CLIMATE CHANGE                |                            |                        |         |         |                      |       |       |                    |           |           |                   |           |           |         |\n|--|-------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|---------|---------|----------------------|-------|-------|--------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|---------|\n|  |                               |                            | OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENTS |         |         | PROFESSIONAL ILLNESS |       |       | COMMON CONTINGENCY |           |           | TOTAL ABSENTEEISM |           |           |         |\n|  | INDICATOR                     | GENDER                     | 2021                   | 2022    | 2023    | 2021                 | 2022  | 2023  | 2021               | 2022      | 2023      | 2021              | 2022      | 2023      |         |\n|  | 5.

Some of the main initiatives undertaken are as follows:\n\n- Creation and implementation of the management system for health and safety.\n- Implementation of different training and awareness initiatives in order to encourage a culture of prevention, incorporating this area into the obligatory training programme for all the groups that it applies to.\n\nImage /page/163/Picture/7 description: The image shows the text 'TRAINING (HOURS PAX)' in green, followed by the number '4.3' in gray, and then '(2022: 3.1)' in gray.\n\n**HEALTH AND SAFETY** \n\n- Control and monitoring of sick leave due to common illness (in Spain through healthcare partners), where the indicators show a high incidence or complexity in absenteeism.\n- Strengthening of leadership quality processes.\n- Analysis of workloads and psychosocial aspects.\n\nIn addition to the external audits that are carried out annually, the Company plans internal audits annually, carried out by the Internal Audits department, —with the support of the department of Occupational Health— to ensure the correct application and control of the management system and verify shortcomings or more critical points, with the aim of ensuring their minimisation, thus contributing to ensuring a sound management system. During 2023, 14 internal audits were carried out in different business units.\n\nImage /page/163/Picture/12 description: The image shows the text \"INTERNAL AUDITS OF THE SYSTEM FOR OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH\" in green font at the top.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nOur 2030 Vision aims to position us among the world's leading hotel groups in the middle and upper segment, affirm our leadership in leisure hospitality and *bleisure*, and be recognised as a global leader for **excellence, responsibility, and sustainability.**\n\nMeliá Hotels International, in its *Commercial Policy*, with a global scope and approved by the Board of Directors in February 2017, establishes the guidelines that must govern our relationship with customers, based on the commitments outlined in the Code of Ethics:\n\n- To communicate and market our products and services in an honest and ethical way, avoiding misleading advertising campaigns.\n- Compete ethically in markets, being respectful and avoiding unfair competition.\n- Not to capture customers or information about our competitors using unethical methods.\n\nThe content of this Policy is applied without prejudice to what is established in national and international regulation and approved for application in any of the countries where the Company or any entity in its Group carry out activities.\n\n### **A customer-focused organisation**\n\nOur international presence in 38 countries globally (aggregate perimeter), and in 14 countries at a consolidated level which only includes the hotels within the financial perimeter (ownership and rental), enables us to manage a wide range of profiles that enriches our strategic vision, knowledge of the customer and their demands or expectations, avoiding any type of discrimination of any nature, creating an exclusive environment for all of our customers and anticipating customer needs.\n\nOur aim is to create long-term bonds with all of our customers and partners, ensuring the communication and marketing of our products and services with ethical, transparent, truthful and honest criteria.\n\nOur promotion of all the communication channels (website *App*, public relations ecosystems, social media, *customer service* and *contact centre,* among others) is a key and essential lever to strengthen and consolidate a direct relationship with the customer, whether end consumer or professional.\n\nKnowing what they value, especially our customers, is essential in order to ensure a value proposition aligned with their expectations, especially if we consider that the Company manages a customer base of over 45 million people worldwide. Among other initiatives, in 2021 the Company launched its third materiality analysis, with the aim of identifying the most important matters for our stakeholders. Considering the importance of this group and, their knowledge of our portfolio and brands, we devote efforts to ensuring their participation and evaluation, which was the largest of all the surveys received. As expected, the Customer experience was the most notable topic, making it into the TOP 5 of the most important fields for many of our stakeholders consulted.\n\nWe also provide our customers with the chance to inform us about their special needs through our platforms, including vulnerable groups so that they can enjoy our properties in comfort. Additionally, we send them a satisfaction survey to collect information about their stay and understand how their experience with us has been.\n\n158\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5. SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### CONTENTS **Communication channels with the customer**\n\nAn essential part to guarantee the high level of satisfaction of our customers and strengthen loyalty to Meliá Hotels International, is diligently and rigorously managing any eventuality or incident that our customers may report, on the different channels provided for that purpose.\n\nTo this end, on a daily basis the hotels manage situations and events that have occurred for which the customer needs an immediate response, using for example, a digital tool provided in order to enable the customer to request whatever they need during their stay during the check-in process, facilitating a quick and effective means of communication, as well as a prompt response to their needs.\n\nAnother of the channels provided for the customer to communicate any suggestion, reflection or shortcoming regarding their experience, stay, or service offered, is the mailbox at myexperiencia@melia.com, with which we undertake to continue improving our response times, reducing the waiting time for providing a response to a period of no more than 48 hours.\n\nFrom our entire portfolio globally, 72% of incidents received were resolved in less than 48 hours, meeting the target that the Company has set. None of the incidents were related to cases of non-compliance regarding information about services or marketing communications.\n\nThis year, we have implemented actions to improve the efficiency of the incident management process in the hotels located in the Dominican Republic and Mexico, as well in the hotels located in the city of Madrid (Spain), through the contracting of the services of the *GEX Service Center*, a cross-functional team that centralises the complaint management of all the hotels, in order to provide a better service and assistance to all customers staying in these destinations.\n\nThis initiative has made the management of incidents more agile, notably improving response times, as well as quality, and consequently customer satisfaction. Also, it has freed up operating teams from *back-office* tasks, enabling them to focus on offering a better service to customers, enriching their experience and ensuring one of the principles of the Company which is the vocation of service. The teams now operate in all the hotels located in Punta Cana (Dominican Republic), Mexico, and Madrid (Spain). In 2024 we will expand this new service to hotels located in the EMEA region.\n\nLikewise, the Social Media team manages all the messages that are published on our social networks, which can be of a varying nature: campaign, hotel information, booking requests, etc. This year, we resolved all the open cases of the 368,435 messages in an average response time of 12 hours, while in 2022, from the time we started the service in March up until December, we resolved almost half of the cases in an average response time of 11 hours.\n\n### **Satisfaction surveys**\n\nOne of the tools promoted by the Company for finding out the level of satisfaction of our customers, after their stay at our hotels are the satisfaction surveys. This questionnaire is sent to the customer at the end of their hotel stay with the aim of evaluating their experience and personalised according to the standards and attributes for each of the hotel brands.\n\nTo this end, Meliá Hotels International uses the **ReviewPRO** tool which makes it possible to consolidate information under the parameters that are important for the Company (brand, segment, management type, etc.).\n\nThe results obtained enable the business unit to check their score, find out the perception of customers and plan actions in order to improve results and meet the objectives set. Likewise, it makes it possible to reflect on the results obtained according to the standards and attributes established for each brand.\n\nImage /page/165/Picture/14 description: The image shows the text 'INCIDENTS RECEIVED' in green, followed by the number '3,297' in a large, gray font.

With the extraordinary result of 53.1, the Company has greatly surpassed the goal set for 2023 (9.6%). The positive trend of this indicator across all Group brands invites us to think about customer perception, which is returning to normality and the good work of our teams after the pandemic.\n\nMeliá Hotels International recorded a slight drop in the result of the *Guest Satisfaction Score (GSS)* rating of 2023, compared to the results of 2019 and 2022, finishing 0.6 points under the target set. However, the Gran Meliá, The Meliá Collection, ZEL and INNSiDE brands achieved the customer satisfaction goals set for 2023, a distinction that endorses the strategy of the Company to have growth focused on *Premium & Luxury* brands.\n\nThe general performance in the *Global Review Index* **(GRI)** is 87.4%, increasing the results of previous years and maintaining market reputation rates. These excellent reviews are accompanied by an 18% increase in the volume of online reviews compared to 2022.\n\nLastly, it is worth noting that the *Quality Penetration Index* **(QPI)**, has continued the upward trend displayed in recent years. We ended the year with **100.4%**, a figure never attained before by the Group, exceeding the global comparison goal.\n\n### **SATISFACTION INDICATORS Online reputation**\n\nDuring 2023, Meliá devoted considerable resources to improving the management of social media and the digital presence of brands has been strengthened, fulfilling the aim of encouraging greater interaction and engagement with the audience.\n\nAlongside this, the public relations activities were targeted at the proactive management of the reputation of our brands, as well as generating positive media coverage in order to increase the digital presence and interaction with the community through the:\n\n- Development of strategic, relevant, and appealing content in order to strengthen the connection with the audience, highlighting unique experiences, new developments implemented in our brands, with the aim of strengthening the positioning and values of each of our brands.\n- Launch of personalised and segmented campaigns in order to adapt to the preferences of different audiences, harnessing personalisation and data analysis tools.\n- Encouragement of strategic partners that make it possible to consolidate relationships both within the field of influencers, and with similar brands in order to amplify our audience, scope, and presence on social media.\n- Strengthening of our relationship with the customer, through social platforms, responding proactively to enquiries, comments or other questions thus ensuring more personalised and effective service and assistance.\n- Optimisation of advanced analytics that makes it possible to assess our performance in different projects, including social media, in order to identify areas of improvement and adjust the strategy, according to the results obtained.\n- Creation of interactive experiences, such as surveys, competitions, and online events, in order to encourage participation in the community and generate content created by the user themselves.\n- Collaboration with a dozen global agencies present in 190 countries (social fans presence) and we have a significant fanbase spread among several platforms.\n\nImage /page/166/Picture/24 description: The image shows the text \"SOCIAL MEDIA PROFILES\" in green, followed by the number \"460\" in gray.\n\n**SOCIAL MEDIA USERS** 11M\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/167/Picture/1 description: The image shows a house icon next to the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\".\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.

With the firm commitment of improving our positioning in relation to our competitors and charting a greater future course for our hotels, the brand architecture has been meticulously updated with our sights set on the future, which matches the change in our vision of new luxury with our traditional focus, which is customer centred, adapted to the different interests and expectations of each profile.\n\nThis new architecture strengthens the positioning and reputation of the group, as a whole, and strengthens our vision targeted at those *premium* brands, as well as others associated with the *luxury* segment, focused on increasing the capture of customers with high purchase power who consider the characteristics of each destination.\n\nImage /page/167/Figure/7 description: The image shows a breakdown of the Melia hotel brands. The luxury brands are Gran Melia (4.9%), The Melia Collection (2.3%), ME by Melia (2.3%), and Paradisus by Melia (3.4%).

Therefore, next year in 2024 we want to undertake the challenge of bringing this experience to the customer with an appealing narrative, that can be perceived during their stay at the hotel and valued in the purchasing decision.\n\nWe are aware that bridging the gap between the customer and the sustain-\nable attributes that we are committed to is a challenge given that it is nec-\n\nImage /page/168/Figure/7 description: The image displays a diagram outlining sustainable attributes.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\nCONTENTS As part of our commitment to sustainability and excellence, we have requested information from each of our hotels about the attributes that form part of the Company's positioning in terms of sustainability and for each of the brands. This questionnaire is an essential component and is valued both internally and by tour operators, and it provides visibility to customers about the sustainable practices that each hotel integrates into their value proposal.\n\n> With this information we have been able to relaunch a certification process for hotels under ESG criteria with the aim of providing visibility, both for the business units and all of our stakeholders, about the level of criteria implemented in our portfolio, and have selected entities of renowned prestige in order to make progress on this process. Of the hotels in global integration, 90% comply with sustainable certification according to the standards of the GSTC and 94% have obtained sustainable certification.\n\n# 1 IN 3 OPENINGS ARE OUR LUXURY BRANDS\n\n### **Consolidating our luxury strategy**\n\nMeliá Hotels International is committed to strengthening the reputation and recognition of the hotels that are unique, which are focused on attracting high value customers seek a personalised luxury experience.\n\nInternationally renowned entities and leaders in the luxury and *premium* segment who assess, using a set of demanding standards, the hotels that we want to be leaders in luxury hospitality around the world.\n\nOn the other hand, as part of their experience, we want our customers to notice the commitments made in terms of sustainability and appreciate how they are integrated into the hotel itself, however we are aware of the challenge posed by bringing them closer to this reality individually in each business unit.\n\n### **MELIÁ PRO committed to the luxury segment**\n\nMeliá PRO coordinates the entire communication strategy for the B2B segments, through specific campaigns and programmes that encompass all of the Group's brands, more at the end of this chapter.\n\nThe *BRAVOS Meliá PRO Selected Club* programme offers a platform that is aimed and designed to offer the best benefits and services to the luxury segment, with an exclusive programme for travel agencies specialising in high value customers.\n\nThe vision of Meliá PRO *Business Traveller Benefits & Rewards* stands out, launched in 2022 it aims to encourage business trips through special rates and benefits designed to meet the needs of current business travellers. This programme continues to expand to new hotels and, at present, it is available in 80 of the Group's properties.\n\n### **Enriching the experience**\n\nWe aim to build lasting relationships based on the trust and loyalty of our customers. We use levers that motivate us each day: the vocation for service and the values of proximity and excellence, the hallmarks of Meliá Hotels International.\n\nCustomers are increasingly demanding and request authentic and differential services, aligned with their preferences and needs. Within a context of endless change, we strive to adapt our commercial model to the new challenges of the tourist industry, without losing sight of the relationship with the customer. To this end, in addition to strengthening our organisational structure, we have also strengthened its coordination and adapted the overall framework to the situation in each region and destination where we operate.\n\nAlso, we devote economic and human resources to support our digital transformation and to turning each point of the *customer journey* into an opportunity to get to know our customers better. We encourage the creation of spaces for dialogue where we obtain the customer's opinion, first hand, to evaluate and consider it.\n\n*LEADING HOTELS OF THE WORLD MEMBER HOTELS*\n\nImage /page/169/Picture/18 description: The image contains the number 8, which is formed by two vertically stacked circles of equal size.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### CONTENTS **Destination Inclusive**\n\nParadisus by Meliá has incorporated the *Destination Inclusive* concept, a brand that is already a leader in the Latin American market and implemented, for the first time in Spain, in a leading holiday destination such as the Canary Islands. Destination Inclusive Paradisus Gran Canaria and Paradisus Salinas enrich the expression of the brand, enabling customers to connect and delve into the aspects of the destination that make it unique. It offers new experiences, focused on cultural and local gastronomy for examples, customers can immerse themselves in private classes with local chefs and receive personalised yoga sessions next to a natural well with crystal-clear waters.\n\n### **Safe environments**\n\nEquality, diversity, and inclusion are cornerstones of our Code of Ethics and they are also becoming essential vectors for competitiveness and business. According to the World Tourism Organisation (WTO), LGBT tourism has experienced continuous growth in recent years. The figures published reveal that the LGTB community accounts for 10%-20% of tourists globally and represents 16% of total travel spending, equivalent to almost 200 billion Euros a year.\n\nAccordingly, during 2023 we have worked to ensure that some Company hotels obtain the *Travel Proud* certification, a programme promoted by Booking.com which aims to aid the understanding of the specific challenges that this community faces in its trips and to offer a positive and inclusive travel experience. The programme goes beyond certification as it offers the chance to provide training to hotels and their teams in order to ensure inclusive and safe treatment. At the end of this year the Company has certified 30 hotels and it expects to certify 160 hotels around the world during 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, Meliá Hotels International has partnered with the leading company in the LGBTQ+ travel sector, *Queer Destinations* offering these travellers the chance to enjoy exceptional holidays in seven of our hotels located in Mexico, Madrid, the Dominican Republic and New York, identified as *Queer Destinations Committed*. This partnership also strengthens our staff training, in an inclusive atmosphere based on respect, empathy, etc.\n\n### **A healthy gastronomic offer**\n\nThe *Food & Beverage (F&B)* area is immersed in a significant transformation process to enhance the appeal of our brands, products and services from a gastronomic perspective. Our portfolio is enriched with a unique and differential value proposal, which enables customers and residents, to discover the gastronomic concepts that have been devised for each of our brands, always being very mindful of the peculiarities and attributes of each of them.\n\nWe want our gastronomic offer to also be a lever for innovation and sustainability. Under this premise, we have designed a new proposal devised for the future, which enhances the positioning of our product and responds to the peculiarities of each area, helping to optimise our management, improve profitability, with a focus on attracting and gaining the loyalty of our customers.\n\nChanges in new consumption habits show a growing interest in a diet that is increasing wholesome and healthy, based on local produce, and which contributes to taking care of ecosystems and the planet. The ability to offer a quality, attractive and valued culinary offering becomes an important differentiating element, including for the events and conferences segment (MICE).\n\nFor the urban hotels located in Europe, the Company has designed the *Mediterranean Comfort Food Menu* concept aimed at encouraging a culinary offering with a greater presence of vegetarian products, with the vision of adapting our menus to the new demands of customers who value a healthy and Mediterranean diet. This new offer also helps to reduce our water footprint and carbon emissions.\n\nLikewise, as a responsible company that is committed to the health and wellness of our customers, we have reduced our alcoholic beverages menu, and offer a menu focused on alcohol-free or natural drinks.\n\nAlso, all our hotels provide, at the customer's request, the fourteen allergens and the chart of allergens that we inform our customers about relating to the content of their food.\n\nImage /page/170/Picture/15 description: The image shows the number 30 in a simple, sans-serif font.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe range of products offered by the Company is selected ensuring high quality standards, and also ensure compliance with legal requirements and the ban on purchasing products that contain additives that are harmful to health, for example ADA, BHA and BHT or BVO. Thus, our customers can have access to a nutritious and healthy offer, complying with the requirements of the European Union in terms of *Food to Fork and the Fitness Check***.**\n\n### **ROAD TO NET ZERO EVENTS**\n\nAccording to a survey by American Express, 78% of participants outlined the commitment to NET ZERO emissions in their organisations. In terms of event organisation, although it is still not an essential factor, it is gaining momentum year after year and we envisage gradual growth over the coming years. At present, 13% consider it to be an aspect to incorporate into their requirements.\n\nMeliá Hotels International, with the aim of furthering the integration of its sustainability strategy in the commercial sphere, has designed technology that allows it to measure the carbon footprint (scope 1 and 2) in all the *MICE* hotels selected. With the support and expert knowledge of Creast, a company that specialises in measuring the carbon footprint of large events, an innovative programme *ROAD TO NET ZERO EVENTS* has been created, with the aim of achieving carbon neutral events, allowing us to measure the environmental impact of the groups at two times: when making the application for the event and at the end of it.\n\nThe technology developed communicates and interacts with the Company's computer systems, as well as the sales force, in a way that speeds up processes for the teams affected and, it prevents unnecessary administrative tasks and calculations.\n\nWith the aim of testing the tool, the Company has selected two pilot hotels, located in Spain and Germany, with the aim of testing how the tool functions and the calculation of the carbon footprint.\n\nThe measurement calculates the carbon emissions generated during the event, considering both the emissions produced during the hotel stay, and those produced in meeting rooms. The differential aspect of this project is the measurement of the footprint in the restaurant and catering services, as well as other consumables that can be offered during the celebration of the event.\n\nThe measurement of the carbon footprint, will enable us to enrich our knowledge of the environmental impact of the *MICE* segment in each hotel and identify opportunities to develop our range of products and services, with the aim of being more efficient and also, raise awareness among events organisers in the proposals considering the environmental variable in their decision-making process.\n\nAll the events will be offset once they have ended, either through the programme of the organising company or through the programme of the Company *The Planet We Love*, using, in this case, credits certified by the United Nations.\n\nIn the first few months of 2024 we will begin the gradual roll-out of this tool and its management model in fourteen of the Group's hotels and we estimate that we will complete the *roll-out* of all the hotels specialising in the meetings, incentives, conferences and events segment before the end of 2025, which covers 80 hotels.\n\n### **MeliáRewards**\n\nOur *MeliáRewards* loyalty programme supports this strategy, focused on enhancing our portfolio of high value customers, through an innovative methodology in order to identify our most valuable customers and optimise our communications with them, adding specific initiatives aimed at influential travel agents in this segment, with the aim of encouraging the improvement of our occupancy rates for superior rooms and suites.\n\n{172}------------------------------------------------\n\n2023 has been an exceptional period for the *MeliáRewards* loyalty programme marked by growth, innovation and the ongoing commitment to excellence in customer satisfaction and sustainability. These advances consolidate Meliá's position as a leader in loyalty programmes in the hotel industry.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.

The deep understanding of customers was the basis for offering highly personalised experiences and strengthening the long term connection with its members.\n\nOver the course of 2023, the Meliá Loyalty Programme reached significant milestones, consolidating its status as an essential component in the company's strategy. The following aspects highlight the key developments and notable achievements throughout the year.\n\n#### **Personalisation and ad hoc communications**\n\n*MeliáRewards* continues to improve its communication model through the lifecycle of the customer, notably with an innovative *Account statement* model with 20 different versions. This has introduced advanced levels of personalisation and reinvigorated content, significantly improving the user experience and its effectiveness.\n\n### **Campaign management**\n\n*MeliáRewards* has been an effective driver of demand, with a historic record of 90 campaigns carried out under the loyalty programme, including all of its brands, hotels, and destinations, including a points component. The annual campaign *The MeliáRewards Effect: the more you travel, the greater the Rewards* included a credit in points component to enjoy at hotels, achieving an outstanding redemption rate of 53%, setting an especially high record for luxury holiday hotels.\n\nSupporting the group's strategy, *MeliáRewards* has implemented campaigns aimed at both the end customers, incentivising the bookings for suites and villas, as well as travel agents, offering special commission and extra *MeliáRewards* points.\n\nImage /page/172/Figure/17 description: The image shows three sections of text. The first section, titled \"Reservations,\" discusses offering better information to users during the booking process, giving greater visibility to experiences, activities in the destination, packages, or other extra services available to complement their stay. The second section, titled \"MeliáRewards,\" focuses on making the MeliáRewards loyalty program more visible and relevant while digitizing key customer interactions. The third section, titled \"The Stay,\" describes a digital directory of all hotel information, including restaurant information, activity schedules, and menus. It improves the management of requests such as check-in, check-out, digital key, and reservations for hotel services, integrating the app with other company platforms like Stay, Hmobile, or Revo.\n\n#### **Progress towards loyalty ecosystems**\n\nDuring 2023, we continued growth in the *Partners* vertical, both in terms of issuance and redemption, enabling us to convey the usefulness of the programme while in-house, at the time of the trip, and in daily life.\n\nWe wish to highlight the integration of *MeliáEscapes powered by Logitravel*, making it possible to obtain and redeem points, for all the elements contracted (flight, hotel, experiences ,etc.), as well as the agreement with the new high speed operator IRYO, and the incorporation of the *Vietnam Airlines Lotus Miles* programme, supporting the significant expansion in the Asia-Pacific region and particularly in Vietnam.\n\n{173}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/173/Picture/1 description: The image shows a house icon next to the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\".\n\nREPORT\n\n### CONTENTS **A digital experience**\n\nABOUT THIS an obligation in the business sector.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### CONTENTS **Technology to improve the satisfaction of our customers**\n\nDuring 2023, we focused on redesigning the key processes in order to increase efficiency, speed and customer satisfaction. With the aim of harmoniously integrating the online procedures into the physical operations of our receptions. This strategy requires offering greater autonomy to the customer throughout their *Customer Journey* along with simplifying the procedures for our reception times and cutting waiting times.\n\nThe reconfiguration of the *check-in* process includes aligning the digital process with the traditional one, allowing the digital *check-in* to be carried out on the same day as arrival, offering the customer complete autonomy to complete the process, from entering personal details, to formalising the legal documents required, and incorporating a key dispenser where customers can obtain a room key by scanning a QR code, once the room is ready for the customer to enter.\n\nThe digital *check-out* encompasses the payment phase and other information at the end of the stay. The customer can carry out the entire process, from the verification of expenditure up to payment, with the option of adding minibar consumption during it.\n\nBoth processes have been adapted to work in a web version, thus increasing the scope to a greater number of customers and creating a much smoother and much more satisfactory experience. At present, these two digital processes are implemented in seven Company hotels, and their expansion is planned for 2024, for all the hotels in 4 countries where the customer can enjoy greater autonomy.\n\n### **Next generation Meliá PRO & B2B Portal**\n\nWe ended 2023 with the launch of a new website for all the professionals in the sector: travel agents, companies, event organisers and specialised agencies.\n\nThis channel reproduces the design created on melia.com, integrating the same principles, values and criteria of excellence, as well as their integration with *MeliáRewards*, offering the specific benefits of our loyalty programme to these groups.\n\nWith Meliá PRO, we have further strengthened the commitment to the success of professional customers which is experiencing exponential growth.

The aim is for the customer to feel unique and important, by personalising their experience, making them the real star.\n\n> This has required a training and education plan for our teams, designing training itineraries focused on both the use of tools and the improvement of communication and business skills, ensuring that a personalised experienced is offered and enriching the customer profile.\n\nDuring 2023 we undertook the implementation of a CCaaS tool that will enable us to migrate to the *cloud* and relocate our advisors to locations where demand requires it.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe Company currently operates in fourteen countries, with realities that have very different social and cultural environments. The social purpose of Meliá Hotels International is focused on identifying opportunities to generate a positive impact, in an increasingly changing environment and with needs of different importance, on a social and economic level.\n\nThe tourism sector is undoubtedly a key driver for the creation of wealth globally, both for societies that receive and send tourists, it has consolidated its status as one of the primary sources of income, employment, and growth in global economies, and also provides an extensive network of international, national, and local suppliers as a result of its activity.\n\nCreating value and redistributing it among our stakeholders is, in our opinion, the best way to generate a positive impact in the destinations. Furthermore, with the desire to go beyond our activity, we encourage environmental, social, and cultural initiatives, involving the local entities, where we have a presence.\n\nWe have a different impact in each setting, whether tangibly (with a direct or redistributed economic contribution), or intangible, thanks to the sharing of knowledge and influence targeted at achieving a change, helping to improve the tourist value chain or enriching the entities that we interact and collaborate with.\n\nIn 2018, the Board of Directors approved the *Philanthropy Policy*, whose contents strengthen the approaches linked to consolidating ethical and responsible conduct with the aim of encouraging a model that contributes directly to social support in destinations and to building a fairer and more equitable society, including all of our staff, the communities who live and work close to the hotel and our entire value chain, Likewise, this document is aligned with the following reference frameworks:\n\n- European Directive on the protection of persons who report breaches of European Union law\n- The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights\n- United Nations Global Compact\n- OECD Guidelines for Enterprises\n- ILO Declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work\n\nWe also extend the application of this policy to the promotion of human rights, the wellbeing of children and society, and also the fight against the commercial sexual exploitation of children and child prostitution, affirming our commitment to the EPCAT code, and we were the first signatory tourist company fifteen years ago.\n\nThe *Social Cash Flow* shows how we redistribute the wealth generate, by providing visibility for the volume of collections and payments made and distributed among all our stakeholders, making it possible to trace the movement of incoming and outgoing cash flows. Our activity helps to invigorate local economies, to drive investments, the acquisition of products and services, as well as the recruitment of the workforce and the payment of taxes, among others.\n\n{177}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/177/Figure/1 description: The image shows the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\" in gray text, with a gray house icon to the left of the words.\n\n#### **SOCIAL CASH FLOW**\n\nImage /page/177/Figure/3 description: This image shows a breakdown of incoming and outgoing value. The incoming value is divided between customers (2,935.5€M, 99.9%) and divestments (3.0€M, 0.1%).

The technology platform launched during 2022 provides a system for the approval, monitoring and control of donations and the direct voluntary work carried out as well as a record of the entities involved. Each hotel has its own space for monitoring the information of its initiatives, ensuring permanent alignment with our policy, strategy, and management system and increasing data quality for reporting this information, both qualitative and quantitative.\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.

ANNEXES**\n\nCONTENTS Since 2018 Meliá has had a Code of Ethics for Suppliers, whose aim is for suppliers to assume the commitments, principles, and values of the hotel chain from the start of the of the commercial relationship. This code arises from and is based on the general principles and commitments of the Code of Ethics of Meliá, and each supplier assumes specific commitments in relation to regulatory compliance, non-discrimination, ensuring safe work environments, zero tolerance of abuse and coercion, zero tolerance of slavery, the prohibition of child labour, the payment of fair wages, the respect for freedom of opinion and association and protection of the environment. These approaches are referenced in the 2023 Management Report in the section Good governance, ethics and integrity, which expressly mentions Meliá's due diligence with its suppliers.\n\n> Likewise, Meliá has adopted and integrated into its practices the express commitment to manage this area with due diligence and regularly review it. Three years after carrying out its first human rights self-assessment, in 2022 the Company reviewed and updated the Control Self-Assessment (CSA) in order to identify new risks and criteria relating to human rights in operations. This new approach goes a step further in the monitoring of the most demanding standards, adding the Dhaka Principles on responsible recruitment and the guidelines of the Modern Slavery Act (United Kingdom) to the approaches already included in our first self-assessment such as the Principles of the Global Compact, the guidelines of the ILO and the Guiding Principles on Human Rights of the United Nations (UN). The approach is reflected in the Governance and Management Model of human rights, included in the section on Human rights due diligence in the 2023 Management Report. This section structures Meliá's model of due diligence, in a way that aligns with the principles of the Global Compact and its goals, defining which bodies participate in the management, which internal regulations apply and which tools and levers are available to the Company to ensure due diligence.\n\nWith this update, Meliá covers different areas relating to labour rights (selection of staff, remuneration and contracting, workplace environment and health, social dialogue, supply chain and complaints channel), environment (recognised as a human right in our policy) and anti-corruption.\n\nThe exercise of regular analysis allows Meliá to measure the perception of protection and probability of violating these rights in hotel units as well as the management capacity of the management, and aware of the potential negative impact of a possible violation in our activity. The level of participation in this exercise is reflected in the 2023 Management Report, as are the risk levels and probability of a breach, no real risks of a breach are identified in the Company's portfolio.\n\nGiven that one of the key elements in human rights due diligence is offering channels that are open for complaints, in Meliá's case it is possible to consult information in this regard in the Ethics and Integrity section of the 2023 Management Report, the section which describes how it works. With regard to the complaints received through this channel, and which are directly related to human rights, the Company discloses their nature. None of the complaints received in 2023 have had a significant impact on the company from a penal, financial, or reputation standpoint. In all cases, after the investigations carried out, the relevant corrective measures have been taken, disciplinary actions in some cases, and in others, training actions or improvements in processes or procedures. None of the complaints received were linked to breaches of the rights of indigenous peoples or operations that involved child labour. This detail can be consulted in the subsection on Reporting and complaint mechanisms included in the section on Human rights due diligence. Meliá thus makes incidents relating to this matter public along with the measures taken to rectify them.\n\nIt is essential to point out that access to Meliá's complaints channel is open to any stakeholder who believes that their rights have been violated, it is publicly accessible through online and offline means. Thus, in cases of a violation Meliá undertakes proceedings for every case, involving all necessary bodies in the process with the aim of resolving and rectifying the negative impact that may have been caused.\n\nMeliá's commitment to the defence of these rights means that, if required, it will openly collaborate with the entity that requests it. Throughout 2023 Meliá has not received requests or communications in this regard. In another order of magnitude, during this year the Company has not been reported or condemned in a final ruling with regard to the breach of these rights.\n\n{207}------------------------------------------------\n\n### ABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n- **2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n- **3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n- **4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6. ANNEXES**\n\n### CONTENTS **b. The fight against corruption and bribery**\n\nThe Code of Ethics of Meliá Hotels International establishes a series of global commitments including:\n\n• Act rigorously and forcefully against any practice of corruption, fraud, or bribery\n\nOn the other hand, the Code of Ethics itself, among the commitments undertaken with public administrations, includes that of:\n\n• Not accepting or offering any kind of bribe, financial or in kind, and maintaining an attitude of actively fighting against corruption, to prevent crime and money laundering.\n\nThese commitments established in the Code of Ethics are embodied in Meliá's Anti-Corruption Policy (updated in 2021). The aim of this Policy is to establish the principles that must govern our actions as a Company, in order to prevent, detect, report, and rectify the implementation of any actions that, in accordance with the applicable legislation, may be classified as corruption or bribery, both active and passive, always in accordance with the principle of Zero Tolerance towards any of these practices. In turn, this policy makes the commitments:\n\n- To comply with legislation and regulatory obligations in Spain and at an international level.\n- Establish the mechanisms for the oversight and control of our principles, values and commitments, ensuring the condemnation of irregular conduct, in particular action will be taken against any practice of corruption, fraud and bribery.\n\n• Reject gifts and courtesies from third parties if they exceed the reasonable value of mere courtesy, nor accept any type of economic consideration, gift or invitation from our suppliers that, due to their value, may exceed the symbolic or mere courtesy.\n\nIn addition to what is outlined above, the company has a Crime Prevention and Detection Protocol whose main objective is to prevent or reduce the risks of crimes being committed, especially those that entail the criminal liability of legal persons.\n\nThis Protocol has the certification issued by AENOR which certifies that the Management System for Penal *Compliance* complies with the requirements established by standard UNE 19601:2017 (renewed in 2023).\n\nCorruption is one of the criminal offences included in our Crime Prevention Protocol for which we have identified specific checks, which are evaluated annually with the aim of mitigating this criminal risk.\n\nThe company also has other internal Policies and Regulations, all included in our Crime Prevention Protocol, establishing guidelines or instructions targeted at preventing Corruption, including, for example:\n\n- The Regulatory Compliance Protocol (*Compliance*), through which the company assumes the commitment to comply with national and international legislation and regulatory obligations, as well as with its internal regulations and the commitment to ensure that the internal regulations and actions of its executives and management are based on ethical criteria aligned with the principles and values of the company and its Code of Ethics.\n- The Philanthropy Policy which expressly prohibits contributions to political parties and their foundations, no matter what type (financial or in kind), this Policy extends to trade unions, individuals, or initiatives promoted in a private capacity.\n- The Hotel Administration and Internal Control Regulation establishes clear guidelines aimed, among other things, at avoiding corruption and fraud in different internal processes.\n\nTo ensure the functioning of the Code of Ethics, as well as the internal Policies and Regulations, Meliá has Complaints Channels (internal for employees and external for third parties) through which it is possible to report conduct (active or passive) that is contrary to the content of the Code of Ethics, or any other regulations, this conduct specifically includes corruption, bribery, fraud, etc.\n\nThe Company also has an Internal Audit Department which, acting as a third line of defence, reviews compliance with internal policies and regulations, and each year it reviews the Crime Prevention Protocol with the aim of ensuring the correct and effective implementation of the controls established in the Protocol. In 2023 it produced a total of 199 auditing reports, with a\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n### **1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6. ANNEXES**\n\nCONTENTS global scope, providing coverage to all regions, areas, and businesses of the companies. As a result of these reviews, and based on the result of the audits carried out, no practice was detected in 2023 that could expose the company to a crime of corruption or fraud.\n\n**c. Taxation**\n\nTaxation is a critical part of corporate responsibility and is overseen by the Board of Directors of MHI. Thus, the Board of Directors approves the Tax Strategy and monitors its implementation and the management of tax risks, at least, once a year. Among other key aspects, the Tax Strategy defines compliance with the law as fundamental, in both letter and in spirit. MHI publishes its tax strategy on its corporate website.\n\nThe company has defined regulations, internal control processes and a complaints channel to ensure tax compliance. Periodic reviews of compliance with tax obligations are carried out and there is an organisational structure with appropriate means, including a professional team that receives ongoing training.\n\nMHI has a corporate structure aligned with the business and appropriate to legal requirements and corporate governance standards, and does not use instrumental organisations in tax havens.\n\nAlso, MHI also has a strong commitment to transparency in relation to tax matters according to reports by independent experts, and it publishes information on its tax strategy and the taxes it pays.\n\nTax risk management at MHI is reflected in the existence of internal processes, systems and controls (ICFR, key controls, etc.). The Tax Department, as the body for tax *compliance* is responsible for managing the Group's tax risks and it has implemented processes that, along with robust information management systems, ensure the reliability and traceability of information and minimise the chance of human error in this area.\n\n### **d. Competition law**\n\nMeliá Hotels International plays a leading role in the tourist sector. This implies it must act with due and necessary responsibility in regard to healthy competition with other players in the tourism value chain. This desire leads Meliá to set the objective of contributing to sustainable tourism development as a means of driving progress and well-being in society, actively collaborating with industry organisations and maintaining a relationship of respect and transparency with its competitors.\n\nGenerally, Meliá has set very clear communication, marketing and sales targets in this regard that lead it to create and maintain links with all of its stakeholders, providing them with open, accurate, clear and transparent information on its mission, strategy, objectives and achievements. This communication is also aimed at enhancing its corporate reputation through an accurate and appropriate depiction of the Company's image and establishing and maintaining the communication channels required to guarantee all stakeholders the opportunity to participate in its leadership and reputation.\n\nThus, Meliá's commitments to the tourism industry and its competitors are therefore mainly aimed at exercising its leadership in a responsible and ethical way given the impact and repercussions its behaviour as a leading company may have on the industry.\n\nThus, the company avoids any type of practice that could directly or indirectly be considered contrary to freedom in regard to establishing contracting conditions in the markets in which it operates. In fact, during 2023 no sanctions were received in relation to any of the markets in which it markets or provides its services.\n\nAdditionally, the company's conduct also helps to protect and enhance the reputation of the industry, therefore it actively participates and shares its knowledge and good practices in local, domestic and international forums, associations and other relevant entities and institutions, in order to strength-\n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.

The Impact on the environment section identifies different areas and business and non-business bodies of which the company forms part, which are part of the objective to promote its leadership and share its ideas and good practices.\n\n> Its presence in these environments leads it to responsibly exercise its role as a leading company in the tourist sector, avoiding the adoption of positions that could harm the sector and actively collaborating in actions that, carried out jointly, enable the continued development of the tourist industry and improvement of its reputation, whether on a local, regional, national and/or supranational.\n\n> Meliá maintains a dialogue with other companies in the industry that promotes listening and active collaboration, regardless of whether or not they are competitors. Thus, Meliá acts in good faith, ethically and honestly, to foster cordial and mutually beneficial relationships within the industry, bearing its competitors in mind and refraining from attracting customers or gathering customer information using unethical methods. This leads Meliá to even involve competing companies in the definition of its own material issues, as outlined in the 2023 Management Report in the Materiality section.\n\n> Meliá communicates and markets its products and services in an honest and ethical way, avoiding misleading advertising actions. This is an essential element for Meliá given that its customers are its raison d'être. That is why its ethical conduct standards lead it to comply with all of the applicable regulations in each of the countries in which it provides or markets its services.\n\nTo use the best available systems to guarantee the protection of data and information provided by customers, acting at all times with due diligence and responsibility in the processing of that data, with a special focus on data protection as outlined in the Cybersecurity section of the 2023 Management Report, a key area with regard to its technological development and for which its teams receive training in view of its importance.\n\nFurthermore, Meliá markets its products and services in a correct, transparent, truthful and honest way, avoiding misleading advertising or any other practice that may confuse or deceive customers. The fact the company has such high levels of loyalty and a strong NPS confirm that its customers perceive the transparency and quality in the company's value proposition, as shown very clearly in the sections on Brand architecture and Customer experience in particular. In this regard, the company also offers customers channels with clear information on the characteristics of its services, contracting conditions and prices, as well as channels through which customers can make claims or complaints if appropriate.\n\nThus, with clear focus on digitalisation, Meliá promotes the marketing of its services through its own channels, allowing direct contact with customers, end consumers and professionals, and it promotes its own customer loyalty programmes, whether individual or corporate. In this regard, Meliá provides its teams with the required training and development in order to adapt to changes in the marketing of its products, especially training on digital tools.\n\nWith regard to the ethical management of its partnerships, Meliá assumes the commitment to not establish commercial relationships with third parties that do not share its values, or that breach any legally established obligation in a demonstrable way as outlined in the section on Good governance, ethics and integrity in the 2023 Management Report, or in any of the approaches.\n\nLastly, Melia organises regular training and other initiatives aimed at raising awareness among staff about competition issues and how to communicate and market our products and services, both on our own channels (Website, App, Contact Center) and with third parties, OTAs, tour operators, etc. in order to ensure that the information provided is honest, transparent and ethical and that there is no disparity on the different channels. All employees access courses on our digital learning platform, when they join in order to obtain the\n\n203\n\n{215}------------------------------------------------\n\n# CONTENTS **Table of contents SASB Standards - Global Integration**\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.

This category includes the purchase of electricity, district heating and district cooling.\n\n### **SCOPE 3**\n\nGiven the nature of our business model, Scope 3 emissions are very significant in our activity. Thus, following recommendations and best practices, we continue to make progress in measuring our Scope 3 footprint, which includes all the following categories in our value chain:\n\n### **Category 1: purchase of goods and services**\n\nIndirect emissions in this category are estimated through an input/output economic analysis, using a proprietary tool and the emission factors from the database for CEDA 5 calculations (Complete environmental data sheet v5.0. CEDA provides information on emissions in the life cycle per monetary unit spent on goods and services).\n\nThe methodology for calculating emissions first breaks down the annual expense for each group of items purchased in the year of the report, taking into account the company code assigned to each group, and making it possible to differentiate between OPEX and/or CAPEX. Secondly, the cost of each group of articles is multiplied by the emission factor that best fits its denomination in the CEDA data.\n\nBelow is the main data used for the calculation of category 1:\n\n- This category includes all upstream emissions from the production of all goods or services purchased or acquired in the reporting year.\n- It includes materials (tangible products) and services (intangible products).\n- Source: Database of purchase organising companies.\n- The emission factors used from CEDA 5 (Complete environmental data file v 5.0.\n\n## **Category 2: equipment/capital assets**\n\nIndirect e missions in this category have been estimated through an input/ output economic analysis, using a proprietary tool with this method and the emission factors from the database for CEDA 5 calculations (Complete environmental data sheet v5.0.

Secondly, the cost of each group of articles is multiplied by the emission factor that best fits its denomination in the CEDA data.\n\n> Below is the main data used for the calculation of category 2, equipment and/or capital assets purchased:\n\n- This category includes all upstream emissions caused by equipment and/or capital goods acquired in the reporting year.\n- Source: Database of purchase organising companies.\n- The emission factors used from CEDA 5 (Complete environmental data file v 5.0\n\n### **Category 3: fuel and energy consumed by the company (not included in scope 1 and 2)**\n\nThese emissions are the ones associated with fuel and energy consumed that are not included in scopes 1 and 2. We calculate these emissions due to the fact that our fuel and energy consumption is a significant part of scope 3 emissions.\n\nWe used the AEI database (2018 version) and followed the updated Standard to use electricity emission factors and grid loss data obtained from global emission data sources (IEA, DEFRA and individual countries) to calculate transmission and distribution losses and emissions associated with the extraction, production and transportation of fuel.\n\n### **Category 5: waste**\n\nThe emissions associated with the management of waste generated on site are calculated taking into account the emissions derived from its treatment by third parties (recycling, composting, dumping and incineration).\n\nThe emissions associated with the management of waste generated on site are calculated based on their treatment: recycling, composting, landfill disposal and incineration; and the emission factors for each of them.\n\n### **Category 6: business trips**\n\nScope 3 emissions associated with business travel are obtained from the air travel report provided by our partner American Express Global Business Travel:\n\n• Emissions associated with flights based on the number of kilometres travelled and the emission factor provided by DEFRA (Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs).\n\n### **Category 7: commuting to work (employees)**\n\nIn order to calculate the emissions associated with the commute of our employees worldwide, we created a survey in 2019 to collect data on the distance each of them travels every day from their home to their workplace, the means of transport they use and the number of trips they make each day.\n\nUsing this information and based on the emission factors obtained from the GHG Protocol, we have calculated the total emissions for 2022.\n\n### **Category 11: Use of sold products**\n\nIt includes the scope 1 and 2 emissions from hotels that we provide a management service to.\n\n{218}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/218/Picture/1 description: The image shows the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\" in a light gray color.

Comparative information\".\n- Amendment to IAS 12: \"Tax Reform Pillar 2 Model Rules\"\n\n{229}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe accounting policies applied are consistent with those of the previous year, considering the adoption of the standards and interpretations mentioned above which have no greater impact on the consolidated financial statements or the financial position of the Group, except for the described impacts of the amendments to IAS 12 (see Note 19).\n\nThe amendments to standards issued and approved for use in the EU prior to the formulation date of these consolidated annual accounts, and which will enter into force in subsequent dates, are the following:\n\n• Amendment to IFRS 16: \"Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback\".\n\nIt is not expected that the adoption of the abovementioned standards will have significant impacts on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### 2.2. True Image\n\nThese Consolidated Annual Accounts have been prepared on the basis of the internal accounting records of the parent company, Meliá Hotels International, S.A., and the accounting records of the rest of the companies included in the scope of consolidation as detailed in Annex 1 and Annex 2, duly adjusted according to the accounting principles established in the IFRS adopted by the EU; and fairly present the equity, financial position and results of operations of the Company, and the cash flows for the related year.\n\n#### 2.3. Comparability\n\nThese consolidated annual accounts include the figures for year 2023 and, for comparison purposes, those for year 2022, of each of the items in the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Statement of Comprehensive Income, Statement of Changes in Equity and the Cash Flow Statement, all of them in consolidated form.\n\n#### 2.4. Alternative Performance Measures\n\nThe main alternative performance measures (APM) used by the Company are listed below, as well as the basis on which they are calculated, such measures being regarded as the measures of future or past financial performance, financial position or cash flows.\n\n#### Key financial indicators\n\nThe Group uses various subtotals from the EBIT. These subtotals are broken down in the Consolidated Income Statement, where their reconciliation in relation to the EBIT can be observed, as well as their comparative values.\n\n- EBITDAR: Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, Amortisation, & Rent. EBITDAR allows comparability among the hotel business units operated by the Group, regardless of the method through which the operation rights were acquired.\n- EBITDA: Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation & Amortisation. It offers an estimate of the net cash flow from operating activities. To this end, this indicator is also reported as a subtotal in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.\n\n#### Other financial indicators\n\n• EBITDAR and EBITDA without capital gains: The purpose of this indicator is to offer a measurement of the Company's operating income, excluding certain results from the property segment mainly related to the variation of the fair value of investment property and the asset rotation. Revenues and expenses derived from those activities are excluded from the calculation of EBITDA without capital gains, giving rise to revenues without capital gains, measurement used to calculate margins without capital gains.\n\n{230}------------------------------------------------\n\n| The reconciliation of EBITDAR and EBITDA without capital gains for year 2023, in relation to the subtotals reported in the<br>consolidated income statement, is as follows:             |           |             |          |          |

It measures the average price per room reached by a hotel in a specific time frame and provides valuable information as for price dynamics and type of customers of a specific hotel or group of hotels. Thus, this measurement is widely used in the industry and by the management team in order to estimate the prices the Company can charge based on the type of customer. Likewise, the changes applied to the average price per room have a different impact on revenues as well as on the business profitability in comparison with those applied to the occupancy rate. The result of the ARR calculation for 2023 and 2022 is as follows: 2023 2022 Room Income 1,123,977 969,332Occupied Rooms 7,085,809 6,524,586ARR (euros) 158.62 148.57\n\n|                | 2023      | 2022      |\n|----------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Room Income    | 1,123,977 | 969,332   |\n| Occupied Rooms | 7,085,809 | 6,524,586 |\n| ARR (euros)    | 158.62    | 148.57    |\n\n• RevPar (Revenue per available room): Revenue per available room is the result of dividing the total room revenue (see Note 7.1) by the number of available rooms. The management team uses this indicator to evaluate the business performance, since it is correlated with the two key indicators of the operations of a hotel or group of hotels: the occupancy rate and the average price per room.\n\n{232}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Likewise, the RevPar is used to measure and compare the performance in comparable periods between similar hotels.             |            |            |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n|                                                                                                                               |            |            |\n| The result of the RevPar calculation for 2023 and 2022 is as follows:                                                         |            |            |\n|                                                                                                                               | 2023       | 2022       |\n| Room Income                                                                                                                   | 1,123,977  | 969,332    |\n| Available Rooms                                                                                                               | 10,465,526 | 10,589,298 |\n| RevPAR (euros)                                                                                                                | 107.40     | 91.54      |\n|                                                                                                                               |            |            |\n| This indicator has improved compared to the previous year, in line with the increase in occupancy rates and the ARR as stated |            |            |\n| above, as a result of the activity recovery during this year 2023.                                                            |            |            |\n|                                                                                                                               |            |            |\n\n### 2.5. Consolidation\n\n#### Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are the companies over which the Group exercises effective control, generally accompanied by more than half of the voting rights.\n\nIn addition to the shareholding percentage, when assessing whether a controlling interest is held in a company, the Group considers the following aspects:\n\n- Influence over the investee, giving the Group the ability to manage its significant activities.\n- Right to the variable returns from its shareholding in the investee.\n- Ability to use its influence over the investee to have an impact on the amount of the returns obtained.\n\nAccording to the full consolidation method, the financial statements of subsidiaries are consolidated as from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are excluded from the consolidation as from the date on which such control ceases to exist. Intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated in full.\n\n#### Associates and Joint Ventures\n\nAssociates are all companies over which the Group exercises significant influence but not control. Significant influence generally includes between 20% and 50% of the voting rights and means the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee company.\n\nJoint ventures are joint agreements in which the parties that hold joint control under such agreements hold rights over the net assets thereof. The unanimous consent of the parties sharing control is required under these agreements.\n\nAssociates and joint ventures are consolidated using the equity method. According to this method, the carrying value of the investment is recognised initially at cost, and is increased or decreased to recognise the Group's interest in the results and in the income and expenses directly recognised in equity of the associate or joint venture after the date of acquisition. The Group's investment in associates and joint ventures includes goodwill identified on acquisition.\n\nThe Group's share in profit or loss after the date of acquisition of associates and joint ventures is recognised under heading Profit / (Loss) from companies carried by the equity method in the Consolidated Income Statement, and its share in movements in other comprehensive income is directly recognised in equity, including the relevant adjustment to the carrying value of the investment.\n\nWhere the accumulated losses incurred by an associate or joint venture result in a negative equity, the Group adds the amount of any other item that may be considered to be greater in value than the net investment until said investment is reduced to zero. From that moment on, the Company takes into account any additional losses by recognising a liability, only to the extent that it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or has made payments on behalf of the investee company or joint venture.\n\nCurrently, the Group does not participate in joint ventures that must be included using the proportional consolidation method.\n\n{233}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Consistency in terms of timing and measurement\n\nAll subsidiaries included in the scope of consolidation close their fiscal year on 31 December, so the relevant annual accounts for 2023 have been used for consolidation purposes, and if the annual accounts have not yet been prepared, the corresponding accounting records have been used, once the appropriate measurement adjustments to ensure compliance with the relevant IFRS adapted by the European Union have been carried out.\n\n#### Business combinations\n\nIf the business combination is achieved in stages, the carrying value on the acquisition date of the interest in the acquiree's equity previously held by the acquirer is remeasured at fair value on the acquisition date, and any loss or profit arising from this new measurement is recognised in the income statement for the year.\n\nIn business combinations, the excess between the cost of the combination and the acquirer's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recorded as Goodwill in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nThe excess between the acquirer's interest, where appropriate, after reassessing the identification and valuation of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, and the cost of the business combination, is recognised in the income statement for the year.\n\nWhen the Group first applied IFRS, it did not apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations that occurred before the date of transition, and it availed itself of the exemption provided for in IFRS 1 \"First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards\", therefore, the existing goodwill provided for in the Spanish legislation as at 31 December 2003, net of accumulated depreciation to that date, was allocated to the goodwill under the heading Intangible Assets.\n\n#### Purchase of non-controlling interests\n\nOnce control is obtained, any subsequent operations in which the controlling company acquires more non-controlling interests, or sells interests without losing control, are accounted for as transactions with equity instruments. It follows from the above that:\n\n- Any difference between the amounts by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in consolidated equity and attributed to the owners of the controlling company.\n- The carrying value of the goodwill is not adjusted, and no gains or losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n#### Sale of controlling interests\n\nWhen the Group ceases to have control over a subsidiary, any retained interest is recognised at fair value at the date when control is lost, and the change in the carrying amount is recognised in the income statement for the year. In the case of companies owning hotels, the result is recognised as Capital gains of fixed assets in the Consolidated Income Statement (see Note 3.11). The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of the subsequent recognition of the interest retained as associate, joint venture or financial asset.\n\n#### Loss of significant influence\n\nIf the Group no longer exercises significant influence over the associate or joint venture, it measures and recognises the investment maintained at fair value. Any difference between the carrying value of the associate at the time significant influence is lost and the fair value of the investment maintained plus the income obtained on the sale is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n#### Elimination of inter-company transactions\n\nThe inter-company balances for inter-company transactions relating to loans, leases, dividends, financial assets and liabilities, sale and purchase of inventories and fixed assets and provision of services, have been eliminated. Regarding the sale and purchase transactions, the unrealised profit margin with regard to third parties has been reversed so that the corresponding assets are stated at cost, thus adjusting the depreciations carried out.\n\n#### Non-controlling interests\n\nThe proportional part of equity corresponding to the Group's non-controlling interests, calculated in accordance with IFRS 10, is recorded under this heading of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n{234}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Profit or loss attributed to non-controlling interests\n\nThis relates to the share in consolidated profit or loss for the year corresponding to the non-controlling interests.\n\n#### Translation of the annual accounts of the foreign companies\n\nAll the assets and liabilities of companies with a functional currency other than the euro and which are included in the scope of consolidation, are translated to euro at the exchange rate existing at year end.\n\nItems in the Profit and Loss Account have been translated at the exchange rates existing on the dates on which the relevant transactions were carried out.\n\nThe difference between the amount of the foreign companies' equity, including the balance of the Profit and Loss Account calculated according to the previous paragraph, translated at the historical exchange rate, and the equity position resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities as mentioned in the first paragraph, is recorded with a positive or negative sign, as appropriate, in the equity of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, under the Translation differences heading, net of the portion of such difference corresponding to noncontrolling interests, which is recorded under the Non-controlling interests item in equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments of the Balance Sheet items upon the acquisition of interests in a foreign company, are recognised as assets and liabilities of the company acquired and, therefore, translated at the exchange rate existing at year end, and the exchange differences that may arise are recognised under the Translation differences heading.\n\nUpon total or partial disposal or reimbursement of contributions of a company with a functional currency other than the Euro, cumulative translation differences since 1 January 2004 (date of transition to IFRS) relating to said company, recognised in the consolidated equity, are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement as a gain or loss on disposal.\n\n#### 2.6. Accounting Valuations and Estimates\n\nDirectors have prepared the Group's consolidated annual accounts using judgments, estimates and assumptions which have an effect on the application of the accounting policies described in Note 3, as well as on the balances of assets, liabilities, income and expenses and the breakdown of contingent assets and liabilities at the issuance date of these consolidated annual accounts.\n\nSuch estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors considered reasonable and relevant under the circumstances. The carrying amount of assets and liabilities, which is not readily apparent from other sources, has been established based on these estimates. These estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed; the effects of the reviews on the accounting estimates are recognised whether in the year in which they are realised, if they have an effect solely on such period, or in the period under review and future periods, if the review affects both periods. However, the uncertainty inherent in the estimates and assumptions could lead to results that may require an adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities affected in future periods.\n\nThe estimates made are detailed, where appropriate, in each of the explanatory notes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet captions. The estimates and judgment that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements and may involve adjustments in future years are set out below:\n\n#### Estimated impairment loss on goodwill and other non-financial assets\n\nThe Group verifies annually whether there is an impairment loss in respect of goodwill and other fixed assets, in accordance with Notes 3.1, 3.2 and 3.12. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units under lease and those other than hotels with which goodwill is associated are calculated from its value in use.\n\nOn the other hand, the recoverable amounts of cash-generating units under ownership have been determined based on the fair value estimated according to the appraisals undertaken by independent experts using valuation techniques such as expected discounted cash flows from such assets.\n\nThese calculations are based on reasonable assumptions in accordance with past yields obtained and future production and market development expectations.\n\nHowever, cash flow projections have a considerable degree of uncertainty due to the possible effects that some factors, such as the geopolitical context, inflation or environmental risks, inter alia, have on the occupancy rate and the average price per room, which may lead to adjustments in the carrying amounts of the assets of the cash-generating units in the future, in particular, of those under lease, given the significant difference between the fair value and the carrying value of most of the assets under ownership.\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Corporate income tax\n\nThe calculation of income tax requires the interpretation of the tax legislation applicable to the countries in which the Group companies operate. There are also several factors related mainly, but not exclusively, to changes in tax laws and changes in the interpretation of tax laws currently in force that require the use of estimates by the directors of the parent company.\n\nDirectors of the parent company must carry out significant estimates to determine the amount of the deferred tax assets that can be recognised, by considering the amounts and the dates on which future taxable profits will be obtained and the reversal period of the taxable temporary differences.\n\nWhere there is an uncertainty in relation to the income tax treatments, the Group assesses whether a tax authority is likely to accept an uncertain tax treatment. If it concludes that the tax authority is likely to accept an uncertain tax treatment, the effect of the uncertainty on the taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses and unused tax credits or the corresponding tax rates is reflected. The effect of the uncertainty is reflected using the method that, in each case, better foreshadows the resolution of the uncertainty: the most probable amount or the expected value. In each case, the Company makes an assessment of whether each uncertain tax treatment must be considered separately or jointly with another or several uncertain tax treatments, in line with the approach that better foreshadows the resolution of the uncertainty.\n\nNote 19 includes the breakdowns regarding the corporate income tax estimates.\n\n#### Fair value of derivative financial instruments\n\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using measurement techniques, as specified in Note 3.5. The Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based mainly on market conditions at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. Most of these measurements are obtained from the financial institutions with which the instruments were contracted or are determined by reference to the fair value of the asset from which these derive.\n\n#### Fair value of investment property\n\nThe Group uses the fair value method in measuring investment property. The estimation of this fair value is mainly carried out based on the appraisals undertaken by independent experts using valuation techniques such as expected discounted cash flows from such assets, as well as regular updates of the Company based on such studies.\n\n#### Post-employment benefits\n\nThe cost of defined benefit pension plans is calculated using actuarial valuations. Actuarial valuations require the use of assumptions on discount rates, asset yields, salary increases, mortality tables and rotation, as well as the retirement age of employees with right to these benefits. These estimates are subject to significant uncertainties due to the long-term settlement of these plans.\n\nThe valuation of these commitments has been calculated by reputable independent experts using actuarial valuation techniques. Note 16.2 gives details of the assumptions used to calculate these commitments.\n\n#### Inflation and exchange rate to be applied to the consolidation of Venezuelan subsidiaries\n\nIn October 2021, Venezuela replaced the Bolívar soberano (VES), which was applied until such date, with the Bolívar digital (VED), by dividing the value of the new currency by 1,000,000 (VED 1 = VES 1,000,000).\n\nHowever, since 2017 and due to the ongoing complex political and economic situation in the country, the Company considers that the different official exchange rates do not reflect the economic situation of the country and, therefore, decided to internally estimate the exchange rate that is most appropriate for the consolidation of the financial statements of its subsidiaries in Venezuela.\n\nThis estimated exchange rate, based on the high inflation to which the price of goods and services of the country are subjected, has been calculated based on the last official exchange rate of 2014, updated according to the corresponding inflation rate in each period from then on.\n\nThe inflation considered for this calculation in 2023 has been 185.71%; 256.03% in 2022, both estimates based on studies carried out by independent experts. The Central Bank of Venezuela has published inflation figures for 2023 of 193%.\n\nThe Group will continue to assess the political and economic situation in the country in order to adopt any change in the exchange rate which may be applicable for the consolidation of its Venezuelan subsidiaries.\n\n{236}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 2.7. Cash Flow Statements\n\nThe consolidated cash flow statement includes the cash movements during the fiscal year, calculated by the indirect method. The expressions used in the consolidated cash flow statement have the following meanings:\n\n- Cash flows: Inflows and outflows of cash or other cash equivalents, these being understood to be investments for a period of less than 3 months with high liquidity and low risk of changes in value.\n- Operating activities: These are the activities that constitute the main source of ordinary income of the Group, as well as other activities that cannot be classified as investment or financing.\n- Investment activities: The acquisition, sale or other disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash and cash equivalents.\n- Financing activities: Activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the equity and of liabilities of a financial nature.\n\nCash flows from operating activities include the capital gains generated by asset rotation activities, if transactions are carried out during the year, while the net carrying amount of the assets disposed of is recognised under the heading Investment activities.\n\nIn relation to lease payments, the total amount of the cash flows paid in each fiscal year is divided between principal (included in financing activities) and interest (included also in financing activities).\n\n## Note 3. Accounting Policies\n\n#### 3.1. Intangible Assets\n\n#### Goodwill\n\nGoodwill generated on consolidation represents the difference between the acquisition price of fully consolidated subsidiaries and the Group's interest in the market value of identifiable assets and liabilities of subsidiaries.\n\nGoodwill generated in acquisitions prior to the date of transition to IFRS is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net value recorded as of 31 December 2003.\n\nGoodwill is not depreciated. Instead, goodwill review studies are carried out annually to identify any impairment losses. Impairment losses are recognised if the recoverable value, determined based on the current value of future expected cash flows of the cashgenerating units associated with goodwill and discounted at a rate which considers the specific risks of each generating unit, is lower than the amount initially assigned. Impairment loss recognised for goodwill shall not be reversed in subsequent periods. These measurements are carried out internally. Note 9 includes details regarding their calculation.\n\n#### Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets relate to several software applications, as well as transfer rights and industrial property.\n\nSoftware applications are valued at cost price or production cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life of 5 to 10 years. Software maintenance-related expenses are recognised as an expense when incurred.\n\nThe investments in technological innovation incurred by the Group in producing identifiable and unique software programmes controlled by the Group are included under this heading. In addition, these comply with the following conditions:\n\n- The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.\n- The Company intends to use or sell the intangible asset.\n- The Company can use or sell the intangible asset.\n- It can be demonstrated how the intangible asset will generate probable future financial benefits.\n- Adequate technical, financial and other resources are available to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset.\n- The expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be reliably measured.\n\n{237}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software programmes include the labour cost of the staff developing the programmes and a suitable percentage of general costs.\n\nTransfer rights relate mainly to the acquisition costs of operating and management rights for various hotels and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the term of the agreements related to these rights.\n\nInvestments carried out in trademarks, which are initially recognised at cost, are not amortised as their useful life is indefinite. The remaining items included in industrial property are amortised on a straight-line basis over a five-year period.\n\nAt each year end, the Group assesses whether there is an indication of impairment loss of this type of assets, and if so, the recoverable amount of these assets is estimated according to the methodology described in Note 3.2.\n\n### 3.2. Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost, including transaction costs, plus the financial expenses directly attributable to the acquisition, construction and renovation incurred to bring the assets into operating conditions, if any, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses according to the provisions of this Note.\n\nThe repairs which do not extend the useful life or the production capacity of the assets and the maintenance expenses are charged directly to the Consolidated Income Statement. Costs that extend or improve the useful life of the assets or can only be used with the item of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as an increase in their value.\n\nThe Group depreciates its property, plant and equipment by the straight-line method over the years of estimated useful life, as follows:\n\n| Buildings          | 40-50 years |\n|--------------------|-------------|\n| Plant              | 15-18 years |\n| Machinery          | 10-18 years |\n| Furniture          | 10-15 years |\n| Software           | 3-8 years   |\n| Vehicles           | 5-10 years  |\n| Other fixed assets | 4-8 years   |\n\nSuch depreciation, however, is adjusted for those assets associated with lease contracts, which are depreciated over the shorter of the assets' useful life and the lease term.\n\nThe useful life and residual value of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each Consolidated Balance Sheet date, specifically considering whether climate-related risks require a change in the useful life and residual value of assets. Land is not subject to systematic depreciation since it is considered to have indefinite useful life, however it is subject to impairment tests.\n\nThe Other fixed assets heading also includes the amount of the inventory of spare parts valued at realisable value. Breakages and losses are recorded as Disposals, and their cost is recognised under heading \"Other operating expenses\" in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n#### Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nAt each year end, the Company assesses whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. An asset's or cash-generating unit's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cash-generating unit's fair value less costs to sell and value in use, and is determined individually for each asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Regularly, the Group obtains valuations carried out by independent experts of the fair value of its owned hotel assets whether operated by the Company or leased to third parties, as well as certain hotels under lease. Such valuations are completed with the valuations made internally.\n\nWhen determining the value of the assets, the valuation criterion most used by the experts is the discounted cash flow, since hotel investments are generally valued according to the potential future income. In certain cases, other valuation methods are used, such as the comparable method or the residual value method. The latter method is mainly used to value plots and land.\n\nAt the end of the years in which valuations by independent experts are not obtained, the Group assesses whether there is an indication that its tangible assets may be impaired. For owned hotels, the Group considers whether there is any indication that they have suffered an impairment loss mainly based on the operating result of the various cash-generating units, as well as observable external sources of information revealing that the value of the asset during the period has decreased more than expected as a consequence of the passage of time or its normal use, due to changes that may have occurred in the environment in which the hotel operates. In addition, other factors such as geopolitical circumstances, economic situation or natural disasters that may affect the recoverable amount of such assets are taken into account.\n\n{238}------------------------------------------------\n\nIf such indication exists, or when annual impairment test for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset's recoverable amount on the basis of the methodology used in the last valuation carried out by the independent expert for the relevant asset or cash-generating unit.\n\nIn assessing value in use, the Group projects future cash flows by considering the budget approved by the governing bodies of the Company for 2024, and applying growth assumptions that are consistent with the market in which the asset operates and its historical performance for a period of 10 years and estimating a residual value according to a long-term growth rate not higher than the expected growth of the economy and the sector in which the asset operates. In the case of assets under lease, cash flows are projected for the estimated term of the lease, as described in Note 3.12. Estimated future cash flows are discounted using a discount rate before taxes which reflects changes in the value of money over time in the current market and the specific risks of the asset which have not been adjusted in the estimated future cash flows, mainly the risks of the business and the country in which the asset is located, as well as the significant climate risks that may affect it.\n\nWhere the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and its carrying value is reduced to its recoverable amount. Losses due to impairment of ongoing activities are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the expense category in accordance with the function of the impaired asset.\n\nAn assessment is made each year end as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. This increase cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in previous years. This reversal is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year. After such reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset's revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.\n\n### 3.3. Investment Property\n\nThe investments carried out by the Group to obtain lease income or capital gains, and which generate cash flows independently of the other assets held by the Group, are recorded under this heading.\n\nAfter the initial recognition made for the total amount of the costs related to the asset acquisition transaction, the Group has chosen the application of the fair value model, therefore, all investment properties are recognised at fair value, and any upward and downward changes in fair value occurred are included under headings \"Other operating expenses\" and \"Capital gains of fixed assets\" in the Consolidated Income Statement. In the case of disposals of investment property, the difference between the fair value of the agreed consideration and the carrying amount is included in heading \"Capital gains of fixed assets\" in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nAt each year end, the Group updates the fair value assessment of each property, either through the valuation made by an independent expert, or by contrasting the main variables used in the last available valuation made by the expert with updated information. The best evidence of the fair value is the current prices in an active market for similar properties. Where this information is not available, future discounted cash flows are estimated, on the basis of the budget approved by the governing bodies of the Company for the next year, and applying growth assumptions in line with the market in which such asset operates.\n\n### 3.4. Segment Reporting\n\nInformation on operating segments is presented according to the internal information as provided to key decision-makers within the Group. Key decision-makers means the Senior Executive Team (SET), which is responsible for allocating resources and evaluating performance of operating segments. The SET is a collegiate body consisting of the Chief Officers of each General Management and the CEO (Chief Executive Officer).\n\n#### 3.5. Financial Instruments\n\nThe Group recognises financial assets or financial liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheet when it becomes party to the contractual clauses of the related instrument.\n\n#### Financial Assets\n\nFinancial assets within the scope of IRFS 9 are classified, according to the valuation criteria, as financial assets at amortised cost, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, and financial assets at fair value through profit and loss. The classification in one category or another will depend on the characteristics of the financial asset's contractual cash flows and on the management model of the Company used to manage such assets.\n\n{239}------------------------------------------------\n\nFinancial assets are initially measured at fair value, except for trade receivables, which are measured at their transaction price if they do not have a significant financial component.\n\n#### Financial assets at amortised cost\n\nThis classification includes the amounts recorded under the Trade and other receivables heading, and all the collection rights included in headings Other non-current financial assets and Other current financial assets.\n\nSuch assets are subsequently recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or are impaired.\n\nNon-current deposits and guarantees are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, however they are not discounted, since the effect of the restatement would not be significant.\n\nThese assets are maintained in order to obtain contractual cash flows and they only give rise to principal and interest payments on the outstanding principal amount.\n\n#### Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss include held-for-trading financial assets acquired for the purposes of selling them mainly in the short term, as well as unlisted equity instruments of companies over which no control or significant influence is exercised.\n\n#### Operations involving the assignment of financial assets\n\nThe Company derecognises an assigned financial asset when it assigns the contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated by the asset or, even when retaining such rights, it assumes a contractual obligation to pay them to the assignees and the risks and rewards associated with the ownership of the asset are substantially transferred.\n\nIn case of assignment of assets in which the risks and rewards associated with the ownership of the financial asset are substantially retained, the assigned financial asset is not derecognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and a related financial liability is recognised for an amount equal to the consideration received, which is subsequently measured at amortised cost. The assigned financial asset continues to be measured according to the same criteria applied prior to the assignment. The income derived from the assigned asset and the expenses derived from the related financial liability are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement without offset.\n\n#### Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe Company applies a simplified approach when calculating the expected credit losses of financial assets at amortised cost and, where appropriate, a value adjustment for the expected credit losses over the entire life of the asset is recognised at each closing date. To do that, the Group has established a matrix of provisions based on its history of credit losses, adjusted by the prospective factors specific for such assets.\n\nDue to the characteristics of the main sector in which the Company operates, the customers of the hotel segment have minimal risk of insolvency.\n\nIn relation to the Vacation Club customers, the Company can terminate the contracts, therefore, the impact of the cancellation of such receivable would also imply the derecognition in the accounts of liabilities pending to be executed.\n\n#### Financial Liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities within the scope of IRFS 9 are classified, according to the valuation criteria, as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss, and financial liabilities at fair value through other comprehensive income. These liabilities are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. All non-derivative financial liabilities of the Group are included within the category Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.\n\nFinancial expenses deriving from financial liabilities are recognised as they accrue.\n\nThe Group derecognises financial liabilities when the obligations giving rise to them cease to exist.\n\n#### Issuance of debentures and other marketable securities\n\nDebt issues are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, less directly attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost applying the effective interest method. Bonds with a maturity exceeding twelve months are classified as non-current liabilities, while those with shorter maturity than that are included under current liabilities.\n\n{240}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Interest-bearing loans and borrowings\n\nAll loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received, net of any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement associated with these loans.\n\nAfter initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n#### Bank loans and credit facilities\n\nLoans are initially recognised at the amount received, net of transaction costs. After initial measurement, they are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n#### Trade creditors and other payables\n\nTrade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n#### Lease liabilities\n\nNote 3.12 provides information on the valuation method and accounting policies regarding this type of liabilities.\n\n#### Other financial liabilities at amortised cost\n\nThe remaining financial liabilities that relate to payment obligations as detailed in Note 13, are also measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. However, financial liabilities with short-term maturities and which have no contractual interest rate are measured at their face value provided the effect of not adjusting the cash flows is not material.\n\n#### Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or as accounting hedges, with the latter relating to financial assets or liabilities at fair value through other comprehensive income. In both cases, derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which they are arranged, and this fair value is regularly adjusted. Derivatives are carried as assets, under the heading Other financial assets, when the fair value is positive and as liabilities, under the heading Other financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. They are classified as current or non-current depending on the estimated timing of cash flows.\n\n#### Accounting Hedges\n\nThe Company has opted to continue to apply the requirements on accounting hedges under IAS 39, in accordance with paragraph 7.2.21 of IRFS 9.\n\nThe Company applies hedge accounting to those operations in which the hedge is expected to be highly effective; that is, when the changes in the fair value or in the cash flows of the items covered by the hedge are offset by the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging instruments with an effectiveness comprised between 80% and 125%. In addition, at the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedged item and the derivative financial instrument designated for that purpose is formally documented.\n\nThe Group has various interest rate swaps classified as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are reflected in equity, under the heading Other measurement adjustments, being allocated by the part considered an effective hedge to the Consolidated Income Statement insofar as the item being hedged is also settled. The fair value is entered in the accounts according to the date of trade.\n\nThe fair value of interest rate swaps is determined through the discounted cash flow measurement technique according to the characteristics of each contract, such as the face amount and the collection and payment schedule. The discount factors used to obtain said value are calculated based on the curve of the zero-coupon rates obtained from the deposits and rates listed in the market on the date of measurement. The resulting fair value is adjusted for the own credit risk and that of the counterparty, according to IFRS 13. These values are obtained from studies carried out usually by the financial institutions with which the Group has contracted these instruments.\n\n{241}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting\n\nAny profit or loss arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives which do not qualify to be classified as hedging instruments are directly recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year. The fair value of these derivative financial instruments is obtained based on studies carried out by independent experts, particularly appraisals of non-financial assets when the derivative arises from a purchase option.\n\n#### 3.6 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\n\nIf there are assets which carrying value is expected to be recovered through a sale rather than by means of their continued use, such assets are recorded under the heading Non-current assets held for sale.\n\nThey are recognised at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The Company recognises an impairment loss for initial or subsequent write-down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell. The Company recognises a gain for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of the cumulative impairment loss that has been recognised.\n\nIn the Consolidated Income Statement, income and expenses from discontinued operations are presented separately from the income and expenses from continued operations, under profit/(loss) after taxes. Assets held for sale are not depreciated.\n\nThe non-current assets that are for sale, within the asset rotation segment, but which are still operated by the Group until their sale, are not reclassified under this heading in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are maintained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet according to their nature.\n\n#### 3.7. Inventories (Commercial Inventories, Raw Materials and Other Supplies)\n\nRaw and ancillary materials are measured at their average acquisition cost, which is generally lower than their net realisable value, any necessary measurement adjustments being made in case their estimated realisable value is lower than their cost. The acquisition price includes the amount included in the invoice plus all additional expenses incurred until the goods are stored in the warehouse. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the costs estimated to be incurred in the selling processes.\n\n#### 3.8. Treasury Shares\n\nTreasury shares are presented as a decrease in the Group's equity and are stated at cost without carrying out any measurement adjustments.\n\nGains and losses obtained on disposal of treasury shares are recorded directly against equity.\n\n#### 3.9. Government Grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised at fair value only when there is a reasonable certainty that the conditions for receiving the grant will be fulfilled and such grants will be effectively received.\n\nWhere the grant relates to an expense item, it is taken to the income statement over the period necessary to match the grant, on a systematic basis, with the costs to be offset by the grant.\n\nWhere the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is recognised as deferred income and is taken to the income statement based on the expected useful life of such asset.\n\n#### 3.10. Provisions and Contingencies\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Group:\n\n- Has a present obligation, legal or implicit, because of a past event.\n- It is probable that an outflow of funds including economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.\n- A reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nProvisions are carried at the present value of the best possible estimate of the amount needed to settle or transfer to a third party the obligation. Adjustments due to updating the provision are recognised as a financial expense as they accrue. Provisions maturing in one year or less with a non-significant financial effect are not discounted.\n\nProvisions are reviewed at each Consolidated Balance Sheet date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimate of the liability at such date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties relating to the obligation.\n\n{242}------------------------------------------------\n\nOn the other hand, contingent liabilities are the possible obligations, arising from past events, the materialisation of which is subject to the occurrence of future events which are not entirely under the Group's control, and those present obligations, arising as a result of past events, which are not likely to give rise to an outflow of resources for their settlement or which cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. These contingent liabilities are not recognised in the accounts, but are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated annual accounts (see Note 21).\n\n### Post-employment benefits\n\nPost-employment plans are classed as defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans.\n\n### Defined contribution pension plans\n\nDefined contribution plans are those plans under which the Group makes fixed contributions to an independent entity and does not have any legal, contractual or implicit obligation to make additional contributions if the independent entity does not hold sufficient assets to satisfy the commitments assumed.\n\nContributions are recognised as employee benefits when they accrue.\n\n#### Defined benefit pension plans\n\nPension plans that are not defined contribution plans are considered as defined benefit plans. In general, defined benefit plans fix the amount of the benefit that the employee will receive on retirement, usually based on one or more factors such as age, number of years of service and remuneration.\n\nThe Group recognises in the Consolidated Balance Sheet a provision for defined benefit awards established in collective bargaining agreements in an amount corresponding to the difference between the present value of the committed benefits and the fair value of any assets linked to the benefit commitments which will be used to settle the obligations, less any past service costs still not recognised, if any.\n\nIf an asset results from the above-mentioned difference, its valuation may not exceed the current value of the economic benefits that may be available in the form of reimbursements from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nPast service costs are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement unless they involve non-vested rights, in which case they are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the period remaining to the vesting of the past service rights.\n\nThe current value of the obligation is determined using actuarial calculation methods and unbiased financial and actuarial assumptions that are mutually compatible. The Company recognises directly in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the profits and losses arising from the change in the current value, and, where applicable, the plan assets, as a result of the changes in actuarial assumptions or adjustments made on the basis of experience.\n\nCertain collective bargaining agreements in force and applicable to some Group companies establish that permanent staff for a specified number of years employed by the Company who opt to terminate their employment contract will be entitled to a cash award equal to a number of monthly salary payments which is proportional to the number of years of service. During the fiscal year, an assessment of these commitments has been performed in accordance with the actuarial assumptions contained in Group's own rotation model, by applying the calculation method known as the projected unit credit method and the population assumptions corresponding to the PER2020 tables.\n\nThe balance of provisions, as well as the capitalisation of payments for future services, cover these acquired commitments, based on an actuarial analysis prepared by an independent expert. This valuation is detailed in Note 16.2.\n\nThe Group has duly externalised the pension commitments and obligations stipulated in collective bargaining agreements subject to the Ministerial Order of 2 November 2006. Assets related to these externalisation operations are recognised as a reduction in the balance of the acquired commitments.\n\n#### 3.11. Revenue Recognition\n\nThe operating revenues arising from contracts with customers are recognised as the obligations undertaken with such customers are met by the Company.\n\nWhen recognising such revenues, the 5-stage analysis included in IFRS 15 is carried out, in order to determine the amount and the moment of revenue recognition for each of the contracts with customers of its operating segments:\n\n- Identification of the customer's contract.\n- Identification of the performance obligations.\n- Determination of the transaction price.\n- Allocation of the price to the various performance obligations.\n- Revenue recognition according to the fulfilment of each obligation.\n\n{243}------------------------------------------------\n\nSuch revenues are shown net of discounts, refunds and value added tax. The Group bases its return estimates on past results, having regard to the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specific circumstances of each agreement.\n\n#### Sale of rooms and other related services\n\nRevenues deriving from the sale of rooms are daily recognised based on the services provided by each hotel establishment and including \"in-house\" customers, i.e. those that are still lodged at the hotel at the time daily production is closed. For this type of contracts, the only execution obligation identified is that of the own hotel service, which includes making available the hotel rooms to the customers.\n\nWhere the hotel rate includes services such as food and beverage (breakfast, half board or full board), an additional execution obligation is identified, to which a differentiated price is allocated on the basis of the expected cost plus a margin approach. It is worth mentioning that in hotels marketed only under all-inclusive regime (mainly located in America), this is not considered as a differentiated service, however, for the purposes of breakdown, a percentage of the rate is allocated to item 'revenues for food and beverages'.\n\nIn any case, the execution obligations undertaken with hotel customers are considered as fulfilled over time, during the stay of the customer in the establishment, and the Group recognises the daily revenues corresponding to the services consumed by the customer on that date.\n\nWithin the hotel business segment, the Company manages the customer loyalty programme \"Meliá Rewards\", which consists of rewarding customers who stay in hotels or use services provided by associates and joint ventures, through a series of points that are exchangeable for rewards such as, among other things, free stays in hotels managed by the Group.\n\nIf a hotel customer is member of the loyalty programme and accumulates points for his/her stays, a differentiated performance obligation is identified, to which an amount is allocated depending on the fair value of such points, and will be met at the time the member of the programme uses the points obtained, by deferring until such time the recognition of revenues in the Consolidated Income Statement of the Group, for the amount allocated to such obligation.\n\nAdditionally, other services provided directly by the hotels, such as rent of rooms, organisation of events, rent of commercial premises to third parties, etc... are included under heading 'Other business revenues' in the table included in Note 7.1 to these consolidated annual accounts and are recognised depending on the IRFS applicable at the time in which the service is rendered.\n\n#### Provision of hotel management services\n\nWith regard to contracts with hotel owners for the management of their establishments, there are several performance obligations identified in each of the contracts. The main obligation of the Group in such contracts is to provide hotel management services for these establishments. The consideration for these services is established as a percentage of the amount of the total revenues and the Gross Operating Profit (GOP) generated by the management of the Group. Every month, the Company recognises the corresponding revenues in the Consolidated Income Statement depending on the progress of both magnitudes for each of the hotel management contracts, according to the contractual terms and conditions set out in each of them.\n\nThe other performance obligations differentiated in the hotel management contracts relate to services linked to such activity, such as fees for reservations made through the own channels of Meliá Group, or licences for use of own or centrally managed software applications. The Company recognises the revenues from the provision of these services as these obligations are met which, in the case of fees for reservations, coincide with the customer's stay in the hotel.\n\nThese revenues are broken down in Note 7.1 to these consolidated annual accounts.\n\n#### Sale of vacation club units\n\nWith regard to the contracts for the sale of vacation club units, the Group has identified as a performance obligation the provision of the marketed units to Club customers in their corresponding weeks. Regardless of the contract term, such obligation is considered to be met when the customer uses such weeks, moment in which the revenues are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. The Group distributes the consideration received in proportion to the number of weeks included in the contract, deferring the recognition of revenues, net of the costs incurred in obtaining them, until the moment of use and recognising the amount of non-used weeks under heading 'Capital grants and other deferred income' in liabilities of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which are weighted taking into account the percentage of rights not used based on the historical performance of the portfolio of vacation club customers.\n\nThe consideration agreed in most of these contracts with customers of the vacation club includes the payment of interest derived from the deferred payments agreed in such contracts. The Group recognises the revenue from such interest over time when the right to receive it is generated, since the customers have the possibility to pay in advance the outstanding amounts.\n\n{244}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Fixed assets capital gains\n\nThe Company actively manages its real estate assets portfolio. In general, these are sales transactions for asset rotation which can be organised through the direct sale of the asset or through the sale of the company owning such asset. The net income of such transactions is shown under heading Operating revenues as Fixed assets capital gains and is calculated as set out in paragraph 71 of IAS 16, by deducting from the fair value of the consideration received the carrying amount of the assets disposed of. Likewise, the increase in the fair value of investment property is recognised under this heading in the Consolidated Income Statement, as stated in Note 3.3.\n\nLikewise, this operating segment of the Company includes sales transactions and/or the contribution of hotels to associates and joint ventures for the purposes of maximising present and future cash flows of this portfolio. These transactions involve the derecognition of the hotels in the consolidated annual accounts and the recognition of the consideration received, whether in cash or the retained interest, or a combination of both.\n\nThe Group recognises the retained residual interest in such hotel businesses at fair value, taking any change in the carrying value to the income statement, as detailed in Note 2.5. Therefore, the recognised capital gains tally with the obtained capital gains.\n\n#### Lease income\n\nIncome deriving from leases of investment properties is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and is included as operating revenues under the asset management segment.\n\n#### Interest income\n\nInterest income is recognised using the effective interest method for all the financial instruments measured at amortised cost. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts payments made and received in cash estimated over the expected life of the financial instrument. Interest income is recognised as financial income in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n### Dividends\n\nIncome from dividends is recognised when the right of the Group to receive the corresponding payment is established.\n\n#### 3.12 Leases\n\nThe Group assesses at inception of an agreement whether the agreement contains a lease. If this is the case, the corresponding lease liability and right of use are recorded. Otherwise, the lease payments are recognised as an operating expense as the economic benefits of the leased assets are realised.\n\nThe lease liability is initially calculated as the present value of the fixed or substantially fixed lease payments which have not been disbursed on that date, discounted by using an incremental rate during the minimum non-cancellable period, and considering the extension options that can reasonably be exercised and the periods with option to terminate that are not reasonably possible to exercise.\n\nThe initial recognition of the right-of-use asset includes the initial measurement of the liability, including the payments made before the start of the lease and the initial direct costs, discounting the rewards received. It is a common practice to establish clauses in hotel lease contracts that require some payments to improve the asset by the lessee. In such circumstances, these improvements are not specific and are included as further payments to be discounted, affecting both the liability and the right of use.\n\nSubsequently, the right of use is measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The depreciation period is the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset, whichever occurs first. Additionally, the value is adjusted if new measurements of the liability are made due to circumstances affecting the amounts of the payments or the lease term. Some of these changes require a review of the discount rate used.\n\nThe Group applies IAS 36 in order to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and recognises any impairment losses identified.\n\n{245}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Company has applied the following accounting policies, estimates and criteria:\n\n#### Scope\n\nThe Company applies the low-value exemption for lease contracts which underlying assets do not exceed USD 5,000 and the short-term exemption for lease contracts with a duration of less than one year. Lease and non-lease components are not separated in those assets in which these components are not likely to affect the total lease value.\n\nThe Company considers that the hotel management agreements are not within the scope of IRFS 16 application and, therefore, management revenues are recognised under IFRS 15 (see Note 3.11).\n\n#### Lease payments\n\nIn addition to fixed (or, basically, fixed) payments included in lease contracts, the Company includes in lease payments the following circumstances:\n\nMost hotel lease contracts include a contingent payment based on the consumer price index of the country in which the asset is located, which usually is reviewed every year, and is applied to the payments due, with lease liabilities and rights of use being recalculated based on such review. The index value at the date of lease inception is considered in the calculation of the lease payments.\n\nIn lease contracts with variable payment for which a minimum lease payment is set for defined periods, this amount is considered in the initial calculation, with the amount of the variable payment exceeding such minimum lease payment being recognised as an expense under heading Leases in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n#### Lease term\n\nRegardless of the date of execution of the agreement, for the purposes of recognition in the Group's consolidated financial statements, the initial date of the agreement is considered to be the date on which the hotel is effectively occupied, and which, in general, corresponds to the opening date.\n\nThe Company considers the minimum non-cancellable term as the initial term set forth in the lease contract, without including the potential extensions if they are unlikely to be exercised. In order to determine whether an extension will be exercised with reasonable certainty, some key features have been defined and taken into account by the Group to determine whether there are economic rewards that justify such exercise: payments not adjusted to market conditions, investments to be made and the particularity of the hotel asset, among others.\n\n#### Discount rate\n\nGiven the difficulty in setting the interest rate implicit in hotel lease contracts, the Group has decided to calculate the incremental borrowing rate as applicable to each agreement. The model for the calculation of incremental rates is based on a risk-free rate, the asset's economic context risks (country) and the risk inherent in the Company, all this weighted by the temporary value of cash flows as determined in the schedule of minimum lease payments stipulated in each lease contract.\n\n#### Impairment of right-of-use assets\n\nIn general, right-of-use assets do not generate separate cash inflows, therefore, their impairment assessment must be made as part of a cash-generating unit and, consequently, the Group adjusts the calculation of the recoverable amount of such cash-generating unit as described in this Note. In this respect, the Group excludes from the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit the lease liabilities and also excludes from the calculation of the value in use the payments linked to such liabilities. By contrast, the Group includes in the calculation of the value in use the variable payments since they are not included in the lease liability, as well as the lease renewal payments when the term thereof is shorter than the cash flow projection period of the cash-generating unit.\n\nIn assessing value in use, the Group projects future cash flows by considering the budget approved by the governing bodies of the Company for 2024, net of tax, and applying growth assumptions that are consistent with the market in which the asset operates and its historical performance for the remaining period, until a period equal to the lease term is completed. The discount rates used in determining the recoverable amount are also adjusted in a way consistent with the underlying cash flows and the corresponding cashgenerating unit, affecting such cash flows with the specific risks of the assets which have not been adjusted in estimated future cash flows, mainly business risks and those of the countries in which the assets are located, as well as significant climate risks that may affect them.\n\n{246}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 3.13. Corporate Income Tax\n\nThe corporate income tax expense for the year is calculated as the sum of the current tax in each of the subsidiary companies included in these consolidated annual accounts, excepting the existing 3 consolidated tax groups, which parent companies are: Meliá Hotels International, S.A., Sol Meliá France S.A.S. and Inversiones Explotaciones Turísticas, S.A. that are treated as one unit each.\n\nThis calculation arises from the application of the corresponding tax rate to the tax base for the year, after applying the existing tax credits and deductions, plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded. This amount is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, unless the tax relates to items recognised directly in consolidated equity, in which case the corresponding tax expense is also recognised in consolidated equity.\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are the estimated amounts payable to or receivable. The tax rates used are those in force at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date.\n\nItems for which the tax determination is uncertain but for which it is probable that future cash outflows to a tax authority will occur, are recognised in provisions. These provisions are measured at the best estimate of the amount that is expected to be paid in relation thereto. The assessment is based on the opinion of tax professionals within the Company with prior experience on this matter and, in certain cases, with the advice of independent experts.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated for all the temporary differences existing at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date as the difference between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities and their tax bases.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset the current tax assets with current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and on the same taxable entity, or different taxable entities which intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, unless the temporary difference arises from goodwill for which depreciation is not deductible for tax purposes, or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction, except in the case of a business combination, which affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.\n\nLikewise, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except when the following conditions are jointly met: the parent company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference; and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered by the generation of sufficient taxable profits against which the deferred tax asset and carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be used, excluding the deductible temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, except in the case of a business combination, which affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.\n\nLikewise, deferred tax assets for all deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, are only recognised when the following conditions are jointly met: it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be used.\n\nAt each Consolidated Balance Sheet date the recovery of the deferred tax assets is reviewed and adjusted to the amount which is expected to be recovered based on the taxable profit available, calculated according to prudence criteria and excluding the potential profits deriving from the disposal of properties, given the uncertainty concerning their realisation dates, which depend on market conditions, and the different tax consequences depending on the nature of the transactions carried out.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on their expected materialisation and on the tax legislation and tax rates approved, or substantively approved on the Consolidated Balance Sheet date.\n\n#### 3.14. Transactions in Foreign Currency\n\nDebit and credit balances in foreign currency are measured at the exchange rate in force on the transaction date and at the end of the year are translated at the exchange rate then in force.\n\nExchange differences are treated as income or expenses in the year in which they occur, except for those arising from financing transactions granted to subsidiaries abroad which have been considered as an increase in the value of the net investment in such businesses since the settlement of such transactions is not foreseen or likely to occur, as provided for in IAS 21 \"The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.\"\n\n{247}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 3.15.

At the end of 2023 and 2022, the Venezuelan economy was classified as hyperinflationary, since it meets the<br>characteristics of the economic environment laid down in IAS 29 \"Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies\".                                                                                                                                               |            |            |\n| Consequently, the Balance Sheets of the Venezuelan companies in the scope of consolidation have been restated based on a current cost<br>approach that reflects the effects of changes in the price indices on their non-monetary assets and liabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |            |            |\n| Likewise, the increase or decrease in purchasing power resulting from the application of the change in the price index to the net<br>monetary position is taken to the Income Statement of these companies. The restatement effect on the current monetary unit of the<br>remaining items of the profit and loss account of Venezuelan companies is also included in the Income Statement.                                                                                                                                              |            |            |\n| For the purposes of enhancing the true image of the consolidated financial statements and given the obvious economic link between the<br>recognised impacts due to hyperinflation and the devaluation which are recorded in the country in recent years, the Group presents the<br>two effects in the consolidated equity, by recognising both the effect of the restatement of non-monetary items and the effect of the<br>differences arising from the conversion into euros, directly under the heading Retained earnings in equity. |            |            |\n| The accumulated impacts of both magnitudes broken down separately for 2023 and 2022 are shown below:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |            |            |\n| (Thousand €)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n| Asset Revaluation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 320,985    | 328,142    |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | (500,079)  | (505,174)  |\n\nThere are no other companies within the scope of consolidation which are considered as hyperinflationary economies at the end of 2023 and 2022.\n\n### Note 4. Financial Risk Management Policy\n\nThe General Policy for Risk Control, Analysis and Management of Meliá Group establishes the core principles and guidelines that govern the activities for control and management of risks, both financial and non-financial, faced by the Group. This policy establishes a reduced tolerance for financial risks; therefore, mitigation of risks is a priority in the management of this type of risks in order to minimise the potential adverse effects of these risks on the consolidated annual accounts. The actions planned in such management are reviewed and updated periodically.\n\nThe Group's activities are mainly exposed to several risks: market risk (interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk), liquidity risk, credit risk, environmental risks and geopolitical risks. The Meliá Hotels International Group, through the management it conducts, tries to minimise the potential adverse effects of these risks on the consolidated annual accounts.\n\nAdditional information on these risks is provided below:\n\n### 4.1.

Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nThe Group operates internationally and, therefore, is exposed to exchange rate risks on transactions in foreign currencies.\n\nForeign exchange risk arises from commercial, financial and investment transactions, as well as from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries which are denominated in a functional currency other than the presentation currency of the Group.\n\nDespite not having financial instruments contracted (swaps, foreign exchange insurance), in order to mitigate these potential risks, the Group develops policies aimed at maintaining a balance between cash collections and payments of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nThe table below includes a sensitivity analysis carried out based on the appreciation and depreciation against the euro of the main currencies in which the Company operates, mainly the US dollar, on pre-tax profit or loss and on equity of relevant subsidiaries (showing with a plus sign a greater expense and a decrease in the consolidated equity) assuming that all other factors remain the same:\n\n{249}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |        | 2023     |        | 2022     |  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|--------|----------|--|\n| (Thousand €)                                                                                                                                                                                                                | +10%   | -10%     | +10%   | -10%     |  |\n| Profit & Loss                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 5,246  | (5,246)  | 9,278  | (9,278)  |  |\n| Equity                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 62,866 | (62,866) | 57,658 | (57,658) |  |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |        |          |        |          |  |\n| 76% of the Group's financial debt is mainly denominated in Euros (74% in 2022), with 24% of the debt being denominated in other<br>currencies (26% in 2022), thus adjusting to the cash generation in different currencies. |        |          |        |          |  |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |        |          |        |          |  |\n\n### 4.3.

Price Risk\n\nPrice risk of the Group's inventories mainly arises from the fluctuations in the price and the availability of food and beverages that the Group sells to its customers. However, the Directors consider that changes in prices are insignificant and are transferred to the selling price of food and beverages, therefore, the Group does not conduct price hedging transactions.\n\n{250}------------------------------------------------\n\nLikewise, the Group is exposed to equity price risks of financial investments in equity instruments. Investments in equity instruments in unlisted companies are broken down in Note 13 and are held for strategic purposes and not for the purposes of trading with them, and they are mainly focused on entities owning hotel assets. Given the reduced percentage of equity interest in these companies, in case of variations not exceeding 10% of the fair value of the assets of the entities in which the Group holds equity instruments without exercising significant influence, these would not significantly affect the carrying amount of these investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nOn the other hand, the Group has no relevant investments in equity instruments of listed companies.\n\n### 4.5. Credit Risk\n\nThe credit risk arising from the default of a counterparty (customer, supplier, or financial entity) is mitigated by the Group's policies regarding the diversification of customer portfolios, source markets, oversight of concentration and on-going in-depth debt control. In addition, in some cases the Group carries out other financial operations which allow the reduction of credit risks, such as assignments of receivables.\n\nThe Group's receivable periods range between 21 and 90 days; the average period of collection of receivables in 2023 was 34.49 days; 35.62 days in 2022. The age of trade receivables at the year-end is included in Note 14.2.\n\n#### 4.6. Environmental Risks\n\nThe fight against climate change and the environment and biodiversity protection are one of the priority strategic lines of the commitment of the Group to sustainability and the protection of tourist destinations. For this reason, the Group continues to promote an efficient and responsible hotel management model, both in the consumption of resources and the minimisation of the impact of its activity.\n\nThe Group's commitment, therefore, takes on a special significance given the nature of the activity developed and the importance of tourism in the global economy, as well as its high level of dependence on social and environmental factors, such as climate and natural resources.\n\nLikewise, technology and sustainability are key to advance towards the decarbonisation of the Group's business model and achieve the public commitments acquired for reduction of the carbon footprint.\n\nProgress made in the incorporation of sustainability in the entire value chain has allowed to enrich and improve the hotel renovation and building processes, designing a differential value proposal which promotes a new hotel experience that is more attractive, more responsible and more sustainable for customers, hotel owners and the various existing partners.\n\nIn addition, in terms of management of water resources, the Group uses the tool Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, which allows to identify areas with higher risk of hydric stress globally, monitor our portfolio located in such areas and adopt the necessary preventive measures. Additionally, for the third consecutive year, the Group has voluntarily participated in the CDP Water Security, an internationally renowned ranking which measures water security and quality.\n\nLikewise, and in line with the acquired commitments in terms of the environment and working towards the achievement of the goals set, the Group continues to promote improvement measures focused on prioritising renewable energy acquisition, promoting investments aimed at reducing emissions, and permanently monitoring energy and water consumptions in order to identify deviations, improvements and corrective actions.\n\n#### 4.7. Geopolitical Risks\n\nThe Group is not indifferent to geopolitical and macroeconomic tensions. Recent conflicts around the world have not negatively affected hotel reservations as there has been no direct exposure to the countries involved.\n\nHowever, a possible extension of hostilities to other countries could threaten the global supply chain, leading to a spike in inflation and a possible extension of high interest rate monetary policies, which could affect demand.\n\nNotes 4.1 and 4.4 detail the exposure of the Group to interest rate risks and price risks, including the existing specific or natural hedging.\n\n#### 4.8. Capital Management Policy\n\nThe main objectives of the Group's capital management are to guarantee financial stability in the short and long term, to ensure the necessary liquidity for daily operations and investments, positive evolution of the Meliá Hotels International S.A.'s share value and an appropriate remuneration to shareholders through the distribution of dividends.\n\nThe financial position is also backed by the strong support of the banks and the Company's asset base. At present, 19.1% (21.3% at the 2022 year end) of the total debt relates to mortgage loans secured by the Group's assets.\n\n{251}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 4.9 Estimate of Fair Value\n\n| 4.9 Estimate of Fair Value                                                                                                                                                                                                          |         |         |                       |         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-----------------------|---------|\n| Fair value means the amount that may be received on the sale of an asset, or paid for the transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction<br>between market participants at the measurement date.                                |         |         |                       |         |\n| Regarding assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the following hierarchy levels have been<br>established in accordance with the variables used in the different measurement techniques: |         |         |                       |         |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         |         |                       |         |\n| Level 1: Based on prices quoted in active markets<br>Level 2: Based on other observable variables in the market, directly or indirectly<br>Level 3: Based on unobservable market variables                                          |         |         |                       |         |\n| The amounts recognised at fair value as at 31 December 2023 according to the hierarchy levels are broken down below:                                                                                                                |         |         |                       |         |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         |         |                       |         |\n| (Thousand €)                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Level 1 | Level 2 | 31/12/2023<br>Level 3 | Total   |\n| Investment property                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |         |         | 117,898               | 117,898 |\n| Financial Assets at fair value:                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         |         |                       |         |\n| Hedging derivatives                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |         | 2,835   |                       | 2,835   |\n| Trading portfolio derivatives                                                                                                                                                                                                       |         | 929     | 20,399                | 21,328  |\n| Trading portfolio                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 229     |         |                       | 229     |\n| Unlisted equity instruments                                                                                                                                                                                                         |         |         | 20,954                | 20,954  |\n\nFinancial instruments included in Level 2 are measured by financial institutions and independent experts using measurement techniques, mainly, discounted cash flows, based on observable market data. They mainly relate to interest rate swap financial derivatives.\n\nInvestment property included in Level 3 is measured through discounted cash flow techniques supported by studies from independent experts and their internal updates. As mentioned in Note 11, this heading includes investments made by the Group to obtain rental income or capital gains, such as interest in three apartment owners' associations in Spain, one shopping centre in America and other land and properties in Spain.\n\nFor the purposes of estimating future cash flows, expected growth rates are considered, both in lease prices and hotel operations, as appropriate, as well as other variables not directly observable.\n\nLikewise, level 3 includes financial assets related to the purchase option of a hotel asset which value is determined by reference to its fair value estimated through an appraisal carried out by an independent expert based on the variables as described above (Note 13.3).\n\nUnlisted equity instruments are detailed in Note 13.1.\n\n{252}------------------------------------------------\n\n| For comparison purposes, the balances recorded in the different hierarchies at the end of 2022 are included below: |         |         |            |         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|------------|---------|\n|                                                                                                                    |         |         | 31/12/2022 |         |\n| (Thousand €)                                                                                                       | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3    | Total   |\n| Investment property                                                                                                |         |         | 114,893    | 114,893 |\n| Financial Assets at fair value:                                                                                    |         |         |            |         |\n| Hedging derivatives                                                                                                |         | 6,705   |            | 6,705   |\n| Trading portfolio derivatives                                                                                      |         | 1,808   | 13,668     | 15,475  |\n| Trading portfolio                                                                                                  | 1,594   |         |            | 1,594   |\n| Unlisted equity instruments                                                                                        |         |         | 19,517     | 19,517  |\n| TOTAL ASSETS                                                                                                       | 1,594   | 8,513   | 148,077    | 158,184 |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value:                                                                               |         |         |            |         |\n| Trading portfolio derivatives                                                                                      |         | 25      |            | 25      |\n\n## Note 5. Scope of Consolidation\n\nThe companies that comprise the Group present individual annual accounts, according to the regulations applicable in the country in which they operate.\n\nDetails of the companies included in the scope of consolidation as at 31 December 2023 are included in Annex 1 and Annex 2, which are classified as subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.\n\nMeliá Brasil Administraçao, which corporate purpose is the hotel management, operates various hotels under management. As the hotels under management are properties in joint ownership and are not legally authorised to carry out operating activities, Meliá Brasil Administraçao has assumed the operation of such hotels on behalf of the joint owners, given the requirements of local regulations. Income and expenses arising from the operation of these establishments are not included in the Consolidated Income Statement, since the risks and revenues arising therefrom are returned to the joint owners. Only income arising from the management of these establishments is included in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nThe Tunisian company, Tryp Mediterranee, in which Meliá Hotels International, S.A. holds an 85.4% stake, is in dissolution process and therefore, is excluded from the Group's scope of consolidation since, currently, the Group has no control or significant influence over this company during such process.\n\nThe Group holds a 19.94% stake in the Venezuelan companies El Recreo Plaza C.A. and El Recreo Plaza & Cia. C.A. through the direct stake of 20% held by its subsidiary holding company MIA Exhold, S.A. and, therefore, the equity method is applied since the Group has significant influence.\n\nThe companies Ayosa Hoteles S.L., S'Argamassa Hotelera, S.L. and Meliá Hotels Orlando, LLC are fully consolidated, although only 50% or less of the voting rights are held. This is because the Group considers that it has the capability to control the variable yields of such companies through the hotel management contracts that the Group has entered into with them.\n\n### 5.1. Business Combinations\n\nIn 2023 and 2022, no business combinations have taken place.\n\n### 5.2. Other Scope Changes\n\nIn 2023, the following changes have been made to the scope of consolidation:\n\n### Additions\n\nOn 31 May 2023, the companies Fuerteventura Beach Property, S.L., Santa Eulalia Beach Property, S.L. and Hoteles Marmel, S.L. (formerly Starmel Hotels OP2, S.L., see Note 5.3), in which Meliá Hotels International, S.A. holds a 20% stake, were included in the consolidated group of the Meliá using the equity method, with a valuation of EUR 17.5 million, an amount paid by Meliá Hotels International, S.A. This \n\n{253}------------------------------------------------\n\namount includes EUR 4.2 million of contributions from shareholders. These 3 companies own 2 hotels in Fuerteventura and 1 hotel in Ibiza, which are operated by Meliá Group under lease.\n\nOn the other hand, in the second half of the year, Detur Panamá, S.A. was fully consolidated following the purchase of an additional 50% of the hotel asset owned by this company. This hotel establishment, valued at EUR 5.3 million as at 31 December 2023, is closed since 2020.\n\nIn addition, two new companies Peturoliso, S.L.U. and Soici Nefsol, S.L.U. have been incorporated with 100% shareholding, with no significant impacts on the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n### Disposals\n\nDuring the first half of 2023, the dissolution of the company Golf Katmandú, S.L. took place, in which the Group held a 50% stake, and which was accounted for using the equity method.\n\nThe company Third Project 2012, S.L., wholly owned by the Meliá Group, was also liquidated.\n\nAt year-end, Mosaico Hoteles S.A., a company in which the Group held a 35% stake and which until now was accounted for using the equity method, merged with Homasi, S.A., a company in which the Group also held a 35% stake, and which was also accounted for using the equity method.\n\nThese disposals have not had significant impacts on the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n#### Acquisition of additional stake in companies accounted for using the equity method\n\nThe Group has increased its stake by 0.494% in the Owners' Association of Meliá Costa del Sol hotel through the purchase of three apartments. In addition, the stake in the Owners' Association of Meliá Castilla has increased by 0.417% hotel through the purchase of four apartments. These transactions have not had significant impacts on the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFor comparison purposes, changes in 2022 were as follows:\n\n#### Additions\n\nDuring the second half of 2022, 100% of the company Willet Reservations SLU was acquired, the corporate purpose of which is the provision of tourism intermediation services. This transaction did not have significant impacts on the Group's consolidated annual accounts, since it was acquired following the incorporation thereof by a third party and did not have relevant net assets on the date of the transaction.\n\nIn addition, the company Holazel, S.L. was incorporated by Melia group and a third party with a 50% stake each, being it considered a joint venture, and the corporate purpose of which is the development and growth of the hotel brand \"Zel\". This transaction did not have significant impacts on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Disposals\n\nDuring the year, the companies Infinity Vacations S.A. de C.V., Operadora Costarisol S.A and Inversiones Turísticas del Caribe, S.A., wholly owned by the Group, were liquidated. These transactions did not have significant impacts on the consolidated annual accounts.\n\nIn December, the company Markserv BV, wholly owned by Meliá Group, was liquidated, and the company Sistemas Ribey Cloud, in which the Group had a 50% stake, and which was accounted for using the equity method, was dissolved. These disposals did not have significant impacts on the Group.\n\n#### Acquisition of additional stake in companies accounted for using the equity method\n\nDuring the year, the Group increased its stake by 1.21% in the Owners' Association of Meliá Costa del Sol hotel through the purchase of several apartments. This transaction did not involve significant impacts on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nLikewise, the Group acquired an additional stake in the company Mosaico Hoteles S.A, increasing its stake by 15% and without significant impacts on the Group's consolidated annual accounts.\n\n{254}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 5.3. Name Changes\n\nIn 2023 the company Starmel Hoteles Op2, S.L. was renamed Hoteles Marmel, S.L.\n\nIn 2022, no name changes took place.\n\n## Note 6. Segment Reporting\n\nThe segments included below make up the organisational structure of the company and their results are reviewed by the key decisionmakers within the Group:\n\n- Hotel management: This relates to the fees received for operating hotels under management and franchise agreements. It also includes the intra-group charges to the Group's hotels that are under ownership or under lease, as well as other services, such as commissions.\n- Hotel business: The results obtained from the operation of hotel units owned or leased by the Group are included in this segment. Likewise, income generated by the food & beverage business is also included since this activity is considered to be fully integrated into the hotel business due to the majority sale of packages which price includes room and board, and therefore, a real segmentation of the associated assets and liabilities would be unfeasible.\n- Other business linked to hotel management: This segment includes additional income from the hotel business, such as casinos or tour-operator activities.\n- Real Estate: This segment includes the capital gains on asset rotation, and real estate development and operation. Likewise, it includes the income and expenses deriving from the change in fair value of investment property.\n- Vacation club: It includes the results deriving from the sale of rights of shared use of specific vacation complex units.\n- Corporate segments: These relate to structural costs, results linked to the intermediation and marketing of room and tourist service reservations, as well as corporate costs of the Group which cannot be assigned to any of the abovementioned three business divisions.\n\nThe segmentation of Meliá Hotels International is due to the diversification of operations existing in the Company based on hotel management, hotel operation, real estate and vacation club.\n\nCertain headings included in the business and geographical segmentation tables are presented in an aggregate manner, due to the impossibility of splitting them into the various specified segments.\n\nThe policies for the determination of transfer prices applied by the Company in transactions between Group companies are similar to those applied in transactions with third parties.\n\n{255}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 6.1.

These financial instruments are used to exchange interest rates, so that the Company receives variable interest from the bank in exchange for a fixed interest payment on the same face amount. The variable interest received from the derivative offsets interest payments on the financing hedged. The final result is a fixed interest payment on the financing hedged.\n\nIn 2023, the negative impact on equity of these derivative financial instruments, after taking the portion pertaining to the hedged item to the income statement and without considering the tax impact, amounted to EUR 3.7 million. In 2022, the impact was positive for the amount of EUR 8 million.\n\nLikewise, as at 31 December 2023, the notional value of the interest rate swaps that qualify as hedges amounted to EUR 114 million, and in 2022 such value amounted to EUR 141.5 million.\n\nHeading Trading portfolio derivatives assets in the short term includes the fair value for the amount of EUR 20.4 million (EUR 13.7 million as at 31 December 2022) of the derivative associated with the purchase option, with the date for its execution being extended by one year, on one hotel in Spain, which has increased its value according to the appraisal carried out during the year.\n\nThe other trading portfolio derivatives assets and liabilities at the end of 2023 relate to interest rate swaps contracted in the framework of the interest rate risk management performed by the Company (see Note 4.1). These interest rate swaps are not considered as accounting hedges because they do not meet the requirements for their application according to IFRS 9.\n\n{277}------------------------------------------------\n\n| As at 31 December 2023, except for the derivative associated with the purchase option, the notional value of these financial

In 2023, the estimated accrued amount was EUR 11.6 million, with an impact of EUR 1.7 million on the income statement for 2023. In 2022, the total amount accrued was EUR 11.6 million, with an impact of EUR 2.2 million on the income statement.\n\nThe assessment of these commitments undertaken by the Company has been conducted in accordance with the actuarial assumptions of the model which pertains to the Group, using the calculation method known as the Projected Unit Credit and the demographic assumptions established by the PER2020 tables, using a capitalisation rate of 3.70%, and a salary increase assumption of 3.04%.

In the said test, the activity recovery during the year and the expectation of activity recovery at the levels before the health crisis, which is included in the budget approved by the governing body of the Group for 2024 and in the projections for the years of the lease term, have led to a greater value in use of such cash-generating units and, therefore, to a reversal of impairment of the assets associated with the mentioned units.\n\nThe discount rates used in the said test have been determined for each lease contract on the basis of the weighted average cost of the capital (WACC) per country, adjusted to reflect the lower cost associated with the lease liabilities.

Tax Situation\n\nThe companies within the Group are subject to the tax legislation applicable in the countries in which they carry out their activities. Current tax regulations in some of these countries do not coincide with the Spanish regulations. As a consequence of the above, the information included in this Note should be construed in the light of the peculiarities of the applicable tax regulations for the benefit of legal entities, with reference to applicable tax bases, tax rates and deductions.\n\n#### \"Pillar 2\" Draft Legislation\n\nThe Government of Spain, where the parent company is incorporated, has published a draft legislation - pending parliamentary procedure - for the implementation in Spain of the 15% minimum taxation (EU) Directive (the \"Pillar 2 Draft Legislation\"), which provides for its application in respect of financial years beginning after 31 December 2023. Pursuant to this Pillar Two Draft Legislation, the parent company will be obliged to pay, in Spain, a supplementary tax on the profits of its subsidiaries that are taxed at an effective tax rate of less than 15%. In addition, some of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates have Pillar Two rules sufficiently implemented, which allow a domestic minimum tax to be levied on the tax shortfall up to 15%.\n\nThe Group has analysed the potential exposure to additional taxation arising from the Pillar 2 Draft Legislation, based on country-bycountry reports and financial statements of the Group companies. According to the analysis performed, the effective tax rate for Pillar Two purposes in most of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates is above 15%. However, the Group believes that the safe harbour rules may not apply in Cuba, where the effective rate could be less than 15%. Nevertheless, the Group does not expect exposure to additional taxation arising from Pillar 2 rules to be significant in any jurisdiction.\n\nThe Group continues to assess the impact of the future Supplementary Tax rule in Spain and the Pillar 2 rules in the jurisdictions in which it operates on its future financial performance.\n\n{288}------------------------------------------------\n\nUnconstitutionality and invalidity of Royal Decree-Law 3/2016, of 2 December, adopting tax measures aimed at consolidating public finances and other urgent social measures (\"RD-Law 3/2016\").\n\nThe Constitutional Court has considered RD-Law 3/2016 as unconstitutional and invalid in its ruling of 18 January 2024 (unconstitutionality issue 2577-2023).\n\nAmong others, the mentioned RD-law established greater restrictions on the offsetting of negative tax bases (BINS [according to its acronym in Spanish]) from previous years; the obligation to include a minimum annual reversal in the 2016-2020 financial years of impairment losses on holdings regardless of the evolution of the investee's equity and results; the establishment of greater limitations on the application of deductions to avoid double taxation; and a restriction on the deductibility of certain negative income deriving from the transfer of holdings.\n\nAs a result of this ruling, the Group has determined the following accounting treatment for income tax in Spain:\n\nRecognition of current tax liabilities and assets for the year 2023: The Group has determined the 2023 Income Tax in accordance with the applicable tax legislation, excluding the provisions declared as unconstitutional.\n\n### 19.1.

Status of the Main Tax Inspections and Litigation\n\nThe main inspections and litigation processes of a tax nature for the Group which could have a negative impact on the Group, take place in America; in particular, the following stand out:\n\n- Litigation in Mexico in relation to Income Tax assessments for 2012 issued against Corporación Hotelera Hispano Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. The purpose of the process is the adequacy of the documentary evidence to prove and apply certain tax losses. The figures under discussion amount to MXN 481 million (EUR 25.6 million).\n- Litigation in Mexico in relation to Income Tax assessments for 2015 issued against Operadora Mesol, S.A. de C.V. The purpose of the process is the adequacy of the documentary evidence to prove and apply certain consultancy costs. The figures under discussion amount to MXN 27 million (EUR 1.4 million).\n\nAt year end, the inspection to the tax group headed by Meliá Hotels International S.A. regarding the Corporate Income Tax from 2017 to 2019 and the Value Added Tax and withholdings and income on account for the period between November 2017 and December 2019 has been concluded.\n\nIn relation to Corporate Income Tax and as a result of valuation differences in certain transactions between Group companies, a tax assessment has been formalised with an agreement which resulted in a tax payable of EUR 2.7 million. This adjustment had no impact on the Group's income statement as the corresponding risk provision was applied.\n\nIn relation to Value Added Tax and Withholdings and Income on Account, tax assessments have been formalised without any adjustment and with no impact on the Group's income statement.\n\nIn accordance with the principles of the Group's Tax Strategy, as well as the recommendations of the Code of Good Tax Practices to which the Company adheres, the Company has proceeded to self-correct the income tax settlements for 2020 and 2021 in accordance with the assessment criteria arising from the tax audit procedure, without this self-correction having had an impact on the income statement.\n\nThe Group has adequately made provisions for any liabilities which may arise from the existing tax inspections and litigation. However, as a result, among others, of the different interpretations of the current legislation, additional liabilities may arise from an inspection. The Group assesses the uncertain tax treatments and reflects the effect of the uncertainty on the taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses or unused tax credits and the corresponding tax rates. On this account, the Group has recognised an amount of EUR 22.8 million under Other deferred tax liabilities (EUR 23.4 million in 2022).\n\n### Note 20.

On the other hand, the Group has arranged a civil liability policy (D&O) for the Group's directors and executives, under the terms and conditions that are common in insurance policies of this nature, with a premium for 2023 of EUR 298,440; EUR 297,275 in 2022. There are no share-based payments.\n\n## Note 21. Contingent Assets and Liabilities\n\nThe Group has commitments with third parties in respect of assets and liabilities not recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet given the remote probability that they give rise to an outflow of economic resources or because the commitments must not be recognised in accordance with current regulations. Such contingent assets and liabilities are detailed below by amount and item.\n\n### 21.1. Contingent Assets\n\nThe Group has claims brought against third parties for compensation for damages suffered as a result of hotel closures during the 2020 health pandemic, on which it considers there are reasonable technical grounds to obtain a favourable ruling in court. However, the Company's Directors, on the basis of prudence, do not consider that the requirements established in the applicable regulations for their recognition in the Consolidated Balance Sheet have been met for the time being.\n\n### 21.2. Guarantees and Deposits\n\nThe Group secures several operations through bank guarantees and for various items, for the amount of EUR 51.2 million as at 31 December 2023 (EUR 45.1 million in 2022).\n\nThe Group has granted collateral and bank guarantees for operations undertaken by associates and joint ventures for the amount of EUR 0.3 million (EUR 0.6 million in 2022).\n\n### 21.3. Contingent Liabilities\n\n{298}------------------------------------------------\n\nCorporación Hotelera Metor, S.A., a subsidiary which is 76% owned, is involved in a dispute with its minority shareholder, claiming that all agreements and transactions carried out with such shareholder be declared invalid. The Company has undertaken the necessary actions to ensure that the resolution of such dispute does not have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nTo the Directors of Meliá Hotels International, S.A.:\n\nAs requested by the Board of Directors of Meliá Hotels International, S.A. and Subsidiaries (\"the Meliá\nHotels International Group\") and in accordance with our proposal-letter of December 1, 2023, we have\napplied certain procedures to the information relating to the ICFR system included in section F of the\nAnnual Corporate Governance Report (\"ACGR\") of the Meliá Hotels International Group for 2023, which\nsummarises the internal control procedures of the Entity in relation to its annual financial reporting.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for adopting the appropriate measures in order to reasonably guarantee\nthe implementation, maintenance and supervision of an adequate internal control system and for\nmaking improvements to that system and for preparing and establishing the content of the information\nrelating to the ICFR system.\n\nIt should be noted in this regard, irrespective of the quality of the design and operating effectiveness of\nthe internal control system adopted by the Meliá Hotels International Group in relation to its annual\nfinancial reporting, that the system can only permit reasonable, but not absolute, assurance in\nconnection with the objectives pursued, due to the limitations inherent to any internal control system.\n\nIn the course of our audit work on the financial statements and pursuant to Technical Auditing Standards,\nthe sole purpose of our assessment of the internal control of the Meliá Hotels International Group was\nto enable us to establish the scope, nature and timing of the audit procedures to be applied to the Meliá\nHotels International Group's financial statements. Therefore, our assessment of internal control\nperformed for the purposes of the aforementioned audit of financial statements was not sufficiently\nextensive to enable us to express a specific opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control over the\nregulated annual financial reporting.\n\nFor the purpose of issuing this report, we applied exclusively the specific procedures described below\nand indicated in the Guidelines on the Auditors' Report on the Information relating to the System of\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting of Listed Companies, published by the Spanish National\nSecurities Market Commission (CNMV) on its website, which establishes the work to be performed, the\nminimum scope thereof and the content of this report.

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nTo the Shareholders of Meliá Hotels International, S.A.,\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of Meliá Hotels International, S.A. (\"the Parent\") and its\nsubsidiaries (\"the Group\"), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2023, and the\nconsolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement\nof changes in equity, consolidated statement of cash flows and notes to the consolidated financial statements for the\nyear then ended.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nconsolidated equity and consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023, and its consolidated\nresults and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting\nStandards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRSs) and the other provisions of the regulatory financial reporting\nframework applicable to the Group in Spain.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the audit regulations in force in Spain. Our responsibilities under those\nregulations are further described in the *Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial*\nStatements section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements, including those pertaining to\nindependence, that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in Spain pursuant to the audit\nregulations in force. In this regard, we have not provided any services other than those relating to the audit of financial\nstatements and there have not been any situations or circumstances that, in accordance with the aforementioned\naudit regulations, might have affected the requisite independence in such a way as to compromise our independence.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the\nconsolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of\nthe consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a\nseparate opinion on these matters.\n\n{2}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs described in Note 1 to the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements, the Group engages\nin the management and operation of 350 hotels\n(owned, leased, managed and franchised) in 38\ncountries, and had assets associated with the hotel\nactivity with an aggregate carrying amount of EUR 3,178\nmillion at 31 December 2023, with this amount\nincluding goodwill, property, plant and equipment,\nintangible assets, right-of-use assets and investment\nproperty.\n\nAt least at each year-end management performs an\nimpairment test in order to determine the recoverable\namount of these assets.\n\nFor each cash-generating unit (\"CGU\"), the Group's\nManagement has calculated the value in use of each of\nthem based on the estimate of future cash flow\ngeneration, taking into account economic and\ngeopolitical aspects, and applying specific growth and\ndiscount rates for the CGUs in each country where the\nGroup operates, also adjusting discount rates to be\nconsistent with the underlying cash flows.\n\nAs a result of the test carried out, an expense has been\nrecognised under the headings \"Depreciation and\nimpairment Property, Plant and Equipment and Other\nintangible assets\", \"Depreciation and impairment Right\nof use\" and \"Results from assets sale\" of the\naccompanying consolidated profit and loss account for\nthe year 2023, for a total amount of €5.5 million.\n\nIn this context, the circumstance described represents\na key audit matter, given the significance of the carrying\namount of the assets associated with the hotel activity\nin the consolidated balance sheet, and given that the\nvaluation methods used require the use of significant\nestimates involving a significant degree of uncertainty,\nsuch as certain operating assumptions, such as\noccupancy rate and revenue per room, and financial\nassumptions such as the discount rate, the long-term\ngrowth rate and, in the case of owned assets, the exit\nyield.\n\nOur audit procedures included, among others,\nevaluating the accounting policies for determining the\nrecoverable amount of the assets associated with the\nhotel activity described in Notes 2 and 3 to the\naccompanying consolidated financial statements for\n2023, in order to evaluate their consistency with the\napplicable regulatory financial reporting framework.\n\nAlso, in order to identify possible bias in management's\nassumptions, we retrospectively reviewed the\nestimates made in the previous year, evaluating the\ndegree to which they were realised, as well as those\nmade in prior years, checking them against historical\ninformation.\n\nOn the other hand, we have obtained the impairment\ntests of the Group's hotel assets carried out by the\nManagement of the Parent Company, verifying their\narithmetic correctness and the adequacy of the\nvaluation methodology used in each case, with the\ninvolvement of our internal valuation specialists. In\naddition, we have obtained the latest budgets approved\nby the directors of the Parent Company adapted to the\ncurrent circumstances of the markets in which the\nGroup operates, and evaluated the reasonableness of\nits main operating assumptions against macroeconomic\nand sector forecasts, taking into account economic,\ngeopolitical and climatic aspects, as well as long-term\nprojections compared to historical hotel data prior to\nthe pandemic. We have also analysed the\nreasonableness of the long-term discount rates and\ngrowth rates and, for owned assets, the exit yields\napplied, with the assistance of our valuation specialists,\nand reviewed the sensitivity analyses carried out by\nmanagement with respect to these assumptions.\n\nLastly, we evaluated whether the disclosures made by\nthe Group in relation to these matters, which are\nincluded in Notes 7.1, 7.5, 10, 11, and 17 to the\naccompanying consolidated financial statements,\ncontained the information required by the applicable\naccounting regulations.\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Group sells timeshare rights for specific holiday\ncomplex units. The revenue recognised in the\naccompanying consolidated statement of profit or loss\nfor 2023 arising from this vacation club activity\namounted to EUR 69 million, and the amounts\ncontracted, net of related expenses but not yet\nrecognised in profit or loss, which are recognised under\n\"Capital grants and other deferred income\" in the\naccompanying consolidated balance sheet as at 31\nDecember 2023, total EUR 264 million.\n\nThe recognition of revenue from the exercise of the\nrights of use by the customers, as well as for\ncancellations of the package of rights contracted,\nalthough not complex, involves a specific casuistry\nassociated with the different conditions signed with the\ncustomers and contains a manual registration\ncomponent. In addition, the Group recognises club\nrevenue from unexercised customer rights in\nproportion to the customer's usage pattern, and\nprovided that the likelihood of the customer exercising\nits remaining rights becomes remote, requiring the use\nof relevant estimates and judgments by management.\n\nAccordingly, this matter was a key audit matter in our\naudit.\n\nOur audit procedures included, among others, the\nreview of the accounting policies for the recognition of\nrevenue from the Group's vacation club, which are\ndescribed in Note 3.11 to the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements for 2023, in order to\nevaluate whether they were in conformity with the\napplicable regulatory financial reporting framework, as\nwell as checking the design and implementation and the\noperating effectiveness of the relevant controls\nidentified in the process of recognising revenue from\nthe vacation club.\n\nWe have also carried out substantive procedures\nconsisting of verifying, for a randomly selected sample\nof sharing rights exercised during the year, as well as\ncancellations, the consistency of the accounting record\nwith the associated contractual documentation and its\nadequacy to the terms and obligations of the program\ncontracted by the club's client. In addition, we have\nobtained the calculation made by the Management of\nthe income recognized by unexercised customer rights,\nevaluating its arithmetic correctness, as well as the\nmost relevant hypotheses, particularly the percentage\nof unused rights, based on historical information.\n\nLastly, we evaluated the reasonableness of the\ndisclosures contained in Notes 7.1 and 16.1 to the\naccompanying consolidated financial statements on the\nrevenue from the Group's vacation club.\n\nThe other information comprises only the consolidated directors' report for 2023, the preparation of which is the\nresponsibility of the Parent's directors and which does not form part of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the consolidated directors' report. Our\nresponsibility relating to the consolidated directors' report, in accordance with the audit regulations in force, consists\nof:\n\n) Solely checking that the consolidated non-financial information statement, certain information included in the\nannual corporate governance report and the annual directors' remuneration report, to which the Spanish Audit Law\nrefers, have been furnished as provided for in the applicable legislation and, if this is not the case, reporting this fact.\n\nb) Evaluating and reporting on whether the other information included in the consolidated directors' report is\nconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, based on the knowledge of the Group obtained in the audit of\nthose consolidated financial statements, as well as evaluating and reporting on whether the content and presentation\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\nf this section of the consolidated directors' report are in conformity with the applicable regulations. If, based on the\nwork we have performed, we conclude that there are material misstatements, we are required to report that fact.\n\nBased on the work performed, as described above, we observed that the information described in section a) above\nhad been furnished as provided for in the applicable legislation and that the other information in the consolidated\ndirectors’ report was consistent with that contained in the consolidated financial statements for 2023 and its content\nand presentation were in conformity with the applicable regulations.\n\nThe Parent's directors are responsible for preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements so that they\npresent fairly the Group's consolidated equity, consolidated financial position and consolidated results in accordance\nwith EU-IFRSs and the other provisions of the regulatory financial reporting framework applicable to the Group in\nSpain, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated\nfinancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Parent's directors are responsible for assessing the Group's\nability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going\nconcern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have\nno realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Parent's audit and compliance committee is responsible for overseeing the process involved in the preparation\nand presentation of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole\nare free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our\nopinion.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with\nthe audit regulations in force in Spain will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can\narise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be\nexpected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements is included in the\nAppendix to this auditor's report. This description, which is on the following pages, forms part of our auditor's report.\n\nWe have examined the digital files in European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) of Meliá Hotels International, S.A. and\nits subsidiaries for 2023, which comprise the XHTML file including the consolidated financial statements for 2023 and\nthe XBRL files with the tagging performed by the Group, which will form part of the annual financial report.\n\nThe directors of Meliá Hotels International, S.A. are responsible for presenting the annual financial report for 2023 in\naccordance with the format and markup requirements established in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU)\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\n2019/815 of 17 December 2018 (\"ESEF Regulation\"). In this regard, the annual corporate governance report and the\nannual directors' remuneration report were included by reference in the consolidated directors' report.\n\nOur responsibility is to examine the digital files prepared by the Parent's directors, in accordance with the audit\nregulations in force in Spain. Those regulations require that we plan and perform our audit procedures in order to\nascertain whether the content of the consolidated financial statements included in the aforementioned digital files\ncorresponds in full to that of the consolidated financial statements that we have audited, and whether those\nconsolidated financial statements and the aforementioned files were formatted and marked up, in all material\nrespects, in accordance with the requirements established in the ESEF Regulation.\n\nIn our opinion, the digital files examined correspond in full to the audited consolidated financial statements, and these\nare presented and have been marked up, in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements established in\nthe ESEF Regulation.\n\nThe opinion expressed in this report is consistent with the content of our additional report to the Parent's audit and\ncompliance committee dated 27 February 2024.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting held on 22 June 2023 appointed us as the Group's auditors for a period of one year from\nthe year ended 31 December 2022, i.e., for 2023.\n\nPreviously, we were designated pursuant to a resolution of the General Meeting for a period of 1 year and have been\nauditing the financial statements uninterruptedly since the year ended 31 December 2019.\n\nDELOITTE, S.L.\nRegistered in ROAC under no.

We also:\n\n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n\nWe communicate with the Parent's audit and compliance committee regarding, among other matters, the planned\nscope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control\nthat we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Parent's audit and compliance committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant\nethical requirements, including those regarding independence, and we have communicated with it to report on all\nmatters that may reasonably be thought to jeopardise our independence, and where applicable, on the related\nsafeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Parent's audit and compliance committee, we determine those matters\nthat were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are\ntherefore the key audit matters.\n\nWe describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the\nmatter.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/7/Picture/0 description: The image is a cover page for a \"2023 Management Report\" for Meliá Hotels International.

As you know, global tourism demand has resurged and continues to show \"extraordinary resilience\" in the words of the Secretary-General of the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), which, like the sector's other institutions and experts, has just once again revised upwards its forecasts for the closing of this year. This is despite the complex context that has conditioned the exit from the crisis, marked by geopolitical insecurity, the inflation crisis, the climate emergency and the shortage of talent in the industry.\n\nIn the case of Meliá Hotels International, 2023 will be remembered as the year in which we consolidated the recovery curve that began in 2022, capitalising on the positive situation to grow and get stronger by following our strategic roadmap, while also mitigating the worst impacts of inflation and the polycrisis. We are continuing to keep more alive than ever the commitments made in our *Roadto2024*, with the ambition of being \"more profitable, better managers, more sustainable and more efficient\", commitments on which we have been underpinning our progress and building our achievements.\n\n### **Growth and transformation**\n\nThe tailwinds of international tourism demand have undoubtedly helped our Company meet targets such as exceeding 2019's revenues by 7.8%, and achieving EBITDA excluding capital gains of 486.5 million, above the commitment made at our last Annual General Shareholders Meeting. But along with the current situation, our strategy has also been fundamental for consolidating our portfolio's growth and promoting greater efficiency in our management. This has contributed to maintaining our margins despite the inflationary context, while giving us a leading competitive factor for expansion through less capital-intensive formulas, including management and franchising, under which we have already incorporated more than 65 hotels in the last 6 years.\n\nOur Roadmap has helped us to continue progressing in areas such as technology, and we now have a top-rate suite of solutions to manage our hotels and third-party hotels more efficiently, while we keep on evolving our distribution platform's digital assets. While last year we updated our B2C melia. com website, this year the investment has been focused on the B2B Meliá PRO platform, laying the foundations for significant growth in demand from this very important segment which, following a strong recovery after the pandemic, now accounts for 5.3% of our global turnover.\n\nTechnology with a global approach that follows the customer throughout their 'journey' by means of a more efficient and digital relationship model, wherever the customer needs it and during their stay, putting at their fingertips our hotels' entire offer in a user-friendly way, to make their stay a true experience.\n\nIn the area of innovation, we have continued committing to knowledge and personalisation of the offer to our customers with the aid of our loyalty programme, *MeliáRewards*. Turning 30 in 2024, this programme welcomes new members every day and, like the other parts of the Company, is essential on the path of growth and expansion.\n\nOn the subject of expansion, together with our management and distribution capacity as competitive levers, Meliá's growth is strongly linked to our\n\n2\n\nImage /page/8/Picture/13 description: A man with dark hair and a beard is shown from the chest up.

Significant advances include the consolidation of our unique luxury hotel brand Meliá Collection, which already has 8 hotels in operation and 8 to be opened in the future, the debut of the ZEL brand, created in collaboration with Rafael Nadal, with an increasing pipeline of openings for the coming years, and the launch in Europe of the Paradisus by Meliá \"Destination Inclusive\" resorts brand, specifically in the Canary Islands with Paradisus Salinas Lanzarote and Paradisus Gran Canaria. 2024 will be a pivotal year for the ME brand, with the planned openings of ME Malta, ME Sayulita, ME Guadalajara in Mexico and ME Lisbon (Portugal).\n\nIn 2023, our Company signed a total of 26 new hotels and 12 new openings, some as major as the Gran Meliá Palazzo Cordusio (Milan), the ZEL Mallorca hotel, our first Gran Meliá in Southeast Asia, Gran Meliá Nha Trang (Vietnam) or the Innside Bangkok in the capital of Thailand. I would also highlight our return to growth in countries like Mexico and our consolidation in holiday destinations with significant potential for growth, such as Albania and Malta.\n\nOur portfolio's current evolution already reflects the positive tendency created by our luxury strategy, a segment which accounts for 13% of the portfolio and to which one in three of the group's new openings belong. As the segment with the highest demand and the most resilient to cycles and crises, the growing focus on luxury hotels and rooms has given us a clear competitive strength over the years. It is also helping to consolidate an increasingly qualitative RevPAR, prioritising quality over quantity and at the same time minimising risks and negative impacts on resources and communities in the destinations where we operate.\n\n### **A responsible business**\n\nOur sustainability strategy, or responsible business, as we designed it in *Roadto2024*, encompasses the three dimensions of the ESG acronym (environmental, social and governance), and I am pleased to report that *S&P Global ESG* has recognised us in its *Sustainability Yearbook 2024* as Europe's most sustainable company in the *Hotels, Resorts & Cruises Lines* sector. However, this milestone should not cause us to overlook the countless challenges posed by the climate situation and social demands, both nationally and internationally, all under a regulatory environment of governance and regulation promoted by the European Economic Community with the ambition of making progress in the face of the challenges set out in the *New Green Deal.*\n\nThe 2023 Climate Change Conference (COP28) held in Dubai concluded with a hopeful agreement to boost the energy transition, with an express call to abandon fossil fuels, with the mission of achieving net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nUnder these premises, Meliá continues to work on reducing its carbon footprint and promoting the use of renewable energies, as well as ensuring an efficient environmental management system that contributes to meeting the targets set to reduce our emissions by 71.4% by 2035 (vs 2018).\n\nDuring the year, we resumed environmental certifications with the aim of completing this process in 2024 for our entire portfolio of owned, leased and managed properties. On the other hand, given the situation of water stress that many hotels are experiencing, mainly in Spain and other countries in the Mediterranean basin, last year we launched the Magnum project, an initiative in partnership with two other business entities to measure the water footprint, applying *Building Information Modelling (BIM)* technology and the creation of a platform that integrates current and future data in a structured way. This project is scheduled for completion during 2025 and will give the Company a level of detail on the hotel's water performance and conclusions to be incorporated into new hotel constructions.\n\nRegarding the social dimension, Meliá is meeting its target of recovering its pre-pandemic workforce levels and achieving *TOP Employer* recognition in eight countries (Spain, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Italy, France, United Kingdom and Germany), which together represent no less than 96% of the Company's total workforce. Together, this certification, the new vision of its *Very Inspiring People* employer brand, presented this year, and the extraordinary results of the Culture and Engagement Study, with an average rating of engagement and sense of belonging of over 87%, ratify Meliá's internal and external reputation as an employer and support our competitiveness in an environment of increasing shortage of and competition for talent.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nThirdly, in terms of governance, Meliá continues to get stronger with a more independent (54.54%) and more diverse Board, maintaining its 36.36% percentage of women. In 2023, the most significant milestone was undoubtedly the culmination of the succession process for the Executive Chairmanship, planned since 2016 following the resignation of our founder and current Honorary Chairman.\n\n### **Strength and trust**\n\nGlobal tourism demand's shining moment, which according to estimates and booking indicators will continue in 2024, should not obscure the significant challenges that our industry continues to face. After providing an example of resilience and commitment in the face of disruption, the current transition period requires us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet to restore the healthy debt levels and value generation prior to the pandemic, and to capitalise on our strengths and leadership as our industry continues to grow in the coming years.\n\nTo achieve this, along with cash generation, the growth and improvement of our portfolio and efficiency improvements, we are continuing to promote other levers such as the turnover of certain non-strategic assets and the consolidation of corporate alliances with leading entities in the market, such as the agreement signed with Banca March for three hotels located in Ibiza and Fuerteventura, and the two operations linked to the *Abu Dhabi Investment Authority* (ADIA).\n\nI would like to conclude by reiterating that without trust there is no growth, no investment and no future. For this reason, Meliá Hotels International would like to thank you for the privilege of having kept the trust of our shareholders, partners and collaborators during such difficult times.

On 1 June 2011, the Annual General Shareholders Meeting approved the change of name to Meliá Hotels International, S.A. The Company moved its registered office to 24 Calle Gremio Toneleros, Palma de Mallorca in 1998.\n\nMeliá Hotels International, S.A. and its subsidiaries and associates (hereinafter, the \"Group\" or the \"Company\") form an integrated group of companies engaged mainly in tourism activities in general and, more specifically, in the management and operation of owned, leased, managed or franchised hotels, as well as vacation club operations. The Group is also engaged in the promotion of all kinds of businesses related to the tourism industry and the hotel sector and to leisure, entertainment and recreational activities, as well as participating in the creation, development and operation of new businesses, establishments and entities in the tourism industry and hotel sector and any leisure, entertainment and recreational activities.\n\nWith more than 65 years of history behind it, Meliá Hotels International has consolidated its international presence with 350 hotels in 38 countries, mainly in Spain, Latin America, the rest of Europe and Asia.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/14/Picture/1 description: The image shows a house icon next to the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\".\n\n**ABOUT THIS REPORT**\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n### **Scope of the report**\n\nThe period covered by the report corresponds to the financial year beginning on 1 January 2023 and ending on 31 December 2023.\n\nThe information reported is aligned with the consolidation perimeter used in the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements (full consolidation method). Consequently, this report includes information on all entities over which the Group exercises effective control, which is generally accompanied by a shareholding of more than half of the voting rights.\n\nDetails of the companies included in the consolidation perimeter as at 31 December 2023 are provided in Annex 1 and Annex 2 of the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements, classified into subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe changes in the presentation of the current report are due, on the one hand, to the recent publication of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, or CSRD, which governs the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, or ESRS, to be transposed during 2024 and, therefore, applicable for next year's reporting. On the other hand, said changes are also due to our ambition to be a benchmark in the transformation towards a new tourism model in which sustainability takes precedence as a strategic criterion in management. In this way, we have taken the first steps towards adapting the structure and content required under the new Directive, while still meeting the requirements of current mercantile legislation (Act 11/2018 of 28 December on diversity and non-financial reporting).\n\nAs at the date when this report was prepared, no errors have been detected that would entail the rectification of previous publications.\n\n### **External verification**\n\nIn order to ensure the transparency and reliability of the information, Meliá Hotels International has submitted its non-financial reporting to verification by an independent external auditor since 2010. The 2023 non-financial information has been verified by the firm Deloitte with a limited level of assurance, obtaining an independent review report, based on the essential GRI standards, including the process scope and objectives, as well as the verification procedures used and their conclusions.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances**\n\n#### **ABOUT THIS REPORT**\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n### **Time horizons**\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nIn the specific case of the assessment carried out in 2021 in which we identi-\n\nfied climate change risks and opportunities, in line with the *Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)* recommendations, time horizons were used that deviate from those defined by the regulations to come into force in 2024.\n\nThe following time horizons were used in this case:\n\n- Short term: 0 to 5 years.\n- Medium term: 6 to 15 years.\n- Long term: 16 to 30 years.\n\n### **Sources of uncertainty in estimation and results**\n\n### **Waste generation**\n\nWe consider it relevant to mention that, given the scaling of our reporting system for waste generated (37% of the active portfolio) as well as the limited knowledge of its treatment by the managers of the same in the different destinations where the company operates, the information reported in this area includes a significant degree of estimation.\n\nIn this regard, the calculation of waste generated by business units that do not report data is carried out by multiplying each of these business units' number of stays each month by the ratio of kilograms of waste generated per stay and type of waste of the business units that do report data.\n\nOn the other hand, concerning the treatment of the waste generated, our calculation assumes that the treatment of the company's waste behaves in the same way as the statistical information reported by each country annually for each type of waste. Consequently, the treatment will depend on the location of the business unit and the type of waste generated.\n\nWe plan to further consolidate our waste management system in the coming years so we can identify both the waste generation and the waste treatment at the business unit level and thus eliminate any uncertainty in this regard.\n\n**Queries**\n\nShould you have any queries or suggestions relating to this report, please contact us directly at:\n\n- FINANCIAL INFORMATION: Investor Relations Department (investors.relations@melia.com)\n- NON-FINANCIAL INFORMATION: Sustainability Department (sustainability@melia.com)\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n2023 Management Report Meliá Hotels International\n\nTABLE OF \nCONTENTS\n\n1.

In response to the growing demand for ESG information from investors, regulators and other stakeholders, we are responding to specific requests and participating in specialised rankings to understand the robustness of our performance in the three areas: environmental, social and governance.\n\nBy listening, measuring and assessing, we identify areas for improvement in our Company with the aim of implementing measures to improve our performance and meet our stakeholders' expectations.\n\nFor more than 10 years, we have been participating in some of the most prestigious indices and frameworks internationally with the goal of endorsing our progress and ensuring that the roadmap we have designed is aligned with expectations.\n\nThe S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook 2023 has once again recognised us as the most sustainable hotel company worldwide in the Hotels, Resorts & Cruise Lines segment, regaining the leadership awarded for the first time in 2020.\n\nMeliá received the highest rating in the industry in governance and finance, standing out in the areas of risk management, in terms of the environment in the areas of climate change and environmental indicators and, finally, in the social field in the areas of human rights, human capital development, team management indicators and, lastly, management with our customers.\n\nBeing recognised, once again, as a market leader in terms of sustainability requires us to continue promoting our firm commitment to the integration of ESG criteria in our business model, and is an additional incentive to consolidate a more sustainable and responsible tourism model.\n\n### **ESG MONITORS 2023**\n\n| ENTITY            | RATING             |                        | ASSESSMENT CRITERIA                               | FROM |\n|-------------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------|\n|                   | 2023               | 2022                   |                                                   |      |\n| S&P Global ESG    | 3rd position       | 1st position           | 0-100 points                                      | 2018 |\n| ISS ESG           | B- Prime           | B- (Prime)             | D- a A+                                           | 2022 |\n| ISS Quality Score | E:1 / S:1 / G:6    | E: 1 / S: 1 / G: 3     | 1-10 (lower to higher risk)                       | 2018 |\n| Sustainalytics    | 25.7               | 23.6                   | 0-40 points (higher score, higher risk)           | 2018 |\n|                   | (Medium Risk)      | (Medium Risk)          |                                                   |      |\n| MSCI ESG          | A                  | A                      | CCC - AAA                                         | 2018 |\n| FTSE 4 Good       | ESG Score: 3.7     | ESG Rating: 3.6        | 0-5 (the higher the score, the better the rating) | 2009 |\n|                   |                    | (E: 3.3 / S: 3 / G: 5) |                                                   |      |\n| EcoVadis          | Bronze (60 points) | Gold (64 points)       | 0-100 points                                      | 2020 |\n| CDP Climate       | B                  | B                      | D - A                                             | 2015 |\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **Rankings and other monitors**\n\nInspired by our vocation for continuous improvement, we also participate in benchmark rankings and monitors in areas aligned with the company's needs, material issues and strategic priorities.

BUSINESS MODEL**\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n# CONTENTS **International context and the impact on the tourism industry**\n\nGRI: 2-6\n\nAfter global growth of 3.5% in 2022, growth in 2023 closes at around 3%, with the prospect of remaining at these levels in 2024. The forecast for 2024- 2025 is lower than the historical average of 3.8% (2000-2019) in the face of monetary policies of high interest rates to combat inflation, the withdrawal of fiscal support, in an environment of heavy indebtedness that is dampening economic activity and low underlying growth in productivity.\n\nDespite a complex global context in 2023, marked by the acceleration of technological change, the vulnerability of cyberspace, economic uncertainty, extreme weather events and armed conflicts between states, international tourism made headway to reach nearly 90% of pre-pandemic levels, almost 38% more than what was observed between January and September 2022, according to the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). This thus confirms the sector's resilience, with a return to pre-pandemic levels in terms of employment, high occupancy and adaptation to the new requirements and expectations of visitors.\n\nAccording to data from Amadeus, a leader in travel technology, global hotel occupancy levels up to the end of August 2023 showed 10% growth compared to 2022. It estimated that for the fourth quarter 2023, booking growth would remain at similar growth rates to those mentioned. International tourism is expected to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels in 2024, with initial estimates pointing to growth of 2% compared to levels achieved in 2019. These figures are a source of optimism for the global hotel sector for the coming year.\n\nWith regard to our main market, Spain consolidated its recovery in 2023 after a successful last quarter, which raised tourism's contribution to the Spanish economy to 12.8%, a record high. An industry that stands as the main driver of real economic growth, according to Exceltur's tourism assessment. This evolution is mainly based on the strength of demand, in a context of improving salaries, consumers' preference for travel experiences and the return of the meetings and conferences segment, as well as an increase in prices that reduced the impact of the increase in energy, supplies (9.6%), financial (+18.9%) and wage (7.3%) costs. This situation has reduced the capacity of companies in the sector to increase their financial results.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, the global economy is in better condition than a year ago: the risk of a global recession has reduced, but rising geopolitical tensions could create new dangers in the short term. The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) is optimistic and indicates that it is on track to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels in 2024, despite economic challenges such as high inflation and weak global production, as well as significant geopolitical tensions and conflicts.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, global headline inflation is projected to fall to 5.8% in 2024 and 4.4% in 2025. In the face of this disinflation and firm growth, the likelihood of a hard landing has receded, and risks to global growth are broadly balanced. On the positive side, faster disinflation could lead to a further easing of financial conditions and looser fiscal policies, bringing with it a temporary increase in growth and a boost to productivity. On the other hand, more spikes in commodity prices as a result of geopolitical upheavals (such as the ongoing attacks in the Red Sea) and supply disruptions, or further persistence of core inflation, could prolong tight monetary conditions.\n\nMeliá is facing these forecasts with optimism, focused on moving forward our *Roadto2024* strategy, with the ambition of meeting all the targets set in this final year of our 2022-2024 strategic plan. We ended 2023 by being recognised as the most sustainable European hotel company according to *S&P Global ESG*.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/25/Picture/1 description: The image shows the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\" in a light gray color.

The tourism industry, and especially leisure tourism, in which we are leaders, is on the one hand particularly sensitive to environmental and social issues. On the other hand, our industry plays an essential role in the fight against climate change and its contribution to promoting the conversion of some mature destinations, established at the beginning of the holiday tourism boom.\n\nOur passion for hospitality drives us to respond to our world's global challenges, approaching sustainability as a fundamental lever to transform the tourism model and ensure a positive legacy for our society and our planet.\n\nWe have a far-reaching potential to influence people. On the one hand, through the training and engagement of our employees and partners (true ambassadors for sustainability). On the other hand, by raising awareness among the millions of customers we welcome each year of the importance of taking care of our environment.\n\nImage /page/28/Picture/6 description: This image shows a long, rectangular swimming pool at a resort or hotel, with palm trees and other greenery surrounding it.

BUSINESS MODEL**\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### CONTENTS **Continued expansion in the year that consolidated the recovery**\n\nDespite being a year marked by an international context of uncertainty and intensifying geopolitical tensions, an inflationary crisis, the climate emergency and a shortage of talent in the industry, 2023 will be remembered as the year that consolidated the recovery. Today, it is safe to say that the trend observed in 2022 has continued, and 2023's evolution has been \"from good to better\", with global tourism demand continuing to grow despite constraints, and closing at close to 90% of pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn contrast to this trend, hotel investments showed a significant decrease (30%) worldwide, according to *JLL Research's 2023 Global Hotel Investment Outlook*. An environment laden with high interest rates resulted in historically low portfolio transaction results, as well as a reduction in transaction size. However, in the case of Spain, investments in the hotel sector led the way in 2023 with close to € 4.1 billion, accounting for 36% of the total amount transacted, according to CBRE. 2023 was thus the year with the second highest transacted volume of hotels, behind only 2018. It was the only real estate sector to grow (+31%) compared to 2022. Investors continue to favour highend hotels due to their more resilient and inelastic nature, accounting for 85% of the total amount transacted.\n\nIn this environment, we experienced significant growth, setting major milestones in various regions worldwide. We continued to grow by opening 12 hotels and 2,000 rooms, a key step in our global expansion and further consolidating our position as leaders in the hospitality industry. Our objective is to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and hotel value proposition through less capital-intensive formulas and by enhancing luxury brand penetration. And, in terms of our geographic strategy, we have focused on holiday destinations in South East Asia, the Mediterranean and the Caribbean.\n\nIn line with our targets, 92% of our openings in 2023 followed the asset light model, driving new contracts under the management modality, and in geographic terms were evenly distributed across the EMEA, CUBA and APAC regions. Our focus on continuing to grow qualitatively also stands out with significant milestones in the expansion of our luxury brands including Gran Meliá and *The Meliá Collection*, and our premium brands INNSIDE and Meliá.\n\nOn the other hand, it is important to highlight the following openings in the expansion of our brands:\n\n- **Gran Meliá Palazzo Cordusio:** Milestone for the Gran Meliá brand as it is the first in Milan.\n- **ZEL Mallorca:** This is the first hotel under our Mediterranean essence brand promoted together with Rafael Nadal.\n- **Paradisus Gran Canaria and Paradisus Salinas Lanzarote**: The first hotels in Europe under the Paradisus by Meliá brand, our Destination Inclusive Luxury Resorts brand.\n\n### **Future evolution**\n\nOur Company will continue to advance on the Roadmap we adopted on leaving the pandemic that runs to 2024. It sets out 4 major priorities: to be bigger and better managed, more profitable and resilient, more efficient and digital, and more sustainable. This strategy has helped us keep on growing (with 25 new hotels signed in 2023). As for our outlook for 2024, we are approaching it with caution, as is always advisable.\n\nOf particular importance is the momentum we will give to the expansion of our luxury brands, which will account for one out of every three planned openings between 2024 and 2027. We expect to open the following facilities in 2024:\n\n- **Gran Meliá Torre Melina:** This urban resort located in Barcelona will see the light of day after the complete renovation of the former Hotel Rey Juan Carlos I.\n- **ME Lisbon:** This will raise the luxury lifestyle proposal in Lisbon to a new level, following the brand's success in other major cities, including London, Milan and Dubai.\n- **ME Malta:** This will be the city's new social and cultural epicentre, located in Saint Julians on the east coast of the island, it will offer an exclusive, personalised and immersive experience.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/31/Picture/1 description: The image shows a house icon next to the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\".\n\nIn this regard, our *pipeline* at year-end 2023 totals 64 hotels, mainly comprising hotels under *asset light* management models (97%), with a commitment to our brands' *luxury* (33%) and *premium* (53%) segments. We are continuing to strengthen our international vocation, with 90% of our future incorporations being outside Spain.\n\n### **Roadto2024**\n\nIt has been two years since the launch of our *Roadto2024* Strategic Plan. 2023 was the year of the tourism industry's recovery after the COVID-19 crisis, with a return to pre-pandemic results and figures in some cases even higher than in 2019.\n\nOur strategic vision is based on four strategic pillars, shown in the chart below, and a firm commitment to advancing the principles that underpin the *Roadto2024* strategic vision: economic excellence, operational efficiency, and economic, social and environmental sustainability, as essential precepts for consolidating our position in the market and meeting present and future challenges.\n\nThis strategic vision required supporting this transformation with a cultural and organisational transformation plan to strengthen the commitment and engagement of all our teams, with a new structure conceptualised under the premises of consolidating a more efficient and responsible management model, including digital transformation with a 360º vision.\n\nImage /page/31/Figure/7 description: The image shows a diagram of 4 strategic pillars. The first pillar is \"more profitable\", the second pillar is \"more efficient\", the third pillar is \"more management\", and the fourth pillar is \"more sustainable\".\n\nThis report reflects all the progress made and achievements realised, as well as detailed information on the initiatives launched in 2023 and their impact. We are aware that in this last year, 2024, of the *Roadto2024*, we need to work to achieve the targets set and ensure the key principles that the strategic vision set out: being more profitable, better managers, more efficient and more sustainable.\n\n|                   | MANAGEMENT<br>MODEL                                                                                                                                                                                             | MANAGEMENT<br>EFFICIENCY                                                                                                                                                                                                | RESPONSIBLE<br>COMPANY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| OBJECTIVE         | Leverage our brands, our<br>talent, our sales channels,<br>our management skills<br>and ability to generate<br>revenue to generate<br>qualitative and<br>sustainable growth<br>through asset-light<br>formulas. | Leverage the flexibility<br>provided by a more agile,<br>digital and efficient<br>operating model to<br>improve our teams'<br>productivity and<br>analytical capabilities and<br>thus enhance the Group's<br>reporting. | Lead the transformation of<br>tourism towards a more<br>sustainable model that includes<br>ESG criteria in the business<br>model and the generation of<br>short, medium and long-term<br>economic, environmental and<br>social value.                                                                                                                           |\n|                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| KEY<br>MILESTONES | • Signing of 25 new<br>hotels<br>• 12 new openings<br>• Progress on the F&B<br>strategy<br>• Growth in the luxury<br>segment                                                                                    | • New consolidated<br>structures<br>• Promotion of Data<br>Analytics<br>• Continuity of the 360°<br>digital transformation<br>process                                                                                   | • Environmental Taxonomy<br>• 1st scenario of Internal Control<br>System for Non-Financial<br>Information (SCIINF)<br>• Consolidate the positioning in<br>terms of Sustainability<br>• Sustainability visibility in the<br>eyes of customers<br>• Strengthening of the<br>organisational structure in two<br>key destinations: Mexico and<br>Dominican Republic |\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.

Consequently, we have promoted the certification of our portfolio by *GSTC-endorsed* bodies to ensure that our establishments meet the required standards.\n\nWe recognise that corporate sustainability is not only an ethical responsibility, but also a competitive advantage, as companies that demonstrate a commitment to sustainability tend to gain the trust and loyalty of consumers, employees and investors.\n\nDuring 2024, the last year of our Responsible Business strategic pillar, we will undertake various actions to reinforce our model under the three areas of sustainability, also keeping economic sustainability very much in mind.\n\n### **Environmental sustainability**\n\n• Continuing to adopt measures to reduce the negative impact on the planet, advancing in the fulfilment of our public commitments aligned to the SBTi criteria and reducing waste generation with the operation as the key player. We will also undertake a climate risk analysis to identify each hotel's vulnerability, and we will conclude with the requirements of Environmental Taxonomy.\n\n### **Social sustainability**\n\n- Strengthening our commitment to promoting diversity, equality and inclusion, and reinforcing our positioning regarding impact on local communities.\n- In addition, we will update two topics of relevance to the Company, namely the Human Rights CSA (*Control Self Assessment*) and the double materiality assessment, an initial exercise from a financial perspective.\n\n### **Governance sustainability**\n\n• We will adapt our management report and reporting model to the new sustainability regulations, aligned with the *CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive)*. On the other hand, we will strengthen our reporting system by making progress in identifying new targets for the main sustainability-related indicators.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.

BUSINESS MODEL**\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### CONTENTS **Raising awareness in our value chain**\n\nOur growth strategy is based on the incorporation of hotels under management and franchise contracts. This model requires us to raise awareness among the owners of these new properties to be managed by the Company. Providing a vision of the importance of sustainability in the model requires us to develop an attractive and profitable value proposition, and to showcase our best practices in our own assets to demonstrate the economic, social and environmental impact generated.\n\n### **Strategic vision**\n\nGiven the current context, the promotion of our responsible management model with a long-term vision takes on special relevance as we aspire to consolidate ethical, transparent and responsible management in our business model.\n\nWe want to be a benchmark in the transformation towards a new tourism model in which sustainability takes precedence as a strategic management criterion, enabling us to contribute minimising our impact on the planet, as well as promoting economic and social development at all the destinations where we have an active presence. This approach is embodied in a programme we have called Responsible Business.\n\nIt is the result of a process of learning and maturity that we began more than a decade ago. A process that has led us to promote the integration of sustainability as a key lever for value creation in our *core business*. Only from this understanding of sustainability will we be in a position to advance in our sustainable strategy, which takes as a reference our Vision 2030, to position ourselves among the world's leading hotel groups in the medium and high end, urban and leisure segments, consolidating our leadership in leisure and *bleisure* hotels, and being recognised as a global benchmark for excellence, responsibility and sustainability.\n\n### **Transition to sustainability**\n\nBeing aware that the drive for sustainability must be understood as a balanced advance across all its areas, the current reality sets us a priority challenge: to advance in the decarbonisation of our business and evolve towards a more efficient, responsible and sustainable tourism model. We have taken on this commitment throughout our value chain with the ambition of allocating the necessary financial resources to meet the targets set.\n\nGiven the current complex regulatory context, in 2022 we updated our carbon footprint reduction objectives with targets for 2025 and 2035, taking 2018 as the base year.\n\nWith the aim of progressing towards the decarbonisation of a business that we operate in more than 38 countries based on a third-party asset management model, we have considered it appropriate to focus our efforts on a financial, rather than operational, perimeter, to be validated under the criteria of the *Science Based Targets initiative* (SBTi) in 2023.\n\nAlong these lines, in 2022 we decided to align the public commitments to our global integration perimeter and adjust our decarbonisation ambition under the financial control model. This change in no way conditions our determination to work resolutely and continuously towards the longed-for decarbonisation of our business model, which has to involve our entire value chain.\n\nWe have also continued with projects and initiatives focused on reducing emissions from our activity. On the one hand, our efficiency in terms of natural resource consumption is increasing as a result of investment and efficiency and innovation measures that leverage technology. Moreover, our business is less intensive in terms of the consumption of energy and water resources. We are also identifying opportunities to promote circular economy and food waste reduction initiatives, as well as initiatives in other areas.\n\nIn addition, we have renewed our commitment to transparency in environmental matters with our eleventh consecutive participation in *CDP Climate Change*, the international benchmark ranking on climate change and environmental management, and have maintained a B rating. We have also renewed our participation in the *CDP Water* ranking, which measures companies' water management, likewise maintaining the B rating we achieved in 2021.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n### **Sustainability governance**\n\nThe Meliá Hotels International Sustainability Committee, formalised in 2020, has new leaders this year, 2023, as a result of the changes made to the Company's Executive Committee (SET).

While the Real Estate area brings together under its responsibility very significant areas in terms of sustainability, primarily: works & maintenance, procurement and energy and water consumption management.\n\nIn 2023, this governing body set the objective of holding monthly meetings to ensure the transformation and adaptation of our business model to sustainability standards, in an increasingly demanding regulatory context which requires more agile and effective decision-making and implementation.\n\nThis Committee also reports to the Company's Senior Executive Team (SET) and maintains a close link with our Board of Directors through direct reporting to the Appointments, Remuneration and Sustainability Committee and the Audit & Control Committee on non-financial *reporting*.\n\n### **Governing bodies**\n\nThe Company has developed an organisational and governance structure that assigns and allocates specific responsibilities in terms of sustainability to the different executive bodies and committees of our Board of Directors. The Board of Directors approves and oversees the sustainability strategy, including that related to climate change, and delegates different sustainability roles to its two committees.\n\nThe **Remuneration, Appointments and Sustainability Committee** is the governing body that has been delegated the roles in this area and is responsible for the application of the policy and its public commitments, for ensuring progress in sustainability and for monitoring the strategy and practices concerning sustainability and the environment, as well as the progress that the Company is making in its hotel portfolio in terms of climate risks.\n\nLikewise, to reinforce the Company's commitment to sustainability and climate change, a **Sustainability Committee** was set up in June 2020, chaired and vice-chaired by two members of the Company's senior management and made up of different corporate and operational departments that are key to driving progress in this area. This Committee assumes a key essential role: to ensure the integration of sustainability at all levels of the organisation and make sure that our roadmap contributes to fulfilling the public commitments assumed in terms of ESG from a global, integrated perspective, and to address the main challenges of Agenda 2030.\n\nNine sessions were held in 2023, all incorporating information related to climate change, the environment or climate risk management, a topic that has been very much present at all the Committee's meetings.\n\nOn the other hand, the Company has strengthened its organisational structure in terms of sustainability, particularly in the fight against climate change, giving the Sustainability Department roles and responsibilities in relation to all (1) public commitments associated with the carbon footprint, (2) the promotion of the conclusions identified in our analysis of climate-related risks and improving our management by applying the recommendations of the *Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures* (TCFD), and (3) waste management and the drive towards a circular economy.\n\nFinally, the Sustainability Department has expanded its structure in two of the Company's key destinations, Mexico and the Dominican Republic, with the aim of becoming a benchmark in environmental and biodiversity issues.\n\nImage /page/35/Picture/20 description: The image shows the text 'SUSTAINABILITY TRAINING (HOURS PAX)' in green, followed by the number '1.3' in a larger, gray font.

Meeting this target depends on the Company's position in the various internationally-recognised ESG indices. These indices assess environmental, social and governance areas, and each of these categories has sub-indicators and parameters used to evaluate a company's performance.\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023 At Meliá, we recognise that our participation and performance in the different rankings are a catalyst for continuous improvement, fostering a culture of sustainability and promoting responsible business practices that have a positive impact on the company and the destinations where we operate.\n\nIn terms of scope, the remuneration model is applicable both to the Company's senior management and to executives with corporate or business responsibilities and key profiles.\n\nOn the other hand, there are areas within the business units that are working on reducing energy and water consumption, setting targets to enhance their management and control, and ensuring the promotion of initiatives to reduce the carbon footprint and improve hotel facilities.\n\nImage /page/36/Picture/7 description: The image shows a panoramic view of a row of modern, white villas situated along a coastline. The villas are interspersed with palm trees and lush greenery, creating a tropical ambiance. A sandy beach is visible in front of some of the villas, while others appear to be built directly on a rocky outcrop that extends into the turquoise water. The sky is blue with scattered clouds, suggesting a sunny day. The overall scene evokes a sense of luxury and tranquility.\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n# TABLE OF CONTENTS **Economic - Financial Report**\n\n### ABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n## **Financial and business results**\n\n### **Global hotel business**\n\n| 1.

BUSINESS MODEL**\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n2023 was the first year of complete normality and the recovery of tourism, a year that went from good to better. The trend seen throughout the year in our hotels stands out for the gradual recovery of occupancy rates. Our leisure hotels are closer to pre-pandemic occupancy figures, with a higher margin in our urban hotels. Both rates, although still below the pre-Covid period year on year, show an upward trend in the main key destinations. This strong demand, together with the company's work to position itself increasingly towards the luxury sector, enabled a positive contribution of the qualitative RevPar. In general terms, customer demand shows increased lead time accompanied by cancellation figures that are already at pre-pandemic levels. In terms of outbound markets, we are pleased to note that our customers' mix of nationalities during the year was similar to the Company's historical records, indicative of our brands' value, our positioning in a global market and the good health of tourism.\n\nIn terms of segments, we would highlight the performance of our direct channel, Melia.com, which accounted for 46% of centralised sales during the year. The company's commitment to strengthening the direct channel and our digital tools has become key in the current environment, marked by constant transformation and evolution. In this regard, our *MeliáRewards* loyalty programme now has more than 15 million registered members and is celebrating its 30th anniversary in 2024. We are pleased to see that our direct channel's positive performance is accompanied by the excellent performance of our partners, such as the tour operators that are so important to the industry and to a global company as is Meliá Hotels International.\n\n### **Prospects at the beginning of 2024**\n\nThe start of 2024 looks positive, with demand continuing to show signs of strength and no sign of slowing down. Despite the increased anticipation of demand, the *last minute* component remains significant, therefore entailing current visibility focused on the short/medium term. It is noteworthy that *On the Books* bookings are continuing the positive trend, surpassing by double digits the figures for the same dates recorded in the previous year.\n\nIn short, the coming months will see a solid leisure and bleisure segment, accompanied by MICE and a calendar that promises good performance from major events, with an undoubted highlight being the Paris 2024 Olympics.\n\nHowever, the environment is not immune to the geopolitical and macroeconomic tensions. Recent conflicts around the world have not adversely affected our bookings, although a possible spread of hostilities to other countries could threaten the global supply chain, potentially leading to an increase in inflation and a possible extension of high interest rate monetary policies. These factors could affect demand, although for the time being the current strength encourages cautious optimism for the coming year.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **Hotel Business by region**\n\n#### **SPAIN Region**\n\n|                                                         | OWNED & LEASED<br>(millions of €) | 2023  | 2022  | Δ%     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------|-------|--------|\n| ABOUT THIS<br>REPORT                                    | Owned & Leased Hotels revenues    | 755.5 | 670.1 | 12.8%  |\n|                                                         | Owned                             | 252.5 | 222.6 | 13.4%  |\n| 1.

These good figures are accompanied by a record number of tourist arrivals in our country, standing at more than 84 million, with an increase in average expenditure per stay.\n\nIn relation to urban hotels, the start of the year was positive, recording a significant growth in revenues. This trend has continued throughout the year, with rates increasing and volumes gradually recovering. During the year as a whole, there was a balanced distribution by segment; tour operators, MICE and *Corporate* showed clear signs of recovery and strength. Major conferences that were held during the year in cities such as Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Seville and Palma de Mallorca contributed to this segment's good performance.\n\n2023 saw positive results in our leisure hotels, mainly driven by the recovery in the first quarter after the negative impact of the Omicron variant in the first months of 2022. In general terms, the mix of nationalities has returned to historical figures, with British and Spanish customer numbers being the fastest growing at our hotels. On the other hand, the increased booking lead time and lower cancellation rate, close to pre-pandemic figures, are also noteworthy. By segment, direct customer and tour operators account for the largest increases, while at the MICE and groups level we are already exceeding the figures for 2019, especially with the attraction of many groups at the beginning and end of the season. The summer season was particularly positive, with our Coastal and Balearic destinations performing the best. The good pace of demand and pleasant weather also made it possible to extend the season. Year-end was led by the positive performance of our hotels in the Canary Islands, which materialised the good prospects that were forecast. Special mention should be made for 2023 in terms of our products, with the launch of the ZEL brand developed together with tennis player Rafa Nadal, and the opening of Paradisus Salinas, which will become the second Paradisus hotel in Europe.\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n### CONTENTS **Outlook for the start of 2024**\n\nIn Spain, forecasts for urban hotels are positive. We estimate growth in both rates and volumes right from the beginning of the year. By destination, Barcelona and Madrid are the cities with the highest growth, combining the good year-end for corporate customers and a significant MICE events calendar. In the case of Barcelona, the Gran Meliá Torre Melina will open in January, which together with the Palacio de Congresos will undoubtedly contribute a positive combination of bleisure, Corporate and MICE segments. Meliá Hotels International's commitment to innovation and positioning of its urban products will undoubtedly be significant in 2024 and the coming years.\n\n**2.

In other regions such as our Coastal hotels, groups confirmed for the start of the season allow for positive occupancy and rate forecasts. By segment, it is our Direct Channel that shows the strongest growth in revenues, and also contributes the largest increase in rates. It is worth highlighting the fact that some hotels that have historically closed in winter have not done so this year, a factor that adds to the plan to bring forward the opening of hotels in the Balearic Islands to the end of March for the second year in a row.\n\nImage /page/42/Picture/10 description: The image shows a modern, angular building with a distinctive design. The building is primarily white with horizontal bands of dark gray or black that run along the facade, accentuating the rows of windows. The building's shape is somewhat triangular, with one side rising to a sharp point. The name \"INNSIDE\" is visible near the top of the building. The building is situated next to a body of water, possibly a river or canal, with a stone embankment. There are tables and chairs with white umbrellas set up along the water's edge, suggesting an outdoor seating area. In the water, there are some inflatable pink flamingo pool floats. In the background, there are trees and a bridge, adding depth to the scene. The sky is blue with scattered white clouds, indicating a clear day.\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **EMEA Region**\n\n| ABOUT THIS |\n|------------|\n| REPORT     |\n\n|  | 1.

Overall, the main bleisure destinations have had very good traction across all segments. In addition, on the dates of major events such as Wimbledon, the Rugby World Cup and top level concerts, the number of visitors has been very positive, generating demand in our hotels. The MICE segment has also performed well, with significant visitor numbers. Although some events were not held in 2023, mainly in Germany, overall the evolution is positive. One of the levers that maintains growth potential is the purely *Corporate* segment which, despite maintaining a positive evolution throughout the year, has not recovered its pre-pandemic volumes year on year. By area, performance by country year on year is as follows:\n\nIn Germany, the start of the year was marked by the different performance of cities in the north of the country more linked to the business customer and cities with a more bleisure component. In the first case, the lack of *Corporate* customers meant a lower base occupancy in hotels in the north, while cities with a bleisure component saw a better evolution in destinations such as Berlin and Hamburg. However, all segments show marked growth compared to 2022. The positive note is presented by the MICE events held, which led to an improvement in average prices on the days of the events, although a lower number of stays was noted.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, 2023 recorded a positive balance sheet, thanks to an improvement mainly in occupancy compared to 2022, accompanied by an increase in rates. The beginning of the year was marked by strikes and the macroeconomic situation, which affected demand in the domestic and European market. However, the positive note at the start of the year was the *Corporate* segment, showing resilience and sustaining demand. Our hotels in London saw positive year-on-year evolution thanks to a balanced contribution from all segments, with traction from international customers, benefiting from special events such as the Coronation of Charles III. Concerning our hotels in the north of the country, the MICE and *Corporate* segments had the best performance, along with the celebration of concerts and events such as Eurovision, with a large number of visitors.\n\nIn France, a positive year, with a remarkable increase in Revpar that exceeds figures for 2022 by double digits. Despite some negative events during the year, such as strikes and riots in the capital, almost all months saw improved figures compared to the previous year. By segment, tour operators performed well, mainly thanks to US customers, which have become the main nationality for our hotels in the centre. Regarding major events and the MICE segment, the evolution is positive, with Roland Garros and the Rugby World Cup generating additional demand. It is important to highlight the performance of the hotels converted to the Meliá Collection brand, which provides\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.

Especially in the summer season, the country, and in particular Rome, saw a significant increase in visitor numbers, mainly from the United States. As respects Milan, domestic, US and British customers allowed for an increase in rates, with the end of the year marked by the gradual return of Asian customers. As is recurrent in the city, events enabled the recovery of revenues following the renovation of the Meliá Milano, which was finished in June. Special mention should be made of the opening of a new property in the city at the end of the year, the Gran Meliá Milano Palazzo di Cordusio, an iconic hotel located on Piazza Cordusio, demonstrating the company's commitment to the luxury sector in major European cities.\n\n> 2023 in the region marks the continuation of our expansion in Albania. This year we opened two new hotels, with a further 13 to be opened, totalling more than 3,000 rooms together with the hotels already in operation. This expansion demonstrates the company's commitment to opening up new markets; it is already the leading hotel operator in the country.\n\n### **Outlook for the start of 2024**\n\nIn EMEA, Germany expects to record year-on-year growth thanks to the strong performance of the *Corporate* and MICE segments, which at the start of 2023 still showed room for improvement. With a much more solid base in these segments and significant growth in direct customers, the outlook is positive. In addition, some major sports events and concerts will generate demand which will be capitalised on through specific commercial strategies.\n\nIn the UK, trends are positive, although the start of the year is proving to be softer than expected, mainly in London hotels. This is mainly due to reduced demand from the *Corporate* segment and the slowdown in tour operators. Hotels in the north of the country are operating at a higher rate than in the same period in 2023, with a considerable drop in MICE but that is more than recovered with increases in the other segments.\n\nIn Italy, the good trend is expected to continue, with demand particularly strong in Milan. Thanks to a solid MICE events base, complemented by direct customer and tour operators, revenue is expected to increase compared to 2023. Regarding Rome, the start of the year is in line with the city's low season. In 2023 it was supported by some events that generated additional demand, which is not expected to be repeated in 2024.\n\nFrance maintains a good *On the Books* position with increases in RevPar across all hotels. In general, 2024 aims to begin with a less tense social climate than that experienced in 2023, without threats of new strikes or protests for the time being. Special mention should be made of the upcoming Paris 2024 Olympic Games, which will start in June. At the moment, bookings are limited, pending full control over the inventory of current bookings that the organisation and delegations are making. Overall, all segments are performing well, with increases in both volume and rates.\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **AMERICAS Region**\n\n| ABOUT THIS<br>REPORT |  |  |  |  |  |\n|----------------------|--|--|--|--|--|\n|                      |  |  |  |  |  |\n|                      |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n| 1.

However, during the third quarter, the country felt a slowdown in US demand for the destination. This demand shifted to European destinations, which is why this quarter recorded worse performance compared to 2022. In the fourth quarter, the pace of demand for the country recovered its good prospects, demonstrating that this occurrence is circumstantial, rather than structural. Indicative of this is the significant increase in air traffic, which has grown considerably compared to 2022. By segment, there is positive evolution across the board, with the MICE segment standing out as having the highest growth during the year.\n\nThe Dominican Republic as a destination has finished a good year in terms of tourist arrivals, surpassing the target of 10 million tourists per year, with the region's air connectivity standing out. In particular, the Canadian market has seen a 20% increase in air capacity over the previous year. In terms of segments, UK, Canadian and US customer tour operators led the year, with increases in rates. On the other hand, Direct Customer has played an important role in the rate increases, with demand for superior rooms also increasing. Finally, the MICE segment has performed well during the year, especially at Paradisus Palma Real, which has hosted major medical conferences.\n\nWith respect to the United States, the year, although positive overall, showed different evolution in the two cities in which we are present. On the one hand, in New York, 2023 presents the highest production to date since opening, demonstrating a solid post-pandemic recovery in both *Corporate* and Leisure customers, with room for leeway in prices compared to other establishments in the area, with this being one of the levers that show potential. In the case of Orlando, after a strong start to the year, the city has seen a final quarter with softer domestic demand following 2022, a year that benefited greatly from ramp-up demand.\n\n41\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n### CONTENTS **Outlook for the start of 2024**\n\nNorth & South America: In Mexico, the strategy for the beginning of the year is to maintain a good base occupancy, allowing for an increase in rates for *last minute* bookings, which prevail among local customers. Regarding the segments, all show a good evolution in terms of occupancy and rate maintenance. In the case of MICE, the year will be challenging as 2023 was particularly positive, with many companies holding large and small events for their employees and customers.\n\n**2. BUSINESS MODEL**\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, this first quarter is presented with an *On the Books* position for all our hotels higher than 2023. The start of the year stands out for the high degree of air connectivity, which allows us to forecast a strong start to the year in terms of occupancy and also allows for an increase in rates. The country continues to be one of the main destinations in the Caribbean for the Canadian market, and thanks to the collaboration with our main partners, it allows us to lay the foundations in occupancy required to improve rates at the destination. Regarding the European market, the presence of German, Spanish and French customers also supplements the demand. By segment, direct customers and tour operators show increases in volumes and rates. With regard to the MICE segment, good prospects were recorded in all hotels, with Paradisus Palma Real once again accounting for the majority of revenues from this segment.\n\nThe United States shows good prospects in New York, where leisure customers continue to show month-on-month increases, coupled with large group bookings for January and February. For the time being, demand in the city is expected to be strong and allow for growth in RevPar. In the case of Orlando, January and February show a drop in rates due to the strategy taken to recover occupancy, which is below expectations. March is traditionally a month of high demand in the city, so it is expected that the rate of bookings will recover from then.\n\nImage /page/48/Picture/11 description: A picturesque outdoor swimming pool is captured on a sunny day, framed by lush greenery and a clear blue sky.

In 2023, the region's recovery was notable and although it has not recovered pre-pandemic metrics, it is laying a solid foundation on which to build growth. By country, China started to recover from the beginning of the year, with the turnaround starting with the Chinese New Year. Year on year, an increase in Revpar was recorded thanks to the recovery of part of the lost occupancy, but more significantly, due to the increase in rates. By segment, all segments show solid recovery, combining leisure demand, city events and *Corporate* customers. It should be noted that for the moment the demand is mainly local and from neighbouring countries. International air connectivity figures remain well below 2019, both in terms of inbound tourists and outbound nationals. In 2024, the major airline associations plan to increase air capacity gradually throughout the year.\n\nWith respect to Southeast Asia, in general, the easing of entry conditions to some destinations has favoured regional demand. Destinations such as Bali have recorded a year of growth in volume and increased rates, in which air connectivity has been key. The return of direct flights to major destinations generates additional demand. In the case of Thailand, tourists are primarily Asian and local, with other nationalities being less relevant at the moment. In terms of segments, the participation of tour operators stands out, increasing revenues while creating brand presence among local and international customers. In destinations such as Koh Samui, the performance of groups and events was also positive. In the case of our hotels operated in Vietnam, demand has mainly been focused on the domestic and nearby international markets (Korea and Australia). Chinese travellers have not recovered their pre-pandemic volumes year on year due to competition from other destinations and the easing of entry conditions through visa waivers. In terms of segments, performance varies from city to city. Hanoi, for example, has performed well in MICE and Corporate, while other destinations are more dependent on tour operators.\n\n### **Outlook for the start of 2024**\n\nIn the Asia region, following the clear turnaround after the pandemic, 2024 should be a year of consolidation and growth in the region. One of the main levers with growth potential lies in international air connectivity, which remains below pre-pandemic capacity, especially in the case of China. The expected gradual increase in international air capacity should be a catalyst for demand in the region from tourist arrivals, as local travellers go abroad, feeding back into demand in other regions. In the case of China, the outlook indicates growth in revenues due to tour operators and the MICE segment, with both showing double-digit growth compared to 2023. In the case of Southeast Asia, demand is generally solid. In destinations such as Bali, the strategy is focused on growth via rates, as there is more readiness for experiences. In Thailand, the region expects to benefit from the growth in Chinese demand, generating a higher volume of *last minute* demand. The segments benefiting the most are direct customers and tour operators, controlling the volume of inventory for tour operators. In the case of Vietnam, the start of the year shows On the Books bookings higher than in 2023; in destinations such as Phu Quoc, the contribution of customers from the Czech Republic stands out. Regarding destinations with a higher number of events such as Hanoi, MICE demand remains solid.\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **CUBA Region**\n\n|                   | OWNED & LEASED (millions of €) | 2023 | 2022 | Δ%   |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------|------|------|------|\n| ABOUT THIS REPORT | Owned & Leased Hotels revenues | N.A. | N.A. | N.A. |\n|                   | Owned                          |      |      |      |\n|                   | Leased                         |      |      |      |\n|                   | Of which Rooms Revenues        | N.A. | N.A. | N.A. |\n| 1.

In general, visitor arrivals from the major foreign outbound markets grew, with diversification and growth in air capacity contributing positively. The Canadian market continues to lead the region, with more than 50% increase over 2022. By segment, tour operators remain the main source of stays generasituation and the consequent devaluation of the Cuban peso.\n\nImage /page/52/Picture/4 description: The image shows the text \"2.

The negative note this year was the domestic market, which saw a large reduction in stays in the region. The main reason is the country's economic **Outlook for the start of 2024** In Cuba, the beginning of the year shows good prospects thanks to increased booking lead time, resulting in a better *On the Books* position. The international market continues to lead the way, with major markets such as Russia, Germany, Argentina and France having a good rate of bookings. With respect to the Canadian market, it continues to lead the destination despite a slight decline in On the Books bookings compared to the previous year, which is compensated by a higher average rate. The opening of the Meliá Trinidad Península, the first 5-star hotel at the destination, stands out in this period. Another highlight is the opening of the Sol Turquesa Beach, located in Holguín.\n\nImage /page/52/Picture/10 description: A serene outdoor scene features a large, inviting swimming pool in the foreground, its turquoise water reflecting the clear blue sky above. The pool's surface is subtly textured with the pattern of the tiles beneath. Beyond the pool, a row of white cabanas with draped curtains offers shaded relaxation areas, each furnished with blue lounge chairs. Tall palm trees sway gently in the background, adding a tropical ambiance to the setting. To the right, a building with a light pink facade and a red-tiled roof can be seen, suggesting a resort or hotel. The overall composition evokes a sense of tranquility and leisure.\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **Value for our shareholders**\n\n### **Shareholding Distribution**\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, our shareholding is structured as follows:\n\n**SHAREHOLDING STRUCTURE**\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n|  |                                      | NO.

This policy is compatible with the top priority given to maintaining a level of equity that guarantees investments for the Company's future growth and ensures value creation.\n\nAfter 2023, a year of normal operations throughout the year and following the suspension of dividend distributions in recent years to strengthen the balance sheet, the Board of Directors resolved on 29 February 2024 to propose to the Annual General Shareholders Meeting a resumption of dividend distributions against FY 2023.\n\n## **Stock Market Evolution**\n\nDuring 2023, Meliá Hotels International shares have recorded a 30.2% increase in value, while the IBEX-35 has appreciated by 22.8%. The stock's performance was particularly positive in the first half of the year, after fears of the onset of a recession at the beginning of 2023 dissipated. The strength of demand and the good prospects for the different seasons that have materialised throughout the year have met market expectations. On the other hand, to contain the increase in inflation, the European Central Bank and the FED in the United States have raised interest rates throughout the year. In the final stretch of the year, however, stock markets in general rose across the board, partly on the back of expectations of the end of the restrictive cycle and the rising interest rates.\n\n**STOCK MARKET EVOLUTION**\n\nImage /page/53/Figure/14 description: The image is a combination line and bar graph.

GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe following changes have taken place in the Board's specialised committees:\n\n• Appointment of Ms. Montserrat Trapé Viladomat (Independent External) as a member of the Appointments, Remuneration and Sustainability Committee. • Appointment of Ms. Cristina Aldamiz-Echevarría González de Durana (In-\n\ndependent External) as member of the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\n### **Diversity**\n\nBoth the Appointments, Remuneration and Sustainability Committee and the Board are aware of the 40% target established in the CNMV's Good Governance Code of Listed Companies and the Diversity Directive. Consequently, they underscore their determination to include more women on the Board in future selection processes.\n\nIn this regard, since 2021 the Board of Directors of Meliá Hotels International has comprised four (4) female directors, out of a total of eleven (11) members, representing 36.36% women on the Board. Moreover, the specialised Board Committees have a composition of more than 40% women (the Audit and Compliance Committee is made up of 60% women and the Appointments, Remuneration and Sustainability Committee, 40%).\n\nFurthermore, in June, the Board of Directors approved a **new** *Diversity Policy*, setting new and more ambitious targets in this area. The Policy establishes the principles, guidelines and main lines of action on diversity and inclusion that will govern the Company's strategy, ensuring equal opportunities and non-discrimination on grounds of race, colour, sexual orientation, age, gender, culture, work, disability, ideology, religion, or any other characteristics, with diversity and inclusion defended as values to be protected and consolidated in the workplace. In addition, the *Director Selection Policy* was amended in June 2023, updating the Board's gender diversity target: **40% women by 2024.**\n\n#### **Evaluation of the Board of Directors**\n\nGRI: 2-18\n\nThe Board of Directors annually evaluates the functioning and composition of the Board itself and its committees, as well as the Company's chief executive. The Appointments, Remuneration and Sustainability Committee is responsible for approving and initiating this process. The report with the results of the 2023 evaluation will be presented to the Board of Directors in the first quarter of the following financial year (2024), when the corresponding action plan, if any, will be discussed and approved.\n\nIn connection with Recommendation 36 of the Good Governance Code of Listed Companies, which refers to the assistance of an external consultant in the Board evaluation process, the Appointments, Remuneration and Sustainability Committee was advised in 2022 by the consultancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers in the review of the assessment questionnaires for the Board of Directors and the chief executive.\n\nAs a result of the 2022 self-assessment process, during 2023 the Board has had a training plan in place for new technologies (artificial intelligence), strategy and cybersecurity. The selection of the training provider was led by the Appointments, Remuneration and Sustainability Committee as part of the process to monitor the Board evaluation.\n\n### **Competency matrix**\n\nGRI: 2-17\n\nDuring 2023, the competency matrix has continued to be used as a tool for the selection and re-election, where applicable, of Directors, as set out in the *Director Selection Policy*, as well as in the preparation of the Board's training plan.\n\n#### **Conflicts of interest**\n\nGRI: 2-15\n\nThe Honorary Chairman of the Board (Gabriel Escarrer Juliá), the Chairman and CEO (Gabriel Escarrer Jaume), as well as the Directors whose re-election or appointment has been submitted for approval by the AGM, have abstained\n\n52\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Short-term variable remuneration**\n\n**Remuneration in kind and other benefits** \n\n#### TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.

We also follow the remuneration studies prepared by external consultants.\n\nIn 2021, the *Board Remuneration Policy* for 2022 to 2024 was approved to incorporate the latest recommendations of the Good Governance Code of Listed Companies and the new requirements resulting from the latest reform to the Spanish Companies Act regarding long-term shareholder involvement.\n\nThe remuneration of the Directors in their capacity as such consists of:\n\n- **Fixed annual allowance** for carrying out their supervisory and joint decision-making roles.\n- **Per diems** for attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors and Committees of which they are members.\n\nIn addition to the above, the Chairman of the Board and the CEO's remuneration package includes:\n\n- Fixed annual remuneration.\n- Short-term variable remuneration.\n- Long-term variable remuneration.\n- Remuneration in kind and other benefits.\n\n### **REMUNERATION STRUCTURE OF THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO**\n\nImage /page/59/Figure/16 description: The image shows two diagrams illustrating director remuneration systems.

The title of the image is \"DIRECTOR REMUNERATION SYSTEM\".\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs part of this remuneration structure and in compliance with the Spanish Companies Act, the Board of Directors submitted for approval by the 2022 Annual General Meeting the long-term remuneration system, partially indexed to the Company's share price, for the Executive Director, leadership and other professionals of the Group.\n\nmuneration Report, which will be submitted for approval by the 2024 AGM.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.

GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe transversal management of intangibles is becoming increasingly important due to new regulatory environments and the interest of investors, customers and consumers etc., with an increased focus on transparency and rigour in non-financial reporting.\n\nThe European Commission presented on 23 February 2022 a proposal for a Directive on corporate sustainability due diligence. The proposal aims to promote sustainable and responsible business behaviour throughout the value chain. It requires companies to play a key role in building a sustainable economy and society, requiring them, where necessary, to prevent, contain or mitigate the adverse effects of their business activity on human rights and the environment. This issue is not only becoming increasingly important in the regulatory environment, but also in our stakeholder materiality matrix, the issue of labour and human rights protection is positioned in the TOP 5.\n\nThe new regulation sets new lines of work, consequently, we assume universal pillars, such as the Principles of the Global Compact - an entity of which we have been a member since 2009 - and United Nations Human Rights, and we apply international frameworks in the business sphere: the International Bill of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Fundamental Principles of the ILO, the Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy, as well as other specific conventions concerning the tourism industry.\n\nUsing the documents available from the European Commission, the Global Compact good practices and the recently published CSRD, the Group is working to make our process for identifying, preventing, mitigating and taking accountability for actual and potential negative effects on people and the environment ever more robust. We are driving this commitment throughout our value chain, including all kinds of suppliers, who provide a service in line with our customers' expectations.\n\nAt Meliá Hotels International, we have been working for years to consolidate our human rights governance and management system, driven by the publication of the global *Human Rights Policy*, approved by the Board of Directors in July 2018.\n\nIt is also worth highlighting the launch of our first Human Rights **Self-Assessment** in 2019, which was updated in 2022. The due diligence process is aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\n### **Human Rights control and management system**\n\nRespect for human rights, in line with international regulations, is inseparable from our way of understanding hotel management and our values as a family-founded company.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **A LOOK BACK AT 17 YEARS OF PROGRESS**\n\nImage /page/65/Figure/3 description: This image is a timeline of events. Starting on the left, the first event is in 2006, the ECPAT Code of Conduct for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation in Travel and Tourism. In 2008, the Principles of the Global Compact. In 2011, the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism. In 2013, Social dialogue and labour rights. In 2015, The Paris Agreement. In 2019, Prevention of sexual harassment. In 2021, UNESCO Sustainable Travel Pledge. In 2022, Commitment letter to the G20 countries to accelerate the Paris commitments.\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nGiven the Company's growth and the opening of new markets and countries, the Company has designed a risk assessment model by country under ESG criteria, where it may potentially be conducting negotiations but to date has no hotels operating under any management system. This assessment evaluates different dimensions, including areas related to the degree of defence or violation of human rights.\n\nOn the other hand, new hotel incorporations include in their contractual documentation a specific clause to ensure the integration of ESG criteria in the future of the relationship and compliance with Meliá Hotels International's ethical management system.\n\nWe translate our commitment to human rights into practice and are working to ensure their integration throughout the value chain. All our suppliers must sign our *Supplier Code of Ethics*, assuming our ethical commitments to respect their own people and to protect human rights. Likewise, they actively undertake to promote and respect the principles of the UN Global Compact on labour and human rights in their business. In this regard, we have the power to at any time verify that the obligations assumed in this clause are being met. While our contract with the supplier is in force, we may also request documentation to demonstrate that the supplier is complying with the commitments set out in the clause and, in the case of non-compliance, initiate termination of the contract, without prejudice to any other appropriate compensatory actions.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### **A robust governance model**\n\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, drafted by representatives with different legal and cultural backgrounds from all regions of the world, represents the first universal recognition of the basic rights and fundamental freedoms inherent to all human beings, inalienable and applicable in equal measure to all people, regardless of our nationality, place of residence, gender, national or ethnic origin, skin colour, religion, language or any other condition.\n\nThis key principle requires the business world to respect human rights in its activities and operations, avoiding negative impacts or violations and, at the same time, promoting actions that contribute positively to the targets set in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nThe Company has different tools, channels and control systems in place, available to both its external stakeholders and its employees, to respond forcefully to any violation of human rights and minimize any impacts that may occur in any country in which it has presence and operates, whatever the nature may be: general, labour or linked to corruption.\n\n### **Risks arising from our activity**\n\nSince 2021, our Global Risk Map has included **potential impacts on human rights protection** as a specific risk since we operate in 14 countries in which rights may not be fully guaranteed or there may be threats of systematic violations. This risk specifically analyses breach of labour rights, staff not covered by a Collective Agreement, human trafficking, respect for the environment, slavery, discrimination, harassment, bullying and mobbing, taking into account the level of probability and impact.\n\nWe monitor this model each year to compile all the behaviours that could threaten the dignity, equality, freedom, health or safety of people, as well as impacts on the environment and issues related to corruption. As part of our Crime Prevention and Detection Protocol, we have identified 23 criminal offenses, 8 of them associated with impacts on human rights, related to be-\n\n### **Governance**\n\nThe various governing bodies assume the functions and powers associated with this area.\n\n### Board of Directors Appointments, Remuneration\n& Sustainability Committee Auditing & Compliance Committee Executive Committee (SET) Sustainability Committee Ethics Committee\n\nCode of Ethics Supplier Code of Ethics Corporate Policies **Auditing & Compliance Committee** Regulatory body that strengthens the general framework defined in our Human Rights Policy.\n\n> Equality Plan Dhaka Principles\n\n**Management tools**\n\nocused on the integration, protection and resolution of incidents in this area.\n\n### Code of Ethics Oice\n\nComplaints Channel\n\nCrime Prevention Model\n\nGlobal Risk Map & ESG\n\nSupply Chain Due\nDiligence\n\nControl Self-Assessment\n(CSA) Human Rights\n\nInternal Audits\n\nCrime Prevention Model\n\nCollective Bargaining Agreements\n\nWorks Councils\n\nOccupational Health & Safety Committee\n\nhaviours that could breach workers' rights, possible environmental impacts and behaviours linked to corruption.\n\nThe analysis conducted with the participation of the 242 hotels involved, as well as the management of the 28 complaints received, leads us to confirm that our management system operates correctly, with no risk situations having been identified in any of the areas covered by the exercise, and concluding that there is a high level of protection and low probability of situations involving a breach of human rights.\n\n60\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\nSince 2020, we have identified groups whose rights, mainly labour related, are not guaranteed or are systematically violated in countries in which we operate and where there could be a risk, taking as a reference the Global Labour Rights Index of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) and Human Rights Watch.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.

Each year our Internal Audit and Occupational Health teams check the correct implementation of these systems and occupational health and safety protocols.\n\nOn our path of continuous improvement and anticipation of potential risks, we periodically verify our internal control systems. Lessons learned and opportunities for improvement are integrated into the Company's management so our performance can be seen by our stakeholders in a transparent, rigorous manner.\n\nImage /page/67/Figure/13 description: The image shows three donut charts with labels above them. The first chart is labeled \"Labor Practices\" and has values of 6.2% and 98.4%. The second chart is labeled \"Environmental Practices\" and has values of 11.2% and 83.1%. The third chart is labeled \"Anti-corruption Practices\" and has values of 5.4% and 97.5%.\n\n**LEVEL OF PROTECTION AND PROBABILITY OF BREACH**\n\n% Degree of protection % Probability of violation\n\n### **Human rights self-assessment**\n\nThree years after our first self-assessment, in 2022 we reviewed and updated our Control Self-Assessment (CSA) to identify new risks and criteria in this area in our operations. This new document incorporated the highest standards and added the Dhaka Principles of Responsible Recruitment and the Modern Slavery Act (UK) guidelines to the approaches already covered in our first self-assessment, mentioned above. With the aim of going further in our requirements, when updating the self-assessment we also incorporated new vulnerable groups, such as migrant workers, women discriminated against on the basis of gender, women who are victims of violence, children, indigenous communities, the unemployed, refugees and LGTBIQ+ groups.\n\nWith this update, we covered different areas relating to labour rights, such as staff selection, remuneration and recruitment, occupational health and the working environment, social dialogue, the supply chain, the environment, recognised as a commitment in our policy, and anti-corruption. In each of them, we measured the perception of protection and the probability of breach of these rights in the business units, as well as management's management capacity, aware of the potential negative impact of a possible breach on our business.\n\nGiven the importance of this issue and our international presence, 242 hotels were invited to participate in 2022 across 26 countries (84% of the active owned, leased and managed portfolio), with the exception of Cuba, China and other hotels that were not operational during the period). All the hotels responded to the questionnaire, giving us a global vision of the level of management, control and assurance that exists in our portfolio.\n\nThe exercise included one hundred questions and was conceptualised from an integrated view of our public commitments. It covered the Company's different policies in areas related to: human rights, anti-corruption, climate change and the environment, procurement and contracting of services, human resources, occupational health and safety, and sustainability. To supplement the process, we analysed other areas with additional specific questions related to harassment, impact on communities, discrimination, labour rights, free movement, ethics, right to privacy and the fight against child labour.\n\n61\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **SELF-ASSESSMENT**\n\nImage /page/68/Figure/3 description: This image shows a world map with hotel locations and a pie chart.

Of the 8 complaints received this year through this channel, all have been related to different areas relating to human rights at 7 hotels. None of the complaints received were linked to breaches of the rights of indigenous peoples or operations that involved child labour. 100% of complaints were analysed, investigated and closed during 2023.\n\n### **2024 Challenges**\n\nThe Company is committed to launching a new Control Self-Assessment (CSA) during the first half of 2024, taking into account all the aspects incorporated in the new corporate sustainability due diligence directive: to protect the environment and human rights.\n\nWe will strengthen our teams' knowledge in this area with specific training, and a particular focus on the highest risk destinations, as well as updating our internal website with specific content on human rights.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n# CONTENTS **Listening to our stakeholders**GRI: 2-29; 3-1; 3-2; 3-3; 207-3\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### **Committed to listening**\n\nGRI: 2-29\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023 **2.** BUSINESS MODEL **3.

For this reason, we include all our relevant stakeholders as well as the subgroups identified in our mapping. It is important to highlight the increase in average participation we achieved in our last exercise, with a response rate of 27% compared to 25% in 2019.\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n#### **3.

This approach has enabled us to identify where the main differences lie between our performance and our stakeholders' views, with the aim of using this learning, coming about from dialogue, and integrating it into our sustainability strategy.\n\nImage /page/71/Figure/13 description: This image is a stakeholder map. The map is divided into three concentric circles labeled \"Internal (Priority 1)\", \"Environment (Priority 2)\", and \"Context (Priority 3)\". The stakeholders are listed around the circles. The stakeholders are Customers, which include B2C (individuals), B2B (corporate), Travel agents, and Intermediaries, OTAs and TOs. Suppliers include Of products and Of services. Shareholders & Investors include Institutional investors, Minority shareholders, Vote advisers, Financial entities, Financial analysts, Rating agencies, and Sustainability analysts. Owners & Partners include Asset owners and Partners - Joint Ventures. Employees include Employees. Industry & Competitors include Regulatory bodies, Tourism industry (competitors), Private business associations or organisations, Public-private organisations, and Lobbies. Public Administration includes National, regional or local administrations, Public entities, and Public-private organisations. The Media is also listed as a stakeholder.

They all have their own channels and spaces for dialogue, which enriches the discussion to ensure that the framework of material issues incorporated by the Group into its materiality analyses is complete, with the premise of incorporating the issues and concerns of the different stakeholders.\n\nThe external analysis also considered the standards and criteria established under international frameworks, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and specific standards for the hotel sector, as well as the main global trends and regulations in the field of sustainability and the industry.\n\n### **Evaluation of the issues identified**\n\nThe materiality survey incorporated the 19 selected material issues and the different internal and external stakeholder groups and subgroups in order to obtain results from an internal perspective (employees, owners, partners, shareholders and investors) and an external perspective (customers, suppliers, industry and competitors, public authorities, media and society), which would enrich the information gathered.\n\n#### **Prioritisation of issues and validation**\n\nIn line with the specific weight given to each stakeholder group, we prioritised the issues in order of relevance. This exercise was subsequently submitted to the Company's Executive Committee and the Appointments, Remuneration and Sustainability Committee, with delegated sustainability functions, for validation.\n\nThe results of the process help us obtain a matrix and catalogue the material issues according to their relevance, the results and importance of the issues, differentiating the issues under three scales, critical, high and medium.\n\nImage /page/72/Figure/11 description: The image shows information about sources used, surveys, and outlooks. Under the title \"SOURCES USED\" are six numbered items: 1) Issued evaluated by ESG analysts and industry investors, 2) GRI and SASB universal and industry reporting standards, 3) Industry analyses, 4) Requirements under law 11/2018 on non-financial information and diversity, 5) WEF Global Risk Report 2021, and 6) 2030 Agenda. The image also states that 1,184 surveys were carried out with 8 stakeholders / 20 subgroups. There are 12 countries participating in the listening. Under the title \"INTERNAL OUTLOOK\" it states that there are 224 employees. Under the title \"EXTERNAL OUTLOOK\" it states that there are 960 people. The image also lists the following: Owners and partners, Shareholders and investors, Customers, Suppliers, Industry and competitors, The media, and Society.\n\n#### **MATERIALITY MATRIX**\n\nImage /page/72/Figure/13 description: The image is a scatter plot with two axes labeled \"EXTERNAL OUTLOOK\" and \"INTERNAL OUTLOOK\". There are several data points plotted on the graph, each represented by a circle and a label. The data points are colored green, red, or light-blue, which are labeled as \"Medium\", \"High\", and \"Critical\" respectively. The data points and their labels are as follows: \"Responsible supply chain\" (green), \"Biodiversity management\" (green), \"Diversity, equality and inclusion\" (green), \"Positive impact on destinations\" (red), \"Responsible water management\" (red), \"Climate action\" (red), \"Waste management and circular economy\" (red), \"Energy efficiency\" (red), \"Trust & Reputation\" (red), \"Sustainable business model\" (red), \"Commitment to employees\" (red), \"Training and development\" (red), \"Regulatory Environment\" (red), \"Digital transformation & Culture of innovation\" (light-blue), \"Protection of human and labour rights\" (light-blue), \"Business ethics, integrity and transparency\" (light-blue), \"Cybersecurity & data protection\" (light-blue), \"Safety, health and well-being of employees and customers\" (light-blue), and \"Customer experience\" (light-blue).\n\n#### **MATERIALITY ANALYSIS PROCESS**\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe chart shows that the most relevant area is governance, with cybersecurity, data protection, business ethics and labour and human rights protection identified as the most relevant areas. There is considerable consensus among external and internal stakeholders on the importance of these issues.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n#### **3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nIt is worth mentioning that in its first strategic sustainability plan, designed in 2008, the Company promoted the governance dimension as a fundamental pillar to ensure a solid governance model, integrated into the business model, so a culture of ESG risk management based on a long-term view prevails.\n\nThe issues associated with the social dimension are the next most important block, taking into account the impact on the different external and internal stakeholders of many of the issues assessed.\n\nWe are aware that the road is long and there is still a long way to go. That is why we have redoubled our efforts to close the gap on the issues that showed a lower level of perception.\n\n### **2024 Commitment**\n\nDuring the first half of the year, we will update our materiality exercise, including the recommendations of the new European Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), incorporating the double materiality perspective, as well as the materiality assessment guidelines set out by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) and the ESRS.\n\nIn this study, we will assess the impact of the company's business activities on stakeholders, society, human rights and the environment, as well as the impact on the company itself from the point of view of the financial impact of each of the risks and opportunities assessed.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n# CONTENTS **Ethics and integrity**\n\n#### ABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nTABLE OF\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nMeliá Hotels International continues with its firm commitment to promoting a more responsible, ethical and transparent tourism industry. Under these principles, we are committed to offering a value proposition that allows us to build long-term relationships of trust and mutual benefit with all our stakeholders and society as a whole, while ensuring the preservation of the environment for future generations.\n\nManaging the business under the premise of ethics, integrity and transparency is a priority for all of us at Meliá Hotels International. We believe that ethical and responsible behaviour reinforces our value proposition in order to convey the trust that our stakeholders place in us.\n\nFurthermore, working with conviction on these areas contributes to ensuring a responsible, solid and strong business model that we aspire to build day by day. We understand integrity as a guiding principle of our strategy and, therefore, of our operations. Consequently, we are committed to always meeting the highest and most demanding standards of business behaviour.\n\nAt Meliá, we live business ethics in our day-to-day work. This is expressed through our corporate values, principles of action, codes of conduct and whistleblowing and dialogue mechanisms which, taken as a whole, define our organisation's operating culture. We are working to ensure that these approaches go beyond mere regulatory compliance, aspiring to promote a culture that encourages exemplary behaviour from all our collaborators and fostering a sense of shared responsibility among all of us at the Company.\n\nFrom the highest levels of its leadership, Meliá promotes continuous work focused on encouraging and facilitating our teams' ethical conduct and behaviour. This commitment is made possible by having a strong, consistent and comprehensive set of rules and regulations on the fight against corruption, fraud, money laundering and respect for human rights, as well as direct, transparent and honest dialogue with our stakeholders. Providing a common, coherent and consistent framework. We also have transparent, public and reliable whistleblowing mechanisms in place, which help to ensure that any possible cases of non-compliance with our ethical principles are dealt with appropriately.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **Code of Ethics**\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe *Code of Ethics* is the cornerstone of our governance model and incorporates all the principles and public commitments that we assume as a Company, as well as a set of guidelines that organise and give meaning to our culture and values.\n\nOur commitment is to consolidate a model of responsible hotel management committed to the common good. Consequently, the Code of Ethics includes the main standards and models of business behaviour and industry conduct of reference throughout the world.\n\nAmong our commitments, it is worth highlighting those that determine how we do business:\n\n- To comply with applicable legislation and regulatory obligations in Spain and at an international level.\n- To act rigorously and forcefully against any practice involving corruption, fraud or bribery.\n\nThe Code of Ethics guides the behaviour of all our executives, middle management, employees and suppliers, laying the foundations for ensuring alignment among all of the Company's internal policies, rules, processes and procedures. It is the compass that guides us in our relations with our stakeholders, based on ethics and compliance with the commitments we have assumed with them.\n\nAll our employees must accept and sign our Code of Ethics.

Its mission is to be an instrument of cohesion for the principles and values that the Company trusts are shared by all its suppliers, besides complying with applicable legislation, internalising and applying it with the conviction and peace of mind that comes from doing the right thing.\n\nOur suppliers are any company, corporation, entity or individual, including their employees, subcontractors, agents and other third-party representatives, that enters into a business relationship for the sale of goods or provision of services with any Meliá Hotels International Group company. The Code provides a common, coherent and consistent framework for all our stakeholders.\n\n#### **2.** BUSINESS **GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY 4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST Professional ethics Human rights and the eradication Safety, health and hygiene at work Product quality and service Protection of the environment Protection of information **SUPPLIER CODE OF ETHICS**\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nIn the supplier registration process, the contract includes a specific obligation to sign this Code or demonstrate the alignment of their Code, as well as a specific Sustainability Clause for the stakeholder group.\n\nof child labour\n\nAll our suppliers have available to them a specific whistleblowing channel through which they can report any conduct contrary to this Code.

GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nResponsible for providing guidance in the interpretation and application of the Code of Ethics, this is an advisory body for resolving any issues, questions or concerns that may arise in the day-to-day business of the organisation. During 2023, several working meetings have been held between the executives that comprise it: Sustainability, Corporate Governance, Organisation & Compensation and Risk Control and Compliance, with the aim of promoting and ensuring awareness of this office and its roles and responsibilities within the organisation. It has also ensured a swift response to all questions and queries that are reported to an email address set up for this purpose.\n\nDuring the coming year, 2024, it will continue to review the current Code of Ethics, as well as the Supplier Code of Ethics, to propose an update to the Company's governing bodies.\n\n### **Whistleblowing Channels**\n\nThe aim of the whistleblowing channels is to facilitate the reporting of any behaviour, action or event that could constitute a breach or violation of the Code of Ethics, the internal rules, laws or external regulations. It is a fundamental tool for ensuring compliance with the company's criminal compliance management system.\n\nIn order to comply with the provisions of European Directive 2019/1937 on the protection of persons who report breaches of EU law, as well as its transposition in Spain in Act 2/2023 regulating the protection of persons who report breaches of regulations and the fight against corruption, Meliá Hotels International has developed its *Whistleblowing Channel Policy*, approved by the Board of Directors in June 2023, in line with the provisions of our Code of Ethics and the Company's principles and commitments regarding the whistleblowing channels set up.\n\nThe management system at all times guarantees the confidentiality and impartiality of the process, as well as the absence of reprisals of any nature. Moreover, it reinforces the figure of a manager who carries out their work in an objective, independent and autonomous manner within the organisation, as well as establishing guarantees for the protection of informants or whistleblowers, guaranteeing confidentiality and expressly prohibiting reprisals,\n\nImage /page/77/Figure/17 description: The image shows a diagram that describes the mission and description of the Code of Ethics Office, Complaints Channel, and Ethics Committee. The Code of Ethics Office acts as a coordinating committee for all activities that take place regarding the Code of Ethics. It is a channelling body which represents all the areas involved in the monitoring, implementation and operation of the Code. The Code of Ethics Office interprets and resolves doubts, makes the required updates, provides support to the areas, and provides permanent advice. The Complaints Channel is the most important channel for issues and complaints related to compliance with the Code of Ethics, applicable law, issues related to regulatory non-compliance or situations or events that may require the attention of senior management. The Complaints Channel guarantees objectivity and the confidentiality of complaints, which are received and stored by an independent third party. The complaints go directly to the Chair of the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Compliance Officer. The Ethics Committee is an independent collegiate body entrusted with managing and resolving complaints. The Ethics Committee ensures the correct implementation and operation of the Complaints Channel, manages all complaints in line with the procedure defined, responding to all the parties involved and managing any corrective measures, guarantees confidentiality, and analyses complaints, classifying them by relevance and type, and reporting periodically to the Audit and Compliance Committee.\n\nincluding threats and/or attempts at reprisals, and enabling anonymous complaints, where applicable.\n\nThe commitment is also assumed to periodically review the processes and systems associated with the whistleblowing channel and, if necessary, adapt them as required. On the other hand, it reinforces the need to provide clear and accessible information on how they work and to raise awareness of their use. To this end, the Company has established in its annual training plan the requirement to run a training course on the Code of Ethics & Compliance, including a specific part that incorporates information on the use of the channel, the nature or type of complaints, their processing and the process and follow-up of the same.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\nThere is a *specific whistleblowing channel regulation* governing its operation, which has been updated and approved by the Audit and Compliance Committee. In addition to specifying the situations or irregularities that can be reported, this document also establishes the procedure for managing the complaints and the measures in place to protect whistleblowers, such as confidentiality and the prohibition of reprisals.\n\n### **Ethics Committee**\n\nThis is a collegiate and **independent** body whose main function is to ensure the proper management of the complaints reported. The *Compliance Officer* reports periodically to the Audit and Compliance Committee on areas relating to the whistleblowing channel, as they report directly to this Committee. In addition, the *Chief Legal & Compliance Officer*, head of the Legal & Compliance area and member of the Executive Committee, is also the Secretary of the Audit and Compliance Committee, and attends all the meetings held.\n\nAs indicated in the Whistleblowing Channel Policy, the *Compliance Officer* (head of the Risk Control & Compliance department) acts as Secretary of the Ethics Committee. This body has delegated to the *Compliance Officer* the powers to manage the channel and process the investigation files until they are resolved or closed. The average time between the investigation and the resolution of admissible communications was 35 days for communications sent by employees and 31 days for those sent by third parties.\n\nThe *Ethics Committee has its own Regulation* governing its operation, which was also reviewed, updated and approved by the Audit and Compliance Committee in June 2023. All information relating to these control and management bodies is available on the Company's intranet to ensure the greatest possible awareness and dissemination.\n\n**PROCESSING OF COMPLAINTS**\n\nImage /page/78/Figure/8 description: The image shows a diagram of the process for submitting a complaint. The first step is that the person submits the complaint. The second step is that the Ethics Committee decides whether to accept or reject the complaint. If the complaint is accepted, the third step is that the Committee appoints an investigator and the investigation process begins. The fourth step is that the investigator submits a report and proposes courses of action. The fifth step is that the Ethics Committee analyses and, where applicable, validates the proposal. The sixth step is that the Committee, if appropriate, informs the party concerned about the actions taken. The image also shows how to submit a complaint. One way is through Meliá Home (employee portal), in the \"Code of Ethics\" section, clicking on \"Complaints Channel\". Another way is through the Meliá corporate website. If the complaint is rejected, one way to submit a complaint is by visiting the URL http://melia.xperta.es/incidencias/crear.

Responsibility for compliance falls on all employees within their area and level of action, and even more so still on the executive team, who should be a benchmark for Meliá's principles and values and always act ethically, with integrity and responsibility in their work.\n\nThe model's governance structure includes the following governance bodies, as well as the key elements to ensure its implementation and compliance:\n\n- The Board of Directors, through the Audit and Compliance Committee, is the body that oversees the Risk and Compliance function.\n- The *Risk Control & Compliance* department, headed by the Company's *Compliance Officer*, reporting directly to the Audit and Compliance Committee, is responsible for developing the internal Compliance Model and overseeing the validity of the controls with a particular focus on criminal compliance, as well as promoting a global and proactive view of compliance risks to thus ensure their management and control.\n- The Code of Ethics of Meliá Hotels International and its rules and regulations, comprising the policies, rules and processes that develop it, including the Supplier Code of Ethics.\n- The Ethics Committee, which ensures the proper management of incidents reported through the whistleblowing channels established by the Company.\n\nThe Company's executives, considered to be staff that are particularly exposed, twice a year sign the Executive Behaviour Regulation, aimed at establishing the criteria for behaviour in matters such as conflicts of interest, confidential information, use of resources, related-party transactions, family relationships and staff management. Through this document, executives also express and communicate their commitment to comply with and enforce the Code of Ethics, policies and rules.\n\n### **Crime Prevention Protocol**\n\nThe Crime Prevention Protocol is the establishment of a system comprising policies, regulations, procedures and controls, the aim of which is to reasonably ensure that the risks of commission of crimes to which the Company is exposed in the course of its business are adequately identified, documented, assessed, controlled and mitigated. This is undertaken in an environment of continuous review, updating and improvement, with the goal of preventing or reducing the risks of commission of crimes, especially those that entail the legal entity's criminal liability.\n\nIn accordance with legal requirements and the UNE 19601 standard, this document is available on the *Meliá Hotels International corporate website*.\n\niuriscert\nCOMPLIANCE PENAL\nUNE 19601\n**AENOR**\nconform\n\nThe Protocol is made up of the different elements needed to guarantee an adequate organisational and management model for the prevention of criminal risks:\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.

Meliá has currently identified 25 such risks, adding two new offences in 2023 (compared to the 23 in the previous year).\n- The Company's **Set of Rules and Regulations** and the **General Measures and Controls** that help to prevent and detect the commission of crimes.\n\n• The **Specific Controls** identified for each of the criminal risks concerned. At year-end 2023, there are a total of 377 identified controls, which are verified annually to ascertain their degree of adequacy and suitability, with the evidence of said controls being documented.\n\nThe Crime Prevention Protocol is reviewed annually. The review carried out in 2023 resulted in the elimination of 30 controls as well as the identification of 48 new controls, going from 359 in 2022 to 377 in the current year, as well as the inclusion in the Protocol of two new offences to which the Company is exposed.\n\nThe reporting model designed enables us to periodically communicate the reports and results of the analysis and review of the Crime Prevention and Detection Protocol to the Executive Committee, the Audit and Compliance Committee and the Board of Directors, as well as to all relevant managers.\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, internal and external audits were conducted to verify compliance with the UNE 19601:2017 standard on Criminal Compliance Management Systems. The external audit carried out by AENOR in April 2023 led to the renewal of the certification which accredits that our Criminal Compliance Management System meets the requirements established by said Standard, demonstrating our solid commitment to best practices in terms of ethics and compliance.\n\nAs has been mentioned, the Crime Prevention Protocol includes the applicable criminal risks in line with Article 31 bis of the Criminal Code. However, due to the importance of the fight against corruption, fraud and bribery, as well as the prevention of money laundering, more detail and information in this respect is provided below.\n\n### CONTENTS **Prevention of corruption, fraud and bribery**\n\nGRI: 2-23; 2-24; 3-3; 205-1; 205-2; 205-3; 415-1\n\nThe aim of the *Anti-Corruption Policy*, approved by the Board of Directors in November 2021, is to prevent, detect, report and rectify the implementation of any actions that, in accordance with the applicable legislation, may be classified as corruption or bribery, both active and passive, in line with the principle of zero tolerance towards any of these practices.\n\nThis Policy enforces compliance with anti-corruption laws around the world, in particular laws prohibiting active or passive bribery and private-to-private corruption. It is part of, and approved in line with, the provisions of the Code of Ethics of Meliá Hotels International whereby the Company assumes the following commitments, as well as others:\n\n- To comply with legislation and regulatory obligations in Spain and at an international level.\n- To establish the mechanisms for the oversight and control of our principles, values and commitments, ensuring the condemnation of irregular conduct, and in particular taking action against any practice of corruption, fraud and bribery.\n- To reject gifts and courtesies from third parties if they exceed the reasonable value of mere courtesy, nor accept any type of economic consideration, gift or invitation from our suppliers that, due to its value, may exceed the symbolic or mere courtesy.\n\nThe Board of Directors is the body responsible for approving all the Company's policies and working to ensure their application, periodically assessing their effectiveness and adopting the appropriate measures to remedy any possible shortcomings, making any changes it deems necessary.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nBusiness corruption is one of the criminal offences included in our *Crime Prevention Protocol*. In order to mitigate this criminal risk, a total of 120 specific controls have been identified in the Protocol, which are assessed annually. Last year there were 102 identified controls linked to this crime.\n\nThe *Internal Hotel Control and Management Regulation*, integrated into the aforementioned Protocol and accessible to all employees through the intranet, has specific sections on accounts payable and treasury that set out clear guidelines to prevent corruption and fraud in some critical processes that occur in the business units, mainly in the areas of reception, validation and posting of invoices:\n\n- Payments to third parties\n- Cash flow and cash management\n- Bank reconciliation\n- Opening and managing bank accounts\n\nWe also have other internal policies and rules that establish guidelines to prevent corruption, including the *Philanthropy Policy*, which expressly prohibits contributions to political parties or their foundations, no matter what type (financial or in kind); this Policy extends to trade unions, individuals and private initiatives. In this regard, in compliance with this obligation, in 2023 no contributions were made on behalf of the Group to **political parties or their foundations**.\n\n#### **Prevention of money laundering**\n\nGRI: 2-26; 3-3\n\nThe Company has a Money Laundering Prevention Manual which establishes the work done to prevent this crime, as well as the due diligence measures that have to be applied in establishments that offer currency exchange.\n\nAs indicated in the Manual, there is a Collegiate Internal Control Body that oversees the application of internal control procedures aimed at preventing money laundering in currency exchanges, which is accessible to all the Company's employees through the intranet.\n\nThis offence, included in our Criminal Offences Prevention Protocol, has a total of 70 controls in place to prevent this criminal offence, compared to 61 in 2022.\n\nIn addition to the external audit conducted by AENOR based on the UNE 19601 certification, our Internal Audit Department, acting as a third line of defence, annually reviews the Crime Prevention Protocol with the aim of ensuring the appropriate and effective implementation of the controls established in the Protocol and linked to criminal offences.\n\nIt also reviews the Internal Control over Financial Reporting System (ICFR), as well as the appropriate implementation in the business and corporate units of the provisions of the internal policies, rules and processes, including those indicated.\n\nEach year, the Internal Audit department prepares different reports on the audit processes carried out, which have a global scope and coverage in the Company's different regions, areas and businesses. A total of 199 reports were produced in 2023 (compared to 160 in the previous year).\n\nAs a result of these reviews, and based on the result of the internal audits conducted, no practices have been detected that could expose the Company to a crime of corruption, fraud or money laundering.\n\nDuring this financial year, 2023, no cases of corruption, fraud or money laundering have been confirmed, received through the Whistleblowing Channel or by any other means, consequently, no remedial actions have been required in these areas.\n\n### **AUDIT PROCESS REPORTS** 199 (2022: 160)\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **Consolidating a culture of ethics and compliance**\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.

In addition to doing the training, it is also necessary to pass the final test and achieve the results set.\n\nThis training is supported by videos and infographics to facilitate learning and, as well as a reference document, includes three modules focusing on:\n\n- **Code of Ethics and Whistleblowing Channel:** Specific training on the Code, its content and objectives, as well as the operation of the Whistleblowing Channel.\n- **Compliance:** Offering a concrete approach to compliance, the function and culture of compliance adapted to the reality of Meliá Hotels International, as well as the specific role and responsibilities of the *Compliance Officer*.\n- **Main Offences:** Training module that covers some of the main criminal offences to which the Company is exposed, including corruption and money laundering, with more extensive content, as well as the behaviours and situations that could involve the commission of these offences and the mechanisms designed and implemented to prevent and report them.\n\nThis training course has a global reach and goes out to more than 23,000 people, including employees at managed and franchised operations. This total includes employees considered to be staff particularly exposed to criminal risks, including the Executive Committee, Senior Management, Corporate Executives and Hotel Managers and Assistant Managers. In terms of the consolidated scope, particularly exposed staff amounted to 932 Executives in 2023, of whom more than 73% have already completed the course or are in the process of doing so as at year-end (consolidated scope).\n\nDuring the 2023 financial year, other compliance dissemination/training actions were carried out at a global level, including the following highlights:\n\n- Participation in the podcast series *In Good Company*, in which *Risk Control & Compliance* explained in detail the main features and elements of the Crime Prevention Protocol and the operation of the Whistleblowing Channel. This podcast can be viewed by all employees on the intranet.\n- Participation in *Onboarding Sessions*, meetings in which the main roles and responsibilities of the different departments are explained to employees. A session for the *Legal & Compliance area was held in April 2023.*\n\nAs a result of the Company's commitment to ethics and compliance and the good practices implemented in terms of ethics and compliance, Meliá Hotels International has achieved **second place in the Transparency and Good Governance Ranking** (tied with another company), developed by the Haz Foundation. This achievement demonstrates that our Company has implemented the highest standards in this area among IBEX 35 companies.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n# CONTENTS **Fiscal transparency and responsibility**\n\nGRI: 2-23; 2-24; 2-25; 3-3; 207-1; 207-2; 207-4\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nTABLE OF\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.

It aims to define our approach to taxation on the basis of three core values: transparency, rigour and good governance. Its scope of application includes all companies controlled by Meliá Hotels International, regardless of their geographical location, and is particularly important to the Board of Directors, the Audit and Compliance Committee, the Senior Executive Team (SET) and the Tax Department.\n\nThe Company develops this Tax Strategy on the basis of the following guiding principles:\n\nOur *Tax Strategy* is actively disseminated to ensure awareness and effective\n\ncompliance by all the Company's executives and employees, and is made available to stakeholders on our corporate website.\n\nMeliá Hotels International has a Tax Risk Management and Control System in place to monitor risks relating to large investments and operations, the creation or acquisition of shareholdings in special purpose vehicles or entities domiciled in countries considered to be non-cooperative jurisdictions, and transactions with board members or shareholders.\n\nThis system is part of the function developed by the tax department and with the participation and commitment of all business units, rolled out under the premise of compliance with applicable tax legislation, internal policies and, clearly, the Tax Strategy.\n\n**Regulatory compliance and responsible tax management** in all the countries in which we operate.\n\n**Development of cooperative relationships with the tax authorities and the internal control and management systems** that guarantee compliance with our tax obligations.\n\n**Tax efficiency, the effective defence of our tax positions and transparency** to create value for stakeholders and transparently report our tax contribution at the Group level.\n\nOversight over this system is the responsibility of the Audit and Compliance Committee, which works on all tax risks inherent in the business activities and processes of Meliá Hotels International. Our tax department reports directly to the Board of Directors through this committee on a recurrent basis (at least once a year) and whenever there is an issue considered to be of particular importance.\n\nWe also have a Whistleblowing Channel available to suppliers and the entire workforce, regardless of their hierarchical, functional or geographical position, to report any tax irregularities that run contrary to our Code of Ethics.\n\n78\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/85/Picture/1 description: The image shows a house icon next to the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\".\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.

Such approval is a non-delegable power. Similarly, any presence in non-cooperative jurisdictions must be based on legitimate economic grounds.\n\nMeliá Hotels International carries out hotel business activities in some countries which, without being considered non-cooperative jurisdictions under Spanish law, are considered by certain external observers to be jurisdictions that enjoy a more favourable tax system than Spain, such as Panama, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. In any case, our presence in these jurisdictions is in the development of genuine business activities and all these jurisdictions have signed a double taxation avoidance agreement with Spain, with an information exchange clause.\n\nMeliá also has an entity, Sol Meliá Funding, domiciled in the Cayman Islands. Although this territory has not been on the EU's blacklist of non-cooperative jurisdictions since 2020, it is included in the list of countries and territories with non-cooperative jurisdictions. This company carries out residual business activity relating to the former vacation club and applies the general criteria and procedures of management control and administration set by the Group, cooperating with the authorities concerned to provide the information they deem necessary.\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nImage /page/86/Picture/7 description: This image shows a view from a hotel room window overlooking a busy city street.

GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nRisk management is a transversal and global core concept in the Company's governance model. Our risk management culture comprises a set of values intrinsic to all our operations and business activities, which are shared and lived by all our employees.\n\nWe firmly believe that a strong risk management culture brings significant benefits to any business organisation, not only in financial terms but also in areas relating to the long-term sustainability of our business. Our risk management culture promotes accountability, helps prevent irregularities and contributes to strengthening the company's due diligence procedures, among other benefits.\n\n### **Risk governance**\n\nSince 2009, the Company has fostered a risk management culture from both an external and internal perspective, associated with the hotel business model. This culture is promoted by the Risk Control & Compliance Department, which reports directly to the Audit and Compliance Committee, a delegated committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nMeliá Hotels International's Risk Management and Control System is aimed at ensuring the Company's targets are achieved, identifying all possible risks that could threaten the Group's strategy and the achievement of the targets set. This management model, consolidated over a 15-year period, is based on different levers to mitigate or reduce the impact on the hotel business model:\n\nA *Risk Management and Control Policy*, approved by the Board of Directors in October 2020, which establishes the basic principles and general framework for action in terms of risk management. Article 5 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors assigns to the Board the general oversight function and, in particular, the identification of the Company's main risks, particularly tax risks. Article 14 of said regulations assigns to the Audit and Compliance Committee the functions of overseeing the effectiveness of the Company's internal control, internal audit services and risk management systems, including tax risks, as well as supervising and assessing non-financial risks: operational, technological, legal, social, environmental, political and reputational risks. This Policy is developed by an internal regulation that establishes the rules, guidelines and criteria to be followed by the risk management system for it to be fully aligned with the strategy.\n\n- The segregation and independence of functions followed by the three lines of defence model enables us to provide comprehensive and integrated management to every division of the Company, with the Board of Directors holding ultimate responsibility.\n- **First line:** made up of various divisions and departments that are incorporated into the different areas of the organisational structure: (Corporate Services, Hotel Services and Operations). They are responsible for identifying, evaluating and managing risks.\n- **Second line:** Risk Control & Compliance Department, which is responsible for i) Guaranteeing compliance with the Risk Control Policy and Internal Regulation, ensuring that the Risk Management System is implemented and functioning correctly; ii) Supporting the identification, analysis and evaluation of risks; iii) Managing and monitoring key risks; iv) Reporting to the Company's Governing Bodies.\n- **Third line:** *Internal Audit Management, whose role is to oversee the Risk Control and Management model to ensure it functions correctly by supervising the first and second lines of defence.*\n\nAn organisational structure and governing bodies with specific functions and responsibilities assigned to ensure the Group's risk management model is as solid and rigorous as possible.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONTENTS Both the second and third line of defence report directly to the Audit and guarantees maximum independence in the management and empower-Compliance Committee at Meliá Hotels International, which ensures and ment of a risk culture.\n\nguarantees maximum independence in the management and empower-\nment of a risk culture.\n\nImage /page/88/Figure/4 description: This image shows a diagram of risk management governance. The diagram is divided into three sections: Board of Directors, Audit and Compliance Committee, and Executive Committee (Senior Executive Team). The Board of Directors is responsible for supervising internal controls and risk management systems, approving the Group Risk Map, and presenting, on a detailed and recurring basis, reports on the company's TOP risks. The Audit and Compliance Committee is responsible for supporting the inclusion of risk management in critical processes and assigning appropriate ownership of risks. The Executive Committee (Senior Executive Team) is responsible for approving the Risk Control Policy. The diagram also shows the three lines of defense: 1st Line of Defense (Business and Organisational Units), 2nd Line of Defense (Risk and Compliance Department), and 3rd Line of Defense (Internal Audit). The 1st Line of Defense is responsible for identifying, assessing, and managing risks, and defining and implementing the necessary mitigation measures. The 2nd Line of Defense is responsible for guaranteeing compliance with the Policy and Regulation and operation of the System, supporting in identifying, analysing and assessing risks, controlling and monitoring of Key Risks, and reporting to Governance Bodies. The 3rd Line of Defense is responsible for supervising first and second line of defense, auditing the risk control and management process, and aligning the Annual Audit Plan with the Risk Map. The diagram also includes the words \"Guidelines\" and \"Information\" with arrows pointing to the different lines of defense.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **Risk management model**\n\nOur Risk Management Model, based on the COSO framework, is applied at every level of the organisation: in 2023 it involved the participation of 66 executives from all the divisions and organisational structures mentioned above.\n\nImage /page/89/Picture/4 description: The image contains the words \"ABOUT THIS\" and \"REPORT\" stacked on top of each other.\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe identified risks are consolidated into six different categories, according to their nature. This risk inventory is reviewed and updated every year and serves as a basis for updating the Risk Map, where we analyse both external sources (reports and expert publications) and the internal vision of key areas of the organisation (SET, Strategic Planning, Sustainability, etc.).\n\nAfter identifying external and internal factors throughout the year, we perform an annual review of the current map, which is evaluated to include any factors that are considered important to the Company.\n\nExecutives involved in the evaluation receive guidelines or instructions through training, to ensure that the process is as consistent as possible. The scale used to evaluate impact not only includes financial perspectives (revenue, costs, EBITDA), but also operational factors, such as impact on strategy, reputation, processes and human resources. This methodology enables us to subsequently produce a sensitivity analysis, as well as a risk profile.\n\nWe have seen a reduction in the average value of identified risks, bringing us back to pre-pandemic levels. If we look at categories, we see that, aside from financial risks, which are becoming more prominent in the Map, the other categories are falling slightly, particularly global risks, which are dropping significantly. This latter category includes the pandemic risk, which has become considerably less significant in comparison to previous years.\n\n35 **operational risks** related to failures that may occur in internal processes and operations. 14 **business risks** derived from variables intrinsic to the business such as strategy, competition, the market, etc. 8 **compliance risks** as a result of both internal and external regulatory changes and potential non-compliance. 7 **financial risks** that aect financial variables in the business: liquidity, credit, debt, interest rates, etc. 5 **information risks** related to events caused by the improper use, generation and communication of information. 9 **global risks** related to events beyond our control and for which management capacity is more limited (natural catastrophes, geopolitical risks, etc.).\n\n**RISK IDENTIFICATION MODEL**\n\n{90}------------------------------------------------\n\n**3.

The first line chart shows the average value top 20 and average value for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The average value top 20 is 17.43 in 2021, 17.22 in 2022, and 15.85 in 2023. The average value is 11.38 in 2021, 11.50 in 2022, and 10.92 in 2023. The bar chart shows the compliance, financial, global, information, business, and operations for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. The compliance is 8.3 in 2021, 7.9 in 2022, and 7.9 in 2023. The financial is 10.8 in 2021, 11.0 in 2022, and 12.1 in 2023. The global is 16.4 in 2021, 16.8 in 2022, and 14.6 in 2023. The information is 9.6 in 2021, 9.9 in 2022, and 8.6 in 2023. The business is 11.6 in 2021, 11.5 in 2022, and 11.0 in 2023. The operations is 11.1 in 2021, 11.3 in 2022, and 10.7 in 2023.\n\n### **Primary risks**\n\nIn addition to the Company's Global Risk Map, in 2023 we also produced 85 other maps, one for each of the participating divisions, according to the aforementioned organisational structure, plus individual maps for each participant.\n\nCreating individual maps enables each management team to understand their own situation and their primary risks, helping them to establish initiatives to mitigate and reduce their exposure.\n\nThe results of the Group's Risk Map update are analysed by the Executive Committee (SET), the Audit and Compliance Committee and, finally, by the Board of Directors, with a particular focus on the TOP 20 risks.\n\nThe Risk Map is also used as one of the essential inputs, both for establishing our strategy and for setting variable compensation targets, ensuring that our strategy and the process for setting annual targets are designed to mitigate the Company's primary risks. To ensure this process runs smoothly, the Compensation & Benefits Department sends guidelines every year for setting targets that will reduce our exposure to the risks identified by each division.\n\nImage /page/90/Figure/9 description: The image shows the text \"RISK MAP 2023\" in a light gray color.\n\nImage /page/90/Figure/10 description: The image is a risk assessment matrix with four quadrants labeled Global, Business, Financial, and Operational. The matrix plots various risks based on their potential impact and likelihood. In the Global quadrant, risks include natural disasters, commodity prices, geopolitical risks, pandemics, and health crises, as well as economic uncertainty. The Business quadrant contains industry restructuring, portfolio distribution, and changes in market trends. The Financial quadrant includes financial risks. The Operational quadrant features emerging technology risks, management model, expansion and growth, and talent and human resources. The proximity of each risk to the center of the matrix indicates its degree of criticality.\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### CONTENTS **RISKS BY CATEGORY: IMPLICATIONS AND STRATEGIC ROADMAP**\n\n|                                                         | CATEGORY   | RISKS                                | ESG                                      | POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | TREND | MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL MEASURES                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ABOUT THIS<br>REPORT                                    | GLOBAL     | Pandemics, health crises             | <span style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">✔</span> | • Inability to adapt or respond to minimise the impact of this type<br>of crisis at a local or global level, a crisis whose effects could even<br>include interruptions or full halts to our business.                                      | ❯     | STRATEGIC ROADMAP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|                                                         |            | Economic uncertainty                 |                                          | • National or international economic crises or uncertainty                                                                                                                                                                                  | ❯     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| 1.

We presented three reports detailing risks related to business and operations, outlining the primary risks included in these categories. Many of these risks involved some aspect that was associated with sustainability. These deep-dive analysis reports included the following:\n\n- A risk context and evolution analysis.\n- Identification of indicators for managing, monitoring and measuring risks.\n\t- Action plans for mitigating identified risks, all of which are integrated into the strategic pillars.\n\nAll the members of the Board of Directors, including the Non-Executive Directors, have training sessions in their annual agenda on matters that are relevant to their role as directors, including risk management, due to the wide range of risks involved (technological, climate, financial, etc.), among other reasons. This year, the training was largely focused on cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.\n\nFinancial risks are included in the agenda of every Audit and Compliance Committee session, where they are looked at in great detail. When it comes to technological risks, the head of the technology division reports to the Board of Directors on a constant basis regarding the current situation and any updates on this issue, with a particular focus on cybersecurity.\n\n### **ESG risks (environmental, social and governance)**\n\nThe Company's risk management model identifies all risks that are directly or indirectly related to sustainability or ESG criteria, in order to classify risks on the map that may impact the Company's sustainability strategy. Accordingly, of the Company's 78 global risks, a total of 37 are associated with ESG risk criteria.\n\nIdentifying and integrating the acronym into the risk management model enables us to obtain a second map specific to sustainability matters, which will be reported to the Sustainability Committee, which is responsible for monitoring and controlling the Group's sustainability strategy, and the Appointment, Compensation and Sustainability Committee, which has been delegated this responsibility by the Board of Directors.\n\nBeing part of the Group's Global Risk Map, the same management and control model also applies to these risks, as does the means of identifying measures to minimise said risks.\n\nImage /page/92/Figure/12 description: The image shows a circular diagram divided into three sections representing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors. The Environmental section includes factors like climate change, catastrophes or natural disasters, and commodity prices. The Social section includes talent and human resources, pandemics and health crises, and social media and communication. The Governance section includes management model, expansion and growth, and contract risk. Each section has a corresponding icon: a plant for Environmental, people for Social, and gears for Governance.\n\n**PRIMARY ESG RISKS**\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### CONTENTS **Emerging risks**\n\nIn such a globalised, turbulent and ever-changing world, we need to take care when navigating a landscape of dynamic risk, which is evolving ever faster and often materialises in unexpected ways. These changes may modify existing risks, create new risks and open up new opportunities. The *Global Risk Report* published in 2024 by the World Economic Forum talks of a world \"plagued by a duo of dangerous crises: climate and conflict\". These threats also exist within a context of rapid technological change and economic uncertainty.\n\nOur world today is less predictable, and more impulsive and chaotic. In addition to wars and armed conflicts, we are also exposed to influences, risks and threats of various kinds that will lead to a greater number of disputes, increased social polarisation, less consensus and more unilateral decisions than we have seen in previous decades.\n\nIssues such as climate change, cyberattacks or major technological changes will take on greater significance in our day-to-day lives. Faced with this situation, Meliá Hotels International also has to monitor another kind of risk, generally instigated by external actors, with potential effects that could have a significant impact on our business.\n\n### **Geopolitical Risks**\n\nTourism companies are increasingly exposed to risks related to international transfer of supplies, currency exchange and movement and safety of employees and customers, as a result of the geographical environment they operate in and the increase in transnational business. As a result, it is a good idea to analyse how all these factors interact to develop a risk management plan that can mitigate any potential damages.\n\nThis interrelation between countries and destinations, at a global level, and situations and changes within a country may have a significant domino effect on travelling patterns, not only in that specific country but throughout the world. That is why it is important to quantitatively and qualitatively analyse contingencies, to subsequently study potential solutions in each case and also opportunities to take advantage of benefits in the long term.\n\nGeopolitical tensions in different parts of the world create an ever-changing dynamic that may evolve quickly and will foreseeably continue to lead to sources of instability that will influence not only those countries directly affected, but also the rest of the world. As such, it is highly likely that the hotel sector will be one of the first to feel the impact of geopolitical changes.\n\nThe potential impacts of this kind of risk may affect various factors, with the most notable including drastic decreases or slowdowns in travel, which would have a direct effect on the flow of tourists and, consequently, revenues for tourism companies; changes to customer habits; raw material price increases; or other significant socioeconomic impacts.\n\n### **Cybersecurity**\n\nCyber insecurity remains towards the top of the list of primary global risks, both in the short- and medium-term. To reduce the risk and improve their resilience, companies are developing their own techniques for managing cybersecurity risk, assigning economic and human resources to respond to cyber threats.\n\nThis is why it is important to promote risk management and good governance throughout the organisation and within the Board of Directors, to ensure that resources and investments are applied to manage those cyber risks that are most significant due to their impact and financial, commercial and operational consequences.\n\nNew technologies enable greater digital interaction with customers and add another level of complexity to the cyber vulnerability we may be exposed to. The potential impacts of this risk are related to loss or theft of sensitive or confidential information; identity theft; paralysis of sales; reputational damage; or loss of confidence among consumers.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\nThe Group is constantly working to monitor emerging risks, analysing all available information with two goals in mind: on the one hand, identifying the cause-effect relationships with other types of risks, and on the other, determining the protocols and mechanisms necessary to mitigate negative impacts should they materialise in the future.\n\n### **2024 Challenges**\n\nClimate-related threats predominate in the 10 primary risks faced by global populations, with substantial price increases being the reality for many due to extreme climates or climate-related disasters. Similarly, multinational companies will need to implement plans to mitigate and adapt to climate change and prevent or prepare for any adverse effects produced by the climate crisis.\n\nissues that will need to be faced over the coming years.\n\nWith this in mind, next year the Company will perform an analysis of its portfolio, hotel by hotel, within the scope of its global integration process. The purpose of this is to understand the climate risks that each hotel asset is exposed to and to design an informed and robust transition plan that minimises the potential financial impacts. Along these same lines, the first double materiality assessment will be performed to determine the sustainability\n\n**3.

GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### **Working together towards a culture of cybersecurity**\n\nCybersecurity is one of the most relevant and important issues on the agendas of governing bodies at companies all over the world right now. This is reflected in the *Global Risks Report 2023*, published by the *World Economic Forum*, which clearly highlighted cyberattacks as one of the emerging risks with the greatest short-term and medium-term impact. For managing directors in Spain, cyberattacks are second on their list of concerns, only surpassed by their worries regarding the ever-changing economic climate.\n\nNew regulatory frameworks require companies to develop cybersecurity prevention models, alongside specific training plans on these matters, to inform employees about the importance of using both systems and data in an appropriate manner.\n\nThe exponential and global growth of digitisation in companies and the transition towards a hybrid working model, driven by the pandemic, has significantly changed the landscape of cyber threats, as an increase in interconnectivity inevitably leads to greater vulnerability. This has triggered greater awareness among organisations regarding the risks of a potential cyber attack.\n\nMeliá Hotels International prioritises cyber security in all its operations, as it does in its relationships with various stakeholders. Indeed, it is one of the top 5 risks on our 2023 Risk Map.\n\n### **Robust governance for efficient and consolidated management**\n\nGRI: 2-23; 2-24; 3-3\n\nAt Meliá Hotels International we are firmly committed to tackling risks related to information security. It is for this reason that we have developed a series of regulations contained within the global *Information Security Policy*, which is based on the international **ISO 27001** standard and is implemented alongside the principles of the **Good Governance Code for Cybersecurity** from the CNMV. It was approved by the Board of Directors in 2017 and updated in October. The purpose of this Policy is to establish security objectives and critical areas, ensuring compliance with the necessary levels of protection and the principles of confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity and online traceability, in line with the Meliá strategy.\n\nThe Policy applies to the Company and to its Group, including all employees and partners who work with Meliá, regardless of their position or role they perform, and it may extend to any other natural or legal person related to the group in any way, such as suppliers, stakeholders or third parties who need to process information or use Meliá information systems. The Company is responsible for motivating and training all members of the organisation to ensure they are aware of and comply with this Policy, and it also makes said Policy available to interested parties through its website.\n\nThe Company has implemented a robust governance model regarding this matter, with the Board of Directors as the main body responsible for supervising the application of this Policy, periodically assessing its effectiveness, adopting suitable measures to resolve any shortcomings and making any changes it deems necessary.\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\nCONTENTS The Board of Directors assigns the Audit and Compliance Committee with the responsibility of supervising and ensuring compliance with the principles and commitments established by this Policy, with support from the Cybersecurity Committee, as the body responsible for adopting any relevant resolution related to information security that may substantially affect the Company's activities, while continuously monitoring the commitments and principles established in this Policy. This Committee will report directly to senior management and the Board of Directors on matters of cybersecurity.\n\n> Furthermore, given the importance of this issue, the Board of Directors shall be updated annually on cybersecurity matters, with the support of expert advisers from this field, along with the *professional expertise of Carina Szpilka Lázaro*, an independent adviser who has worked with Meliá Hotels International since March 2016, offering extensive professional experience in the field of technology.\n\nThe organisational structure of this area has been enhanced by new profiles and teams, to minimise any negative impacts within this field. María Baeza, the *Head of Security*, is responsible for coordinating, monitoring and ensuring the implementation of and compliance with regulations, processes and procedures related to information system security, both in relation to company employees and any other actors within our value chain, such as suppliers, subcontractors and third parties.\n\n**INFORMATION SECURITY GOVERNANCE**\n\nThe guiding principles that shape our Information Security Policy are concentrated around the following matters:\n\n#### **GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF THE INFORMATION SECURITY POLICY**\n\nImage /page/96/Figure/8 description: The image shows a pyramid-shaped diagram illustrating different levels of security measures. At the top of the pyramid is \"Good Governance and Cybersecurity Committee\". The next level down contains \"Protection of personal data and credit cards\" and \"Business continuity and backups\". The next level contains \"Audit and compliance\", \"IT Damage and Security Incident Management\", and \"Access management and proper use of technological resources\". The bottom level contains \"Information classification and document management\", \"Prevention of information leakage\", \"Training and awareness raising\", and \"Supply chain security\".\n\nThe Policy is also reinforced by the System Security Regulation, approved by the Executive Committee in September 2020. The purpose of this regulation is to establish the security criteria and principles that govern the protection of information at Meliá Hotels International and cover the following aspects:\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nImage /page/96/Figure/11 description: The image shows three sections describing the roles of different groups in cybersecurity. The first section, titled \"Cybersecurity Committee,\" states that it makes decisions on cybersecurity, follows up on established commitments and principles, and reports to Senior Management.

To manage and guarantee this protection, we have put in place all the structures, security plans and control mechanisms that are required in line with the current legislation and regulations of each country. This Policy is available to all interested parties on our *company website*.\n\n### **Centralised management**\n\nGRI: 3-3\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThanks to the good practices implemented in relation to cybersecurity, we are able to respond quickly and safely to the demands and risks in our environment. The aim is for all stakeholders to be able to take advantage of the optimal security guarantees offered by our work centres.\n\nMeliá Hotels International offers a Security Operations Centre (SOC), with support from our technology partner. The SOC supervises and manages cybersecurity at a global level, through security prevention, monitoring and control in all our various technological environments. The goal is to detect, analyse and resolve security incidents, and to do this we rely on specialised tools and services that enable us to monitor all the security incidents that have been reported.\n\nFrom this centre we also analyse activity on networks, servers, databases, applications and websites in search of any anomalies that may indicate an incident or a threat to security. If an anomaly is identified, the SOC will help to provide a specific response based on our action plans, to ensure that any potential security incidents are identified, assessed, blocked and reported appropriately.\n\nBelow we have listed some of the specific capacities of our SOC and its scope of management/responsibility:\n\nImage /page/98/Figure/14 description: The image shows a diagram of SOC (Security Operations Center) services. The word \"SOC\" is in the center of the diagram. Surrounding the word \"SOC\" are the words \"SISAP Sistemes Aplicativos\". Radiating outward from the center are the following services: Report, Monitoring of Security and Suspicious Activity, Risk and Vulnerability Management, Cyberthreats, Bitsight/Third-Party Risks, PCI DSS, Malware Detection, Antispam, SDWAN, Managed Security, Threat Intelligence, and Cloud MSS.\n\n**CAPACITIES OF OUR SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTRE (SOC)**\n\n### **Guaranteed cloud solutions (Cloud MSS)**\n\nCloud solutions provide the necessary security measures to ensure technological alignment with data security, risk management and regulatory compliance. We perform regular security reviews on our various solutions across all divisions, starting with the most critical.\n\nThe objective of these reviews is to periodically and systematically ensure that all the security controls are aligned within each environment, measure any identified risks, and establish and implement specific action plans.\n\n{99}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/99/Picture/1 description: The image shows a house icon next to the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\".\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n### CONTENTS **Maximum security in the supply chain (Bitsight/third-party risks)**\n\nAfter developing a new platform for suppliers, which the Company implemented in order to streamline the procurement process for products, goods and services throughout the supply chain, as part of our supplier contract management system we analyse security requirements in terms of access to data and/or technological environments.\n\nThe key objective of this analysis was to ensure compliance with the Company's regulatory framework. We also implemented a framework for managing technological risks with third parties, providing visibility and allowing us to verify information security indexes and technological environments throughout the entire supply chain.\n\n### **Personal data protection in payment systems (PCI DSS)**\n\nIn line with the organisation's commitment to protect and manage credit card information, in 2023, for the thirteenth year running, we renewed the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for booking environments.\n\nWe also applied best security practices to ensure that all the different payment methods offered to customers function correctly.\n\n## **Contingency plans against cyberattacks**\n\nGRI: 418-1\n\nIn 2023 we did not detect nor were we informed of any cyberattack, but Meliá Hotels International does have a procedure in place that establishes the necessary steps and individuals responsible for communicating, managing and recording any security incidents. The primary objective of this procedure is to minimise the impact of any potential incidents and avoid loss of or damage to any data that has been entrusted to the Company.\n\nThis procedure must be followed by everyone within the Company, including any internal and external employees who may have access to data and information that is under our care at Meliá.\n\nWe did not receive any customer complaints this year related to privacy violations, nor did we receive any reports through our whistleblower channel or via any other means. Similarly, we did we identify any leaks, theft or loss of customer data.\n\nTraining and employee awareness of cybersecurity matters is one of our key defences against emerging risks and ongoing cyberattacks. This compulsory training is provided on a yearly basis and is a key lever within the scope of cybersecurity and PCI to minimise and contain risks.\n\n0.8 (2022: 0.9) **CYBERSECURITY TRAINING** \n\n**INFORMATION SECURITY TRAINING (HOURS PER PERSON)**\n\nImage /page/99/Picture/15 description: The image shows the number of employees, which is 4,934.\n\nImage /page/99/Picture/16 description: The image shows the text \"PCI TRAINING (EMPLOYEES)\" in green, above the number \"3,266\" in gray.\n\nImage /page/99/Picture/17 description: The image shows the text \"GDPR TRAINING (EMPLOYEES)\" in green, above the number \"11,514\" in gray.\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nImage /page/99/Figure/19 description: The image contains the words \"TRAINING SNIPPETS (USERS)\" in a teal color.

Each of the snippets focuses on different topics related to cybersecurity, such as secure passwords, phishing, the use of corporate accounts and devices, public WiFi, protecting your devices and managing incidents, among others.\n\nIn line with the contingency plan against cyberattacks, audits are carried out every year to assess the security, effectiveness and good practices of the Company's computer systems, which are crucial for carrying out day-to-day tasks and operations within the organisation. Below you will find the life cycle implemented at Meliá Hotels International for managing and responding to security incidents, which we put into action with the help of our technological partner.\n\n#### **1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nImage /page/100/Figure/5 description: The image shows a diagram of a four-step process.

GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\nThroughout 2023, the Company continued responding to all the challenges that arose during the pandemic, some of which even intensified this year as a result of both global and local factors.\n\nHowever, we have a long way to go before we can return to the normality we knew a few years ago. We are still suffering from product and raw material shortages, which is a constant challenge for numerous industries. Factors such as production interruptions, transport problems and demand fluctuations contribute towards the unavailability of certain goods, which has a direct impact on the supply chain of international hotel companies like ours.\n\nFuel price increases, port congestion, transport limitations and geopolitical challenges lead to incertitude in our value chain as they affect the margins of companies, producers, distributors and consumers, and have a significant impact on the hotel sector specifically. At a global level, this leads to higher financial and logistics costs, which, aggravated by increased inflation rates, triggers price increases and reduced operating margins.\n\n### **ESG risk management**\n\nGRI: 308-2; 407-1; 408-1; 409-1\n\nAt Meliá, we work continually to identify and monitor potential short-term and medium-term risks that we may be exposed to in the various geographical areas where we operate that require constant attention, such as the price of commodities, a direct risk that may considerably impact our supply chain.\n\nIn 2018, Meliá Hotels International performed an exhaustive analysis of the risks related to its supply chain, which has served as the basis for the unique monitoring and control process carried out on a regular basis in countries with a particularly high level of risk. The purpose of this analysis is to determine the risk level of our key suppliers according to ESG criteria (environmental, social and governmental), where we evaluate all issues related to human rights, occupational health and safety, talent, diversity, vulnerability, adaptive capacity to climate change, availability of natural resources, biodiversity, institutional relations and corruption. This analysis provides greater visibility on our level of exposure to ESG risks in the countries where we operate, enabling us to put in place the necessary measures to minimise their impact and occurrence.\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n{102}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/102/Figure/2 description: This image shows an ESG risk map of the world, with different countries colored according to their risk level. The risk levels are: very low risk, low risk, medium risk, high risk, and very high risk. There is a legend that shows the colors associated with each risk level. The image also shows the total number of tier 1 suppliers, critical tier 1 suppliers, and non-critical tier 1 suppliers. The total number of tier 1 suppliers is 6,548 (2022: 6,633). The number of critical tier 1 suppliers is 18 (2022: 20). The number of non-critical tier 1 suppliers is 54 (2022: 164).\n\n#### **5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nFor 2024, the Company has planned to launch a new risk assessment for all the countries identified as critical, to bring the 2018 exercise up to date.\n\nWe have also dedicated financial and human resources to consolidating our technological tool in Spain, preparing future facilities in our key markets (France, Italy, the UK, Germany, Mexico and the Dominican Republic) and designing an evaluation model that, with technological support, we hope to launch in Spain and the Dominican Republic during the first quarter of next year.\n\nThis tool will enable us to strengthen the due diligence that the company already adopts for governance, *compliance*, financial and operational matters when onboarding suppliers, to evaluate alignment levels and their commitment to environmental and social issues, thus enhancing supplier profiles.\n\n{103}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **Supply chain governance**\n\nties on the company website.\n\nGRI: 2-23; 2-24; 2-25; 3-3; 308-1; 414-1\n\nThe *Purchasing and Service Procurement Policy* is a regulatory framework that integrates our key commitments related to the procurement of goods and services and guides our commercial practices, guaranteeing not only operational efficiency, but also responsibility and sustainability throughout our entire supply chain.\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.

This policy was approved\n\nThe company recognises the importance of promoting solid and ethical supplier relations based on trust, respect and mutual commitment, continuously meeting all obligations related to compliance with internal regulations at\n\nMeliá, particularly the standards established in the *Supplier Code of Ethics.*\n\nby the Board of Directors in July 2020 and is available for all interested par-\n\nWe expect our suppliers to commit to actively promoting and respecting the principles of the United Nations Global Compact on human rights, labour and the fight against child labour, exploitation of labour and forced labour. In response to environmental pressures and the struggle against climate change, we expect our suppliers to procure clean products, equipment, services and technology, promote good practices that support the fight against climate change, and sign the mandatory sustainability clause.\n\nImage /page/103/Figure/14 description: The image shows a diagram outlining ethical and sustainability commitments. It includes the following points: \"Comply with legislation\", \"Do not tolerate slavery\", \"Prohibition of child labour\", \"Freedom of opinion and association\", \"Ensure safe working environments\", \"Respect for the environment\", \"Non-discrimination\", \"Do not tolerate abuse or coercion\", \"Responsible supply chain\", and \"Fair wage\". Additionally, the image presents data on \"SUPPLIER CODE OF ETHICS SIGNATURES/ACCEPTANCES\" with a current value of 2,493 (2022: 1,881) and a 2024 target of 100%.

While our contract with the supplier is in force, we may also request documentation to demonstrate that the supplier is complying with the commitments they have accepted and, in the case of non-compliance, request termination of the contract, without prejudice to any other appropriate compensation.\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023 As part of its desire to promote and reinforce supplier relationships based on dialogue and seamless communication, the Company has established direct and two-way communication channels at a frequency that it deems appropriate, according to the characteristics of the supplier.\n\n> It has also developed an incident-management model based on a ticketing system, for receiving notifications related to the provision of the contracted service. This channel is provided to users both to accommodate new requirements for the service and to report any incidents, recording all related information and response times, and assigning a responsible party to manage the incident until it is resolved. The entire process is logged on the platform. This channel is currently in the implementation phase and will be available at all hotels that have the appropriate tool.\n\n### **Commitment to excellence and sustainability**\n\nGRI: 3-3; 308-2; 414-2\n\nWith the current global climate and the worldwide presence of Meliá Hotels International, it is more important than ever to not only have a supply chain that is resilient and efficient, but to consolidate a robust model, optimise all our processes and move towards a management system that is based on excellence, sustainability and digitisation.\n\nThe considerable advances we have made in supplier management not only reflect our commitment to quality and efficiency in the procurement of goods and services, but also highlight our responsibility towards sustainability, ethics and strong partnerships throughout our supply chain. These pillars are key to our success and help us to make a positive contribution both to the business community and to the global environment in which we operate. Our management model is based on the pillars shown in this graphic.\n\n#### **PURCHASING STRATEGY**\n\nImage /page/104/Figure/10 description: The image shows a diagram with text descriptions around a semi-circle. The text descriptions are: \"Digital transformation to ensure greater agility, control and efficiency in our processes.\", \"Investment in training and the development of digital skills.\", \"Integration of sustainability criteria in the selection and evaluation of suppliers.\", and \"Excellence in the operating model to maximise savings and service quality, both in the purchase of goods and in contracting services.\"\n\n{105}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3. GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY**\n\nCONTENTS This transformation of our purchasing management model has enabled us to move towards a vision based on an ordering process with a focus on supplier management, approval and contracting, with the aim of consolidating an efficient, robust, agile and digital model that integrates global management of products, goods and services.\n\n> We have also incorporated sustainability factors into the supplier profile, to ensure that they are in line with our expectations in this area. In addition, with the new model we have modified product and service sheets to include attributes related to ESG parameters, along with packaging information.\n\n> With the aim of furthering the commitment we made in 2020 to purchase free-range eggs, the Company now consumes only this type of product at all its hotels in Germany, Austria, Holland and the United Kingdom. To meet the target we set ourselves for 2025, we will focus our efforts on all our hotels located throughout Spain and the rest of Europe, within the scope of global integration.\n\n> Our management model also extends to all suppliers and actors in our value chain who work in or provide services to any of our business units, with the following obligations:\n\n- All suppliers, contractors or other entities that provide services to our facilities must abide by our Occupational Health and Safety Policy.\n- Preventive criteria must be incorporated into work, service and supply contracts, with the appropriate channels being provided for business coordination on this matter.\n- Coordination measures must be followed to avoid any accidents at the Company's facilities.\n- All third parties must be informed about risks and preventive measures.\n\nWith the implementation of our tool in Spain, we have significantly improved several elements of our management model:\n\n- Data analysis is carried out with a comprehensive vision of expenses, deepening our awareness in various dimensions.\n- Processes have now been automated, making them faster, more accessible and more efficient for users.\n- The interface improves hotel operations and supplier relations.\n\nadapted to each hotel and destination's specific circumstances.\n\n• We are able to expand the range of services available to all areas of the Company.\n\nWith its broad portfolio of suppliers, the Company can now offer a value proposition to our owners and partners at destinations such as Europe and the Caribbean, providing a comprehensive best-in-class service that is\n\n53.64 (2022: 59.91) **COUPA SAP SCOPE (IG)**\n\n**AVERAGE SUPPLIER PAYMENT PERIOD (IG)**\n\nImage /page/105/Picture/16 description: The image shows the number 61 in a light gray color, followed by the text '(48% of portfolio)' in a smaller font size and the same light gray color.\n\nSCURA GAP SCORE (HOTEL)\n\n#### **COUPA SAP SCOPE (HOTEL MANAGEMENT)**\n\nImage /page/105/Picture/19 description: The image shows the number 54 in a large font, followed by the text '(33% of portfolio)' in a smaller font.\n\nImage /page/105/Picture/20 description: The image shows the percentage of local purchases.

COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe consumption of fossil fuels has led to an increase in the level of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing towards an acceleration in global warming, rising sea levels and ocean acidification, among other issues. This triggers more frequent extreme natural phenomena, which impact the sustainability of the planet and consequently society as a whole.\n\nClimate change is one of the most significant challenges that humanity is facing in present times. It is important to act now and combine forces to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and meet the obligations undertaken by the states that signed the Paris Agreement. To do this we need to adopt policies and make investments that enable us to meet our targets over the next ten years and avoid passing the threshold of 1.5ºC, as proposed at the last Climate Change Conference in 2023 (COP28), where it was suggested that all parties progressively reduce their use of carbon-based energy, move towards energy systems with net-zero emissions, triple global capacity of renewable energy and eliminate inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, among other key points.\n\nAlong these lines, within its corporate strategy, Meliá has included a commitment to make further progress in the fight against climate change, minimising its environmental impact. This is in addition to the obligation it has undertaken to tackle the risks and opportunities resulting from climate change, strengthening its risk-based culture and long-term financial performance.\n\n### **Governance of climate change and the environment**\n\nGRI: 2-23; 2-24; 2-25; 3-3\n\nThe aim of our *Climate Change and Environment Policy*, which was approved in 2017 and updated in 2021 by our Board of Directors, is to establish our action principles at Meliá Hotels International and the Group as a whole in relation to its commitment to combat climate change and protect the environment, promoting efficient, responsible and sustainable management throughout its value chain.\n\nIn terms of its scope, compliance is compulsory and it applies globally and directly to all corporate offices and business units managed by Meliá. The contents of the policy are established as a minimum requirement, without prejudice to any additional and specific regulations that may be approved related to this issue.\n\nIt was reviewed within the scope of our *Roadto2024* Strategic Plan, as part of a lever focused on the decarbonisation of our business model, in order to ourselves with the Paris Agreement. Along these lines, Meliá has incorporated into its strategy a commitment to move forward with this transition, with the conviction to integrate sustainability and climate change into our investment decisions and hotel assets, making them more sustainable and resilient.\n\n### **Risks and opportunities resulting from climate change**\n\nGRI: 2-23; 2-24; 2-25; 3-3; 201-2; 203-1; 203-2\n\nOur Global Risk Map identifies the primary risks that we face as a Company. The map is reviewed on an annual basis and the results are submitted to the Audit and Compliance Committee, whose responsibilities involve supervising the risk management systems, including those covered by the acronym ESG.\n\nIn the specific case of risks related to climate change, the \"Natural catastrophes or disasters\" risk, which refers to damage to physical assets or interruption of operations as a result of extreme climate events, is number 11 in the Company's list of top 20 risks. This risk has climbed to a higher position than in 2022, which demonstrates the Company's awareness of its exposure to climate events, as well as the conclusions reached in the study carried out by the TCFD.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4. COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nTherefore, and in line with future regulations that will require sustainability reports to include an estimate of the financial impact of climate change-related risks, this vision has become even more relevant and encourages us to update and improve the analysis of climate risks associated with our property portfolio in 2024.\n\n### **Climate scenarios and scope**\n\nThe exhaustive analysis of the climate risks included in the Global Risk Map served as the starting point for identifying their impact on our activities in four main geographical areas, selected for their present and future strategic relevance: Spain, Mexico, the Dominican Republic and the United Kingdom.\n\nWithin this scope, in 2021 we identified risks and opportunities related to climate change in line with the guidelines issued by the *Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)*. This process involved studying various climate scenarios, taking into account different pathways, both physical and socioeconomic, as well as climate scenario models, primarily the following: *Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) or the International Energy Agency (IEA)*.\n\nAfter combining the RCP and SSP pathways established by the IPCC, we took four specific climate scenarios and used them to perform a risk and opportunity analysis that met the TCFD technical criteria and was in line with our own commitments in this area.\n\nOf the four scenarios, we prioritised the risk and opportunity analysis on the scenario involving a society with intermediate sustainable development that manages to prevent its temperature from increasing by over 2 ºC by the end of the century: scenario SSP2 – RCP 2.6. This scenario is in line with our emission reduction targets, which were approved by the *Science Based Target Initiative* (SBTi), and is also in tune with the objective to prevent the global temperature from increasing beyond 1.5 ºC.\n\n### **Identifying and assessing risks and opportunities**\n\nOur process for identifying and assessing risks is structured around four clearly differentiated stages:\n\n- Establishing and evaluating our value chain.\n- Establishing and classifying our universe of risks and opportunities. During this stage, we also analysed current and future regulatory requirements for the four selected geographical areas.\n- Selecting climate scenarios.\n- Assessing climate risks and opportunities based on impact, probability of occurrence and time horizon.\n\nThe valuation scales and time horizons used have been established to adapt, on the one hand, to the terminology employed in the global risk assessment and, on the other hand, to the timescale of the expected impacts according to the selected scenario and the service life of our various infrastructures. The maximum time horizon we used for this analysis was 2050.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **Climate risk matrix and ranking**\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nOur map identifies 26 climate risks, divided into 9 physical risks and 17 transition risks. The most significant, according to their severity value (probability x impact), are those of a physical nature, both current and medium-term. Furthermore, 65% of the transition risks identified are likely to materialise in current times or in the near future. This initial step, carried out in 2021, will serve as the basis to reveal the climate risks that will affect each hotel asset, leading to a more sustainable and resilient portfolio.\n\n**3**\n\n**4**\n\n**6**\n\n**7**\n\n**2**\n\n**1**\n\n[10](#page-10-10) [11](#page-10-11)\n\n**Unknown N/A**\n\n**Physical risks Transition risks**\n\n### **1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n### **2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.

COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### CONTENTS **Plan to mitigate climate change**\n\nGRI: 2-23; 2-24; 2-25; 3-3; 305-5; 305-7\n\nAs a leader in sustainability within the hotel sector, we have made firm commitments to further adapt our business and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. In 2021, we reaffirmed our emission-reduction targets, in line with the *Science Based Targets* initiative (SBTi), to prevent the global temperature from increasing beyond 1.5 ºC. We are establishing and implementing various initiatives to help us reach two different targets by certain dates: a reduction of 29.4% by 2025 and a reduction of 71.4% by 2035, with respect to the base year of 2018.\n\nWithin this context, as part of its Responsible Business Strategy, Meliá has made the following commitments:\n\n- Adapt to climate change: Respond to the risks and opportunities resulting from climate change.\n- Mitigate climate change: Combat climate change and minimise our environmental impact and footprint, recognising the potential impact on tourist destinations.\n\nThe European Climate Law, approved in June 2021, establishes Europe's target to become climate-neutral by 2050 and provides a framework that will further efforts to adapt to the impacts of climate change, requiring all member states to put in place strategies and plans to adapt and mitigate their carbon footprint.\n\nIn our sector, the greatest potential for carbon lock-in is concentrated in hotel infrastructure. The acquisition of fossil-fuel-intensive assets could slow down our progress towards a decarbonised business model. At Meliá we are aware of this situation and it is for this reason that the management team in our Real Estate Department has been set an objective to reduce our emissions and make progress on the commitment we have made.\n\nIn line with the Company's vision, the design and construction manuals for the various brands in the portfolio include the integration of sustainable criteria into any new construction projects, renovations or major refurbishments that we carry out each year, and we raise awareness among our partners on the importance of designing assets where sustainability is a standard. As such, we incorporate the following into our investments: efficient facilities, the use of renewable energies or the generation of green energies, and the use of materials that help to reduce consumption and protect the environment.\n\nOur decarbonisation plan requires the management of two different scenarios in our portfolio. Firstly, there is the scenario mentioned above, with major construction and renovation projects, and then we have the other, involving hotels that are already in operation, with no investment planned in the near future.\n\nImage /page/111/Picture/12 description: The image shows the 2035 emission-reduction target for scope 1 and 2, which is 71.4% versus the base year of 2018.\n\n**2025 EMISSION-REDUCTION TARGET SCOPE 1 AND 2**\n\n(versus base year of 2018) 29.4%\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Company has identified three key levers that will enable us to move towards decarbonising our business model:\n\n• **Optimising energy consumption**\n\nEnergy efficiency plays a major role in reducing carbon emissions. These measures effectively contribute towards reducing emissions by limiting the amount of energy required for different activities, which makes us less reliant on fossil fuels and reduces overall carbon intensity.\n\n• **Migration towards renewable energy sources**\n\nRenewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydraulic and geothermal, generate electricity without producing greenhouse gases. As opposed to fossil fuels, which emit CO2 and other pollutants when they are burned to produce energy, renewable energy sources significantly reduce emissions.\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n### CONTENTS • **Raising awareness of our value chain**\n\nThe objective to reduce scope-3 emissions is without a doubt one of our greatest challenges in the struggle against climate change. To achieve this, it is essential that we involve our customers and all the key actors in our value chain. We are convinced that the right path to meeting our commitments is by raising awareness through a range of products and services that offer sustainable options to our stakeholders.\n\nFor each of the decarbonisation levers mentioned above, we have launched a series of projects related to the objective and the identified risks.\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.

In 2018, the emissions scope 2 (SBTi) was 361,101. In 2023, the emissions scope 2 (SBTi) was 299,804. The intensity ratio per stay emissions scope 2 (SBTi) decreased by -17% from 2018 to 2023, with a value of 0.011 in 2023.\n\n**Optimising energy consumption**\n\nGRI: 302-1; 302-3; 302-4; 302-5\n\n### **Environmental management system (SAVE)**\n\nDesigned internally by our engineers in 2007, according to ISO 14001 Environmental Management criteria, and updated most recently in 2019, this management system integrates new requirements, ensures constant analysis of our management and that of our technical service teams, and reinforces the importance of measuring and managing environmental indicators related to energy and water consumption and waste production at a global level.\n\nImage /page/112/Picture/17 description: The image shows the text 'EMISSIONS REDUCTION SCOPE 1 AND 2' in green font at the top. Below this text is a large number '19.6%' in gray font. Underneath the percentage is the text '(Target 21%)' in gray font.\n\nThis system also enables us to analyse detailed information from various operational departments in our hotels and identify improvement opportunities, in addition to monitoring our progress towards meeting the annual targets we have set ourselves. Once the opportunities have been identified, we carry out technical and economic viability studies to prioritise those investments that have a greater impact at an environmental and economic level.\n\n### **Sustainable tourism certifications**\n\nIn 2023, we relaunched our hotel certification processes, focusing on those entities renowned throughout Spain and the rest of the world, and endorsed by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) or the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC). Each hotel receives its own individual certification, enabling us to identify improvement opportunities and establish an action plan to improve its positioning and reputation with respect to sustainability, an attribute that is of major importance to customers and tourism intermediaries these days.\n\nOur choice of partner has helped to provide greater consistency to our model, providing both internal and external benchmarking, with other comparable hotels that offer similar products and services, and giving us the opportunity to promote improvements and opportunities for our business. We have certified 110 owned or leased hotels, plus 29 managed hotels.\n\n\\*The company's entire portfolio of owned, leased and managed properties.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\n| ENVIRONMENTAL CERTIFICATIONS |     |\n|------------------------------|-----|\n| AMERICA                      | 8   |\n| EMEA                         | 42  |\n| SPAIN                        | 60  |\n| TOTAL                        | 110 |\n\nBuilding and running sustainable buildings continues to be a key element in the environmentally friendly management of our hotels.

This initiative was complemented by a report that detailed the Company's entire inventory of energy consuming equipment, with key technical properties such as power or year of manufacture, to monitor the life cycle of equipment and facilities.\n\nImprovement opportunities and energy saving measures were also identified for each hotel. All of this information enables us to prioritise and plan investments, reduce our consumption in the short and medium term, and extend the service life of our facilities.\n\n### **CO2PERATE Project**\n\nSince its launch in 2019, the primary objective of this project has been to optimise energy consumption from air conditioning. By integrating artificial intelligence into cooling systems, this system allows the systems to adapt their consumption to operational and thermal needs on a given day, improving control and management of the main energy-consuming installations.\n\nDue to its success, this initiative has now also been implemented in numerous hotels managed by Meliá, with a total of 16 hotels now using this technology.\n\n| GLOBAL INTEGRATION |       | 2020      | 2021      | 2022       | 2023      |\n|--------------------|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------|\n| Hotels             | #     | 87        | 85        | 81         | 69        |\n| Savings            | €M    | 0.5       | 1         | 1.9        | 1.2       |\n| Energy savings     | kWh   | 5,085,267 | 9,505,337 | 12,626,675 | 8,140,432 |\n| Emissions avoided  | TnCO2 | 2,809     | 3,951     | 4,172      | 2,791     |\n\nImage /page/113/Picture/18 description: The image shows the percentage of hotels with energy certifications in Spain.

This initiative uses technology to calculate the carbon footprint of our MICE segment (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions), a niche market that is expected to close the year with a total turnover of around 12 billion euros.\n\nDeveloped in partnership with the technology company Creast, which specialises in measuring, reducing and offsetting the environmental impact of events, the project calculates emissions at two crucial moments: the quoting stage and the end of the event. The tool is connected to and integrated into the hotel management systems and enables measurements to be made based on the specific details of each hotel, taking the consumption data and the hotel surface area (m<sup>2</sup>) and then applying each country's emission factor to calculate the carbon footprint for scopes 1 and 2.\n\nAs a new addition, all menus have now been updated to include the footprint per product, giving us a view of a scope 3 category, providing detailed information of the carbon footprint behind each menu.\n\nOur commitment is to offset the entire carbon footprint, whether that be directly through Meliá Hotels International or the customer, if they decide to offset in projects of their choice. The emissions generated in the 198 events measured during the development of the technological tool were offset at the beginning of 2024, to reach the figure of 372 TnCO2.\n\nThis initiative was developed to find improvement opportunities that would help us towards the goal of achieving carbon neutrality in events and to respond to increasing demand from professionals in the sector. We aim to implement this initiative in approximately 40 hotels over the next two years.\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/116/Picture/1 description: The image shows a house icon next to the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\".\n\n### CONTENTS **The Planet We Love**\n\nhouse gas emissions.\n\nextended throughout our value chain.\n\nA project launched worldwide in June 2021 with the aim of involving customers in the fight against climate change.

The logo for ClimateTrade is also visible, indicating a partnership or commitment to carbon offsetting or climate action.\n\n**Adapting our economic activities to mitigate or adapt to climate change**\n\nThe analysis carried out internally, following the recent publication of the activities associated with the last four environmental objectives included in the European Union's Environmental Taxonomy, which expressly include economic activity - 2.1 Hotels, resorts, campsites and similar accommodations - leads us to conclude that the alignment which may exist between our economic activities and the objectives to mitigate and adapt to climate change, which classifies the investments and economic activities resulting from our activity as sustainable, is neither significant nor material.\n\nImage /page/116/Picture/13 description: The image shows the text \"OFFSET EMISSIONS (TNCO2) 379 (2022: 441)\". The words \"OFFSET EMISSIONS\" are in green, and the number 379 is in a larger font size than the other text.\n\nThis review and classification process has been carried out over the past three years under the parameters of six objectives: mitigation of and adaptation to climate change; sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; transition to a circular economy; prevention and control of pollution; and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. The process determines that the most appropriate decision shall be to focus all of our efforts and economic and human resources on analysing our alignment with the objective related to biodiversity, its protection and its restoration, a decision that will be understood by analysts and investors, as well as by our customers and society as a whole.\n\n{117}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **Our results**\n\nGRI: 302-1; 302-3; 302-4\n\nABOUT THIS\nREPORT\n\n#### **ENERGY TABLE**\n\n|                                                            | INDICATOR                                                         | UNIT                 | 2020       | 2021       | 2022       | 2023       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                                                            | Non-renewable fuels (A+B+C)                                       | GJ                   | 292,024    | 329,889    | 480,190    | 433,140    |\n| 1.

COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT CHANGE**\n\nWater resources are essential to ensure quality tourism activities, and for certain holiday destinations, water forms an intrinsic part of their appeal. The sustainability of these destinations where we operate is affected by the availability and enjoyment of this element. At Meliá we are well aware of the importance of responsible water consumption.\n\nThat is why the first step in any management system always involves under-\n\nstanding the situation with this resource and its availability in our portfolio.\n\nOn an annual basis, we analyse the location of all the hotels we manage to determine whether they are located in areas suffering from water stress, using the Acueduct Water Risk Atlas tool.\n\nThis exercise provides us with greater visibility of our portfolio located in high-risk areas and enables us to establish strategies to promote a culture of risk management and develop action plans to mitigate this risk in the short term.\n\n**LOCATION OF HOTELS IN WATER-STRESSED AREAS (OWNED AND LEASED)**\n\nImage /page/118/Figure/12 description: This image shows a world map with some countries highlighted in green. To the left of the map are the words \"4. COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\", \"5. SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\", and \"6. ANNEXES\". To the right of the map are two text boxes. The first text box says \"HOTELS IN WATER-STRESSED AREAS (IG)\" and the number \"52\" with \"(2022: 50)\" underneath. The second text box says \"HOTELS IN AREAS WITH RISK OF FLOODING (IG)\" and the number \"15\" with \"(2022: 18)\" underneath. In the middle of the map, there is a table with the following data: Spain 48, Mexico 2, Italy 1, Peru 1, Total 52.\n\n{119}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONTENTS To evaluate the risk of water stress and determine whether it is significant or not, we analyse our portfolio with a focus on two key parameters: probability and magnitude of impact. By combining both factors, we are able to calculate the potential financial impact of the risk of water stress.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4. COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nWe perform the probability evaluation in accordance with the results of the analysis, which assigns a score of 3.5 to hotels in high-risk areas and 4.5 points to hotels in extreme-risk areas.\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023 The magnitude of impact is determined by looking at each hotel located in a risk area and determining its importance to our business, based on business volume. If the financial impact is above the significance threshold (>3% of total annual turnover), it is determined that the hotel could have a significant impact on our performance.\n\n### **Water management system**\n\nAn essential part of our commitment to responsible consumption of water resources is the promotion of proactive water management and the implementation of measures to ensure efficient water consumption. The summer season sees the highest levels of water consumption, whether this be by residents or by visitors. This is also the period with the highest volumes of international tourism, with people visiting destinations that may be suffering from water scarcity or restrictions.\n\nIn 2023, certain regions suffered more intense levels of water stress than they had experienced in recent years. The Company is aware of its responsibility to further reduce its water footprint and implement measures to consume water more efficiently and responsibly in its hotels.\n\nBy continuously monitoring our consumption and controlling the operations at our facilities, we can reduce our water consumption and strengthen our commitment to guarantee responsible management of this resource. The investments we have made to improve our facilities and the good practices we share with our customers and partners are key pillars that contribute towards better water management.\n\nAt Meliá we also work with a tool that helps us to identify and analyse the primary operational risks associated with water extraction and spillages, which is a part of our Environmental Management System (SAVE). Aside from helping to ensure efficient water management, this tool is also able to anticipate potential risks and impacts, and ensure that our water is treated in accordance with existing regulations.\n\nThe majority of our business units have implemented various initiatives to mitigate water consumption, such as limiting water flow in taps and showers, which can reduce usage by up to 50%; installing dual-flush cisterns; informing customers about the frequency of washing towels and sheets; and replacing table cloths with disposable and recyclable alternatives.\n\n### **Magnum Project:** *platform for digital management of water footprint in tourism*\n\nNext Generation is an initiative launched to provide financial support to EU member states through loans given out between 2021 and 2026. The goal is to support investment and achieve resilient and sustainable recovery.\n\nAt Meliá we are constantly looking for ways we can contribute towards meeting the European Union's objectives. This drive led us to respond to the RETOS Programme's call for initiatives involving public-private partnerships that promote advances in scientific knowledge, with an innovative project focused on measuring and optimising global management of water footprints.\n\nThe aim of the project is to integrate BIM technology *(Building Information Modeling)* and artificial intelligence to manage water footprints. Its purpose is to improve the management of water footprints from different perspectives, as well as the implementation of operational recommendations in real time, enriching our data with disaggregated information on consumption, implementation of control systems, occupation and use of services and optimisation of operational management, among others, to enhance our water management from a global strategic and operational management point of view.\n\n{120}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4. COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe project has been designed with the support of a consortium of companies that specialise in the fields of management, water, data, technology and facilities, where every party takes on a specific role. Meliá acts as a promoter partner with a participation of 24%, and is supported by CETAQUA and IDP as technological partners (39% and 19% participation, respectively) and AQUATEC as a marketing partner (18% participation).\n\nThree hotels in Spain may participate in the project: Gran Meliá Palacio de Isora (Santa Cruz de Tenerife), Meliá Palma Marina (Palma de Mallorca) and Gran Meliá Don Pepe (Marbella).\n\nIn 2023, all efforts were concentrated on producing the prototype, according to the unique characteristics of Gran Meliá Palacio de Isora, a hotel that serves as a particularly complex case study due to the variety of water sources it uses. This hotel has already been digitally redesigned and recreated, and over the next few months technological devices will be installed to measure consumption in certain rooms and points in the hotel that consume the most water.\n\nFurthermore, as part of this project we have developed a tool that enables us to calculate the water footprint of materials purchased for carrying out our activities, enabling us to identify water-efficiency opportunities that we can incorporate into our purchasing processes. This also enables us to involve and inform our customers and partners of the importance of responsible water consumption.\n\nIncorporating technology will improve data collection and improve awareness of water consumption from various perspectives, enabling the implementation of operational recommendations in real time and visibility of data with disaggregated information on consumption.

In our case, considering our portfolio in global integration, our water mainly comes from public or private water suppliers (41%), fresh groundwater through wells (56%) and a very small amount of saltwater from desalination plants (3%). Well water is consumed primarily by our hotels in the Dominican Republic (51% of the total m3 consumed), as there is no other source of water available in this country.\n\nWastewater is discharged into the public sewer system (45%) or wastewater treatment plants (55%).\n\nIt is important to point out that no significant water spillages were reported in 2023.\n\n#### **2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\nImage /page/121/Figure/9 description: The image shows two graphs and a pie chart. The first graph shows the total water extraction from 2020 to 2023. In 2020, the total water extraction was 4,572. In 2021, the total water extraction was 5,654. In 2022, the total water extraction was 7,758. In 2023, the total water extraction was 8,578. The second graph shows the water use intensity ratio from 2020 to 2023. In 2020, the water use intensity ratio was 1.195. In 2021, the water use intensity ratio was 0.889. In 2022, the water use intensity ratio was 0.651. In 2023, the water use intensity ratio was 0.655. The pie chart shows the origin of the water. 56% of the water is taken from municipal water supply, and 3% is taken from other water utilities.\n\n### **WATER CONSUMPTION (IN THOUSAND M3)**\n\n#### **WATER CONSUMPTION BY SOURCE AND DISCHARGE BY DESTINATION**\n\nImage /page/121/Figure/12 description: The image shows two pie charts, one titled \"ORIGIN OF THE WATER\" and the other titled \"WATER DISCHARGE\". The \"ORIGIN OF THE WATER\" pie chart shows that 41% of the water is taken from municipal water supply (or other water utilities), 56% is extraction of fresh groundwater, and 3% is extraction of salt water. The \"WATER DISCHARGE\" pie chart shows that 45% of the water goes to public sewers and 55% goes to a treatment plant in the hotel.\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n{122}------------------------------------------------\n\n# CONTENTS **Management of biodiversity and ecosystems**GRI: 2-23; 2-24; 2-25; 3-3; 304-1; 304-2; 304-3\n\n#### ABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nTABLE OF\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4. COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, loss of biodiversity is the third greatest risk to the global economy in the medium term. This risk has been climbing the ranking since 2019 and is now approaching the same risk level of climate change and extreme weather phenomena. Over the next years, it is predicted that loss of capital will accelerate, with social, regulatory and financial demands and monitoring metrics related to this issue also increasing at the same time.\n\nIn the report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the United Nations highlighted the direct effects of human activities on the marine environment and the need to reduce our impact on endangered species. In relation to this, the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) published guidelines to help companies identify three different categories of risks: physical, transition and systemic.\n\nThe need to protect natural capital is becoming a requirement for companies, either because of the impact they may have on ecosystems, or because certain activities, such as tourism, make many destinations more attractive, a positive effect that also improves economic, social and environmental wellbeing.\n\nAt Meliá Hotels International, we are aware of the important role we play in material matters for our various stakeholders. Although biodiversity is currently only at a medium level of criticality, it is also associated with other more critical issues that require special attention due to their impact on ecosystems. These issues include waste management and the circular economy, responsible water management, promotion of a sustainable supply chain and climate action related to our activities.\n\n### **Our Commitment**\n\nDue to the unique location of some of our hotels, in 2017 the Board of Directors approved our Climate Change and Environment Policy, which established a series of principles to implement ethical, responsible and sustainable management, combat climate change by identifying opportunities to implement measures that help to protect biodiversity and habitats from the effects of climate change, and adopt measures to protect native fauna and flora by preserving biological diversity and the natural heritage of our tourist destinations.\n\nOne of our key focuses is to preserve ecosystems and protect native fauna and flora. We strive to mitigate the potential impact of our activities and to use natural resources in a responsible and efficient manner. As part of our commitment to biodiversity, we adopt measures that help in the struggle against climate change, minimise our impact and respond to the risks and opportunities resulting from said impact.\n\nWe look at biodiversity protection in a holistic manner, as a consequence of our Environmental Management System, which involves the design and construction of our hotels, the training of our teams and, finally, raising awareness among our customers.\n\nWe would like to move towards a hotel management model based on circularity, where we endeavour to reduce, recycle, reuse and/or progressively eliminate waste, while raising awareness and preserving our most valuable environments. Our current approach is mostly preventive, and we are well aware that in the near future we will need to take on a much more proactive role.\n\n{123}------------------------------------------------\n\n| TABLE OF<br>CONTENTS                      | SCOPE                         | PREVENTATIVE MANAGEMENT                                                                                                                                                                                                 |  |  |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|\n|                                           | Compliance                    | • Compliance with applicable urban planning and environmental regulations                                                                                                                                               |  |  |\n| ABOUT THIS<br>REPORT                      | Infrastructure<br>& equipment | • Design and construction under sustainable criteria<br>• Efficient lighting systems with a low-energy and light impact<br>• Design of gardens and wooded areas that respecting local diversity                         |  |  |\n| 1.

Our ESG Risk Map takes into consideration the protection of biodiversity and maritime and inland areas when incorporating new assets. Tourists are also becoming increasingly aware of environmental protection, preferring to stay in hotels that adopt sustainable practices, such as the use of renewable energies, the reduction of waste and the implementation of environmentally friendly practices.\n\nSome tour operators, such as Booking or Expedia, ask us to update our offer in relation to sustainability, in order to enhance the profile of our business units and attract customers who are willing to choose hotels based on other criteria and even pay a higher price. That is why we participate in the Booking Sustainability Programme, which offers the following advantages:\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.

This certification integrates areas related to water quality, environmental information and education, safety, services and facilities, and environmental management, with the goal of keeping beaches and marine environments in optimal condition. In 2023, all our hotels in the Dominican Republic and two of our hotels in Mexico renewed their certifications.\n\nThe beaches are also cleaned every day to keep them in good condition and we continuously maintain our green areas and gardens, taking care of the habitats for the species that live there, carrying out inspections and environmental monitoring of the water, noise and atmospheric quality, informing the public about the year-long fishing ban, and demonstrating our commitment to preserving biodiversity through firm actions.\n\nThe beaches in the Dominican Republic are affected by large colonies of natural floating macroalgae (Sargassum) that are transported by ocean currents and wash up on the shores. As a result of this natural phenomenon, we need to clean the beaches on a daily basis at certain times of the year to help preserve the marine ecosystem. Once removed, this algae is used as an organic fertiliser in the hotel gardens as it is fantastic for promoting plant growth and stimulating germination, and it is also an effective acidity and mineral regulator.\n\n| INDICATOR               | UNIT | 2022    | 2023    | DIFF.  |\n|-------------------------|------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Volume collected        | m3   | 1,541   | 1,400   | -9.1%  |\n| Mass                    | Kg   | 690,369 | 582,400 | -15.6% |\n| Landscaping (refilling) | m3   | 375     | 468     | 24.8%  |\n\n### **Special Protection Areas**\n\nGRI: 304-1; 304-2; 304-3\n\nMany of the primarily holiday-based destinations where we operate offer significant natural wealth. As such, we work particularly hard to care for and protect these environments. We also see it as our responsibility to inform our customers about this natural wealth, helping them to understand and respect it through specific initiatives. Our teams also of course receive training with assistance from expert organisations to ensure they respect the ecosystems we come into contact with on a daily basis.\n\nWe use Protected Planet, the world's most comprehensive source of information about protected areas, to annually update the analysis of our hotels located in special protection areas, or those located nearby (no more than 2 km for holiday resorts of 0.5 km for city hotels).\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\nCONTENTS Although all special protection areas should be protected, the areas we focus the most on, whether it be through positive direct impacts or by minimising potential negative impacts, are our holiday resorts. These ecosystems are actually a key part of the appeal of these destinations and the direct area of influence of our hotels, which are particularly attractive due to their natural capital. A great example of this are the Balearic Islands, with their protected land and maritime areas that are home to invaluable biodiversity and a number of specially protected species of birds.\n\n> The Company focuses on 6 areas with particularly high levels of risk and impact: Tenerife, the island of La Palma, Fuerteventura, Ibiza, Mexico and the Dominican Republic. We operate 24 hotels across these destinations, which make up 18.9% of our owned and leased portfolio.\n\nWe see Mexico and the Dominican Republic as particularly important destinations, which is why we have installed specialist sustainability teams to guarantee the protection of native species and local biodiversity.\n\nIn 2023, our portfolio of owned and leased hotels occupied an estimated total surface area of 2,858,628 m<sup>2</sup>, 25.3% of which are located in protected areas or near to special protection areas.\n\nWhen providing our services, we always endeavour to use sustainable products and materials: cellulose and furniture made with certified and guaranteed wood, and environmentally friendly cleaning products.\n\n**HOTELS IN PROTECTED AREAS**\n\nImage /page/125/Figure/8 description: The image shows a world map and a table with data about hotels and surface area. The table is divided into two categories: Urban and Leisure. Under the Urban category, there are 8 hotels in total with a surface area of 31,089. Germany has 4 hotels with a surface area of 5,154. Spain has 1 hotel with a surface area of 1,822. Italy has 1 hotel with a surface area of 1,100. Venezuela has 2 hotels with a surface area of 23,013. Under the Leisure category, there are 27 hotels in total with a surface area of 691,600. Spain has 21 hotels with a surface area of 375,811. Mexico has 6 hotels with a surface area of 315,789. The overall total is 35 hotels with a surface area of 722,689.\n\n{126}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4. COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### CONTENTS **Protection programmes**\n\nThe Company works hard to protect and preserve biodiversity, relying on the support of expert organisations in each field. In destinations where biodiversity is of particular importance, we form partnerships to ensure we meet our commitments. Below are two of our most notable initiatives:\n\n### **Welcome to Life**\n\nAward-winning programme for the protection and conservation of endangered species in Mexico. Since 2017, our partners, guests and their families have actively participated in the programme to learn about and protect biodiversity. To make this possible, we work alongside the government, local NGOs, suppliers and specialists in the management and monitoring of plant and animal species.\n\nWe also count on the support and participation of the local community, with volunteering activities and special events. Some of the key elements of the programme include training our teams on biodiversity protection, monitoring beach environments, relocating nests in risk areas, caring for hatchlings during their first five hours of life and recording the release of hatchlings for the birth census.\n\nIn Mexico we promote the Sea Turtle Protection Programme, to protect, conserve and recover this endangered species by protecting nests, promoting environmental awareness among our guests and employees, managing lighting, establishing nocturnal patrols to safeguard the nests, and ensuring that we comply with all applicable environmental regulations. Our dedication and hard work makes a significant contribution towards the preservation of this species.\n\nOur Paradisus Cancún and Meliá Cozumel hotels in the Mexican Caribbean actively participate in the conservation of sea turtles in the area and every year from May to November they launch an internal programme. In 2023, 160 guests, partners and local students volunteered to help us protect 250 nests and 26,973 eggs, and release 25,236 loggerhead sea turtle hatchlings (also known as Caretta caretta), figures that were confirmed by the local government and the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources.\n\nMeliá Puerto Vallarta and Paradisus Los Cabos also work to conserve and protect sea turtles, ensuring appropriate lighting on the beach to avoid distracting the hatchlings. In 2023, a total of 235 nests were protected, 22,571 eggs were relocated and a total of 13,665 hatchlings were released.\n\nAt Meliá, we recognise the importance of preserving bees, particularly in parts of the world with high levels of biodiversity. That is why, as part of the Welcome to Life project, Meliá Cozumel has formed an alliance with the Bee Friendly Cozumel Foundation, which has been recognised by the Government of Quintana Roo and the Secretariat of Environment. This initiative has led to the rescue of two honey-producing Mayan bee honeycombs within the hotel facilities. Throughout the course of the year, the hotel has collected over 620 kg of honey for consumption or use in its spa and wellness treatments.\n\n### **IMPACTS OF THE WELCOME TO LIFE PROJECT**\n\nImage /page/126/Figure/12 description: The image shows turtle conservation statistics for three resorts: Paradisus Cancun Resort, Paradisus Los Cabos, and ME Cabo. For Paradisus Cancun Resort, 6,500 turtles (White Loggerhead) are protected, and there are 1,256 volunteers (guests, staff, and students). For Paradisus Los Cabos, 13,000 turtles are released, 180 nests are protected, and 19,067 eggs are relocated. For ME Cabo, 11 turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) are protected, 2,855 hatchlings are released (+1,168 in situ), 37 turtle nests are protected (+13 nests in situ), and 1,454 eggs are relocated.\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **Environmental awareness**\n\nAs part of our drive to excel, we wanted to raise awareness about the importance of biodiversity in our most vulnerable environments. At two hotels in Mexico, we launched initiatives to raise awareness about the environment, involving 70 children in deprived areas from pre-school age to year 6 of primary school.\n\nAn environmental awareness presentation was given at the Dar Community Centre for the Niños de la Sierra, teaching them about sea turtles, their char-\n\nAt the end of the presentation, the children were given stuffed whales made from reused textiles by hotel employees, along with letters containing information about the whales, to teach the children about environmental issues.\n\nOur commitment for 2024 is to make further progress with biodiversity, aligning ourselves with the environmental taxonomy, whose objective is to\n\nincrease the importance of biodiversity within the tourism sector.\n\nacteristics and importance, and how to help protect them.\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE,\nETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.

COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE**\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nIn accordance with the Green Pact and the target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, in March 2022 the European Commission proposed the first series of measures to accelerate the transition towards a circular economy, including promotion of sustainable products, consumer awareness initiatives, a review of regulations on construction products and a sustainable textile strategy.\n\nOur *Climate Change and Environment Policy* sets out the following commitments to work towards a circular economy:\n\n- Implement a strategy to optimise the management of product life cycles through the development of measurement processes and the promotion of programmes to identify new alternatives for reducing food waste and single-use products, working in collaboration with our partners.\n- Optimise the life cycle of products, materials and resources, reducing the production of waste and its environmental impact, promoting a circular, sustainable and resource-efficient model, and fostering responsible management of waste generated through our hotel activities.\n\nWe are convinced that transitioning the hotel sector towards circularity is necessary to ensure a sustainable future for all our destinations. But we are also well aware of the challenges and opportunities involved in this area, both at an operational level and in terms of its impact on our business. Some of the main challenges we have faced so far are as a result of the highly fragmented nature of our company, involving various destinations and circumstances, along with the different ownership structures and the heterogeneity of actors.\n\nIf we want to respond to all the major challenges and make progress in terms of circularity and recycling, we need to identify the key actors in all the countries where we operate and coordinate efforts at every level, involving employees, customers and waste managers, to ensure that we identify opportunities and share the same objectives. It is undeniable that the transition towards a circular economy requires actors in the value chain to be committed and focused, offering the Company resources and solutions to promote a green economy.\n\nOur commitment is primarily focused on minimising waste generated through our activities, and identifying those activities that produce the most waste within the scope of hotel operations. Most improvements inevitably revolve around transforming the way we handle materials, from the purchase of goods to our construction processes and how we use materials in our activities.\n\nWe have implemented a reduction circular ecosystem, which is key to us transitioning towards a more sustainable business model, with the ability to generate economic and inclusive growth in the areas where we operate and to reduce our environmental footprint and impact, contributing towards the public commitments we have taken on.\n\nHazardous waste is generally collected on a regular basis by the suppliers themselves, as they are responsible for managing and recycling it. This year we also launched a bidding process in Spain to not only manage and ensure the circularity of this kind of waste, but also to measure the volume generated. It is worth noting, however, that the volume of this type of waste is minimal when compared to the volume of non-hazardous waste produced.\n\nIn our case, the Group's hotels carry out a range of activities that can largely be grouped into the accommodation and *food & beverage (F&B)* categories, with the waste generated being managed in accordance with the laws in the countries where we operate.\n\n122\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/129/Picture/1 description: The image shows a house icon next to the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\".\n\nImage /page/129/Figure/3 description: This image is a flowchart that illustrates the destination of waste. The flowchart starts with four categories: Food, F&B, Packaging, Construction, and Cleaning. Food waste comes from the Kitchen and includes Organic Leftovers, which are sent to Compost. F&B waste comes from Restaurants, including A la carte and Buffet, which produce Organic Leftovers, Excess exposed, and Excess NOT exposed waste, all of which are sent to Compost. Packaging waste is divided into Single use and Reusable, which are sent to Recycling. Construction and Cleaning waste are divided into Dangerous and Not Dangerous, with the Not Dangerous waste being sent to Recycling. The Destination of Waste section includes Glass, Plastic, Paper/Carboard, Organic, and Reject, which are sent to Recycling, Compost, and Waste, respectively. The Recycling Bins section includes Recycling, Compost, and Waste.\n\n{130}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n### CONTENTS **Progress and opportunities**\n\nAt Meliá, we are working to establish a strategy that will help us promote a circular model, aligning us with the European target to recycle 55% of all urban waste in 2025. We also assess opportunities to form partnerships that can support us through this transition process, one key example being our participation in the Circular Hotels initiative.\n\nWe view circularity as an essential part of our transition towards a more\n\nin nature.

In recent years, our commitment in this area has evolved towards a much more global and strategic approach, adapted to the context in which we live.\n\nOur organic waste is primarily generated during the production and preparation of our food products, consisting of leftovers of products that have been prepared and not consumed. Aside from being an ethical imperative, we must also tailor our offer and service to take into account the consumption habits of our customers.\n\nOur goal is to manage a responsible and sustainable production chain, and to improve our production processes to **reduce waste**. In this respect, we are working on a number of initiatives aimed at balancing supply with demand and, consequently, minimising food waste.\n\nAs a result of the need to make progress in this area, Meliá has launched various initiatives designed to **reduce food waste** and has established a model of good practices to minimise the impact of our activities:\n\n- Adjusting production to the number of guests and the service being offered.\n- Reducing packaging by purchasing compostable coffee beans and coffee capsules.\n- Developing training on food waste, with preventive plans and production control tools.\n- Adapting and standardising products used to optimise stock and analyse production ratios for events and groups.\n- Receiving feedback from customers about our culinary offer, to avoid wastage\n- Putting up posters with messages to promote awareness.\n- Managing and measuring our food services to customers who have paid for board.\n- Establishing central kitchens to improve efficiency and consolidating critical processes.\n\nImage /page/131/Picture/26 description: The image shows a statistic related to TGTG HOTELS (KG).

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nBy consolidating our globally recognised employer brand, we offer a more unique employee experience, seeking to provide a culture and values that set us apart from our competitors, and strengthening our team's connection with the Company's purpose.\n\nIn recent years, people management has undergone a real revolution; trends have changed and employees require greater flexibility, job satisfaction and training. Used to reactively managing business demands, human resources is regaining its position in the management structure and is making a major contribution to the company's results.\n\nWithin this new context, business growth, profitability and sustainability are closely linked to our ability to attract, retain and manage talent. With our management tools, we aim to provide a rapid, agile, effective and optimal response to our employees. We use technology to offer a service based on quality and agility standards for our employees. We use platforms that help us to simplify and streamline critical operational processes, we have designed a reporting system or dashboard with the main indicators that offer a range of possibilities for analysis, management and control, and most importantly a People Analytics tool that helps us to interpret such important indicators for human resources management as turnover and absenteeism. Social media and new platforms allow us to 'disintermediate' with the recruitment market and directly access the very best professionals.\n\nWithout a doubt, our greatest challenge and concern right now is the \"war for talent\", which involves every industry. This is exacerbated within tourism as the sector has become less appealing due to the considerable loss of talent during the pandemic. Against this backdrop, we also have housing shortages and the rising cost of living, especially in successful holiday destinations.\n\nAll these factors have increased the degree of exposure to risks related mainly to ensuring adequate global and comprehensive talent management, from attracting and retaining talent to minimising talent drain and consolidating an organisational structure that allows for development and growth.\n\n### **Governance and organisational model**\n\nAt Meliá Hotels International, we have implemented a global *Human Resources Policy*, which was approved by the Board of Directors in June 2019. It outlines the basic principles for respecting workers' rights, guaranteeing a suitable work environment, preventing occupational hazards and managing talent to enable employees to develop professionally.\n\nIt is framed and approved in accordance with the specific commitments the Company has made to its employees in the Code of Ethics. The Company must also comply with all regulations in force in each of the countries where it operates, striving to make constant improvements in this area, in line with our corporate values. This Policy is available to all interested parties on the company website.\n\nWe also have our own *Human Rights Policy***,** which was approved by the Board of Directors in July 2018. It reinforces all of the Company's commitments contained within the Code of Ethics and other corporate policies that have a direct or indirect impact on human rights. Its approval and publication strengthen the Company's governance model, which it developed in 2008, integrating various essential principles established by different universal texts.\n\n128\n\n{135}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn June 2023, the Board of Directors approved the Diversity Policy, which establishes the principles, guidelines and main lines of action in matters of diversity and inclusion that should guide the governance of the Company, ensuring equal opportunities and non-discrimination on grounds of race, skin colour, sexual orientation, age, gender, culture, work, disability, ideology, religion, or any other characteristics, with diversity and inclusion declared as values to be protected and consolidated in the workplace.\n\n### **A more business-focused organisation**\n\nIn 2022, we launched an ambitious organisational and cultural transformation programme as part of our *Roadto2024* strategic roadmap to transform our work environment and job roles, and to make certain improvements that were needed, leading to a more inclusive, diverse and equitable society.\n\nThe programme groups the priority actions into three main pillars: Organisational Model, Culture with Purpose and Value Proposition. All three involve initiatives that aim to transform the organisation into a more agile, efficient and interconnected company, enhancing our value proposition to motivate and strengthen our teams.\n\nA framework aimed at the Company's leaders that integrates a wide range of actions in the field of human resources management, to strengthen our employer brand, enhance our leadership in training and development, and empower our teams to improve agility, digitisation and operational efficiency.\n\n### **Consolidating the Leading a New Future organisational model**\n\nThis new structure will significantly change how we work, interact, behave and organise ourselves, enhancing our agility and boosting profitability in a world that is becoming increasingly competitive and demanding. It integrates our corporate vision into the hotel business under the same umbrella, with the goal of consolidating a service culture with a focus on our hotels, placing the customer and the hotel at the centre of our organisational model.\n\nImage /page/135/Figure/9 description: The image shows four text boxes arranged horizontally. The first box is titled \"Hotel and Customer Centric\" and contains the text \"Hotels and customers at the heart of the organisation This focus on the business will determine the way the rest of the structure is organised.\" The second box is titled \"Agile and Profitable\" and contains the text \"An agile and profitable organisation in an industry that is increasingly competitive and always changing.\" The third box is titled \"Hotel Services Oriented\" and contains the text \"Corporate areas have been reorganised to provide a more agile and efficient service to the business.\" The fourth box is titled \"Digital and Analitycs\" and contains the text \"A total transformation as part of a digitalisation process we have named Be Digital 360.\"\n\n**ORGANISATIONAL MODEL BASED ON 4 PILLARS**\n\nThis new approach lays the foundations to consolidate a more efficient, digital and competitive organisation, preserving the immutable principle developed through our 65 years of history: vocation of service. This hallmark is reflected in the daily work of all the company's employees.\n\nThis model is strengthening our capacity as managers, by prioritising the quality service provided by our Hotel Services teams. Our commitment to an expansion focused on management and franchising requires the Hotel Services areas to put together specialist teams that are functionally focused on the development of innovative projects and solutions, to provide greater value to the business, alongside teams located in certain areas/destinations that guarantee the implementation of our management system.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n#### **3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nCONTENTS The model enables us to adapt to the specific nature of our industry and respond quickly and efficiently to any new needs that may be identified.\n\n> This transformation was born out of the desire to promote a new philosophy in our management model based on fluid and direct communication between our hotels and operations centres. The Company currently has a total of 25 centres in operation.\n\nA Role Model has also been established, to develop professional development pathways for the main operational areas. This informs teams about growth opportunities and can be found on our intranet.\n\nIn addition, under the Operations framework, the hotel structures and positions (Job Descriptions) for each job have been reviewed, adapted, standardised and published on the intranet, and a catalogue has been created with all the current positions.\n\n### **Organisational model in business units**\n\nWith this new structure, we needed to inform our teams about the updated organisational model and promote transparency, knowledge and understanding. The objective is for our employees to lead the change and it is important that the approved model be clear and credible, including the catalogue of services that the different Hotel Services areas must provide to the hotel.\n\nThere have been many significant advances made this year, consolidating the new organisational model, moving us towards a more agile, efficient and responsible organisational structure, and reinforcing our focus on service, a value that is essential for successful hotel management.\n\nTo measure our progress against the objectives we have set ourselves, we designed a new Internal Service Survey. The main objective of this is to obtain feedback on the services provided by the different departments attached to Hotel & Corporate Services and our business areas. The purpose of this survey is to identify our strengths and areas for improvement, which will help to guide and develop an action plan to continually improve our service. The 2nd Service Survey is scheduled for release in early 2024 and will allow us to see the progress we have made since the last survey.\n\nTo support this ambitious and transformational organisational change we needed to promote a number of initiatives or projects, which will minimise any lack of understanding and ensure that the model is integrated into each affected role, with the goal of bringing our corporate areas closer to the real heart of our business: our hotels.\n\n#### **HOTEL AND CORPORATE RELATIONSHIP INITIATIVES**\n\n### **\"In Good Company\" Podcast**\n\nA new internal communication format to raise awareness about the leaders of the new organisational structure and the functions in each area so that people can see what they do and the services they oer our hotels.\n\n#### **\"The human side of change\" programme**\n\nAimed at company executives to assist them in the transformation process and strengthen their relationships. Networking as a key tool in ensuring internal unity in the face of strategic challenges, working on change management, psychological safety, trust and coherence.\n\n### **\"Destination Meliá, a journey to service\"**\n\nProgramme for all the Hotel Services and Corporate Services teams to make a service vocation the genuine hallmark of our people's identity.\n\nThe programme will continue in 2023, using specific tools to strengthen service behaviours in each department and with special attention to the owners of managed or franchised hotels.\n\n### **\"Discover our hotels\"**\n\nMonthly webinars to learn more about the company's key hotels and most notable new hotel openings led by the operations teams and the teams from each hotel. They raise awareness about hotel operations, the value they contribute to the company's portfolio and the challenges faced by their teams.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n### CONTENTS **Characteristics of our workforce**\n\n#### GRI: 2-7; 401-1; 405-1\n\nThe tourism sector is a lever for generating opportunities and employment, offering possibilities to a wide range of profiles to cover all the needs within hotels and corporate structures. Hotel companies require a wide array of different talents, so they employ people from a varied range of backgrounds. This creates a very rich and diverse work environment.\n\nAs of the end of 2023, the Company is active in 14 countries, operating 127 hotels with a total of 31,870 rooms.\n\nAs a result of the Group's new organisational structure, the incorporation of new hotels and the repositioning of some business units to a segment or brand with higher added value, our workforce has continued to grow over recent years, increasing by 8.7% in comparison to 2022.\n\nThe information below shows an improvement in the key indicators related to workforce characteristics.\n\nThe Company operates a total of 166 hotels under one management model, implementing its system according to the same principles, policies, standards and criteria that are common to all the hotels owned by the Group. Our international presence strengthens our position as a management company and our understanding of the sector, given our presence and experience in\n\nOur strong international presence offers many opportunities to all of our employees, enabling them to develop their career anywhere in the world.

This has become an effective, efficient and essential source of recruitment to find the best talent and an opportunity to begin a career in a sector that is constantly growing.\n\nWe know how important it is to take advantage of the talent we find through internships, which is why we offer opportunities for them to continue working for our organisation after their training.\n\nWe also endeavour to ensure that our COUPA platform registers all workers and service providers, who carry out work in our hotels under a service provision contract, reinforcing health and safety criteria both in the supplier approval process and during the provision of the service in our hotel facilities.\n\nOur commitment for 2024 is to get even better at recording this information, to improve the integration of service providers into COUPA.\n\n### **Value Management System**\n\nGRI: 2-23; 2-24; 3-3\n\nThe culture at Meliá Hotels International is based on our mission and our values, which are central to the Company's identity. These values encapsulate our corporate slogan, *Leisure at heart, business in mind*, expressing this perfect harmony that defines our philosophy: the balance between heart and mind, between the exceptional hospitality we offer and our excellent and rigorous management.\n\n- SERVICE VOCATION born from our background in hospitality.\n- EXCELLENCE AND CONSISTENCY, because we like to do things well, with professionalism and efficiency.\n- CLOSENESS, because we love to share, listen and feel.\n- INNOVATION, because we think ahead and innovate to be better every day.\n\nImage /page/137/Picture/23 description: The image shows the number of employees in the value chain (FTES).

Our human resources processes support our employees throughout the employment life cycle: talent attraction, hiring, training and development.\n\nWe maintain a close relationship with our employees to identify and mitigate any potential impact on our management model, opening various communication channels to ensure we are always aware of any concerns coming from our teams.\n\nWe ensure that our employees can carry out their work in an environment free of exploitation, without exception, and offer the following guarantees, among others: compliance with minimum working age, fair treatment in hiring processes, access to training and development opportunities, equal pay and non-discrimination, work-life balance options, respect for labour rights and holidays, safe working environments and access to social benefits of various kinds.\n\nTo establish a culture of respect and protection of human rights, the involvement of employees is key. This is something we are well aware of, which is why our intranet includes a section with specific human rights information. We want all of our partners to be aware of, understand and share not only our commitments and how they are integrated into our management model, but also our perspective of an issue that is so fundamental to achieving a better future.\n\nWith this objective in mind, through our online eMeliá platform, we train our entire workforce on issues that affect human rights, such as ethics, compliance, anti-corruption, equality, diversity, and occupational health and safety, among others.\n\nImage /page/138/Figure/15 description: The image is a graphic with the title \"Our heart: vocation for service\" in the center.

This discussion centres around strengths, areas of improvement and the implementation of our values, with the key moment being when both parties come up with a development plan together for the employee. Our talent development section provides development programmes that include performance reviews and support for all employees.\n\n{139}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONTENTS For the second year running, this process has been rolled out globally to all employees who have been with the company for at least 6 months, using the Human Resource Department's global management tool.\n\n> In 2023, we looked at how to incorporate new challenges into those already faced by our leaders, as well as the essential levers used in the leadership\n\n> We added the 180º Evaluation to this process for our leaders, updating the usual yearly development discussion with an assessment from their manager and feedback from their hierarchical and functional team, to identify strengths and opportunities for improvement, helping them to grow both personally and professionally.

And the tourism industry has not escaped this dilemma. As a result of the pandemic, it has suffered a significant loss of talent and must now look for profiles with a more diverse and technology-based skill set, to meet the needs of the transformation process it is currently undergoing.\n\nThere are a number of measures that can and should be adopted to respond to this new challenging reality. Some of them will of course have a direct impact on human resource management, to bring management in line with the business, supporting both the employees and the business, and maintaining both the human and digital sides of the company.\n\n133\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.

To achieve this, we endeavour to offer an appealing value proposition that meets employee expectations, without forgetting to emphasise our competitiveness as an employer brand, rooted in our values and culture. This approach aims to highlight what we can offer and to help the tourism sector recover, making it more appealing for professionals from other sectors, as an industry where they can work and develop professionally.\n\n> The decision taken to design our image as an employer with a focus on the importance of marketing to attract and develop valuable candidates for our company has enabled the Group to not only position itself as an attractive employer in the labour market, but also to often beat the competition in the race to attract the best candidates and triumph in the famous War for Talent.\n\n> We began our growth journey in 2022 and this year we have managed to double the figure we achieved last year, reflecting the growing interest in and recognition of our value proposition. We are proud of having made it to the finals of the Hospitality Awards and winning the title of TOP EMPLOYER in eight different countries and at the Best in Travel awards, strengthening our commitment to excellence in talent management and our reputation within the hotel sector.\n\n> With our vibrant and modern visual identity, our employees are the key focus at every stage, from recruitment to professional development and visibility of internal opportunities. Through these actions we aim to inspire employees and offer the best possible experience at every stage of their journey with Meliá.\n\n> We established a series of targets to measure the impact of our employer brand in channels such as Instagram and LinkedIn, with the following objectives:\n\n- Establish a framework for filling vacancies with both external and internal candidates, offering clarity, transparency and order to hiring managers who need to recruit talent in their departments.\n- Standardise recruitment processes, making them more rigorous, agile, efficient and aligned with internal regulations.\n- Support the company's evolution and ensure sustainable development of its activities.\n- Promote internal growth of employees, ensuring that professional opportunities are communicated throughout the company, with equal opportunities.\n\nMeliá *Careers* is our new brand and platform for communicating our talent needs worldwide. Its end goal is to make the candidate the core focus of our talent search and recruitment activities, just as our marketing and sales departments put customers at the centre of their processes.\n\n(2023 target: 5%) **LINKEDIN ENGAGEMENT** 4.77%\n\n(2023 target: 8%)\n\n**INSTAGRAM ENGAGEMENT**\n\n5%\n\nThis year, the Company has developed three initiatives designed to attract talent with the best skill sets and create loyalty.\n\nImage /page/141/Figure/21 description: The image shows a circular diagram with the words \"MELIÁ CAREERS\" at the top.

Its objective is to enhance the appeal of the tourism sector, while also highlighting the unique nature of our Company's proposal.\n\nAll of our employees perform their roles with great enthusiasm and help us to strengthen our brand image, boost the commitment of our team and promote internal development. To inspire candidates, we link the brand proposal and employee experience to the core essence of the Company: travel and passion.\n\n#### **Talent Days**\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5. SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nLargescale recruitment events that generate a major impact and improve our hiring processes. They enable us to evaluate and hire a large number of candidates over a short period of time, streamline the selection process and increase our temporary workforce, which is essential to the hotel industry due to seasonal fluctuations in demand.\n\nIt is essential to carefully manage key processes such as planning and execution, not only to ensure we hire quality candidates and effectively manage new employees, but also to guarantee a positive impact and provide the opportunity to visualise certain behaviours by fostering team dynamics.\n\n#### **Inbound and Outbound Talent**\n\nThis initiative is focused on recruiting employees for seasonal hotels, attracting and retaining employees who work during certain periods of the year and offering them the opportunity to continue their careers in positions both in Spain and abroad.\n\nThis initiative offers a wide range of benefits, such as the flexibility of being able to assign employees according to the fluctuating demand at different locations; employee mobility, with opportunities for professional growth and development; stronger commitment to the Company; a greater retention ratio; and a more diverse set of skills, as employees gain experience working for different brands and/or in different countries.\n\nIt also contributes towards organisational cohesion by promoting a unified company culture and sharing best practices in different locations. When implementing the initiative, it was crucial to manage this mobility with a balanced approach to avoid any potential logistical challenges and ensure that employees feel supported during their transition.\n\n### **Inspiring Friends**\n\nAn initiative to engage employees as brand ambassadors to identify and attract new talent. Participating employees receive financial compensation for referring friends and acquaintances that meet certain performance criteria and are available for the required period.\n\nThe successful implementation of this initiative has had many positive effects on the organisation:\n\n- Stimulating participation and commitment from employees by offering financial incentives for their help in searching for talent.\n- Improving the quality of recruitments, as employees tend to refer people that they know well and that will fit in with the company culture.\n- Strengthening the internal professional network by promoting an environment with collaborative and solid relationships between colleagues.\n- Streamlining the recruitment process by providing a constant flow of recommended candidates.\n- Guaranteeing equality and preventing conflicts of interest through the development of clear and transparent policies.\n\nImage /page/142/Picture/24 description: The image shows the text 'VERY INSPIRING PEOPLE CVS RECEIVED' in green, followed by the number '51,215' in gray, and then '(+2,180%)' in gray.\n\nImage /page/142/Picture/25 description: The image shows the number of people who attended Talent Days.

With this in mind, we cultivate a culture of continual growth that promotes constant improvements to individual performance. The aim is to prepare our employees to respond to challenges effectively and to promote innovation in a proactive way, thus fostering commitment to the organisation. All of this should make us more competitive as a company and elevate our people.\n\nTo achieve this, we use tools for identifying and evaluating talent, along with professional development and growth programmes.\n\n### **Identifying and evaluating internal talent**\n\nWe have launched a number of on-demand processes for identifying and evaluating employees who have worked with us for at least a year, a system meticulously designed to expand knowledge and stimulate professional growth among our employees.\n\n#### **Talent Map**\n\nThis map is designed to identify entry-level and middle-management employees with exceptional performance and clear potential for promotion, transfer or incorporation into task forces in key projects. It offers employees in middle or lower ranking positions the opportunity to be recognised, evaluated and included in development and growth programmes.\n\n### **Talent Meeting**\n\nThe performance review process plays a key role in identifying and establishing talent development objectives. As part of our constant drive to optimise development and promotions, we are taking this process one step further to calibrate the results obtained in the performance review through Talent Meeting sessions.\n\n| OBJECTIVE                   | TOOLS                          | PROGRAMMES                     | FOCUS                                                                         | BENEFITS FOR<br>EMPLOYEES                                                       | BENEFITS FOR<br>MELIÁ                                                                                                       |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| EVALUATE<br>INTERNAL TALENT | TALENT<br>IDENTIFICATION       | TALENT MAPPING                 | Identification<br>of department<br>managers and entry-<br>level profiles      | Access to<br>development and<br>growth programmes                               | Identification of<br>high-value profiles<br>Fill hotel vacancies                                                            |\n|                             |                                | TALENT MEETING                 | Talent ranking for<br>hotel executives<br>and managers and<br>corporate staff | Fair evaluation<br>process<br>Access to<br>development and<br>growth programmes | Annual talent<br>evaluation<br>Identification of<br>potential successor<br>for key positions<br>Creation of action<br>plans |\n|                             | POTENTIAL TALENT<br>EVALUATION | TALENT<br>ASSESSMENT<br>CENTER | Evaluation<br>of motivated<br>employees with high<br>potential                | They can start a<br>career in their area of<br>interest                         | Fill vacancies with<br>high-potential<br>profiles                                                                           |\n\n**EVALUATING TALENT**\n\nWe use these sessions to compare and contrast reviews performed by different evaluators, applying a global approach. The goal is reduce individual bias and promote equality and transparency throughout the entire process. This approach reaffirms our commitment to apply rigorous and fair talent management processes.\n\nImage /page/143/Picture/13 description: The image shows the text 'CVS' in green, followed by the number '104,126' in a large, gray font. Below the number, the text '(+136%)' is displayed in a smaller font size.\n\nThe results enable us to make decisions and optimise our activities in the area of talent management, providing growth opportunities to employees that offer high potential and have achieved an impressive level of performance. This comprehensive approach improves the quality and suitability of our team, optimising their performance and alignment with the company's objectives.\n\nWithin this framework we identify and evaluate three key factors: experience, potential and passion. By assessing these three areas, we are able to plan talent development initiatives.\n\nWe have identified over 100 employees who are capable of taking on new responsibilities and we are developing succession plans for these valuable, high-potential profiles.\n\n**TALENT MAP** 681\n\nImage /page/143/Figure/18 description: The image shows the text \"VALUABLE PROFILES\" in green, followed by the number \"54%\" in gray.\n\nImage /page/143/Picture/19 description: The image contains the text \"HOTEL AND CORPORATE EXECUTIVE PROFILES\" in a teal color.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe talent calibration process is accompanied by an action plan that helps us to make progress in areas where employees need to improve or develop additional skills. This action plan is divided into training and development activities, offering a structured framework that covers specific areas of improvement and promotes continuous development. This strategy significantly helps us to improve both the individual and collective performance of our workforce.\n\n### **Development programmes**\n\nProgrammes carefully designed to expand knowledge and promote professional growth. They take into consideration the unique characteristics of each role, anticipate future needs and develop specific and transferrable skills. They also offer internal growth opportunities to fill vacancies, whether they be at business units or corporate offices.\n\nIn 2023 we strengthened our commitment to talent development by setting ourselves the target of including 2% of our employees in development initiatives, using the average annual workforce at hotels and strategic destinations as a reference.\n\nDue to the Group's continuing growth and expansion, the Company needs to attract and hire new talent to meet its current and future needs. To do this, we develop programmes directed at young talent and recent graduates with the aim of attracting people to join our teams who can bridge gaps within the company and enrich it with new skills and abilities.\n\n### **Executive Graduate Programme**\n\nDesigned exclusively for recent graduates, with the goal of offering participants the opportunity to develop specific leadership and management skills. Its main objective is to facilitate a fluid transition from academic life to the professional world, through practical experience that will provide the necessary skills to enable them to take on roles with greater responsibility and advance quickly along their professional career.\n\nThis programme prepares eleven future talent profiles, enabling us to anticipate and cover vacancies in the medium and long term.\n\n#### **PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT**\n\n| OBJECTIVE                   | INITIATIVE                                                            | PROGRAMMES

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe first MBA promoted by the Company to train participants through a study plan. In partnership with the *Vatel Hotel & Business School*, we teach\n\nour students the essential skills and expertise they will need to effectively lead and manage hotel companies from a data-analysis perspective. The study plan combines a range of courses related to business and information technology.\n\nThe six participants will develop skills in key areas such as statistics, data analysis, data visualisation, business modelling, business strategy and leadership. They will also explore aspects specific to the hotel industry, including customer experience management, pricing and supply chain management.\n\n#### **Job Training Plan**\n\nA programme designed for entry-level employees who achieve optimal performance when performing their functions and responsibilities at the hotel. The primary objective is to ensure that these employees with potential are trained in all areas of their respective departments, improving their current performance to ensure their employability in the long term.\n\n### **Professional Development Plan**\n\nWhen young talent joins us, we review their performance to determine their future within the company. Along these lines, the *Professional Development Plan* provides training for employees with potential, helping them grow and take on roles with greater responsibility. This plan includes an operational roadmap, a skill development plan and an online training itinerary, available on the e-Meliá training platform. This programme encompasses various areas related to hotel operations and management.\n\nThe performance and/or progress of participants is reviewed periodically, to ensure that they are reaching their established goals and can progress in their professional career. All of this provides a solid basis for internal leadership while disseminating our culture and values to new generations. In 2022, we performed a review of the Plan with our hotels, resulting in higher participation in the system this year.\n\n### **Initiating the Journey**\n\nIntended for department managers who have been identified as having potential to start a career in Hotel Management, offering them a meticulously designed action plan to expand their global vision of business and introduce them to the key functions involved in hotel management.\n\nThese evaluations are critical in our talent management model, providing a clear understanding of the skills, qualities, ambitions and goals of our employees, reducing the talent leak and giving us a view of our internal talent pool of experienced candidates who are aligned with the expectations of our employees.\n\nParticipants who successfully make it through the Assessment Center process are included in the Hotel Management Talent Pool, a career programme that enables them to obtain a management position.\n\n48% of the group in Development is promoted in 2023 or is ready to be promoted.\n\n1.8% of our total workforce is currently participating in development programmes, and our objective is to reach 2% in 2024.\n\n#### **Developing Executive Talent**\n\nWe have launched a number of on-demand processes for evaluating employees who have worked with us for at least a year, a system meticulously designed to expand knowledge and stimulate professional growth among our employees.\n\nImage /page/145/Picture/25 description: The image shows the text 'JOB TRAINING PLAN PARTICIPANTS' in green, followed by the number '139' in a larger, gray font.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nAn annual process to promote a culture of continual feedback through dialogue between employees and managers. This discussion centres around strengths, areas of improvement and the implementation of our values, ending with both parties coming up with a development plan together for the employee.\n\n### **Designed for established department managers and entry-level staff**\n\nThe programme offers a personalised work plan for each participant based on three fundamental pillars, which together form a development plan: experimentation and practice, developing skills and applying new expertise.\n\n### **Hotel Management Development**\n\n### **Hotel Management Talent Pool**\n\nThe programme fosters internal rotation to offer participants broad experience about the different hotel types, segments and brands, which will help to give them a global understanding of the organisation. They will receive training where they will learn specific skills, be mentored by an experienced executive and participate in strategic projects, along with other learning opportunities.\n\nThe programme offers a personalised work plan for each participant based on three fundamental pillars, which together form a development plan: experimentation and practice, developing skills and applying new expertise.\n\n22 new participants joined this programme in 2023, with 69% of them being promoted or transferred.\n\n### **Support Programmes**\n\nThese programmes serve two purposes. Firstly, they offer support and guidance during the implementation and consolidation of our new organisational model, and secondly, they offer personalised counselling and orientation for our leaders. The main objective is to develop and strengthen the skills and abilities of our leaders, enabling them to achieve their professional goals, whether that be in their current role or for future roles.\n\n### **Mentoring**\n\nThis programme has two objectives: firstly, to support the work of Hotel Managers who are Mentors for our Management Talent Pool, and secondly, to guide Mentees (members of the Talent Pool) in their development process as future Managers at MHI.\n\nThis 12-month programme begins with a pair of 2-day workshops for mentors and mentees to inform participants about the key aspects involved in a mentoring programme, the expectations and the practical tools they will use for their respective functions.\n\nThe mentor will also receive personalised support from a coach throughout the programme to help resolve any queries that may arise from the process, and once a month they will receive a newsletter with topics of interest for them to reflect on and share with their mentees.\n\n### **DRIVE Programme**\n\nAn internal initiative designed to support and motivate our best leaders, in both hotel and corporate environments. The main objective is to adapt executive talent to new competitive requirements and emerging roles.\n\nThrough comprehensive analysis of their profile, we create a personalised roadmap for each leader, with training programmes, cross-exposure training, and personalised coaching and/or mentoring sessions.\n\nImage /page/146/Picture/27 description: The image contains the words \"HOTEL EXECUTIVES AND CORPORATE PERSONNEL IN PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT\" in green font.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nCONTENTS One unique aspect of this programme is the ability to objectively evaluate the skills of participants through the use of psychometric testing. These tests enable us to compare the strengths of the participant against an ideal profile, enabling us to precisely identify areas of growth. This methodology also establishes measurable indicators to evaluate individual progress and a clear vision of the return on investment of our actions. Five hours are dedicated to assessing the participant and providing feedback on results. An individual action plan is then established, adapted to their needs and the results obtained.\n\n> This programme involves participation from prestigious partners, who provide the executive talent with a view of the market and ensure continuous and sustainable growth, making it one of the most popular programmes among our internal employees.\n\n### **Coaching Programme**\n\nDeveloped in partnership with *CoachHub* to improve the performance of participants and develop the skills they need for their current role. The programme includes occasional participation from managers, turning some coaching sessions into three-way interactions that ensure effective alignment with organisational objectives.\n\nDuring a period of 4-6 months, participants will have access to limited sessions with a coach of their choice, where they can discuss key aspects relating to professional growth, emotional wellbeing, stress management, change management, performance enhancement and new skills, among others. This personalised approach provides comprehensive support for individual development and success.\n\n### **Senior and Junior Development Workshops**\n\nInteractive and practical sessions that combine theory, practical exercises, group discussions and, in some cases, feedback activities, to teach participants new skills or enhance their current abilities.\n\nFor our senior management talent, we have developed the Leading Diversity workshop, which includes the development of skills and abilities that participants will need to lead diverse teams effectively and with sensitivity.\n\nTo foster personal awareness and promote practical tools for both personal and professional growth, we promote self-knowledge to guide participants in the exploration of their skills, motivations, emotions and areas of development.\n\n### **Hotel Leadership Group**\n\nThe performance and/or progress of participants in development programmes is reviewed periodically, to ensure that they are reaching their established goals and can progress in their professional career. All of this provides a solid foundation to guarantee return on investment while also ensuring these actions are aligned with our strategic objectives.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning another series of actions that have a global impact on our company culture.\n\n### **We see training as a major lever for retaining talent**\n\nGRI: 2-23; 2-24; 2-25; 3-3; 404-2\n\nOur talent training and development division offers programmes designed to help employees adapt continuously to the needs of our business, as well as the current multicultural, digitised and ever-changing environment we find ourselves in. The aim is to provide every employee with the tools they need to develop key skills that will promote both personal and professional growth, including technological and digital skills, communication, emotional intelligence and transformational leadership.\n\nTo support this mission, our plan was to invest 0.6% of our social cost in training and talent development initiative, an objective that we achieved. We aim to increase this percentage to 1% over the next two years, reaffirming our commitment to the training and development of our internal talent. This is calculated based on the total investment made, divided by the Company's total social cost.\n\nImage /page/147/Picture/18 description: The image shows the text \"DRIVE PROGRAMME PARTICIPANTS\" in green, followed by the number \"76\" in gray.\n\n(NPS 79) *COACHING PROGRAMME*  **PARTICIPANTS**\n\nImage /page/147/Picture/20 description: The image shows the number 110 in a large font, followed by the text \"(Rating 4.9/5)\" in a smaller font.\n\nImage /page/147/Picture/21 description: The image shows the number of workshop participants.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe results are obtained by adding the total positive responses (7 to 10) to the total responses in the Commitment Index.\n\nOnce the feedback collection process has been completed, the results are shared with each centre or department and the manager commits to fulfil the action plan themselves, ensuring that the team's identified objectives are achieved. The report with the overall responses also serves as a basis for developing a global action plan, to improve the variables with the lowest rating.\n\nAs a result of the feedback collected in the survey, we identified the need to enhance agility, effective communication and wellbeing in our daily lives by focusing on managing meetings and emails in a more efficient way. As a result we launched Meliá Talks, an initiative that offers guidance and recommendations to foster a culture of continuous improvement, making both meetings and emails key levers for good performance and managing the wellbeing of our teams.\n\nAnother initiative developed to generate a positive atmosphere is the Meliá Celebration calendar, which fosters a sense of belonging among our employees through weekly themed celebrations and international days, with global awareness activities and local events. This year we celebrated two themed weeks: Meliá *Diversity Week* and Meliá *Wellbeing Week*. They promoted messages such as the importance of a healthy diet and lifestyle (nutrition, exercise and our \"My Wellbeing\" programme), with options ranging from nutritional advice to therapeutic sessions.\n\nFinally, as another part of our constant feedback ecosystem, we implemented a standardised procedure for employees who choose to leave the company, with an Exit Interview designed to find out their personal reasons for leaving. To support line managers and the Human Resources Department, support guides have been designed with recommendations for the interview, to guide the conversation in a satisfactory way for both parties, creating a comfortable environment where the employee feels comfortable and safe to express their opinions and share their feelings freely, and, for its part, the Company will receive feedback to make decisions and avoid similar departures, thus improving the employee experience.\n\n### **Equality, Diversity and Inclusion**\n\nGRI: 2-23; 2-24; 2-25; 3-3\n\nIn recent years, the principles of equality, diversity and inclusion have proved to be essential factors in the competitiveness of a company, with a wealth of initiatives being developed to further integrate these principles into business strategies and models.\n\nAt Meliá, diversity has always been a powerful driver for competitiveness, as reflected by the Company's fantastic performance in this area. We believe that accepting and including a diverse range of talents enriches us and offers different perspectives and management styles, helping us to be more innovative and grow in a more responsible way.\n\nWe endeavour to improve our internal processes and adopt the necessary measures to tackle any form of inequality based on gender, race, ethnicity, religion, disability, age, sexual orientation, identity, beliefs or anything else, and our Code of Ethics also expresses our firm commitment to combat all kinds of violence or harassment in our work environment.\n\nIn the 2022 Management Report, one of our goals was to implement an Equality Plan that covered all the requirements in this area. Another target was for women to hold 40% of management positions by 2030, no more than two levels below the positions of Chairman and CEO.\n\nIn June 2023, the Board of Directors approved our Diversity Policy, to be applied globally. It encompasses the following compromises, which act as levers to promote our various initiatives.\n\n- Commitment to hire, retain and develop women in senior management positions.\n- Implementation of policies and public commitments to combat harassment and discrimination, with training and channels for handling employee complaints.\n- Progress towards reducing the wage gap, providing criteria to measure said gap and developing transparent and rigorous action plans.\n\n{152}------------------------------------------------\n\n- ABOUT THIS REPORT\n- **1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n- **2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n- **3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n- **4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n- **5. SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n- CONTENTS Promotion of programmes to achieve an inclusive work environment where employees feel valued and have access to the same opportunities, ensuring that inclusive leadership constitutes a core part of our leaders' behaviours.\n\t- Stakeholder awareness of our commitments and progress in the Company, particularly with our services.\n\nWe realise that making advances in this area will expose us to new challenges. This year we received 8 harassment and discrimination complaints. As a result, in 2023 we implemented a series of specific measures designed to guarantee and promote equality, diversity, equity and inclusion in our corporate culture, and to integrate groups at risk of exclusion.\n\n### *Meliá Diversity Week*\n\nTo coincide with the \"World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development\", launched by the European Commission on 21 May, promoting \"Diversity Month\" under the slogan \"Building Bridges\", the Company launched its first \"Diversity Week\", a series of communication and advocacy activities focusing on aspects such as generational, cultural, sexual and gender diversity and raising awareness of disabilities and inclusion.\n\nTo highlight the value of diversity in the workplace and make it a source of pride for all our employees, we focused on a range of different areas, such as gender, sexual and functional diversity, to raise awareness about the different practices in the market and share the thoughts and aspirations of our most affected employees, members of minority groups who have felt out of place or forgotten at times.\n\nOur commitment is to communicate the challenges that we must continue to address to make progress regarding equality of opportunities and training and employability of vulnerable groups, and to ensure that companies better reflect today's society, so that everyone feels seen and represented.\n\n### **CEO Action for Diversity**\n\nDiversity and inclusion have a direct impact on the brand's image, our performance and the achievement of corporate objectives. It is one of the most important factors when establishing an employment brand to attract the best talent. In 2021, the Company joined the CEO Action for Diversity, whose mission is to bring together the heads of leading Spanish companies around a common and innovative perspective of diversity and inclusion (D&I), as drivers of these challenges in their companies, to promote business excellence strategies that foster talent and reduce inequality and exclusion in Spanish society.\n\nLed by the Adecco Foundation and the CEOE Foundation, it is based on a rigorous research and analysis process with 79 questions, which enable the development of a model built around five strategic blocks: identity and strategy, cultural change, competitiveness, equality and equity, and inclusion in society and the workplace. This year, we worked on various areas: D&I trends, homeworking, collaborative models, mental health, psychosocial risks, workplace inclusion and senior talent.\n\n### **Equality Plan**\n\nIn 2023, Meliá Hotels International made progress with its commitment to equality and, alongside the two biggest unions in Spain and in the Group, UGT and CC.OO, it ratified its third Equality Plan. The previous plan, signed in 2019, strengthened the Company's commitments to its employees, and this new plan establishes the roadmap for the next four years.\n\nThe measures and commitments included in this new Plan are grouped into 9 essential aspects or areas of action to consolidate the Company's equality principles, from a global and holistic vision: organisational culture and management, selection and recruitment process, professional classification, training, professional promotion, working time/work-life balance, under-representation of women, remuneration, prevention of sexual and gender-based harassment, gender-based violence, occupational health and communication, information and awareness-raising.\n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5. SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nCONTENTS Through 12 different blocks, the plan is introducing 136 measures to be implemented in Spain, across 16 work areas. The targets are set per quarter and will be incorporated into the plan's monitoring, compliance and implementation system over the next four years.\n\n> To summarise, below we outline the main commitments that will be our key focus while the plan is in force:\n\n> • Hiring people according to the principle of equality, in addition to promoting training and raising awareness regarding issues related to equality throughout every level of the Company. One of the key measures of the plan is our commitment to monitor the professional categories where women are underrepresented, with the aim of, where necessary, implementing appropriate measures to identify possible causes and solutions.\n\n• Strengthen guidance and education on equality issues to make this the main foundation of the entire employee journey, beginning with the hiring processes, developing a specific training and awareness-raising plan for the people involved in these processes, along with measures that will support them through the various stages of their career within the company. Along these lines, the Company has committed to design a specific professional development plan for women, which will support and empower their leadership, with specific resources assigned for this purpose.\n\n• Develop a communication plan to enhance awareness and dissemination, creating a section about equality on the intranet, including all the information produced on this matter and any advances we have made.\n\n• This new plan will also continue providing improvement measures to help working people and, particularly, people who have dependents in their care, giving them the opportunity to reconcile their professional and personal lives. In addition to previously implemented measures, such as the possibility for employees to specify their working hours after the birth of a child, by mutual agreement with the company (without the need to reduce their working hours), we have also added a number of new measures, such as the possibility of paid leave for serious illness, surgery or hospitalisation.\n\n• Finally, continuing the progress made in our previous plan, specific measures have been established to combat sexual harassment and support victims of gender violence, for whom the Company has committed to enable adapted working hours and shift changes, and to provide other specific resources.\n\nTourism by its very nature is a great way of connecting cultures and people within the Meliá family, and we are proud to employ people of over 137 different nationalities, who speak more than 58 languages. This melting pot we have created is without a doubt one of our greatest achievements as a company.\n\n### **Integration of groups at risk of exclusion**\n\nWe appreciate that talent should be encouraged regardless of its origins, which is why we continue to offer employment opportunities by working with social associations and experts in this field.\n\nIn partnership with La Caixa Foundation (Spain), with its Incorpora Programme, and the Pinardi Foundation, we promote the employment of people at risk of exclusion at selected hotels throughout Spain.\n\nIn 2023, we made a total of 55 job offers, achieving a recruitment rate of 76%. We have made significant progress in recruitment, reaching a ratio of 71.43% of permanent contracts.\n\nAnother group that we work with is disabled people. We advocate for equality of opportunities and strive to contribute actively to creating a more inclusive and diverse environment. Aside from employing people with disabilities, we are also aware of the need to train our teams to provide a better service to this group of people as customers as well. As a result of our commitment, in 2023 we worked with the ONCE Foundation (Spain) to sign a Partnership Agreement, which was ratified on 24 January 2024 and will remain in force for five years, with the objective of promoting the direct employment of people with disabilities. Some of its key goals are as follows:\n\n**FEMALE EMPLOYEES** 46.6% (+1.4pp)\n\n> **JOB OFFERS** 31\n\n**PEOPLE HIRED** 18\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5. SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n- Promoting direct employment of people with disabilities.\n- Promoting training of people with disabilities.\n- Promoting employability and employment opportunities through various internship programmes.\n- Promoting indirect labour integration by encouraging procurement from Special Employment Centres.\n- Promoting the production of accessible goods and services.\n- Promoting initiatives to raise awareness in society.\n\n### **Social Dialogue**\n\nGRI 2-29; 2-30; 402-1\n\nMeliá recognises the following principles at an international level: freedom of association, protection of the right to unionise, collective bargaining, the elimination of forced or compulsory labour, the abolition of child labour, and the elimination of discrimination based on employment or occupation. We respect freedom of thought and the right of employees to form and join unions. This is all reflected in our Code of Ethics, which is based on the guidelines of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), adopted by the Company in 1998. In 2013, we signed an agreement with the IUF (International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations) to defend the aforementioned rights, among others, and this was reinforced in 2019 with the signing of a Specific Agreement to combat sexual harassment and workplace bullying.\n\nCollective bargaining plays a very important role in maintaining smooth industrial relations and agreeing on fair wages and adequate working conditions. In Spain, all our employees are subject to a collective agreement. Collective bargaining in Spain has its greatest exponent in the Framework Agreement, a state-wide labour agreement for the Hotel and Catering sector (ALEH), which is the result of collective bargaining in this sector and, together with the Autonomous Regional Hotel and Catering Collective Agreements, constitutes the foundation of the framework of sustainability and trust on which the reciprocal interests of companies and workers are based.\n\n**43.26%** of the workforce is located in Spain, where the rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining are recognised by the Constitution and enshrined by Organic Law 11/1985, on Freedom of Association.\n\nIn its Code of Ethics, approved by the Board of Directors in October 2012, the Company states its commitment to offer the best opportunities for professional development, based on the stability of a family business and the resilience of a leading international company, which knows how to recognise commitment, talent and achievements fairly, highlighting the following premises in the area of talent management:\n\nImage /page/154/Picture/21 description: The image shows the text \"WORKFORCE COVERED BY COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT\" in green, followed by the number \"94.9%\" in gray.\n\n- Protecting employees as they carry out their work and ensuring an adequate work environment that provides all necessary measures to guarantee employee health and safety.\n- Working to achieve commitment from our employees and ensure their wellbeing through active listening.\n- Promoting constant training and professional development.\n- Promoting a training policy that makes the company more competitive and provides professional development for our employees.\n- Ensuring that all our employees feel proud to be part of a company that puts people at the heart of everything it does.\n\nThe Company works to promote constructive social dialogue, exploring solutions that enable its employees to exercise their right to work in the best conditions possible. This dialogue establishes several key pillars, including but not limited to the following: equal treatment in regard to remuneration and working conditions, elimination of discrimination in all its forms, protection of people's health and workplace safety, social and working conditions for its employees. These commitments are reflected in the aforementioned Code of Ethics and the Human Rights Policy, and extend to the labour rights of our suppliers, who endorse these commitments by signing the Meliá Hotels International Code of Ethics.\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONTENTS We also maintain constant dialogue with unions to discuss relevant matters, such as the establishment of a negotiating table for the third Equality Plan, for which discussions began in 2023, or the promotion of initiatives with the IUF to combat sexual harassment in the workplace.\n\n> In Spain, this year the Company attended meetings with the main trade unions to report on developments within the business, played an active role in collective bargaining agreement negotiations for the hotel industry in the Balearic Islands and Madrid, directly monitored collective bargaining agreement negotiations for the hotel industry in Las Palmas and Tenerife, and reached agreements with local trade unions in relation to the wage agreements included in the collective bargaining agreement for the sector in the Canary Islands.\n\n> In relation to communication with our employees, we use a number of different channels, such as the corporate intranet, which offers spaces where employees can access information on their contracts, pay slips, social benefits, education and training, occupational health and safety programmes and advice, and, of course, all the Company's latest news.\n\nMeliá also offers a whistleblowing channel to all stakeholders, which can be used to report any rights violations.\n\nA Joint Training Committee was established in 2019 to promote a training policy designed to make the Company competitive and provide professional development for our employees, through continuous training programmes to enhance skills and expertise. This body meets at least once every six months and its primary mission is to plan, organise and manage training activities, using the funding provided for this purpose by the Spanish state foundation for employment training. Representing employees in Spain for any centres associated with the Commission (approximately 10,000 employees), the commission enables employees to raise any queries with the RLT related to their training and development within the Company.\n\n### **Representation of employees and other workers**\n\nAt Meliá, we are firmly committed to respecting the working rights of our employees all over the world, particularly regarding their right to participation and representation, which is an essential element of the governance model.\n\nThis commitment is reflected in the Meliá Hotels International Code of Ethics, which applies globally to all employees of the Group and incorporates our adherence to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Guidelines, which promote respect for and promotion of the principles and rights of freedom of association and the right to unionise, and effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of forced or compulsory labour, the abolition of child labour and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment or occupation.\n\nIn Spain, we maintain and strive for peaceful relations and social dialogue with all the main unions, which we work towards in a number of different ways. Firstly, we collaborate with union organisations that represent employees in each work centre (Company Committees or Staff Delegates), holding joint meetings to discuss any relevant workplace issues, along with subsequent follow-up meetings. And secondly, we hold regular meetings to provide information about any labour developments that could directly impact the company, to ensure that employee representatives receive consistent labour standards, which will help to avoid conflict later on. Lastly, Meliá is present in the negotiation of Collective Agreements in the sector, either directly or through different Associations from the Hotel industry in Spain.\n\nAt an international level, it is worth highlighting that in 2013 Meliá signed an agreement with the IUF (International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations), which internationally recognises the principles of freedom of association, protection of the right to form unions, collective bargaining and declares that it respects freedom of thought and the right of employees to form and join Unions. The aforementioned agreement was strengthened in 2019 with the signing of a specific agreement to combat sexual or workplace harassment.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nTABLE OF\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### CONTENTS **Decent wages**\n\nThe *human rights policy* approved by the Board of Directors in July 2018, established the guiding principle of offering fair and decent working and remuneration conditions. Under this premise, the Company establishes criteria for remuneration, compensation, and benefits that are decent, fair and appropriate for the work carried out by its employees, in a way that is aligned with their training, education, and level of responsibility, and in strict compliance with the applicable labour legislation in accordance with the laws of the country where they are operating. Also, it offers opportunities focused on achieving a work-life balance, it provides its employees with measures that enable this balance without undermining the Company's own needs and the reality of the sector it operates in.\n\nIn an increasingly globalised world, where people have access to international opportunities, it is important for companies to display their commitment to offering decent wages. At Meliá Hotels International, we not only provide access, we also encourage the international rotation of our employees with decent compensation for their work in order to ensure that they have a feeling of security and stability, and increase job satisfaction, productivity, and loyalty.\n\nThrough this commitment which seeks to align salaries according to the value of the work carried out, we continue to strengthen the vocation of service of our employees and encourage excellence.\n\nRewarding our employees fairly is essential to ensure that our staff feel part of a responsible and sustainable company, focused on teamwork in order to encourage the Company's innovation and efficiency.\n\nFor next year, 2024, our human resources team has planned a project to assess wages and the cost of local life, in the places where we operate, in order to assess where we can implement new initiatives that could improve the quality of life of our teams.\n\n### **Benefits for our employees**\n\nGRI: 2-20; 2-21; 2-23; 2-24\n\nThe *Human Resources Policy* of Meliá Hotels International, approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018 and with a global scope, outlines the need to promote a model of social benefits in accordance with the needs and demands of each working environment.\n\nOur aim is to encourage a more enriching work environment focused on the overall well-being of employees, by promoting different initiatives, with the aim of enriching the value proposal for our teams.\n\n## **My MeliáBenefits**\n\nThe implementation of *My MeliáBenefits* represents a significant step forward towards the creation of a more enriching work environment and one focused on the overall well-being of its employees. This platform not only offers tangible benefits such as My Flexible Remuneration, which adapts remuneration to individual needs, and My Discounts, which provides exclusive discount, but it also tackles essential aspects of daily life through sections such as My Insurance, My Finances, My Wellness, and My Social Responsibility.\n\nImage /page/156/Picture/14 description: The image shows the text 'PAY GAP' in green, followed by the number '1.05' in a large, gray font.

Likewise, the increasing adoption of cognitive technologies and the digitalisation of processes (automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence systems) are transforming the workforce and organisations are redesigning their jobs in order to take advantage of these technologies.\n\nAfter two years of teleworking, as a consequence of the pandemic, we were aware of the importance of analysing the opportunities that a hybrid work approach could offer us.\n\nDuring 2023 the methods of teleworking implemented in the Spanish enterprises were consolidated with the deployment of different work tools to strengthen communication and interaction between people, operation centres and hotels.\n\nTeleworking: 1 day and one afternoon Teleworking: 4 days At the workplace: 100% This hybrid work approach is aligned with our acknowledgement and respect of the right to digital disconnection in the workplace of our teams, so that, outside of the work time that is legally or conventionally established, their time for rest, leave, and holidays is respected, along with their personal and family privacy. Our commitment on this matter is included in the Human Resources Policy.\n\nAlso, in order to encourage respect and compliance we have a digital awareness course, which includes the obligatory training pathway that our employees must undertake in order to know the legal measures and policies adopted.\n\nWe ensure that employees are aware of the implications of hyperconnectivity and the impact it has and we encourage digital disconnection, always considering the well-being of our employees and ensuring that they have an appropriate work-life balance.\n\nWe also support work-life balance measures for employees who have children or who look after dependents, introducing greater flexibility in the support for school tutoring, medical appointments, shift changes and the\n\nImage /page/158/Figure/10 description: The image shows three different work models: Office First, Remote First, and Office. Office First is for employees with roles and responsibilities linked to the company's strategic vision, both with respect to design, definition, and implementation. Remote First is for those employees whose activity is highly specialized, standardized, and recurrent, which allows their activity to be monitored without requiring regular.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nAt Meliá Hotels International we have an Occupational Health and Safety Policy, with a global scope, which is aimed at establishing the principles and commitments within the framework of occupational health and safety and the well-being of employees, in all processes for the provision of service. This Policy was approved in 2018 by the Company's Board of Directors and updated in 2021. It is based on the ISO 45001:2018 standard, the certification we obtained in 2021, and renewed in 2022 and 2023, as well as the model of the World Health Organisation (WHO) for a Healthy Workplace. This policy is available to all interested parties on the *company website*.\n\n### **Management system for occupational health and safety**\n\nThe Company has an Occupational Health and Safety Policy, in accordance with ISO 45001:2018 certification, with a global scope that ensures compliance with legal, regulatory and contractual requirements, as well as compliance with the objectives set, providing the necessary tools to strengthen control, the measurement of progress and the identification of areas of improvement. This model includes the following instruments:\n\n- The manual for the Management System for Occupational Health and Safety and the Healthy Workplace Programme, designed according to ISO 45001:2018 and the parameters and recommendations of the World Health Organisation (WHO), ensuring a comprehensive plan that encompasses physical, mental, and cognitive health, and providing the necessary requirements to establish, implement and consolidate the established system.\n- The Occupational Health and Safety Procedures (OHSP), which describe the specific way of carrying out an activity or process within the Occupational Health and Safety System, in order to ensure compliance with the management system, facilitating the work of the teams affected.\n\n#### **MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY**\n\nImage /page/159/Figure/16 description: The image is a circular diagram illustrating different aspects of management. The diagram is divided into seven sections, each representing a different area of focus. The sections are labeled as follows: Definition & Objectives, Risk Management, Operational Management, Audit & Control, Communication & Publication, Resources & Investment, and Constant Improvement. Each section contains a list of related activities or considerations. For example, the Definition & Objectives section includes context of Melia and stakeholders, definition of objectives, goals and programmes, and planning and preventative management. The Risk Management section includes risk and opportunity assessment, health monitoring, emergency response, specific actions for particularly sensitive groups, and especially dangerous work. The Operational Management section includes operational management and control, documentary control and management, preparation, review and approval of procedures, and operating instructions for safety and health at work. The Audit & Control section includes external audit, internal audit, development and preventative review, investigation of incidents, verification of preventative activities, and management of regular inspections. The Communication & Publication section includes consultation and participation, information and constant training, and internal communication and distribution. The Resources & Investment section includes definition of required resources, acquisition of machinery, work equipment and products, and management of personal protective equipment. The Constant Improvement section includes change management, management of non-conformities, corrective and preventative actions, coordination of interdepartmental activities, and integration of new projects and modifications.\n\nEach procedure establishes different mitigation actions, by determining the object, scope, definitions, allocation of responsibilities, implementation of the procedure and records if applicable.\n\nBy way of example, in Health Monitoring (OHSP 11) control and monitoring of the health of staff is established in order to detect the symptoms of illnesses deriving from work and suggest measures to reduce the likelihood of damage, and in order to also carry out epidemiological analysis that enables us to\n\n{160}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONTENTS find out the effects of risks. The incident investigation procedure (OHSP 23) defines all the responsibilities, obligations, analysis and investigation methods and corrective measures to ensure that those incidents (occupational accidents and illnesses) do not occur again. In all of them, they are carried out for each of the incidents that occurred.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\nfollowing graphic:\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.

It is worth highlighting that each business unit is responsible for establishing its preventive action plans for the correction of measures established as a consequence of the result of the risk assessments and investigation of incidents relating to work (occupational accidents and illnesses).\n\nThese integration plans include a description of the scope of each action, the deadline, as well as information about the defined action. Also, each business unit is responsible for providing the financial resources needed to mitigate risk.\n\nThe *Risk Control & Compliance Department* also ensures the allocation of the financial resources needed for investments relating to this matter, with the *Health & Safety Director also participating.*\n\nIn 2023 we retained the certification of our Healthy Workplace Programme, which fulfils the required principles, including both individual and organisational actions to create healthy, safe, and stable working environments over time, where possible with the participation of all staff. The measures taken notably include the following:\n\n- The strengthening of training on wellbeing, healthy habits and occupational health and safety.\n- The improvement of spaces for carrying out activities focused on staff wellbeing (mindfulness, relaxation, etc.).\n\nImage /page/160/Figure/17 description: The image shows a diagram of business processes.

During 2024, this management model will be extended to all hotels in Mexico and the Dominican Republic.\n\nLastly, it is worth mentioning the celebration of our first Wellbeing Week, coinciding with World Mental Health Day. An initiative that included different activities to inspire, encourage a healthy and balanced lifestyle, as well as incorporating other topics such as financial health. The first activity was provided by the renowned speaker Dr. Mario Alonso Puig, under the title \"Keys to success to achieve our wellbeing at work\" with the attendance of 42% of the people registered.\n\n### **Assessment of risks and opportunities**\n\nAccording to the materiality analysis carried out by the Company, the health and safety, and wellbeing of staff is considered a highly relevant matter and positioned in the TOP 5 of the materiality matrix globally and for 40% of the participant stakeholders, which is why we work to consolidate our business model, by evaluating possible risks and developing measures to mitigate them.\n\nThe Company has consolidated a monitoring system aimed at the early identification of risks relating to this matter, as well as their evaluation and control, along with measures for the detection and assessment of opportunities. Responsibility for the management of the prevention of these risks lies with the entire Company and at all of its hierarchical levels. In particular, the *Health & Safety Director*, who directly reports to the *Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO)*, is the contact person and holds overall responsibility for the definition, management, and control of the Company's health and safety protocols globally. They are the manager responsible for creating, in certain destinations, a support structure to strengthen the prevention and care of customers and employees, and ensure alignment with the management system established by the global management. Specifically, this management has been strengthened with teams located in Mexico and the Dominican Republic, managing a volume of staff that amounts to 42.5% of the Group's total workforce.\n\nOn a regular basis, the technical team of the department of occupational health is supported by experts on this matter, as well as Consultancy firms and internal Health and Safety Commissions or Committees for the different business units. These commissions or committees are formed by the legal representation of company staff and representatives, they carry out a process of risk analysis in the different business units. These assessments include an analysis of the jobs at each hotel, the tasks assigned to each manager and the environment and facilities affected. Particularly in Spain, specific assessments are also carried out for occupational safety, industrial hygiene, ergonomics and psycho-sociology. In the other regions, there are external consultants or advisors who determine how these activities are implemented based on what is stipulated in current legislation.\n\nAlso, based on prevention and control plans, activity is monitored on a preventive basis. These services, assigned to the hotels, establish the frequency of the evaluations, always agreed with the consultation and participation bodies.\n\n**WORKFORCE REPRESENTED ON OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH & SAFETY COMMITTEES IN SPAIN**\n\nImage /page/161/Picture/14 description: The image shows the text \"88.8%\" in a large font, with the text \"(2022: 85.6%)\" in a smaller font directly below it.\n\n# **TRAINING HOURS**  47,416\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/162/Picture/1 description: The image shows the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\" in gray, with a small gray house icon to the left of the words.\n\n### CONTENTS **Progress in terms of health**\n\nGRI: 403-9; 403-10\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nOur ambition is to fulfil all the commitments and principles incorporated in this Policy, with the mission of ensuring the greatest levels of physical, mental, and cognitive health, even beyond compliance with the duties and obligations established by legislation, maximising the reduction of the number of occupational accidents and illnesses of our own and external employees.\n\nOn the other hand, to create and maintain a healthy workplace, it is essential to tackle the absenteeism caused by health conditions and problems. At the start of this year, we established goals with the aim of minimising the increase in cases of occupational contingency (occupational accidents and illnesses) and common contingency cases (common illnesses and non-workplace accidents), maintaining levels at under 8%.\n\n#### **OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH RATES - EMPLOYEES**\n\n|                                                                                                                   |        | OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENTS |       |       | PROFESSIONAL ILLNESS |      |      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------------|-------|-------|----------------------|------|------|\n| INDICATOR                                                                                                         | GENDER | 2021                   | 2022  | 2023  | 2021                 | 2022 | 2023 |\n| RATE/INCIDENCE RATE                                                                                               | M      | 33.96                  | 45.86 | 32.84 | 1.60                 | 0.11 | 0.00 |\n|                                                                                                                   | F      | 45.47                  | 50.51 | 54.39 | 2.64                 | 0.53 | 1.18 |\n|                                                                                                                   | TOTAL  | 38.81                  | 47.96 | 42.83 | 2.04                 | 0.30 | 0.55 |\n| RATE/FREQUENCY RATE                                                                                               | M      | 18.53                  | 25.55 | 18.33 | 0.87                 | 0.06 | 0.00 |\n|                                                                                                                   | F      | 25.20                  | 28.23 | 30.76 | 1.46                 | 0.29 | 0.67 |\n|                                                                                                                   | TOTAL  | 21.32                  | 26.76 | 24.05 | 1.12                 | 0.17 | 0.31 |\n| RATE/SEVERITY RATE                                                                                                | M      | 0.36                   | 0.45  | 0.34  | 0.02                 | 0.00 | 0.00 |\n|                                                                                                                   | F      | 0.46                   | 0.49  | 0.71  | 0.10                 | 0.02 | 0.04 |\n|                                                                                                                   | TOTAL  | 0.40                   | 0.51  | 0.51  | 0.05                 | 0.01 | 0.02 |\n| Nº OF OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENTS/<br>PROFESSIONAL ILLNESSES Nº<br>OF OCCUPATIONAL INCIDENTS/<br>PROFESSIONAL ILNESSES | M      | 212                    | 421   | 322   | 10                   | 1    | 0    |\n|                                                                                                                   | F      | 207                    | 383   | 461   | 12                   | 4    | 10   |\n|                                                                                                                   | TOTAL  | 419                    | 804   | 783   | 22                   | 5    | 10   |\n\n#### **ABSENTEEISM**\n\n|  | CLIMATE CHANGE                |                            |                        |         |         |                      |       |       |                    |           |           |                   |           |           |         |\n|--|-------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|---------|---------|----------------------|-------|-------|--------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|---------|\n|  |                               |                            | OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENTS |         |         | PROFESSIONAL ILLNESS |       |       | COMMON CONTINGENCY |           |           | TOTAL ABSENTEEISM |           |           |         |\n|  | INDICATOR                     | GENDER                     | 2021                   | 2022    | 2023    | 2021                 | 2022  | 2023  | 2021               | 2022      | 2023      | 2021              | 2022      | 2023      |         |\n|  | 5.

Some of the main initiatives undertaken are as follows:\n\n- Creation and implementation of the management system for health and safety.\n- Implementation of different training and awareness initiatives in order to encourage a culture of prevention, incorporating this area into the obligatory training programme for all the groups that it applies to.\n\nImage /page/163/Picture/7 description: The image shows the text 'TRAINING (HOURS PAX)' in green, followed by the number '4.3' in gray, and then '(2022: 3.1)' in gray.\n\n**HEALTH AND SAFETY** \n\n- Control and monitoring of sick leave due to common illness (in Spain through healthcare partners), where the indicators show a high incidence or complexity in absenteeism.\n- Strengthening of leadership quality processes.\n- Analysis of workloads and psychosocial aspects.\n\nIn addition to the external audits that are carried out annually, the Company plans internal audits annually, carried out by the Internal Audits department, —with the support of the department of Occupational Health— to ensure the correct application and control of the management system and verify shortcomings or more critical points, with the aim of ensuring their minimisation, thus contributing to ensuring a sound management system. During 2023, 14 internal audits were carried out in different business units.\n\nImage /page/163/Picture/12 description: The image shows the text \"INTERNAL AUDITS OF THE SYSTEM FOR OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH\" in green font at the top.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nOur 2030 Vision aims to position us among the world's leading hotel groups in the middle and upper segment, affirm our leadership in leisure hospitality and *bleisure*, and be recognised as a global leader for **excellence, responsibility, and sustainability.**\n\nMeliá Hotels International, in its *Commercial Policy*, with a global scope and approved by the Board of Directors in February 2017, establishes the guidelines that must govern our relationship with customers, based on the commitments outlined in the Code of Ethics:\n\n- To communicate and market our products and services in an honest and ethical way, avoiding misleading advertising campaigns.\n- Compete ethically in markets, being respectful and avoiding unfair competition.\n- Not to capture customers or information about our competitors using unethical methods.\n\nThe content of this Policy is applied without prejudice to what is established in national and international regulation and approved for application in any of the countries where the Company or any entity in its Group carry out activities.\n\n### **A customer-focused organisation**\n\nOur international presence in 38 countries globally (aggregate perimeter), and in 14 countries at a consolidated level which only includes the hotels within the financial perimeter (ownership and rental), enables us to manage a wide range of profiles that enriches our strategic vision, knowledge of the customer and their demands or expectations, avoiding any type of discrimination of any nature, creating an exclusive environment for all of our customers and anticipating customer needs.\n\nOur aim is to create long-term bonds with all of our customers and partners, ensuring the communication and marketing of our products and services with ethical, transparent, truthful and honest criteria.\n\nOur promotion of all the communication channels (website *App*, public relations ecosystems, social media, *customer service* and *contact centre,* among others) is a key and essential lever to strengthen and consolidate a direct relationship with the customer, whether end consumer or professional.\n\nKnowing what they value, especially our customers, is essential in order to ensure a value proposition aligned with their expectations, especially if we consider that the Company manages a customer base of over 45 million people worldwide. Among other initiatives, in 2021 the Company launched its third materiality analysis, with the aim of identifying the most important matters for our stakeholders. Considering the importance of this group and, their knowledge of our portfolio and brands, we devote efforts to ensuring their participation and evaluation, which was the largest of all the surveys received. As expected, the Customer experience was the most notable topic, making it into the TOP 5 of the most important fields for many of our stakeholders consulted.\n\nWe also provide our customers with the chance to inform us about their special needs through our platforms, including vulnerable groups so that they can enjoy our properties in comfort. Additionally, we send them a satisfaction survey to collect information about their stay and understand how their experience with us has been.\n\n158\n\n{165}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5. SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### CONTENTS **Communication channels with the customer**\n\nAn essential part to guarantee the high level of satisfaction of our customers and strengthen loyalty to Meliá Hotels International, is diligently and rigorously managing any eventuality or incident that our customers may report, on the different channels provided for that purpose.\n\nTo this end, on a daily basis the hotels manage situations and events that have occurred for which the customer needs an immediate response, using for example, a digital tool provided in order to enable the customer to request whatever they need during their stay during the check-in process, facilitating a quick and effective means of communication, as well as a prompt response to their needs.\n\nAnother of the channels provided for the customer to communicate any suggestion, reflection or shortcoming regarding their experience, stay, or service offered, is the mailbox at myexperiencia@melia.com, with which we undertake to continue improving our response times, reducing the waiting time for providing a response to a period of no more than 48 hours.\n\nFrom our entire portfolio globally, 72% of incidents received were resolved in less than 48 hours, meeting the target that the Company has set. None of the incidents were related to cases of non-compliance regarding information about services or marketing communications.\n\nThis year, we have implemented actions to improve the efficiency of the incident management process in the hotels located in the Dominican Republic and Mexico, as well in the hotels located in the city of Madrid (Spain), through the contracting of the services of the *GEX Service Center*, a cross-functional team that centralises the complaint management of all the hotels, in order to provide a better service and assistance to all customers staying in these destinations.\n\nThis initiative has made the management of incidents more agile, notably improving response times, as well as quality, and consequently customer satisfaction. Also, it has freed up operating teams from *back-office* tasks, enabling them to focus on offering a better service to customers, enriching their experience and ensuring one of the principles of the Company which is the vocation of service. The teams now operate in all the hotels located in Punta Cana (Dominican Republic), Mexico, and Madrid (Spain). In 2024 we will expand this new service to hotels located in the EMEA region.\n\nLikewise, the Social Media team manages all the messages that are published on our social networks, which can be of a varying nature: campaign, hotel information, booking requests, etc. This year, we resolved all the open cases of the 368,435 messages in an average response time of 12 hours, while in 2022, from the time we started the service in March up until December, we resolved almost half of the cases in an average response time of 11 hours.\n\n### **Satisfaction surveys**\n\nOne of the tools promoted by the Company for finding out the level of satisfaction of our customers, after their stay at our hotels are the satisfaction surveys. This questionnaire is sent to the customer at the end of their hotel stay with the aim of evaluating their experience and personalised according to the standards and attributes for each of the hotel brands.\n\nTo this end, Meliá Hotels International uses the **ReviewPRO** tool which makes it possible to consolidate information under the parameters that are important for the Company (brand, segment, management type, etc.).\n\nThe results obtained enable the business unit to check their score, find out the perception of customers and plan actions in order to improve results and meet the objectives set. Likewise, it makes it possible to reflect on the results obtained according to the standards and attributes established for each brand.\n\nImage /page/165/Picture/14 description: The image shows the text 'INCIDENTS RECEIVED' in green, followed by the number '3,297' in a large, gray font.

With the extraordinary result of 53.1, the Company has greatly surpassed the goal set for 2023 (9.6%). The positive trend of this indicator across all Group brands invites us to think about customer perception, which is returning to normality and the good work of our teams after the pandemic.\n\nMeliá Hotels International recorded a slight drop in the result of the *Guest Satisfaction Score (GSS)* rating of 2023, compared to the results of 2019 and 2022, finishing 0.6 points under the target set. However, the Gran Meliá, The Meliá Collection, ZEL and INNSiDE brands achieved the customer satisfaction goals set for 2023, a distinction that endorses the strategy of the Company to have growth focused on *Premium & Luxury* brands.\n\nThe general performance in the *Global Review Index* **(GRI)** is 87.4%, increasing the results of previous years and maintaining market reputation rates. These excellent reviews are accompanied by an 18% increase in the volume of online reviews compared to 2022.\n\nLastly, it is worth noting that the *Quality Penetration Index* **(QPI)**, has continued the upward trend displayed in recent years. We ended the year with **100.4%**, a figure never attained before by the Group, exceeding the global comparison goal.\n\n### **SATISFACTION INDICATORS Online reputation**\n\nDuring 2023, Meliá devoted considerable resources to improving the management of social media and the digital presence of brands has been strengthened, fulfilling the aim of encouraging greater interaction and engagement with the audience.\n\nAlongside this, the public relations activities were targeted at the proactive management of the reputation of our brands, as well as generating positive media coverage in order to increase the digital presence and interaction with the community through the:\n\n- Development of strategic, relevant, and appealing content in order to strengthen the connection with the audience, highlighting unique experiences, new developments implemented in our brands, with the aim of strengthening the positioning and values of each of our brands.\n- Launch of personalised and segmented campaigns in order to adapt to the preferences of different audiences, harnessing personalisation and data analysis tools.\n- Encouragement of strategic partners that make it possible to consolidate relationships both within the field of influencers, and with similar brands in order to amplify our audience, scope, and presence on social media.\n- Strengthening of our relationship with the customer, through social platforms, responding proactively to enquiries, comments or other questions thus ensuring more personalised and effective service and assistance.\n- Optimisation of advanced analytics that makes it possible to assess our performance in different projects, including social media, in order to identify areas of improvement and adjust the strategy, according to the results obtained.\n- Creation of interactive experiences, such as surveys, competitions, and online events, in order to encourage participation in the community and generate content created by the user themselves.\n- Collaboration with a dozen global agencies present in 190 countries (social fans presence) and we have a significant fanbase spread among several platforms.\n\nImage /page/166/Picture/24 description: The image shows the text \"SOCIAL MEDIA PROFILES\" in green, followed by the number \"460\" in gray.\n\n**SOCIAL MEDIA USERS** 11M\n\n{167}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/167/Picture/1 description: The image shows a house icon next to the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\".\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.

With the firm commitment of improving our positioning in relation to our competitors and charting a greater future course for our hotels, the brand architecture has been meticulously updated with our sights set on the future, which matches the change in our vision of new luxury with our traditional focus, which is customer centred, adapted to the different interests and expectations of each profile.\n\nThis new architecture strengthens the positioning and reputation of the group, as a whole, and strengthens our vision targeted at those *premium* brands, as well as others associated with the *luxury* segment, focused on increasing the capture of customers with high purchase power who consider the characteristics of each destination.\n\nImage /page/167/Figure/7 description: The image shows a breakdown of the Melia hotel brands. The luxury brands are Gran Melia (4.9%), The Melia Collection (2.3%), ME by Melia (2.3%), and Paradisus by Melia (3.4%).

Therefore, next year in 2024 we want to undertake the challenge of bringing this experience to the customer with an appealing narrative, that can be perceived during their stay at the hotel and valued in the purchasing decision.\n\nWe are aware that bridging the gap between the customer and the sustain-\nable attributes that we are committed to is a challenge given that it is nec-\n\nImage /page/168/Figure/7 description: The image displays a diagram outlining sustainable attributes.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\nCONTENTS As part of our commitment to sustainability and excellence, we have requested information from each of our hotels about the attributes that form part of the Company's positioning in terms of sustainability and for each of the brands. This questionnaire is an essential component and is valued both internally and by tour operators, and it provides visibility to customers about the sustainable practices that each hotel integrates into their value proposal.\n\n> With this information we have been able to relaunch a certification process for hotels under ESG criteria with the aim of providing visibility, both for the business units and all of our stakeholders, about the level of criteria implemented in our portfolio, and have selected entities of renowned prestige in order to make progress on this process. Of the hotels in global integration, 90% comply with sustainable certification according to the standards of the GSTC and 94% have obtained sustainable certification.\n\n# 1 IN 3 OPENINGS ARE OUR LUXURY BRANDS\n\n### **Consolidating our luxury strategy**\n\nMeliá Hotels International is committed to strengthening the reputation and recognition of the hotels that are unique, which are focused on attracting high value customers seek a personalised luxury experience.\n\nInternationally renowned entities and leaders in the luxury and *premium* segment who assess, using a set of demanding standards, the hotels that we want to be leaders in luxury hospitality around the world.\n\nOn the other hand, as part of their experience, we want our customers to notice the commitments made in terms of sustainability and appreciate how they are integrated into the hotel itself, however we are aware of the challenge posed by bringing them closer to this reality individually in each business unit.\n\n### **MELIÁ PRO committed to the luxury segment**\n\nMeliá PRO coordinates the entire communication strategy for the B2B segments, through specific campaigns and programmes that encompass all of the Group's brands, more at the end of this chapter.\n\nThe *BRAVOS Meliá PRO Selected Club* programme offers a platform that is aimed and designed to offer the best benefits and services to the luxury segment, with an exclusive programme for travel agencies specialising in high value customers.\n\nThe vision of Meliá PRO *Business Traveller Benefits & Rewards* stands out, launched in 2022 it aims to encourage business trips through special rates and benefits designed to meet the needs of current business travellers. This programme continues to expand to new hotels and, at present, it is available in 80 of the Group's properties.\n\n### **Enriching the experience**\n\nWe aim to build lasting relationships based on the trust and loyalty of our customers. We use levers that motivate us each day: the vocation for service and the values of proximity and excellence, the hallmarks of Meliá Hotels International.\n\nCustomers are increasingly demanding and request authentic and differential services, aligned with their preferences and needs. Within a context of endless change, we strive to adapt our commercial model to the new challenges of the tourist industry, without losing sight of the relationship with the customer. To this end, in addition to strengthening our organisational structure, we have also strengthened its coordination and adapted the overall framework to the situation in each region and destination where we operate.\n\nAlso, we devote economic and human resources to support our digital transformation and to turning each point of the *customer journey* into an opportunity to get to know our customers better. We encourage the creation of spaces for dialogue where we obtain the customer's opinion, first hand, to evaluate and consider it.\n\n*LEADING HOTELS OF THE WORLD MEMBER HOTELS*\n\nImage /page/169/Picture/18 description: The image contains the number 8, which is formed by two vertically stacked circles of equal size.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### CONTENTS **Destination Inclusive**\n\nParadisus by Meliá has incorporated the *Destination Inclusive* concept, a brand that is already a leader in the Latin American market and implemented, for the first time in Spain, in a leading holiday destination such as the Canary Islands. Destination Inclusive Paradisus Gran Canaria and Paradisus Salinas enrich the expression of the brand, enabling customers to connect and delve into the aspects of the destination that make it unique. It offers new experiences, focused on cultural and local gastronomy for examples, customers can immerse themselves in private classes with local chefs and receive personalised yoga sessions next to a natural well with crystal-clear waters.\n\n### **Safe environments**\n\nEquality, diversity, and inclusion are cornerstones of our Code of Ethics and they are also becoming essential vectors for competitiveness and business. According to the World Tourism Organisation (WTO), LGBT tourism has experienced continuous growth in recent years. The figures published reveal that the LGTB community accounts for 10%-20% of tourists globally and represents 16% of total travel spending, equivalent to almost 200 billion Euros a year.\n\nAccordingly, during 2023 we have worked to ensure that some Company hotels obtain the *Travel Proud* certification, a programme promoted by Booking.com which aims to aid the understanding of the specific challenges that this community faces in its trips and to offer a positive and inclusive travel experience. The programme goes beyond certification as it offers the chance to provide training to hotels and their teams in order to ensure inclusive and safe treatment. At the end of this year the Company has certified 30 hotels and it expects to certify 160 hotels around the world during 2024.\n\nOn the other hand, Meliá Hotels International has partnered with the leading company in the LGBTQ+ travel sector, *Queer Destinations* offering these travellers the chance to enjoy exceptional holidays in seven of our hotels located in Mexico, Madrid, the Dominican Republic and New York, identified as *Queer Destinations Committed*. This partnership also strengthens our staff training, in an inclusive atmosphere based on respect, empathy, etc.\n\n### **A healthy gastronomic offer**\n\nThe *Food & Beverage (F&B)* area is immersed in a significant transformation process to enhance the appeal of our brands, products and services from a gastronomic perspective. Our portfolio is enriched with a unique and differential value proposal, which enables customers and residents, to discover the gastronomic concepts that have been devised for each of our brands, always being very mindful of the peculiarities and attributes of each of them.\n\nWe want our gastronomic offer to also be a lever for innovation and sustainability. Under this premise, we have designed a new proposal devised for the future, which enhances the positioning of our product and responds to the peculiarities of each area, helping to optimise our management, improve profitability, with a focus on attracting and gaining the loyalty of our customers.\n\nChanges in new consumption habits show a growing interest in a diet that is increasing wholesome and healthy, based on local produce, and which contributes to taking care of ecosystems and the planet. The ability to offer a quality, attractive and valued culinary offering becomes an important differentiating element, including for the events and conferences segment (MICE).\n\nFor the urban hotels located in Europe, the Company has designed the *Mediterranean Comfort Food Menu* concept aimed at encouraging a culinary offering with a greater presence of vegetarian products, with the vision of adapting our menus to the new demands of customers who value a healthy and Mediterranean diet. This new offer also helps to reduce our water footprint and carbon emissions.\n\nLikewise, as a responsible company that is committed to the health and wellness of our customers, we have reduced our alcoholic beverages menu, and offer a menu focused on alcohol-free or natural drinks.\n\nAlso, all our hotels provide, at the customer's request, the fourteen allergens and the chart of allergens that we inform our customers about relating to the content of their food.\n\nImage /page/170/Picture/15 description: The image shows the number 30 in a simple, sans-serif font.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe range of products offered by the Company is selected ensuring high quality standards, and also ensure compliance with legal requirements and the ban on purchasing products that contain additives that are harmful to health, for example ADA, BHA and BHT or BVO. Thus, our customers can have access to a nutritious and healthy offer, complying with the requirements of the European Union in terms of *Food to Fork and the Fitness Check***.**\n\n### **ROAD TO NET ZERO EVENTS**\n\nAccording to a survey by American Express, 78% of participants outlined the commitment to NET ZERO emissions in their organisations. In terms of event organisation, although it is still not an essential factor, it is gaining momentum year after year and we envisage gradual growth over the coming years. At present, 13% consider it to be an aspect to incorporate into their requirements.\n\nMeliá Hotels International, with the aim of furthering the integration of its sustainability strategy in the commercial sphere, has designed technology that allows it to measure the carbon footprint (scope 1 and 2) in all the *MICE* hotels selected. With the support and expert knowledge of Creast, a company that specialises in measuring the carbon footprint of large events, an innovative programme *ROAD TO NET ZERO EVENTS* has been created, with the aim of achieving carbon neutral events, allowing us to measure the environmental impact of the groups at two times: when making the application for the event and at the end of it.\n\nThe technology developed communicates and interacts with the Company's computer systems, as well as the sales force, in a way that speeds up processes for the teams affected and, it prevents unnecessary administrative tasks and calculations.\n\nWith the aim of testing the tool, the Company has selected two pilot hotels, located in Spain and Germany, with the aim of testing how the tool functions and the calculation of the carbon footprint.\n\nThe measurement calculates the carbon emissions generated during the event, considering both the emissions produced during the hotel stay, and those produced in meeting rooms. The differential aspect of this project is the measurement of the footprint in the restaurant and catering services, as well as other consumables that can be offered during the celebration of the event.\n\nThe measurement of the carbon footprint, will enable us to enrich our knowledge of the environmental impact of the *MICE* segment in each hotel and identify opportunities to develop our range of products and services, with the aim of being more efficient and also, raise awareness among events organisers in the proposals considering the environmental variable in their decision-making process.\n\nAll the events will be offset once they have ended, either through the programme of the organising company or through the programme of the Company *The Planet We Love*, using, in this case, credits certified by the United Nations.\n\nIn the first few months of 2024 we will begin the gradual roll-out of this tool and its management model in fourteen of the Group's hotels and we estimate that we will complete the *roll-out* of all the hotels specialising in the meetings, incentives, conferences and events segment before the end of 2025, which covers 80 hotels.\n\n### **MeliáRewards**\n\nOur *MeliáRewards* loyalty programme supports this strategy, focused on enhancing our portfolio of high value customers, through an innovative methodology in order to identify our most valuable customers and optimise our communications with them, adding specific initiatives aimed at influential travel agents in this segment, with the aim of encouraging the improvement of our occupancy rates for superior rooms and suites.\n\n{172}------------------------------------------------\n\n2023 has been an exceptional period for the *MeliáRewards* loyalty programme marked by growth, innovation and the ongoing commitment to excellence in customer satisfaction and sustainability. These advances consolidate Meliá's position as a leader in loyalty programmes in the hotel industry.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.

The deep understanding of customers was the basis for offering highly personalised experiences and strengthening the long term connection with its members.\n\nOver the course of 2023, the Meliá Loyalty Programme reached significant milestones, consolidating its status as an essential component in the company's strategy. The following aspects highlight the key developments and notable achievements throughout the year.\n\n#### **Personalisation and ad hoc communications**\n\n*MeliáRewards* continues to improve its communication model through the lifecycle of the customer, notably with an innovative *Account statement* model with 20 different versions. This has introduced advanced levels of personalisation and reinvigorated content, significantly improving the user experience and its effectiveness.\n\n### **Campaign management**\n\n*MeliáRewards* has been an effective driver of demand, with a historic record of 90 campaigns carried out under the loyalty programme, including all of its brands, hotels, and destinations, including a points component. The annual campaign *The MeliáRewards Effect: the more you travel, the greater the Rewards* included a credit in points component to enjoy at hotels, achieving an outstanding redemption rate of 53%, setting an especially high record for luxury holiday hotels.\n\nSupporting the group's strategy, *MeliáRewards* has implemented campaigns aimed at both the end customers, incentivising the bookings for suites and villas, as well as travel agents, offering special commission and extra *MeliáRewards* points.\n\nImage /page/172/Figure/17 description: The image shows three sections of text. The first section, titled \"Reservations,\" discusses offering better information to users during the booking process, giving greater visibility to experiences, activities in the destination, packages, or other extra services available to complement their stay. The second section, titled \"MeliáRewards,\" focuses on making the MeliáRewards loyalty program more visible and relevant while digitizing key customer interactions. The third section, titled \"The Stay,\" describes a digital directory of all hotel information, including restaurant information, activity schedules, and menus. It improves the management of requests such as check-in, check-out, digital key, and reservations for hotel services, integrating the app with other company platforms like Stay, Hmobile, or Revo.\n\n#### **Progress towards loyalty ecosystems**\n\nDuring 2023, we continued growth in the *Partners* vertical, both in terms of issuance and redemption, enabling us to convey the usefulness of the programme while in-house, at the time of the trip, and in daily life.\n\nWe wish to highlight the integration of *MeliáEscapes powered by Logitravel*, making it possible to obtain and redeem points, for all the elements contracted (flight, hotel, experiences ,etc.), as well as the agreement with the new high speed operator IRYO, and the incorporation of the *Vietnam Airlines Lotus Miles* programme, supporting the significant expansion in the Asia-Pacific region and particularly in Vietnam.\n\n{173}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/173/Picture/1 description: The image shows a house icon next to the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\".\n\nREPORT\n\n### CONTENTS **A digital experience**\n\nABOUT THIS an obligation in the business sector.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\n### CONTENTS **Technology to improve the satisfaction of our customers**\n\nDuring 2023, we focused on redesigning the key processes in order to increase efficiency, speed and customer satisfaction. With the aim of harmoniously integrating the online procedures into the physical operations of our receptions. This strategy requires offering greater autonomy to the customer throughout their *Customer Journey* along with simplifying the procedures for our reception times and cutting waiting times.\n\nThe reconfiguration of the *check-in* process includes aligning the digital process with the traditional one, allowing the digital *check-in* to be carried out on the same day as arrival, offering the customer complete autonomy to complete the process, from entering personal details, to formalising the legal documents required, and incorporating a key dispenser where customers can obtain a room key by scanning a QR code, once the room is ready for the customer to enter.\n\nThe digital *check-out* encompasses the payment phase and other information at the end of the stay. The customer can carry out the entire process, from the verification of expenditure up to payment, with the option of adding minibar consumption during it.\n\nBoth processes have been adapted to work in a web version, thus increasing the scope to a greater number of customers and creating a much smoother and much more satisfactory experience. At present, these two digital processes are implemented in seven Company hotels, and their expansion is planned for 2024, for all the hotels in 4 countries where the customer can enjoy greater autonomy.\n\n### **Next generation Meliá PRO & B2B Portal**\n\nWe ended 2023 with the launch of a new website for all the professionals in the sector: travel agents, companies, event organisers and specialised agencies.\n\nThis channel reproduces the design created on melia.com, integrating the same principles, values and criteria of excellence, as well as their integration with *MeliáRewards*, offering the specific benefits of our loyalty programme to these groups.\n\nWith Meliá PRO, we have further strengthened the commitment to the success of professional customers which is experiencing exponential growth.

The aim is for the customer to feel unique and important, by personalising their experience, making them the real star.\n\n> This has required a training and education plan for our teams, designing training itineraries focused on both the use of tools and the improvement of communication and business skills, ensuring that a personalised experienced is offered and enriching the customer profile.\n\nDuring 2023 we undertook the implementation of a CCaaS tool that will enable us to migrate to the *cloud* and relocate our advisors to locations where demand requires it.

SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION**\n\n**6.** ANNEXES\n\nThe Company currently operates in fourteen countries, with realities that have very different social and cultural environments. The social purpose of Meliá Hotels International is focused on identifying opportunities to generate a positive impact, in an increasingly changing environment and with needs of different importance, on a social and economic level.\n\nThe tourism sector is undoubtedly a key driver for the creation of wealth globally, both for societies that receive and send tourists, it has consolidated its status as one of the primary sources of income, employment, and growth in global economies, and also provides an extensive network of international, national, and local suppliers as a result of its activity.\n\nCreating value and redistributing it among our stakeholders is, in our opinion, the best way to generate a positive impact in the destinations. Furthermore, with the desire to go beyond our activity, we encourage environmental, social, and cultural initiatives, involving the local entities, where we have a presence.\n\nWe have a different impact in each setting, whether tangibly (with a direct or redistributed economic contribution), or intangible, thanks to the sharing of knowledge and influence targeted at achieving a change, helping to improve the tourist value chain or enriching the entities that we interact and collaborate with.\n\nIn 2018, the Board of Directors approved the *Philanthropy Policy*, whose contents strengthen the approaches linked to consolidating ethical and responsible conduct with the aim of encouraging a model that contributes directly to social support in destinations and to building a fairer and more equitable society, including all of our staff, the communities who live and work close to the hotel and our entire value chain, Likewise, this document is aligned with the following reference frameworks:\n\n- European Directive on the protection of persons who report breaches of European Union law\n- The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights\n- United Nations Global Compact\n- OECD Guidelines for Enterprises\n- ILO Declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work\n\nWe also extend the application of this policy to the promotion of human rights, the wellbeing of children and society, and also the fight against the commercial sexual exploitation of children and child prostitution, affirming our commitment to the EPCAT code, and we were the first signatory tourist company fifteen years ago.\n\nThe *Social Cash Flow* shows how we redistribute the wealth generate, by providing visibility for the volume of collections and payments made and distributed among all our stakeholders, making it possible to trace the movement of incoming and outgoing cash flows. Our activity helps to invigorate local economies, to drive investments, the acquisition of products and services, as well as the recruitment of the workforce and the payment of taxes, among others.\n\n{177}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/177/Figure/1 description: The image shows the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\" in gray text, with a gray house icon to the left of the words.\n\n#### **SOCIAL CASH FLOW**\n\nImage /page/177/Figure/3 description: This image shows a breakdown of incoming and outgoing value. The incoming value is divided between customers (2,935.5€M, 99.9%) and divestments (3.0€M, 0.1%).

The technology platform launched during 2022 provides a system for the approval, monitoring and control of donations and the direct voluntary work carried out as well as a record of the entities involved. Each hotel has its own space for monitoring the information of its initiatives, ensuring permanent alignment with our policy, strategy, and management system and increasing data quality for reporting this information, both qualitative and quantitative.\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.

Within this context, the EU Taxonomy Regulation came into force in mid 2020 and established some new obligations that companies must fulfil.\n\nThe Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 18 June 2020, on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment (henceforth, \"the Taxonomy\" or \"the Regulation\") aims to serve as a standard and obligatory classification system for determining which economic activities are considered \"environmentally sustainable\" in the EU.\n\nAt present, the EU has published a catalogue of sustainable activities that encompass the six environmental objectives: climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, pollution prevention and control, the transition to a circular economy, the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. Thus, each year companies must report on the classification of their activities as environmentally sustainable in accordance with the EU Taxonomy. To this end, an initial distinction between Taxonomy-Eligibility and Taxonomy-Alignment is required.\n\nFirstly, it is necessary to examine if an activity is eligible. The eligibility of an activity is based on its similarity to the descriptions detailed in the delegated acts of the Taxonomy, which establish the technical criteria and requirements for each environmental objective. These descriptions are linked to a series of NACE codes which aim to guide the exercise of eligibility analysis.\n\nA second step requires analysis of whether the taxonomy-eligible activities previously identified can be considered to be aligned with the Taxonomy, and thus, environmentally sustainable. For an eligible activity to be considered aligned, it is necessary to simultaneously meet three criteria:\n\n- The activity should make a substantial contribution (SC) to an environmental objective,\n- The activity should do no significant harm (DNSH) to the other environmental objectives; and,\n- The company should respect a series of minimum safeguards.\n\n## **1.2 Objective and scope**\n\nAccording to its article 1.1, Regulation (EU) 2020/852 is applicable to companies that are subject to the obligation of publishing a non-financial statement or a consolidated non-financial statement in accordance with article 19 bis or article 29 bis of the Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, respectively.\n\nIn accordance with the aforementioned regulatory obligations, Meliá Hotels Internacional S.A. (henceforth \"the company\" or \"Meliá\") is obliged to comply with Regulation (EU) 2020/852, and to report on the specific key performance indicators in relation to the eligibility and alignment of its activities, in the planned form and substance.\n\nTherefore, in accordance with the aforementioned regulatory requirement, and based on analysis of the economic activities carried out by Meliá, this document reports the percentage of the turnover/ CapEx /OpEx eligible and\n\n191\n\n{198}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONTENTS aligned in accordance with the Taxonomy in their respective totals for the 2023 tax year. The calculation of these KPIs has been carried out for the consolidated Group and the companies that are part of it, taking into account that they meet the criteria established by the regulation on the information used as a basis for all the indicators.\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6. ANNEXES**\n\nThis year, the study carried out by Meliá has taken into account the regulatory developments that apply to the data of the 2023 tax year, which include the obligation to analyse, in addition to the eligibility and alignment of the activities of the objectives of Mitigation of climate change and the Objectives of Adaptation to Climate Change, the eligibility of the four remaining objectives: Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, Transition towards a circular economy, Prevention and control of pollution, and Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. Thus, as shall be indicated in the following sections, it has been identified that the main activity of Meliá is included as eligible in taxonomic activity 2.1 of the objective for the Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems: Hotels, holiday resorts, camping grounds and similar accommodation.\n\n### **2. Main results**\n\n### **2.1 KPIs**\n\nIn the year corresponding to the 2023 tax year, Meliá recorded a total turnover of €1,733 Mn (+15%) with a total CapEx of €77 Mn (-24%), and a total OpEx of €159 Mn (+28%). The significant variation in these figures is mainly due to the revival of the hotel operation in a year of recovery for the tourist sector.\n\nThe eligibility analysis has concluded that, from the aforementioned figures, the following are eligible:\n\n#### **TAXONOMY SUMMARY TABLE**\n\n| INDICATOR  | REF. | BREAKDOWN              | 2022             | 2023             |\n|------------|------|------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| A.

Hotels, holiday resorts, camping grounds and similar accommodation\" in the COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2023/2486, of 27 June 2023, completing l Regulation (EU) 2020/852 by establishing the technical selection criteria for determining the conditions in which an economic activity will be considered to substantially contribute to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, to the transition towards a circular economy, to the prevention and control of pollution, or to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nIn this regard, given the nature of the Company's economic activities and considering what is outlined in the \"Commission Notice on the interpretation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of EU Taxonomy Regulation on the reporting of eligible economic activities and assets (2022/C 385/01)\", specifically in section 3 which defines what a taxonomy-eligible economic activity is, the increase of the reference volumes that may be adapted in the future is undeniable.\n\n{199}------------------------------------------------\n\n### CONTENTS **2.1.1 Turnover (Revenue)**\n\n| ABOUT THIS<br>REPORT                | Figures in EUR million                                                                            |                                                                   |       |               |                       |                                 |                                 | SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION                            |                                          |                                     |                                                                    |                                 |                                 | ABSENCE OF SIGNIFICANT HARM                         |                                          |                                     |                                                                    |                    |                                                               | MS               |                     |  |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------|--|\n| 1.

ANNEXES**\n\n## CONTENTS **2.2 Accounting policy**\n\nIn compliance with point 1.2.1 of Annex I of Commission Delegated Regulation supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852, the way in which the turnover, investments in fixed assets and operating expenses were determined and assigned to both the numerator and denominator of each reported indicator is described below.\n\nIn this regard, the calculation of the amount and percentage of the eligibility of the activities of Meliá within the different indicators, has used the full amount of the specific turnover, CapEx and OpEx required by the regulation for the different activities in accordance with their eligibility.\n\n### **2.2.1 Turnover**\n\nIn the case of the turnover indicator, based on the income statements, the accounts to process have been selected based on the Delegated Regulation (EU) of the Commission, as well as the *Final Report- Advice on article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulatio*n published by the ESMA on 26 February 2021.\n\nThus, the income accounts recognised for accounting purposes have been selected in accordance with IAS 1, paragraph 82, letter a): ordinary income, indicating separately interest income calculated according to the effective interest rate method. This income includes:\n\n- the ordinary income from contracts with customers recorded in accordance with IFRS 15;\n- income from leases registered in accordance with IFRS 16, both income from operational leases and income from financial leases, income from interest on accounts receivable from financial leases and other accounts receivable calculated using the effective interest method; and,\n- other sources of income, when applicable.\n\nFor the calculation of the denominator, the income statement of Meliá is used, selecting only the accounts according to the pre-defined accounting criteria. These accounts are as follows: (a) sale of rooms, (b) sales of food, (c) sales of beverages, (d) sales of different services, (e) sales of derivative activities, (f) sale of real estate assets, (g) returns on sales, (h) provision of different services, (i) billing for commissions from loyalty programmes, and (j) income from franchise fees.\n\nThe final figure will be the sum total of these accounts in the consolidated result after adjustments, as they all comply with the criteria of the European Union Regulation.\n\nFor the calculation of the numerator, the same income statement of Meliá is used as the one that was used to calculate the denominator, but only the items that were considered eligible based on their analysis in relation to the Taxonomy are included. To this end, an initial differentiation is carried out evaluating the economic activity of each company that makes up the Group's result. Having determined the companies whose activity is considered eligible according to the regulation, the results are identified which are linked to Assets Owned or Rented which are part of the processes of activity \"2.1. Hotels, holiday resorts, camping grounds and similar accommodation\"\n\n### **2.2.2 CapEx**\n\nFor the calculation of this KPI, the detail of the CapEx per project has been extracted from analytical accounting. Based on this data and, following the criteria defined in Annex I and II, section 1.1 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) of the Commission, the types that must be included according to the regulatory mandate have been selected, i.e. those that have been registered in accordance with International Accounting Standards (henceforth, IAS). The types defined for these purposes are: (a) Expansion – rebranding and pre-opening, (b) IT, (c) Business, (d) Operations, (e) Strategic Plan, and (f) Risks.\n\nWhen applying the international financial reporting standards (IFRS) adopted by Regulation (EC) No. 1126/2008, the Group will include the costs posted to accounts in accordance with:\n\n{203}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n- **1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n- **2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n- **3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6. ANNEXES**\n\n- CONTENTS \n IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, paragraph 73, letter e), items i) and iii);\n\t- IAS 38 Intangible Assets, paragraph 118, letter e), item i);\n\t- IAS 40 Investment Property, paragraph 76, letters a) and b), (for the fair value model);\n\t- IAS 40 Investment Property, paragraph 79, letter d), items i) and ii), (for the cost model);\n\t- IFRS 16 Leases, paragraph 53, letter\n\t- Additionally, the capital expenditure carried out through joint ventures has been considered as CapEx.\n\nThe calculation of the denominator is based on a list of group projects with consolidated information after adjustments, taking into account those that can be considered CapEx in accordance with article 8, and indicating whether the project should be chosen based on the accounting criteria established by the Regulation. The total sum of the amounts in these projects constitutes the denominator.\n\nThe calculation of the numerator uses the same list of group projects, but this time only including the projects that are considered eligible in accordance with the criteria established by the Taxonomy. In addition to this list, the taxonomy CapEx linked to activity 2.1 of Annex IV of the objective on the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems has been added. Hotels, holiday resorts, camping grounds and similar accommodation.\n\n### **2.2.3 OpEx**\n\nFor the OpEx indicator, the Group's consolidated income statements after adjustments have been used as the base information in order to avoid duplication.\n\nIn accordance with the regulations, (Annex I, paragraph 1.1 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU); and *Final Report- Advice on article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation* published by the ESMA on 26 February 2021) the accounts that need to be taken into consideration for the calculation have been selected. Thus, the OpEx calculation will only include non-capitalised direct costs recorded in the income statement for the year relating to:\n\n- Research and development expenses.\n- Short-term lease expenses.\n- Maintenance and repairs, as well as other direct related expenses that are required to guarantee the continued and efficient operation of said assets.\n- The aforementioned operating expenses carried out through joint ventures will also form part of the OPEX. However, the operating expenses of joint ventures will not be considered as such.\n\nThe calculation of the denominator is based on the income statement of Meliá, taking the following accounts selected according to the pre-defined criteria, which are as follows: (a) Other Rentals, (b) Other Rentals IFRS16, (c) High or Low Value Rentals, (d) Low Value Rentals, (e) Royalties and others, (f) Off-Shore Rentals, (g) Repairs and Maintenance, (h) Rentals from Hotels, (i) Rental from Hotels IFRS16. Meliá does not have an account item relating to R+D.\n\nTherefore, the OpEx denominator consists of the sum of these accounts for the companies in the consolidated Group.\n\nThe calculation of the numerator of the OpEx indicator is based on the figure obtained from the calculation of the denominator, but including only those accounts and items that are considered eligible in accordance with the Taxonomy Regulation and following the same criteria described in the previous sections, i.e. that they are assets that are intrinsically linked to the activity: Hotels, holiday resorts, camping grounds and similar accommodation.\n\n### **2.2.4 Double counting**\n\nWith the aim of avoiding double counting of the figures of the aforementioned activities, the organisation has established the necessary supervision and control measures in order to ensure the consistency and reliability of the information extraction and transformation, and thus ensure the integrity and traceability of the information from its origin to the reporting of the calculated indicators. To this end, the company has defined the appropriate responsibilities and mechanisms for segregating functions that allow the tasks in the process to be supervised, and also to ensure the standardisation of accounting\n\n{204}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.

Thus, the taxonomy analysis of this fiscal year, 2023, concluded that 89% of Revenue, 97% of the CapEx and 29% of the OpEx of Meliá Hotels International will be eligible within activity 2.1.\n\nAccording to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486, of 27 June 2023, completing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the eligibility and alignment results relating to the information corresponding to the 2023 financial year relating to the objectives of Mitigation of climate change and of Adaptation to climate change, and only the eligibility of the four new objectives should be included.\n\nDue to the above and in view of the low participation in eligible economic activities linked to the objectives of Mitigation of climate change and of Adaptation to climate change, this analysis will focus on the eligibility of activity 2.1. Hotels, holiday resorts, camping grounds and similar accommodation, and a pre-assessment of the future alignment.\n\n### **2.3.2 Substantial contribution criteria (SCC)**\n\nWith regard to the substantial contribution, as we have stated, the activity Hotels, holiday resorts, camping grounds, and similar accommodation naturally becomes the one of greatest relevance. Therefore, we will further our analysis of the criteria for the contribution to the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems in future years with the objective of achieving the alignment of our activities where possible.\n\nThis analysis will result in extending the assessment that we present in the section Management of biodiversity and ecosystems, and also identifying and approaching organisations responsible for the conservation of the zones close to the tourist destinations that house our accommodation in order to establish collaboration agreements.\n\n### **2.3.3 Do no significant harm (DNSH) criteria**\n\nOn the other hand, regarding the criteria of doing no significant harm relating to activity, specifically those relating to the adaptation to climate change, while it is true that, during 2021 we aligned Meliá's climate change management to the recommendations guide prepared by the Task Force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) working group, we have decided to apply conservative criteria when evaluating the alignment of our activities and we believe we need to analyse each particular asset in the assessment of the risks and opportunities related to climate change and the way we manage them. In view of the foregoing, and due to the aforementioned need, we believe that at present our activities cannot be considered to be aligned in accordance with the criteria established in the Regulation.\n\nIn view of what has been outlined, and in accordance with what is described in the section on Climate change and Energy, this review takes on even greater importance and encourages us to update and improve the analysis of climate risks associated with our property portfolio in 2024.\n\n{205}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\nCONTENTS On the other hand, we will analyse the remaining DNSH criteria in order to establish a plan that eventually enables us to adapt our assets in order to do no harm to the mitigation of climate change and to none of the other objectives established in these regulations.\n\n> It is worth highlighting the Company will face a significant challenge to achieve alignment, requiring strategic and sustained efforts to attain it. Although it is important to acknowledge that immediate success may not be attainable in the short-term, the approach that we adopt gives us confidence in eventual favourable results.\n\n**2.4 Information regarding minimum safeguards** GRI: 206-1; 416-2; 417-2; 417-3; 418-1\n\n### **2.4.1 Introduction**\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6. ANNEXES**\n\nIn addition to complying with a series of objective technical criteria for each of its activities, alignment depends on compliance, by the Company, with a series of minimum safeguards.\n\nEssentially, the purpose of the Minimum Safeguards (MS) outlined in Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council consists of preventing an investment being classified as sustainable if it entails negative impacts on:\n\n- Human Rights, including the rights of workers.\n- The fight against corruption and bribery\n- Tax matters.\n- Competition law.\n\nThese minimum safeguards do not contradict the application of more stringent requirements in terms of health, safety, etc. provided it is applicable under European Law.\n\n### **2.4.2 Declaration of compliance.**\n\nThe requirements outlined in this analysis have been interpreted based on the guidelines provided by the European Union Platform on Sustainable Finance in the document *Final Report on Minimum Safeguards* of October 2022.1\n\n### **a. Human rights**\n\nMeliá Hotels International has spent years working on the consolidation of a management and governance system for human rights, the process began with the publication of its Human Rights Policy, approved by the Board of Directors in July 2018 and which expressly outlines its express commitments in relation to this field.\n\nThe Company has assumed the universal cornerstones for the protection and defence of these rights, such as the Principles of the Global Compact —an entity it has been a member of since 2008— and the Human Rights of the United Nations. It also follows and applies other international reference frameworks in the business sector (the International Charter of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as well as the Fundamental Principles of the ILO, the Tripartite Declaration of Principles on Multinational Enterprises and the Social Policy) as well as the specific agreements of the tourist industry, as publicly outlined in the aforementioned corporate policy.\n\nRespect for human rights in accordance with international regulation is inseparable from the way that Meliá Hotels International understands management and its origins as a family business. This leads Meliá to put its commitments into practice in order to further their integration into its entire value chain.\n\nTo this end, Meliá uses its own Code of Ethics– general framework for both employees and suppliers and stakeholders–, of the aforementioned corporate policy as well as other specific approaches, also public, through its adherence to the Modern Slavery Act in the United Kingdom.\n\n{206}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6. ANNEXES**\n\nCONTENTS Since 2018 Meliá has had a Code of Ethics for Suppliers, whose aim is for suppliers to assume the commitments, principles, and values of the hotel chain from the start of the of the commercial relationship. This code arises from and is based on the general principles and commitments of the Code of Ethics of Meliá, and each supplier assumes specific commitments in relation to regulatory compliance, non-discrimination, ensuring safe work environments, zero tolerance of abuse and coercion, zero tolerance of slavery, the prohibition of child labour, the payment of fair wages, the respect for freedom of opinion and association and protection of the environment. These approaches are referenced in the 2023 Management Report in the section Good governance, ethics and integrity, which expressly mentions Meliá's due diligence with its suppliers.\n\n> Likewise, Meliá has adopted and integrated into its practices the express commitment to manage this area with due diligence and regularly review it. Three years after carrying out its first human rights self-assessment, in 2022 the Company reviewed and updated the Control Self-Assessment (CSA) in order to identify new risks and criteria relating to human rights in operations. This new approach goes a step further in the monitoring of the most demanding standards, adding the Dhaka Principles on responsible recruitment and the guidelines of the Modern Slavery Act (United Kingdom) to the approaches already included in our first self-assessment such as the Principles of the Global Compact, the guidelines of the ILO and the Guiding Principles on Human Rights of the United Nations (UN). The approach is reflected in the Governance and Management Model of human rights, included in the section on Human rights due diligence in the 2023 Management Report. This section structures Meliá's model of due diligence, in a way that aligns with the principles of the Global Compact and its goals, defining which bodies participate in the management, which internal regulations apply and which tools and levers are available to the Company to ensure due diligence.\n\nWith this update, Meliá covers different areas relating to labour rights (selection of staff, remuneration and contracting, workplace environment and health, social dialogue, supply chain and complaints channel), environment (recognised as a human right in our policy) and anti-corruption.\n\nThe exercise of regular analysis allows Meliá to measure the perception of protection and probability of violating these rights in hotel units as well as the management capacity of the management, and aware of the potential negative impact of a possible violation in our activity. The level of participation in this exercise is reflected in the 2023 Management Report, as are the risk levels and probability of a breach, no real risks of a breach are identified in the Company's portfolio.\n\nGiven that one of the key elements in human rights due diligence is offering channels that are open for complaints, in Meliá's case it is possible to consult information in this regard in the Ethics and Integrity section of the 2023 Management Report, the section which describes how it works. With regard to the complaints received through this channel, and which are directly related to human rights, the Company discloses their nature. None of the complaints received in 2023 have had a significant impact on the company from a penal, financial, or reputation standpoint. In all cases, after the investigations carried out, the relevant corrective measures have been taken, disciplinary actions in some cases, and in others, training actions or improvements in processes or procedures. None of the complaints received were linked to breaches of the rights of indigenous peoples or operations that involved child labour. This detail can be consulted in the subsection on Reporting and complaint mechanisms included in the section on Human rights due diligence. Meliá thus makes incidents relating to this matter public along with the measures taken to rectify them.\n\nIt is essential to point out that access to Meliá's complaints channel is open to any stakeholder who believes that their rights have been violated, it is publicly accessible through online and offline means. Thus, in cases of a violation Meliá undertakes proceedings for every case, involving all necessary bodies in the process with the aim of resolving and rectifying the negative impact that may have been caused.\n\nMeliá's commitment to the defence of these rights means that, if required, it will openly collaborate with the entity that requests it. Throughout 2023 Meliá has not received requests or communications in this regard. In another order of magnitude, during this year the Company has not been reported or condemned in a final ruling with regard to the breach of these rights.\n\n{207}------------------------------------------------\n\n### ABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n- **2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n- **3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n- **4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6. ANNEXES**\n\n### CONTENTS **b. The fight against corruption and bribery**\n\nThe Code of Ethics of Meliá Hotels International establishes a series of global commitments including:\n\n• Act rigorously and forcefully against any practice of corruption, fraud, or bribery\n\nOn the other hand, the Code of Ethics itself, among the commitments undertaken with public administrations, includes that of:\n\n• Not accepting or offering any kind of bribe, financial or in kind, and maintaining an attitude of actively fighting against corruption, to prevent crime and money laundering.\n\nThese commitments established in the Code of Ethics are embodied in Meliá's Anti-Corruption Policy (updated in 2021). The aim of this Policy is to establish the principles that must govern our actions as a Company, in order to prevent, detect, report, and rectify the implementation of any actions that, in accordance with the applicable legislation, may be classified as corruption or bribery, both active and passive, always in accordance with the principle of Zero Tolerance towards any of these practices. In turn, this policy makes the commitments:\n\n- To comply with legislation and regulatory obligations in Spain and at an international level.\n- Establish the mechanisms for the oversight and control of our principles, values and commitments, ensuring the condemnation of irregular conduct, in particular action will be taken against any practice of corruption, fraud and bribery.\n\n• Reject gifts and courtesies from third parties if they exceed the reasonable value of mere courtesy, nor accept any type of economic consideration, gift or invitation from our suppliers that, due to their value, may exceed the symbolic or mere courtesy.\n\nIn addition to what is outlined above, the company has a Crime Prevention and Detection Protocol whose main objective is to prevent or reduce the risks of crimes being committed, especially those that entail the criminal liability of legal persons.\n\nThis Protocol has the certification issued by AENOR which certifies that the Management System for Penal *Compliance* complies with the requirements established by standard UNE 19601:2017 (renewed in 2023).\n\nCorruption is one of the criminal offences included in our Crime Prevention Protocol for which we have identified specific checks, which are evaluated annually with the aim of mitigating this criminal risk.\n\nThe company also has other internal Policies and Regulations, all included in our Crime Prevention Protocol, establishing guidelines or instructions targeted at preventing Corruption, including, for example:\n\n- The Regulatory Compliance Protocol (*Compliance*), through which the company assumes the commitment to comply with national and international legislation and regulatory obligations, as well as with its internal regulations and the commitment to ensure that the internal regulations and actions of its executives and management are based on ethical criteria aligned with the principles and values of the company and its Code of Ethics.\n- The Philanthropy Policy which expressly prohibits contributions to political parties and their foundations, no matter what type (financial or in kind), this Policy extends to trade unions, individuals, or initiatives promoted in a private capacity.\n- The Hotel Administration and Internal Control Regulation establishes clear guidelines aimed, among other things, at avoiding corruption and fraud in different internal processes.\n\nTo ensure the functioning of the Code of Ethics, as well as the internal Policies and Regulations, Meliá has Complaints Channels (internal for employees and external for third parties) through which it is possible to report conduct (active or passive) that is contrary to the content of the Code of Ethics, or any other regulations, this conduct specifically includes corruption, bribery, fraud, etc.\n\nThe Company also has an Internal Audit Department which, acting as a third line of defence, reviews compliance with internal policies and regulations, and each year it reviews the Crime Prevention Protocol with the aim of ensuring the correct and effective implementation of the controls established in the Protocol. In 2023 it produced a total of 199 auditing reports, with a\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n### **1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6. ANNEXES**\n\nCONTENTS global scope, providing coverage to all regions, areas, and businesses of the companies. As a result of these reviews, and based on the result of the audits carried out, no practice was detected in 2023 that could expose the company to a crime of corruption or fraud.\n\n**c. Taxation**\n\nTaxation is a critical part of corporate responsibility and is overseen by the Board of Directors of MHI. Thus, the Board of Directors approves the Tax Strategy and monitors its implementation and the management of tax risks, at least, once a year. Among other key aspects, the Tax Strategy defines compliance with the law as fundamental, in both letter and in spirit. MHI publishes its tax strategy on its corporate website.\n\nThe company has defined regulations, internal control processes and a complaints channel to ensure tax compliance. Periodic reviews of compliance with tax obligations are carried out and there is an organisational structure with appropriate means, including a professional team that receives ongoing training.\n\nMHI has a corporate structure aligned with the business and appropriate to legal requirements and corporate governance standards, and does not use instrumental organisations in tax havens.\n\nAlso, MHI also has a strong commitment to transparency in relation to tax matters according to reports by independent experts, and it publishes information on its tax strategy and the taxes it pays.\n\nTax risk management at MHI is reflected in the existence of internal processes, systems and controls (ICFR, key controls, etc.). The Tax Department, as the body for tax *compliance* is responsible for managing the Group's tax risks and it has implemented processes that, along with robust information management systems, ensure the reliability and traceability of information and minimise the chance of human error in this area.\n\n### **d. Competition law**\n\nMeliá Hotels International plays a leading role in the tourist sector. This implies it must act with due and necessary responsibility in regard to healthy competition with other players in the tourism value chain. This desire leads Meliá to set the objective of contributing to sustainable tourism development as a means of driving progress and well-being in society, actively collaborating with industry organisations and maintaining a relationship of respect and transparency with its competitors.\n\nGenerally, Meliá has set very clear communication, marketing and sales targets in this regard that lead it to create and maintain links with all of its stakeholders, providing them with open, accurate, clear and transparent information on its mission, strategy, objectives and achievements. This communication is also aimed at enhancing its corporate reputation through an accurate and appropriate depiction of the Company's image and establishing and maintaining the communication channels required to guarantee all stakeholders the opportunity to participate in its leadership and reputation.\n\nThus, Meliá's commitments to the tourism industry and its competitors are therefore mainly aimed at exercising its leadership in a responsible and ethical way given the impact and repercussions its behaviour as a leading company may have on the industry.\n\nThus, the company avoids any type of practice that could directly or indirectly be considered contrary to freedom in regard to establishing contracting conditions in the markets in which it operates. In fact, during 2023 no sanctions were received in relation to any of the markets in which it markets or provides its services.\n\nAdditionally, the company's conduct also helps to protect and enhance the reputation of the industry, therefore it actively participates and shares its knowledge and good practices in local, domestic and international forums, associations and other relevant entities and institutions, in order to strength-\n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6. ANNEXES**\n\nCONTENTS en its own positioning, as reflected in the 2023 Management Report in the section called We listen to our stakeholders, among which Meliá includes its competitors. The Impact on the environment section identifies different areas and business and non-business bodies of which the company forms part, which are part of the objective to promote its leadership and share its ideas and good practices.\n\n> Its presence in these environments leads it to responsibly exercise its role as a leading company in the tourist sector, avoiding the adoption of positions that could harm the sector and actively collaborating in actions that, carried out jointly, enable the continued development of the tourist industry and improvement of its reputation, whether on a local, regional, national and/or supranational.\n\n> Meliá maintains a dialogue with other companies in the industry that promotes listening and active collaboration, regardless of whether or not they are competitors. Thus, Meliá acts in good faith, ethically and honestly, to foster cordial and mutually beneficial relationships within the industry, bearing its competitors in mind and refraining from attracting customers or gathering customer information using unethical methods. This leads Meliá to even involve competing companies in the definition of its own material issues, as outlined in the 2023 Management Report in the Materiality section.\n\n> Meliá communicates and markets its products and services in an honest and ethical way, avoiding misleading advertising actions. This is an essential element for Meliá given that its customers are its raison d'être. That is why its ethical conduct standards lead it to comply with all of the applicable regulations in each of the countries in which it provides or markets its services.\n\nTo use the best available systems to guarantee the protection of data and information provided by customers, acting at all times with due diligence and responsibility in the processing of that data, with a special focus on data protection as outlined in the Cybersecurity section of the 2023 Management Report, a key area with regard to its technological development and for which its teams receive training in view of its importance.\n\nFurthermore, Meliá markets its products and services in a correct, transparent, truthful and honest way, avoiding misleading advertising or any other practice that may confuse or deceive customers. The fact the company has such high levels of loyalty and a strong NPS confirm that its customers perceive the transparency and quality in the company's value proposition, as shown very clearly in the sections on Brand architecture and Customer experience in particular. In this regard, the company also offers customers channels with clear information on the characteristics of its services, contracting conditions and prices, as well as channels through which customers can make claims or complaints if appropriate.\n\nThus, with clear focus on digitalisation, Meliá promotes the marketing of its services through its own channels, allowing direct contact with customers, end consumers and professionals, and it promotes its own customer loyalty programmes, whether individual or corporate. In this regard, Meliá provides its teams with the required training and development in order to adapt to changes in the marketing of its products, especially training on digital tools.\n\nWith regard to the ethical management of its partnerships, Meliá assumes the commitment to not establish commercial relationships with third parties that do not share its values, or that breach any legally established obligation in a demonstrable way as outlined in the section on Good governance, ethics and integrity in the 2023 Management Report, or in any of the approaches.\n\nLastly, Melia organises regular training and other initiatives aimed at raising awareness among staff about competition issues and how to communicate and market our products and services, both on our own channels (Website, App, Contact Center) and with third parties, OTAs, tour operators, etc. in order to ensure that the information provided is honest, transparent and ethical and that there is no disparity on the different channels. All employees access courses on our digital learning platform, when they join in order to obtain the\n\n203\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\nCONTENTS necessary information on competition before undertaking their work at the company. In the Contact Center, for example, our teams of agents who specialise in assisting, via phone, chat, or email, our customers who are in the process of booking and/or modifying a current booking, receive a PCI Audit each year - which evaluates the efficiency of the service provided and especially the processes for data processing and communication with customers.\n\nImage /page/210/Picture/3 description: The image shows the text \"1.

This category includes the purchase of electricity, district heating and district cooling.\n\n### **SCOPE 3**\n\nGiven the nature of our business model, Scope 3 emissions are very significant in our activity. Thus, following recommendations and best practices, we continue to make progress in measuring our Scope 3 footprint, which includes all the following categories in our value chain:\n\n### **Category 1: purchase of goods and services**\n\nIndirect emissions in this category are estimated through an input/output economic analysis, using a proprietary tool and the emission factors from the database for CEDA 5 calculations (Complete environmental data sheet v5.0. CEDA provides information on emissions in the life cycle per monetary unit spent on goods and services).\n\nThe methodology for calculating emissions first breaks down the annual expense for each group of items purchased in the year of the report, taking into account the company code assigned to each group, and making it possible to differentiate between OPEX and/or CAPEX. Secondly, the cost of each group of articles is multiplied by the emission factor that best fits its denomination in the CEDA data.\n\nBelow is the main data used for the calculation of category 1:\n\n- This category includes all upstream emissions from the production of all goods or services purchased or acquired in the reporting year.\n- It includes materials (tangible products) and services (intangible products).\n- Source: Database of purchase organising companies.\n- The emission factors used from CEDA 5 (Complete environmental data file v 5.0.\n\n## **Category 2: equipment/capital assets**\n\nIndirect e missions in this category have been estimated through an input/ output economic analysis, using a proprietary tool with this method and the emission factors from the database for CEDA 5 calculations (Complete environmental data sheet v5.0. CEDA provides information on emissions in the life cycle per monetary unit spent on goods and services).\n\n{217}------------------------------------------------\n\nABOUT THIS REPORT\n\n**1.** MELIÁ IN 2023\n\n**2.** BUSINESS MODEL\n\n**3.** GOOD GOVERNANCE, ETHICS AND INTEGRITY\n\n**4.** COMMITMENT TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n**5.** SOCIAL VALUE GENERATION\n\n**6.

Secondly, the cost of each group of articles is multiplied by the emission factor that best fits its denomination in the CEDA data.\n\n> Below is the main data used for the calculation of category 2, equipment and/or capital assets purchased:\n\n- This category includes all upstream emissions caused by equipment and/or capital goods acquired in the reporting year.\n- Source: Database of purchase organising companies.\n- The emission factors used from CEDA 5 (Complete environmental data file v 5.0\n\n### **Category 3: fuel and energy consumed by the company (not included in scope 1 and 2)**\n\nThese emissions are the ones associated with fuel and energy consumed that are not included in scopes 1 and 2. We calculate these emissions due to the fact that our fuel and energy consumption is a significant part of scope 3 emissions.\n\nWe used the AEI database (2018 version) and followed the updated Standard to use electricity emission factors and grid loss data obtained from global emission data sources (IEA, DEFRA and individual countries) to calculate transmission and distribution losses and emissions associated with the extraction, production and transportation of fuel.\n\n### **Category 5: waste**\n\nThe emissions associated with the management of waste generated on site are calculated taking into account the emissions derived from its treatment by third parties (recycling, composting, dumping and incineration).\n\nThe emissions associated with the management of waste generated on site are calculated based on their treatment: recycling, composting, landfill disposal and incineration; and the emission factors for each of them.\n\n### **Category 6: business trips**\n\nScope 3 emissions associated with business travel are obtained from the air travel report provided by our partner American Express Global Business Travel:\n\n• Emissions associated with flights based on the number of kilometres travelled and the emission factor provided by DEFRA (Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs).\n\n### **Category 7: commuting to work (employees)**\n\nIn order to calculate the emissions associated with the commute of our employees worldwide, we created a survey in 2019 to collect data on the distance each of them travels every day from their home to their workplace, the means of transport they use and the number of trips they make each day.\n\nUsing this information and based on the emission factors obtained from the GHG Protocol, we have calculated the total emissions for 2022.\n\n### **Category 11: Use of sold products**\n\nIt includes the scope 1 and 2 emissions from hotels that we provide a management service to.\n\n{218}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/218/Picture/1 description: The image shows the words \"TABLE OF CONTENTS\" in a light gray color.

Comparative information\".\n- Amendment to IAS 12: \"Tax Reform Pillar 2 Model Rules\"\n\n{229}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe accounting policies applied are consistent with those of the previous year, considering the adoption of the standards and interpretations mentioned above which have no greater impact on the consolidated financial statements or the financial position of the Group, except for the described impacts of the amendments to IAS 12 (see Note 19).\n\nThe amendments to standards issued and approved for use in the EU prior to the formulation date of these consolidated annual accounts, and which will enter into force in subsequent dates, are the following:\n\n• Amendment to IFRS 16: \"Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback\".\n\nIt is not expected that the adoption of the abovementioned standards will have significant impacts on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### 2.2. True Image\n\nThese Consolidated Annual Accounts have been prepared on the basis of the internal accounting records of the parent company, Meliá Hotels International, S.A., and the accounting records of the rest of the companies included in the scope of consolidation as detailed in Annex 1 and Annex 2, duly adjusted according to the accounting principles established in the IFRS adopted by the EU; and fairly present the equity, financial position and results of operations of the Company, and the cash flows for the related year.\n\n#### 2.3. Comparability\n\nThese consolidated annual accounts include the figures for year 2023 and, for comparison purposes, those for year 2022, of each of the items in the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Statement of Comprehensive Income, Statement of Changes in Equity and the Cash Flow Statement, all of them in consolidated form.\n\n#### 2.4. Alternative Performance Measures\n\nThe main alternative performance measures (APM) used by the Company are listed below, as well as the basis on which they are calculated, such measures being regarded as the measures of future or past financial performance, financial position or cash flows.\n\n#### Key financial indicators\n\nThe Group uses various subtotals from the EBIT. These subtotals are broken down in the Consolidated Income Statement, where their reconciliation in relation to the EBIT can be observed, as well as their comparative values.\n\n- EBITDAR: Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, Amortisation, & Rent. EBITDAR allows comparability among the hotel business units operated by the Group, regardless of the method through which the operation rights were acquired.\n- EBITDA: Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation & Amortisation. It offers an estimate of the net cash flow from operating activities. To this end, this indicator is also reported as a subtotal in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.\n\n#### Other financial indicators\n\n• EBITDAR and EBITDA without capital gains: The purpose of this indicator is to offer a measurement of the Company's operating income, excluding certain results from the property segment mainly related to the variation of the fair value of investment property and the asset rotation. Revenues and expenses derived from those activities are excluded from the calculation of EBITDA without capital gains, giving rise to revenues without capital gains, measurement used to calculate margins without capital gains.\n\n{230}------------------------------------------------\n\n| The reconciliation of EBITDAR and EBITDA without capital gains for year 2023, in relation to the subtotals reported in the<br>consolidated income statement, is as follows:             |           |             |          |          |

It measures the average price per room reached by a hotel in a specific time frame and provides valuable information as for price dynamics and type of customers of a specific hotel or group of hotels. Thus, this measurement is widely used in the industry and by the management team in order to estimate the prices the Company can charge based on the type of customer. Likewise, the changes applied to the average price per room have a different impact on revenues as well as on the business profitability in comparison with those applied to the occupancy rate. The result of the ARR calculation for 2023 and 2022 is as follows: 2023 2022 Room Income 1,123,977 969,332Occupied Rooms 7,085,809 6,524,586ARR (euros) 158.62 148.57\n\n|                | 2023      | 2022      |\n|----------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Room Income    | 1,123,977 | 969,332   |\n| Occupied Rooms | 7,085,809 | 6,524,586 |\n| ARR (euros)    | 158.62    | 148.57    |\n\n• RevPar (Revenue per available room): Revenue per available room is the result of dividing the total room revenue (see Note 7.1) by the number of available rooms. The management team uses this indicator to evaluate the business performance, since it is correlated with the two key indicators of the operations of a hotel or group of hotels: the occupancy rate and the average price per room.\n\n{232}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Likewise, the RevPar is used to measure and compare the performance in comparable periods between similar hotels.             |            |            |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n|                                                                                                                               |            |            |\n| The result of the RevPar calculation for 2023 and 2022 is as follows:                                                         |            |            |\n|                                                                                                                               | 2023       | 2022       |\n| Room Income                                                                                                                   | 1,123,977  | 969,332    |\n| Available Rooms                                                                                                               | 10,465,526 | 10,589,298 |\n| RevPAR (euros)                                                                                                                | 107.40     | 91.54      |\n|                                                                                                                               |            |            |\n| This indicator has improved compared to the previous year, in line with the increase in occupancy rates and the ARR as stated |            |            |\n| above, as a result of the activity recovery during this year 2023.                                                            |            |            |\n|                                                                                                                               |            |            |\n\n### 2.5. Consolidation\n\n#### Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are the companies over which the Group exercises effective control, generally accompanied by more than half of the voting rights.\n\nIn addition to the shareholding percentage, when assessing whether a controlling interest is held in a company, the Group considers the following aspects:\n\n- Influence over the investee, giving the Group the ability to manage its significant activities.\n- Right to the variable returns from its shareholding in the investee.\n- Ability to use its influence over the investee to have an impact on the amount of the returns obtained.\n\nAccording to the full consolidation method, the financial statements of subsidiaries are consolidated as from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are excluded from the consolidation as from the date on which such control ceases to exist. Intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated in full.\n\n#### Associates and Joint Ventures\n\nAssociates are all companies over which the Group exercises significant influence but not control. Significant influence generally includes between 20% and 50% of the voting rights and means the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee company.\n\nJoint ventures are joint agreements in which the parties that hold joint control under such agreements hold rights over the net assets thereof. The unanimous consent of the parties sharing control is required under these agreements.\n\nAssociates and joint ventures are consolidated using the equity method. According to this method, the carrying value of the investment is recognised initially at cost, and is increased or decreased to recognise the Group's interest in the results and in the income and expenses directly recognised in equity of the associate or joint venture after the date of acquisition. The Group's investment in associates and joint ventures includes goodwill identified on acquisition.\n\nThe Group's share in profit or loss after the date of acquisition of associates and joint ventures is recognised under heading Profit / (Loss) from companies carried by the equity method in the Consolidated Income Statement, and its share in movements in other comprehensive income is directly recognised in equity, including the relevant adjustment to the carrying value of the investment.\n\nWhere the accumulated losses incurred by an associate or joint venture result in a negative equity, the Group adds the amount of any other item that may be considered to be greater in value than the net investment until said investment is reduced to zero. From that moment on, the Company takes into account any additional losses by recognising a liability, only to the extent that it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or has made payments on behalf of the investee company or joint venture.\n\nCurrently, the Group does not participate in joint ventures that must be included using the proportional consolidation method.\n\n{233}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Consistency in terms of timing and measurement\n\nAll subsidiaries included in the scope of consolidation close their fiscal year on 31 December, so the relevant annual accounts for 2023 have been used for consolidation purposes, and if the annual accounts have not yet been prepared, the corresponding accounting records have been used, once the appropriate measurement adjustments to ensure compliance with the relevant IFRS adapted by the European Union have been carried out.\n\n#### Business combinations\n\nIf the business combination is achieved in stages, the carrying value on the acquisition date of the interest in the acquiree's equity previously held by the acquirer is remeasured at fair value on the acquisition date, and any loss or profit arising from this new measurement is recognised in the income statement for the year.\n\nIn business combinations, the excess between the cost of the combination and the acquirer's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recorded as Goodwill in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nThe excess between the acquirer's interest, where appropriate, after reassessing the identification and valuation of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, and the cost of the business combination, is recognised in the income statement for the year.\n\nWhen the Group first applied IFRS, it did not apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations that occurred before the date of transition, and it availed itself of the exemption provided for in IFRS 1 \"First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards\", therefore, the existing goodwill provided for in the Spanish legislation as at 31 December 2003, net of accumulated depreciation to that date, was allocated to the goodwill under the heading Intangible Assets.\n\n#### Purchase of non-controlling interests\n\nOnce control is obtained, any subsequent operations in which the controlling company acquires more non-controlling interests, or sells interests without losing control, are accounted for as transactions with equity instruments. It follows from the above that:\n\n- Any difference between the amounts by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in consolidated equity and attributed to the owners of the controlling company.\n- The carrying value of the goodwill is not adjusted, and no gains or losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n#### Sale of controlling interests\n\nWhen the Group ceases to have control over a subsidiary, any retained interest is recognised at fair value at the date when control is lost, and the change in the carrying amount is recognised in the income statement for the year. In the case of companies owning hotels, the result is recognised as Capital gains of fixed assets in the Consolidated Income Statement (see Note 3.11). The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of the subsequent recognition of the interest retained as associate, joint venture or financial asset.\n\n#### Loss of significant influence\n\nIf the Group no longer exercises significant influence over the associate or joint venture, it measures and recognises the investment maintained at fair value. Any difference between the carrying value of the associate at the time significant influence is lost and the fair value of the investment maintained plus the income obtained on the sale is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n#### Elimination of inter-company transactions\n\nThe inter-company balances for inter-company transactions relating to loans, leases, dividends, financial assets and liabilities, sale and purchase of inventories and fixed assets and provision of services, have been eliminated. Regarding the sale and purchase transactions, the unrealised profit margin with regard to third parties has been reversed so that the corresponding assets are stated at cost, thus adjusting the depreciations carried out.\n\n#### Non-controlling interests\n\nThe proportional part of equity corresponding to the Group's non-controlling interests, calculated in accordance with IFRS 10, is recorded under this heading of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n{234}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Profit or loss attributed to non-controlling interests\n\nThis relates to the share in consolidated profit or loss for the year corresponding to the non-controlling interests.\n\n#### Translation of the annual accounts of the foreign companies\n\nAll the assets and liabilities of companies with a functional currency other than the euro and which are included in the scope of consolidation, are translated to euro at the exchange rate existing at year end.\n\nItems in the Profit and Loss Account have been translated at the exchange rates existing on the dates on which the relevant transactions were carried out.\n\nThe difference between the amount of the foreign companies' equity, including the balance of the Profit and Loss Account calculated according to the previous paragraph, translated at the historical exchange rate, and the equity position resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities as mentioned in the first paragraph, is recorded with a positive or negative sign, as appropriate, in the equity of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, under the Translation differences heading, net of the portion of such difference corresponding to noncontrolling interests, which is recorded under the Non-controlling interests item in equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments of the Balance Sheet items upon the acquisition of interests in a foreign company, are recognised as assets and liabilities of the company acquired and, therefore, translated at the exchange rate existing at year end, and the exchange differences that may arise are recognised under the Translation differences heading.\n\nUpon total or partial disposal or reimbursement of contributions of a company with a functional currency other than the Euro, cumulative translation differences since 1 January 2004 (date of transition to IFRS) relating to said company, recognised in the consolidated equity, are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement as a gain or loss on disposal.\n\n#### 2.6. Accounting Valuations and Estimates\n\nDirectors have prepared the Group's consolidated annual accounts using judgments, estimates and assumptions which have an effect on the application of the accounting policies described in Note 3, as well as on the balances of assets, liabilities, income and expenses and the breakdown of contingent assets and liabilities at the issuance date of these consolidated annual accounts.\n\nSuch estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors considered reasonable and relevant under the circumstances. The carrying amount of assets and liabilities, which is not readily apparent from other sources, has been established based on these estimates. These estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed; the effects of the reviews on the accounting estimates are recognised whether in the year in which they are realised, if they have an effect solely on such period, or in the period under review and future periods, if the review affects both periods. However, the uncertainty inherent in the estimates and assumptions could lead to results that may require an adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities affected in future periods.\n\nThe estimates made are detailed, where appropriate, in each of the explanatory notes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet captions. The estimates and judgment that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements and may involve adjustments in future years are set out below:\n\n#### Estimated impairment loss on goodwill and other non-financial assets\n\nThe Group verifies annually whether there is an impairment loss in respect of goodwill and other fixed assets, in accordance with Notes 3.1, 3.2 and 3.12. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units under lease and those other than hotels with which goodwill is associated are calculated from its value in use.\n\nOn the other hand, the recoverable amounts of cash-generating units under ownership have been determined based on the fair value estimated according to the appraisals undertaken by independent experts using valuation techniques such as expected discounted cash flows from such assets.\n\nThese calculations are based on reasonable assumptions in accordance with past yields obtained and future production and market development expectations.\n\nHowever, cash flow projections have a considerable degree of uncertainty due to the possible effects that some factors, such as the geopolitical context, inflation or environmental risks, inter alia, have on the occupancy rate and the average price per room, which may lead to adjustments in the carrying amounts of the assets of the cash-generating units in the future, in particular, of those under lease, given the significant difference between the fair value and the carrying value of most of the assets under ownership.\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Corporate income tax\n\nThe calculation of income tax requires the interpretation of the tax legislation applicable to the countries in which the Group companies operate. There are also several factors related mainly, but not exclusively, to changes in tax laws and changes in the interpretation of tax laws currently in force that require the use of estimates by the directors of the parent company.\n\nDirectors of the parent company must carry out significant estimates to determine the amount of the deferred tax assets that can be recognised, by considering the amounts and the dates on which future taxable profits will be obtained and the reversal period of the taxable temporary differences.\n\nWhere there is an uncertainty in relation to the income tax treatments, the Group assesses whether a tax authority is likely to accept an uncertain tax treatment. If it concludes that the tax authority is likely to accept an uncertain tax treatment, the effect of the uncertainty on the taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses and unused tax credits or the corresponding tax rates is reflected. The effect of the uncertainty is reflected using the method that, in each case, better foreshadows the resolution of the uncertainty: the most probable amount or the expected value. In each case, the Company makes an assessment of whether each uncertain tax treatment must be considered separately or jointly with another or several uncertain tax treatments, in line with the approach that better foreshadows the resolution of the uncertainty.\n\nNote 19 includes the breakdowns regarding the corporate income tax estimates.\n\n#### Fair value of derivative financial instruments\n\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using measurement techniques, as specified in Note 3.5. The Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based mainly on market conditions at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. Most of these measurements are obtained from the financial institutions with which the instruments were contracted or are determined by reference to the fair value of the asset from which these derive.\n\n#### Fair value of investment property\n\nThe Group uses the fair value method in measuring investment property. The estimation of this fair value is mainly carried out based on the appraisals undertaken by independent experts using valuation techniques such as expected discounted cash flows from such assets, as well as regular updates of the Company based on such studies.\n\n#### Post-employment benefits\n\nThe cost of defined benefit pension plans is calculated using actuarial valuations. Actuarial valuations require the use of assumptions on discount rates, asset yields, salary increases, mortality tables and rotation, as well as the retirement age of employees with right to these benefits. These estimates are subject to significant uncertainties due to the long-term settlement of these plans.\n\nThe valuation of these commitments has been calculated by reputable independent experts using actuarial valuation techniques. Note 16.2 gives details of the assumptions used to calculate these commitments.\n\n#### Inflation and exchange rate to be applied to the consolidation of Venezuelan subsidiaries\n\nIn October 2021, Venezuela replaced the Bolívar soberano (VES), which was applied until such date, with the Bolívar digital (VED), by dividing the value of the new currency by 1,000,000 (VED 1 = VES 1,000,000).\n\nHowever, since 2017 and due to the ongoing complex political and economic situation in the country, the Company considers that the different official exchange rates do not reflect the economic situation of the country and, therefore, decided to internally estimate the exchange rate that is most appropriate for the consolidation of the financial statements of its subsidiaries in Venezuela.\n\nThis estimated exchange rate, based on the high inflation to which the price of goods and services of the country are subjected, has been calculated based on the last official exchange rate of 2014, updated according to the corresponding inflation rate in each period from then on.\n\nThe inflation considered for this calculation in 2023 has been 185.71%; 256.03% in 2022, both estimates based on studies carried out by independent experts. The Central Bank of Venezuela has published inflation figures for 2023 of 193%.\n\nThe Group will continue to assess the political and economic situation in the country in order to adopt any change in the exchange rate which may be applicable for the consolidation of its Venezuelan subsidiaries.\n\n{236}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 2.7. Cash Flow Statements\n\nThe consolidated cash flow statement includes the cash movements during the fiscal year, calculated by the indirect method. The expressions used in the consolidated cash flow statement have the following meanings:\n\n- Cash flows: Inflows and outflows of cash or other cash equivalents, these being understood to be investments for a period of less than 3 months with high liquidity and low risk of changes in value.\n- Operating activities: These are the activities that constitute the main source of ordinary income of the Group, as well as other activities that cannot be classified as investment or financing.\n- Investment activities: The acquisition, sale or other disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash and cash equivalents.\n- Financing activities: Activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the equity and of liabilities of a financial nature.\n\nCash flows from operating activities include the capital gains generated by asset rotation activities, if transactions are carried out during the year, while the net carrying amount of the assets disposed of is recognised under the heading Investment activities.\n\nIn relation to lease payments, the total amount of the cash flows paid in each fiscal year is divided between principal (included in financing activities) and interest (included also in financing activities).\n\n## Note 3. Accounting Policies\n\n#### 3.1. Intangible Assets\n\n#### Goodwill\n\nGoodwill generated on consolidation represents the difference between the acquisition price of fully consolidated subsidiaries and the Group's interest in the market value of identifiable assets and liabilities of subsidiaries.\n\nGoodwill generated in acquisitions prior to the date of transition to IFRS is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net value recorded as of 31 December 2003.\n\nGoodwill is not depreciated. Instead, goodwill review studies are carried out annually to identify any impairment losses. Impairment losses are recognised if the recoverable value, determined based on the current value of future expected cash flows of the cashgenerating units associated with goodwill and discounted at a rate which considers the specific risks of each generating unit, is lower than the amount initially assigned. Impairment loss recognised for goodwill shall not be reversed in subsequent periods. These measurements are carried out internally. Note 9 includes details regarding their calculation.\n\n#### Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets relate to several software applications, as well as transfer rights and industrial property.\n\nSoftware applications are valued at cost price or production cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life of 5 to 10 years. Software maintenance-related expenses are recognised as an expense when incurred.\n\nThe investments in technological innovation incurred by the Group in producing identifiable and unique software programmes controlled by the Group are included under this heading. In addition, these comply with the following conditions:\n\n- The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.\n- The Company intends to use or sell the intangible asset.\n- The Company can use or sell the intangible asset.\n- It can be demonstrated how the intangible asset will generate probable future financial benefits.\n- Adequate technical, financial and other resources are available to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset.\n- The expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be reliably measured.\n\n{237}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software programmes include the labour cost of the staff developing the programmes and a suitable percentage of general costs.\n\nTransfer rights relate mainly to the acquisition costs of operating and management rights for various hotels and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the term of the agreements related to these rights.\n\nInvestments carried out in trademarks, which are initially recognised at cost, are not amortised as their useful life is indefinite. The remaining items included in industrial property are amortised on a straight-line basis over a five-year period.\n\nAt each year end, the Group assesses whether there is an indication of impairment loss of this type of assets, and if so, the recoverable amount of these assets is estimated according to the methodology described in Note 3.2.\n\n### 3.2. Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost, including transaction costs, plus the financial expenses directly attributable to the acquisition, construction and renovation incurred to bring the assets into operating conditions, if any, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses according to the provisions of this Note.\n\nThe repairs which do not extend the useful life or the production capacity of the assets and the maintenance expenses are charged directly to the Consolidated Income Statement. Costs that extend or improve the useful life of the assets or can only be used with the item of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as an increase in their value.\n\nThe Group depreciates its property, plant and equipment by the straight-line method over the years of estimated useful life, as follows:\n\n| Buildings          | 40-50 years |\n|--------------------|-------------|\n| Plant              | 15-18 years |\n| Machinery          | 10-18 years |\n| Furniture          | 10-15 years |\n| Software           | 3-8 years   |\n| Vehicles           | 5-10 years  |\n| Other fixed assets | 4-8 years   |\n\nSuch depreciation, however, is adjusted for those assets associated with lease contracts, which are depreciated over the shorter of the assets' useful life and the lease term.\n\nThe useful life and residual value of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each Consolidated Balance Sheet date, specifically considering whether climate-related risks require a change in the useful life and residual value of assets. Land is not subject to systematic depreciation since it is considered to have indefinite useful life, however it is subject to impairment tests.\n\nThe Other fixed assets heading also includes the amount of the inventory of spare parts valued at realisable value. Breakages and losses are recorded as Disposals, and their cost is recognised under heading \"Other operating expenses\" in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n#### Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nAt each year end, the Company assesses whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. An asset's or cash-generating unit's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cash-generating unit's fair value less costs to sell and value in use, and is determined individually for each asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Regularly, the Group obtains valuations carried out by independent experts of the fair value of its owned hotel assets whether operated by the Company or leased to third parties, as well as certain hotels under lease. Such valuations are completed with the valuations made internally.\n\nWhen determining the value of the assets, the valuation criterion most used by the experts is the discounted cash flow, since hotel investments are generally valued according to the potential future income. In certain cases, other valuation methods are used, such as the comparable method or the residual value method. The latter method is mainly used to value plots and land.\n\nAt the end of the years in which valuations by independent experts are not obtained, the Group assesses whether there is an indication that its tangible assets may be impaired. For owned hotels, the Group considers whether there is any indication that they have suffered an impairment loss mainly based on the operating result of the various cash-generating units, as well as observable external sources of information revealing that the value of the asset during the period has decreased more than expected as a consequence of the passage of time or its normal use, due to changes that may have occurred in the environment in which the hotel operates. In addition, other factors such as geopolitical circumstances, economic situation or natural disasters that may affect the recoverable amount of such assets are taken into account.\n\n{238}------------------------------------------------\n\nIf such indication exists, or when annual impairment test for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset's recoverable amount on the basis of the methodology used in the last valuation carried out by the independent expert for the relevant asset or cash-generating unit.\n\nIn assessing value in use, the Group projects future cash flows by considering the budget approved by the governing bodies of the Company for 2024, and applying growth assumptions that are consistent with the market in which the asset operates and its historical performance for a period of 10 years and estimating a residual value according to a long-term growth rate not higher than the expected growth of the economy and the sector in which the asset operates. In the case of assets under lease, cash flows are projected for the estimated term of the lease, as described in Note 3.12. Estimated future cash flows are discounted using a discount rate before taxes which reflects changes in the value of money over time in the current market and the specific risks of the asset which have not been adjusted in the estimated future cash flows, mainly the risks of the business and the country in which the asset is located, as well as the significant climate risks that may affect it.\n\nWhere the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and its carrying value is reduced to its recoverable amount. Losses due to impairment of ongoing activities are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the expense category in accordance with the function of the impaired asset.\n\nAn assessment is made each year end as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. This increase cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in previous years. This reversal is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year. After such reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset's revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.\n\n### 3.3. Investment Property\n\nThe investments carried out by the Group to obtain lease income or capital gains, and which generate cash flows independently of the other assets held by the Group, are recorded under this heading.\n\nAfter the initial recognition made for the total amount of the costs related to the asset acquisition transaction, the Group has chosen the application of the fair value model, therefore, all investment properties are recognised at fair value, and any upward and downward changes in fair value occurred are included under headings \"Other operating expenses\" and \"Capital gains of fixed assets\" in the Consolidated Income Statement. In the case of disposals of investment property, the difference between the fair value of the agreed consideration and the carrying amount is included in heading \"Capital gains of fixed assets\" in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nAt each year end, the Group updates the fair value assessment of each property, either through the valuation made by an independent expert, or by contrasting the main variables used in the last available valuation made by the expert with updated information. The best evidence of the fair value is the current prices in an active market for similar properties. Where this information is not available, future discounted cash flows are estimated, on the basis of the budget approved by the governing bodies of the Company for the next year, and applying growth assumptions in line with the market in which such asset operates.\n\n### 3.4. Segment Reporting\n\nInformation on operating segments is presented according to the internal information as provided to key decision-makers within the Group. Key decision-makers means the Senior Executive Team (SET), which is responsible for allocating resources and evaluating performance of operating segments. The SET is a collegiate body consisting of the Chief Officers of each General Management and the CEO (Chief Executive Officer).\n\n#### 3.5. Financial Instruments\n\nThe Group recognises financial assets or financial liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheet when it becomes party to the contractual clauses of the related instrument.\n\n#### Financial Assets\n\nFinancial assets within the scope of IRFS 9 are classified, according to the valuation criteria, as financial assets at amortised cost, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, and financial assets at fair value through profit and loss. The classification in one category or another will depend on the characteristics of the financial asset's contractual cash flows and on the management model of the Company used to manage such assets.\n\n{239}------------------------------------------------\n\nFinancial assets are initially measured at fair value, except for trade receivables, which are measured at their transaction price if they do not have a significant financial component.\n\n#### Financial assets at amortised cost\n\nThis classification includes the amounts recorded under the Trade and other receivables heading, and all the collection rights included in headings Other non-current financial assets and Other current financial assets.\n\nSuch assets are subsequently recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or are impaired.\n\nNon-current deposits and guarantees are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, however they are not discounted, since the effect of the restatement would not be significant.\n\nThese assets are maintained in order to obtain contractual cash flows and they only give rise to principal and interest payments on the outstanding principal amount.\n\n#### Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss include held-for-trading financial assets acquired for the purposes of selling them mainly in the short term, as well as unlisted equity instruments of companies over which no control or significant influence is exercised.\n\n#### Operations involving the assignment of financial assets\n\nThe Company derecognises an assigned financial asset when it assigns the contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated by the asset or, even when retaining such rights, it assumes a contractual obligation to pay them to the assignees and the risks and rewards associated with the ownership of the asset are substantially transferred.\n\nIn case of assignment of assets in which the risks and rewards associated with the ownership of the financial asset are substantially retained, the assigned financial asset is not derecognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and a related financial liability is recognised for an amount equal to the consideration received, which is subsequently measured at amortised cost. The assigned financial asset continues to be measured according to the same criteria applied prior to the assignment. The income derived from the assigned asset and the expenses derived from the related financial liability are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement without offset.\n\n#### Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe Company applies a simplified approach when calculating the expected credit losses of financial assets at amortised cost and, where appropriate, a value adjustment for the expected credit losses over the entire life of the asset is recognised at each closing date. To do that, the Group has established a matrix of provisions based on its history of credit losses, adjusted by the prospective factors specific for such assets.\n\nDue to the characteristics of the main sector in which the Company operates, the customers of the hotel segment have minimal risk of insolvency.\n\nIn relation to the Vacation Club customers, the Company can terminate the contracts, therefore, the impact of the cancellation of such receivable would also imply the derecognition in the accounts of liabilities pending to be executed.\n\n#### Financial Liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities within the scope of IRFS 9 are classified, according to the valuation criteria, as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss, and financial liabilities at fair value through other comprehensive income. These liabilities are initially recognised at fair value adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. All non-derivative financial liabilities of the Group are included within the category Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.\n\nFinancial expenses deriving from financial liabilities are recognised as they accrue.\n\nThe Group derecognises financial liabilities when the obligations giving rise to them cease to exist.\n\n#### Issuance of debentures and other marketable securities\n\nDebt issues are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, less directly attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost applying the effective interest method. Bonds with a maturity exceeding twelve months are classified as non-current liabilities, while those with shorter maturity than that are included under current liabilities.\n\n{240}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Interest-bearing loans and borrowings\n\nAll loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received, net of any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement associated with these loans.\n\nAfter initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n#### Bank loans and credit facilities\n\nLoans are initially recognised at the amount received, net of transaction costs. After initial measurement, they are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n#### Trade creditors and other payables\n\nTrade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n#### Lease liabilities\n\nNote 3.12 provides information on the valuation method and accounting policies regarding this type of liabilities.\n\n#### Other financial liabilities at amortised cost\n\nThe remaining financial liabilities that relate to payment obligations as detailed in Note 13, are also measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. However, financial liabilities with short-term maturities and which have no contractual interest rate are measured at their face value provided the effect of not adjusting the cash flows is not material.\n\n#### Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are classified as financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or as accounting hedges, with the latter relating to financial assets or liabilities at fair value through other comprehensive income. In both cases, derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which they are arranged, and this fair value is regularly adjusted. Derivatives are carried as assets, under the heading Other financial assets, when the fair value is positive and as liabilities, under the heading Other financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. They are classified as current or non-current depending on the estimated timing of cash flows.\n\n#### Accounting Hedges\n\nThe Company has opted to continue to apply the requirements on accounting hedges under IAS 39, in accordance with paragraph 7.2.21 of IRFS 9.\n\nThe Company applies hedge accounting to those operations in which the hedge is expected to be highly effective; that is, when the changes in the fair value or in the cash flows of the items covered by the hedge are offset by the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging instruments with an effectiveness comprised between 80% and 125%. In addition, at the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedged item and the derivative financial instrument designated for that purpose is formally documented.\n\nThe Group has various interest rate swaps classified as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are reflected in equity, under the heading Other measurement adjustments, being allocated by the part considered an effective hedge to the Consolidated Income Statement insofar as the item being hedged is also settled. The fair value is entered in the accounts according to the date of trade.\n\nThe fair value of interest rate swaps is determined through the discounted cash flow measurement technique according to the characteristics of each contract, such as the face amount and the collection and payment schedule. The discount factors used to obtain said value are calculated based on the curve of the zero-coupon rates obtained from the deposits and rates listed in the market on the date of measurement. The resulting fair value is adjusted for the own credit risk and that of the counterparty, according to IFRS 13. These values are obtained from studies carried out usually by the financial institutions with which the Group has contracted these instruments.\n\n{241}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting\n\nAny profit or loss arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives which do not qualify to be classified as hedging instruments are directly recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year. The fair value of these derivative financial instruments is obtained based on studies carried out by independent experts, particularly appraisals of non-financial assets when the derivative arises from a purchase option.\n\n#### 3.6 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\n\nIf there are assets which carrying value is expected to be recovered through a sale rather than by means of their continued use, such assets are recorded under the heading Non-current assets held for sale.\n\nThey are recognised at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The Company recognises an impairment loss for initial or subsequent write-down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell. The Company recognises a gain for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell of an asset, but not in excess of the cumulative impairment loss that has been recognised.\n\nIn the Consolidated Income Statement, income and expenses from discontinued operations are presented separately from the income and expenses from continued operations, under profit/(loss) after taxes. Assets held for sale are not depreciated.\n\nThe non-current assets that are for sale, within the asset rotation segment, but which are still operated by the Group until their sale, are not reclassified under this heading in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are maintained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet according to their nature.\n\n#### 3.7. Inventories (Commercial Inventories, Raw Materials and Other Supplies)\n\nRaw and ancillary materials are measured at their average acquisition cost, which is generally lower than their net realisable value, any necessary measurement adjustments being made in case their estimated realisable value is lower than their cost. The acquisition price includes the amount included in the invoice plus all additional expenses incurred until the goods are stored in the warehouse. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the costs estimated to be incurred in the selling processes.\n\n#### 3.8. Treasury Shares\n\nTreasury shares are presented as a decrease in the Group's equity and are stated at cost without carrying out any measurement adjustments.\n\nGains and losses obtained on disposal of treasury shares are recorded directly against equity.\n\n#### 3.9. Government Grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised at fair value only when there is a reasonable certainty that the conditions for receiving the grant will be fulfilled and such grants will be effectively received.\n\nWhere the grant relates to an expense item, it is taken to the income statement over the period necessary to match the grant, on a systematic basis, with the costs to be offset by the grant.\n\nWhere the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is recognised as deferred income and is taken to the income statement based on the expected useful life of such asset.\n\n#### 3.10. Provisions and Contingencies\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Group:\n\n- Has a present obligation, legal or implicit, because of a past event.\n- It is probable that an outflow of funds including economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.\n- A reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nProvisions are carried at the present value of the best possible estimate of the amount needed to settle or transfer to a third party the obligation. Adjustments due to updating the provision are recognised as a financial expense as they accrue. Provisions maturing in one year or less with a non-significant financial effect are not discounted.\n\nProvisions are reviewed at each Consolidated Balance Sheet date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimate of the liability at such date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties relating to the obligation.\n\n{242}------------------------------------------------\n\nOn the other hand, contingent liabilities are the possible obligations, arising from past events, the materialisation of which is subject to the occurrence of future events which are not entirely under the Group's control, and those present obligations, arising as a result of past events, which are not likely to give rise to an outflow of resources for their settlement or which cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. These contingent liabilities are not recognised in the accounts, but are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated annual accounts (see Note 21).\n\n### Post-employment benefits\n\nPost-employment plans are classed as defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans.\n\n### Defined contribution pension plans\n\nDefined contribution plans are those plans under which the Group makes fixed contributions to an independent entity and does not have any legal, contractual or implicit obligation to make additional contributions if the independent entity does not hold sufficient assets to satisfy the commitments assumed.\n\nContributions are recognised as employee benefits when they accrue.\n\n#### Defined benefit pension plans\n\nPension plans that are not defined contribution plans are considered as defined benefit plans. In general, defined benefit plans fix the amount of the benefit that the employee will receive on retirement, usually based on one or more factors such as age, number of years of service and remuneration.\n\nThe Group recognises in the Consolidated Balance Sheet a provision for defined benefit awards established in collective bargaining agreements in an amount corresponding to the difference between the present value of the committed benefits and the fair value of any assets linked to the benefit commitments which will be used to settle the obligations, less any past service costs still not recognised, if any.\n\nIf an asset results from the above-mentioned difference, its valuation may not exceed the current value of the economic benefits that may be available in the form of reimbursements from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nPast service costs are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement unless they involve non-vested rights, in which case they are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the period remaining to the vesting of the past service rights.\n\nThe current value of the obligation is determined using actuarial calculation methods and unbiased financial and actuarial assumptions that are mutually compatible. The Company recognises directly in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the profits and losses arising from the change in the current value, and, where applicable, the plan assets, as a result of the changes in actuarial assumptions or adjustments made on the basis of experience.\n\nCertain collective bargaining agreements in force and applicable to some Group companies establish that permanent staff for a specified number of years employed by the Company who opt to terminate their employment contract will be entitled to a cash award equal to a number of monthly salary payments which is proportional to the number of years of service. During the fiscal year, an assessment of these commitments has been performed in accordance with the actuarial assumptions contained in Group's own rotation model, by applying the calculation method known as the projected unit credit method and the population assumptions corresponding to the PER2020 tables.\n\nThe balance of provisions, as well as the capitalisation of payments for future services, cover these acquired commitments, based on an actuarial analysis prepared by an independent expert. This valuation is detailed in Note 16.2.\n\nThe Group has duly externalised the pension commitments and obligations stipulated in collective bargaining agreements subject to the Ministerial Order of 2 November 2006. Assets related to these externalisation operations are recognised as a reduction in the balance of the acquired commitments.\n\n#### 3.11. Revenue Recognition\n\nThe operating revenues arising from contracts with customers are recognised as the obligations undertaken with such customers are met by the Company.\n\nWhen recognising such revenues, the 5-stage analysis included in IFRS 15 is carried out, in order to determine the amount and the moment of revenue recognition for each of the contracts with customers of its operating segments:\n\n- Identification of the customer's contract.\n- Identification of the performance obligations.\n- Determination of the transaction price.\n- Allocation of the price to the various performance obligations.\n- Revenue recognition according to the fulfilment of each obligation.\n\n{243}------------------------------------------------\n\nSuch revenues are shown net of discounts, refunds and value added tax. The Group bases its return estimates on past results, having regard to the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specific circumstances of each agreement.\n\n#### Sale of rooms and other related services\n\nRevenues deriving from the sale of rooms are daily recognised based on the services provided by each hotel establishment and including \"in-house\" customers, i.e. those that are still lodged at the hotel at the time daily production is closed. For this type of contracts, the only execution obligation identified is that of the own hotel service, which includes making available the hotel rooms to the customers.\n\nWhere the hotel rate includes services such as food and beverage (breakfast, half board or full board), an additional execution obligation is identified, to which a differentiated price is allocated on the basis of the expected cost plus a margin approach. It is worth mentioning that in hotels marketed only under all-inclusive regime (mainly located in America), this is not considered as a differentiated service, however, for the purposes of breakdown, a percentage of the rate is allocated to item 'revenues for food and beverages'.\n\nIn any case, the execution obligations undertaken with hotel customers are considered as fulfilled over time, during the stay of the customer in the establishment, and the Group recognises the daily revenues corresponding to the services consumed by the customer on that date.\n\nWithin the hotel business segment, the Company manages the customer loyalty programme \"Meliá Rewards\", which consists of rewarding customers who stay in hotels or use services provided by associates and joint ventures, through a series of points that are exchangeable for rewards such as, among other things, free stays in hotels managed by the Group.\n\nIf a hotel customer is member of the loyalty programme and accumulates points for his/her stays, a differentiated performance obligation is identified, to which an amount is allocated depending on the fair value of such points, and will be met at the time the member of the programme uses the points obtained, by deferring until such time the recognition of revenues in the Consolidated Income Statement of the Group, for the amount allocated to such obligation.\n\nAdditionally, other services provided directly by the hotels, such as rent of rooms, organisation of events, rent of commercial premises to third parties, etc... are included under heading 'Other business revenues' in the table included in Note 7.1 to these consolidated annual accounts and are recognised depending on the IRFS applicable at the time in which the service is rendered.\n\n#### Provision of hotel management services\n\nWith regard to contracts with hotel owners for the management of their establishments, there are several performance obligations identified in each of the contracts. The main obligation of the Group in such contracts is to provide hotel management services for these establishments. The consideration for these services is established as a percentage of the amount of the total revenues and the Gross Operating Profit (GOP) generated by the management of the Group. Every month, the Company recognises the corresponding revenues in the Consolidated Income Statement depending on the progress of both magnitudes for each of the hotel management contracts, according to the contractual terms and conditions set out in each of them.\n\nThe other performance obligations differentiated in the hotel management contracts relate to services linked to such activity, such as fees for reservations made through the own channels of Meliá Group, or licences for use of own or centrally managed software applications. The Company recognises the revenues from the provision of these services as these obligations are met which, in the case of fees for reservations, coincide with the customer's stay in the hotel.\n\nThese revenues are broken down in Note 7.1 to these consolidated annual accounts.\n\n#### Sale of vacation club units\n\nWith regard to the contracts for the sale of vacation club units, the Group has identified as a performance obligation the provision of the marketed units to Club customers in their corresponding weeks. Regardless of the contract term, such obligation is considered to be met when the customer uses such weeks, moment in which the revenues are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. The Group distributes the consideration received in proportion to the number of weeks included in the contract, deferring the recognition of revenues, net of the costs incurred in obtaining them, until the moment of use and recognising the amount of non-used weeks under heading 'Capital grants and other deferred income' in liabilities of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which are weighted taking into account the percentage of rights not used based on the historical performance of the portfolio of vacation club customers.\n\nThe consideration agreed in most of these contracts with customers of the vacation club includes the payment of interest derived from the deferred payments agreed in such contracts. The Group recognises the revenue from such interest over time when the right to receive it is generated, since the customers have the possibility to pay in advance the outstanding amounts.\n\n{244}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Fixed assets capital gains\n\nThe Company actively manages its real estate assets portfolio. In general, these are sales transactions for asset rotation which can be organised through the direct sale of the asset or through the sale of the company owning such asset. The net income of such transactions is shown under heading Operating revenues as Fixed assets capital gains and is calculated as set out in paragraph 71 of IAS 16, by deducting from the fair value of the consideration received the carrying amount of the assets disposed of. Likewise, the increase in the fair value of investment property is recognised under this heading in the Consolidated Income Statement, as stated in Note 3.3.\n\nLikewise, this operating segment of the Company includes sales transactions and/or the contribution of hotels to associates and joint ventures for the purposes of maximising present and future cash flows of this portfolio. These transactions involve the derecognition of the hotels in the consolidated annual accounts and the recognition of the consideration received, whether in cash or the retained interest, or a combination of both.\n\nThe Group recognises the retained residual interest in such hotel businesses at fair value, taking any change in the carrying value to the income statement, as detailed in Note 2.5. Therefore, the recognised capital gains tally with the obtained capital gains.\n\n#### Lease income\n\nIncome deriving from leases of investment properties is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and is included as operating revenues under the asset management segment.\n\n#### Interest income\n\nInterest income is recognised using the effective interest method for all the financial instruments measured at amortised cost. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts payments made and received in cash estimated over the expected life of the financial instrument. Interest income is recognised as financial income in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n### Dividends\n\nIncome from dividends is recognised when the right of the Group to receive the corresponding payment is established.\n\n#### 3.12 Leases\n\nThe Group assesses at inception of an agreement whether the agreement contains a lease. If this is the case, the corresponding lease liability and right of use are recorded. Otherwise, the lease payments are recognised as an operating expense as the economic benefits of the leased assets are realised.\n\nThe lease liability is initially calculated as the present value of the fixed or substantially fixed lease payments which have not been disbursed on that date, discounted by using an incremental rate during the minimum non-cancellable period, and considering the extension options that can reasonably be exercised and the periods with option to terminate that are not reasonably possible to exercise.\n\nThe initial recognition of the right-of-use asset includes the initial measurement of the liability, including the payments made before the start of the lease and the initial direct costs, discounting the rewards received. It is a common practice to establish clauses in hotel lease contracts that require some payments to improve the asset by the lessee. In such circumstances, these improvements are not specific and are included as further payments to be discounted, affecting both the liability and the right of use.\n\nSubsequently, the right of use is measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The depreciation period is the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset, whichever occurs first. Additionally, the value is adjusted if new measurements of the liability are made due to circumstances affecting the amounts of the payments or the lease term. Some of these changes require a review of the discount rate used.\n\nThe Group applies IAS 36 in order to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and recognises any impairment losses identified.\n\n{245}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Company has applied the following accounting policies, estimates and criteria:\n\n#### Scope\n\nThe Company applies the low-value exemption for lease contracts which underlying assets do not exceed USD 5,000 and the short-term exemption for lease contracts with a duration of less than one year. Lease and non-lease components are not separated in those assets in which these components are not likely to affect the total lease value.\n\nThe Company considers that the hotel management agreements are not within the scope of IRFS 16 application and, therefore, management revenues are recognised under IFRS 15 (see Note 3.11).\n\n#### Lease payments\n\nIn addition to fixed (or, basically, fixed) payments included in lease contracts, the Company includes in lease payments the following circumstances:\n\nMost hotel lease contracts include a contingent payment based on the consumer price index of the country in which the asset is located, which usually is reviewed every year, and is applied to the payments due, with lease liabilities and rights of use being recalculated based on such review. The index value at the date of lease inception is considered in the calculation of the lease payments.\n\nIn lease contracts with variable payment for which a minimum lease payment is set for defined periods, this amount is considered in the initial calculation, with the amount of the variable payment exceeding such minimum lease payment being recognised as an expense under heading Leases in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n#### Lease term\n\nRegardless of the date of execution of the agreement, for the purposes of recognition in the Group's consolidated financial statements, the initial date of the agreement is considered to be the date on which the hotel is effectively occupied, and which, in general, corresponds to the opening date.\n\nThe Company considers the minimum non-cancellable term as the initial term set forth in the lease contract, without including the potential extensions if they are unlikely to be exercised. In order to determine whether an extension will be exercised with reasonable certainty, some key features have been defined and taken into account by the Group to determine whether there are economic rewards that justify such exercise: payments not adjusted to market conditions, investments to be made and the particularity of the hotel asset, among others.\n\n#### Discount rate\n\nGiven the difficulty in setting the interest rate implicit in hotel lease contracts, the Group has decided to calculate the incremental borrowing rate as applicable to each agreement. The model for the calculation of incremental rates is based on a risk-free rate, the asset's economic context risks (country) and the risk inherent in the Company, all this weighted by the temporary value of cash flows as determined in the schedule of minimum lease payments stipulated in each lease contract.\n\n#### Impairment of right-of-use assets\n\nIn general, right-of-use assets do not generate separate cash inflows, therefore, their impairment assessment must be made as part of a cash-generating unit and, consequently, the Group adjusts the calculation of the recoverable amount of such cash-generating unit as described in this Note. In this respect, the Group excludes from the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit the lease liabilities and also excludes from the calculation of the value in use the payments linked to such liabilities. By contrast, the Group includes in the calculation of the value in use the variable payments since they are not included in the lease liability, as well as the lease renewal payments when the term thereof is shorter than the cash flow projection period of the cash-generating unit.\n\nIn assessing value in use, the Group projects future cash flows by considering the budget approved by the governing bodies of the Company for 2024, net of tax, and applying growth assumptions that are consistent with the market in which the asset operates and its historical performance for the remaining period, until a period equal to the lease term is completed. The discount rates used in determining the recoverable amount are also adjusted in a way consistent with the underlying cash flows and the corresponding cashgenerating unit, affecting such cash flows with the specific risks of the assets which have not been adjusted in estimated future cash flows, mainly business risks and those of the countries in which the assets are located, as well as significant climate risks that may affect them.\n\n{246}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 3.13. Corporate Income Tax\n\nThe corporate income tax expense for the year is calculated as the sum of the current tax in each of the subsidiary companies included in these consolidated annual accounts, excepting the existing 3 consolidated tax groups, which parent companies are: Meliá Hotels International, S.A., Sol Meliá France S.A.S. and Inversiones Explotaciones Turísticas, S.A. that are treated as one unit each.\n\nThis calculation arises from the application of the corresponding tax rate to the tax base for the year, after applying the existing tax credits and deductions, plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded. This amount is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, unless the tax relates to items recognised directly in consolidated equity, in which case the corresponding tax expense is also recognised in consolidated equity.\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are the estimated amounts payable to or receivable. The tax rates used are those in force at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date.\n\nItems for which the tax determination is uncertain but for which it is probable that future cash outflows to a tax authority will occur, are recognised in provisions. These provisions are measured at the best estimate of the amount that is expected to be paid in relation thereto. The assessment is based on the opinion of tax professionals within the Company with prior experience on this matter and, in certain cases, with the advice of independent experts.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated for all the temporary differences existing at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date as the difference between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities and their tax bases.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset the current tax assets with current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and on the same taxable entity, or different taxable entities which intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, unless the temporary difference arises from goodwill for which depreciation is not deductible for tax purposes, or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction, except in the case of a business combination, which affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.\n\nLikewise, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except when the following conditions are jointly met: the parent company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference; and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered by the generation of sufficient taxable profits against which the deferred tax asset and carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be used, excluding the deductible temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, except in the case of a business combination, which affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.\n\nLikewise, deferred tax assets for all deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, are only recognised when the following conditions are jointly met: it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be used.\n\nAt each Consolidated Balance Sheet date the recovery of the deferred tax assets is reviewed and adjusted to the amount which is expected to be recovered based on the taxable profit available, calculated according to prudence criteria and excluding the potential profits deriving from the disposal of properties, given the uncertainty concerning their realisation dates, which depend on market conditions, and the different tax consequences depending on the nature of the transactions carried out.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on their expected materialisation and on the tax legislation and tax rates approved, or substantively approved on the Consolidated Balance Sheet date.\n\n#### 3.14. Transactions in Foreign Currency\n\nDebit and credit balances in foreign currency are measured at the exchange rate in force on the transaction date and at the end of the year are translated at the exchange rate then in force.\n\nExchange differences are treated as income or expenses in the year in which they occur, except for those arising from financing transactions granted to subsidiaries abroad which have been considered as an increase in the value of the net investment in such businesses since the settlement of such transactions is not foreseen or likely to occur, as provided for in IAS 21 \"The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.\"\n\n{247}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 3.15.

At the end of 2023 and 2022, the Venezuelan economy was classified as hyperinflationary, since it meets the<br>characteristics of the economic environment laid down in IAS 29 \"Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies\".                                                                                                                                               |            |            |\n| Consequently, the Balance Sheets of the Venezuelan companies in the scope of consolidation have been restated based on a current cost<br>approach that reflects the effects of changes in the price indices on their non-monetary assets and liabilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |            |            |\n| Likewise, the increase or decrease in purchasing power resulting from the application of the change in the price index to the net<br>monetary position is taken to the Income Statement of these companies. The restatement effect on the current monetary unit of the<br>remaining items of the profit and loss account of Venezuelan companies is also included in the Income Statement.                                                                                                                                              |            |            |\n| For the purposes of enhancing the true image of the consolidated financial statements and given the obvious economic link between the<br>recognised impacts due to hyperinflation and the devaluation which are recorded in the country in recent years, the Group presents the<br>two effects in the consolidated equity, by recognising both the effect of the restatement of non-monetary items and the effect of the<br>differences arising from the conversion into euros, directly under the heading Retained earnings in equity. |            |            |\n| The accumulated impacts of both magnitudes broken down separately for 2023 and 2022 are shown below:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |            |            |\n| (Thousand €)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n| Asset Revaluation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 320,985    | 328,142    |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | (500,079)  | (505,174)  |\n\nThere are no other companies within the scope of consolidation which are considered as hyperinflationary economies at the end of 2023 and 2022.\n\n### Note 4. Financial Risk Management Policy\n\nThe General Policy for Risk Control, Analysis and Management of Meliá Group establishes the core principles and guidelines that govern the activities for control and management of risks, both financial and non-financial, faced by the Group. This policy establishes a reduced tolerance for financial risks; therefore, mitigation of risks is a priority in the management of this type of risks in order to minimise the potential adverse effects of these risks on the consolidated annual accounts. The actions planned in such management are reviewed and updated periodically.\n\nThe Group's activities are mainly exposed to several risks: market risk (interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk), liquidity risk, credit risk, environmental risks and geopolitical risks. The Meliá Hotels International Group, through the management it conducts, tries to minimise the potential adverse effects of these risks on the consolidated annual accounts.\n\nAdditional information on these risks is provided below:\n\n### 4.1.

Foreign Exchange Risk\n\nThe Group operates internationally and, therefore, is exposed to exchange rate risks on transactions in foreign currencies.\n\nForeign exchange risk arises from commercial, financial and investment transactions, as well as from the translation of the financial statements of subsidiaries which are denominated in a functional currency other than the presentation currency of the Group.\n\nDespite not having financial instruments contracted (swaps, foreign exchange insurance), in order to mitigate these potential risks, the Group develops policies aimed at maintaining a balance between cash collections and payments of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nThe table below includes a sensitivity analysis carried out based on the appreciation and depreciation against the euro of the main currencies in which the Company operates, mainly the US dollar, on pre-tax profit or loss and on equity of relevant subsidiaries (showing with a plus sign a greater expense and a decrease in the consolidated equity) assuming that all other factors remain the same:\n\n{249}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |        | 2023     |        | 2022     |  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|--------|----------|--|\n| (Thousand €)                                                                                                                                                                                                                | +10%   | -10%     | +10%   | -10%     |  |\n| Profit & Loss                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 5,246  | (5,246)  | 9,278  | (9,278)  |  |\n| Equity                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 62,866 | (62,866) | 57,658 | (57,658) |  |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |        |          |        |          |  |\n| 76% of the Group's financial debt is mainly denominated in Euros (74% in 2022), with 24% of the debt being denominated in other<br>currencies (26% in 2022), thus adjusting to the cash generation in different currencies. |        |          |        |          |  |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |        |          |        |          |  |\n\n### 4.3.

Price Risk\n\nPrice risk of the Group's inventories mainly arises from the fluctuations in the price and the availability of food and beverages that the Group sells to its customers. However, the Directors consider that changes in prices are insignificant and are transferred to the selling price of food and beverages, therefore, the Group does not conduct price hedging transactions.\n\n{250}------------------------------------------------\n\nLikewise, the Group is exposed to equity price risks of financial investments in equity instruments. Investments in equity instruments in unlisted companies are broken down in Note 13 and are held for strategic purposes and not for the purposes of trading with them, and they are mainly focused on entities owning hotel assets. Given the reduced percentage of equity interest in these companies, in case of variations not exceeding 10% of the fair value of the assets of the entities in which the Group holds equity instruments without exercising significant influence, these would not significantly affect the carrying amount of these investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nOn the other hand, the Group has no relevant investments in equity instruments of listed companies.\n\n### 4.5. Credit Risk\n\nThe credit risk arising from the default of a counterparty (customer, supplier, or financial entity) is mitigated by the Group's policies regarding the diversification of customer portfolios, source markets, oversight of concentration and on-going in-depth debt control. In addition, in some cases the Group carries out other financial operations which allow the reduction of credit risks, such as assignments of receivables.\n\nThe Group's receivable periods range between 21 and 90 days; the average period of collection of receivables in 2023 was 34.49 days; 35.62 days in 2022. The age of trade receivables at the year-end is included in Note 14.2.\n\n#### 4.6. Environmental Risks\n\nThe fight against climate change and the environment and biodiversity protection are one of the priority strategic lines of the commitment of the Group to sustainability and the protection of tourist destinations. For this reason, the Group continues to promote an efficient and responsible hotel management model, both in the consumption of resources and the minimisation of the impact of its activity.\n\nThe Group's commitment, therefore, takes on a special significance given the nature of the activity developed and the importance of tourism in the global economy, as well as its high level of dependence on social and environmental factors, such as climate and natural resources.\n\nLikewise, technology and sustainability are key to advance towards the decarbonisation of the Group's business model and achieve the public commitments acquired for reduction of the carbon footprint.\n\nProgress made in the incorporation of sustainability in the entire value chain has allowed to enrich and improve the hotel renovation and building processes, designing a differential value proposal which promotes a new hotel experience that is more attractive, more responsible and more sustainable for customers, hotel owners and the various existing partners.\n\nIn addition, in terms of management of water resources, the Group uses the tool Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, which allows to identify areas with higher risk of hydric stress globally, monitor our portfolio located in such areas and adopt the necessary preventive measures. Additionally, for the third consecutive year, the Group has voluntarily participated in the CDP Water Security, an internationally renowned ranking which measures water security and quality.\n\nLikewise, and in line with the acquired commitments in terms of the environment and working towards the achievement of the goals set, the Group continues to promote improvement measures focused on prioritising renewable energy acquisition, promoting investments aimed at reducing emissions, and permanently monitoring energy and water consumptions in order to identify deviations, improvements and corrective actions.\n\n#### 4.7. Geopolitical Risks\n\nThe Group is not indifferent to geopolitical and macroeconomic tensions. Recent conflicts around the world have not negatively affected hotel reservations as there has been no direct exposure to the countries involved.\n\nHowever, a possible extension of hostilities to other countries could threaten the global supply chain, leading to a spike in inflation and a possible extension of high interest rate monetary policies, which could affect demand.\n\nNotes 4.1 and 4.4 detail the exposure of the Group to interest rate risks and price risks, including the existing specific or natural hedging.\n\n#### 4.8. Capital Management Policy\n\nThe main objectives of the Group's capital management are to guarantee financial stability in the short and long term, to ensure the necessary liquidity for daily operations and investments, positive evolution of the Meliá Hotels International S.A.'s share value and an appropriate remuneration to shareholders through the distribution of dividends.\n\nThe financial position is also backed by the strong support of the banks and the Company's asset base. At present, 19.1% (21.3% at the 2022 year end) of the total debt relates to mortgage loans secured by the Group's assets.\n\n{251}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 4.9 Estimate of Fair Value\n\n| 4.9 Estimate of Fair Value                                                                                                                                                                                                          |         |         |                       |         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|-----------------------|---------|\n| Fair value means the amount that may be received on the sale of an asset, or paid for the transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction<br>between market participants at the measurement date.                                |         |         |                       |         |\n| Regarding assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the following hierarchy levels have been<br>established in accordance with the variables used in the different measurement techniques: |         |         |                       |         |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         |         |                       |         |\n| Level 1: Based on prices quoted in active markets<br>Level 2: Based on other observable variables in the market, directly or indirectly<br>Level 3: Based on unobservable market variables                                          |         |         |                       |         |\n| The amounts recognised at fair value as at 31 December 2023 according to the hierarchy levels are broken down below:                                                                                                                |         |         |                       |         |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         |         |                       |         |\n| (Thousand €)                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Level 1 | Level 2 | 31/12/2023<br>Level 3 | Total   |\n| Investment property                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |         |         | 117,898               | 117,898 |\n| Financial Assets at fair value:                                                                                                                                                                                                     |         |         |                       |         |\n| Hedging derivatives                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |         | 2,835   |                       | 2,835   |\n| Trading portfolio derivatives                                                                                                                                                                                                       |         | 929     | 20,399                | 21,328  |\n| Trading portfolio                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 229     |         |                       | 229     |\n| Unlisted equity instruments                                                                                                                                                                                                         |         |         | 20,954                | 20,954  |\n\nFinancial instruments included in Level 2 are measured by financial institutions and independent experts using measurement techniques, mainly, discounted cash flows, based on observable market data. They mainly relate to interest rate swap financial derivatives.\n\nInvestment property included in Level 3 is measured through discounted cash flow techniques supported by studies from independent experts and their internal updates. As mentioned in Note 11, this heading includes investments made by the Group to obtain rental income or capital gains, such as interest in three apartment owners' associations in Spain, one shopping centre in America and other land and properties in Spain.\n\nFor the purposes of estimating future cash flows, expected growth rates are considered, both in lease prices and hotel operations, as appropriate, as well as other variables not directly observable.\n\nLikewise, level 3 includes financial assets related to the purchase option of a hotel asset which value is determined by reference to its fair value estimated through an appraisal carried out by an independent expert based on the variables as described above (Note 13.3).\n\nUnlisted equity instruments are detailed in Note 13.1.\n\n{252}------------------------------------------------\n\n| For comparison purposes, the balances recorded in the different hierarchies at the end of 2022 are included below: |         |         |            |         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|------------|---------|\n|                                                                                                                    |         |         | 31/12/2022 |         |\n| (Thousand €)                                                                                                       | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3    | Total   |\n| Investment property                                                                                                |         |         | 114,893    | 114,893 |\n| Financial Assets at fair value:                                                                                    |         |         |            |         |\n| Hedging derivatives                                                                                                |         | 6,705   |            | 6,705   |\n| Trading portfolio derivatives                                                                                      |         | 1,808   | 13,668     | 15,475  |\n| Trading portfolio                                                                                                  | 1,594   |         |            | 1,594   |\n| Unlisted equity instruments                                                                                        |         |         | 19,517     | 19,517  |\n| TOTAL ASSETS                                                                                                       | 1,594   | 8,513   | 148,077    | 158,184 |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value:                                                                               |         |         |            |         |\n| Trading portfolio derivatives                                                                                      |         | 25      |            | 25      |\n\n## Note 5. Scope of Consolidation\n\nThe companies that comprise the Group present individual annual accounts, according to the regulations applicable in the country in which they operate.\n\nDetails of the companies included in the scope of consolidation as at 31 December 2023 are included in Annex 1 and Annex 2, which are classified as subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.\n\nMeliá Brasil Administraçao, which corporate purpose is the hotel management, operates various hotels under management. As the hotels under management are properties in joint ownership and are not legally authorised to carry out operating activities, Meliá Brasil Administraçao has assumed the operation of such hotels on behalf of the joint owners, given the requirements of local regulations. Income and expenses arising from the operation of these establishments are not included in the Consolidated Income Statement, since the risks and revenues arising therefrom are returned to the joint owners. Only income arising from the management of these establishments is included in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nThe Tunisian company, Tryp Mediterranee, in which Meliá Hotels International, S.A. holds an 85.4% stake, is in dissolution process and therefore, is excluded from the Group's scope of consolidation since, currently, the Group has no control or significant influence over this company during such process.\n\nThe Group holds a 19.94% stake in the Venezuelan companies El Recreo Plaza C.A. and El Recreo Plaza & Cia. C.A. through the direct stake of 20% held by its subsidiary holding company MIA Exhold, S.A. and, therefore, the equity method is applied since the Group has significant influence.\n\nThe companies Ayosa Hoteles S.L., S'Argamassa Hotelera, S.L. and Meliá Hotels Orlando, LLC are fully consolidated, although only 50% or less of the voting rights are held. This is because the Group considers that it has the capability to control the variable yields of such companies through the hotel management contracts that the Group has entered into with them.\n\n### 5.1. Business Combinations\n\nIn 2023 and 2022, no business combinations have taken place.\n\n### 5.2. Other Scope Changes\n\nIn 2023, the following changes have been made to the scope of consolidation:\n\n### Additions\n\nOn 31 May 2023, the companies Fuerteventura Beach Property, S.L., Santa Eulalia Beach Property, S.L. and Hoteles Marmel, S.L. (formerly Starmel Hotels OP2, S.L., see Note 5.3), in which Meliá Hotels International, S.A. holds a 20% stake, were included in the consolidated group of the Meliá using the equity method, with a valuation of EUR 17.5 million, an amount paid by Meliá Hotels International, S.A. This \n\n{253}------------------------------------------------\n\namount includes EUR 4.2 million of contributions from shareholders. These 3 companies own 2 hotels in Fuerteventura and 1 hotel in Ibiza, which are operated by Meliá Group under lease.\n\nOn the other hand, in the second half of the year, Detur Panamá, S.A. was fully consolidated following the purchase of an additional 50% of the hotel asset owned by this company. This hotel establishment, valued at EUR 5.3 million as at 31 December 2023, is closed since 2020.\n\nIn addition, two new companies Peturoliso, S.L.U. and Soici Nefsol, S.L.U. have been incorporated with 100% shareholding, with no significant impacts on the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n### Disposals\n\nDuring the first half of 2023, the dissolution of the company Golf Katmandú, S.L. took place, in which the Group held a 50% stake, and which was accounted for using the equity method.\n\nThe company Third Project 2012, S.L., wholly owned by the Meliá Group, was also liquidated.\n\nAt year-end, Mosaico Hoteles S.A., a company in which the Group held a 35% stake and which until now was accounted for using the equity method, merged with Homasi, S.A., a company in which the Group also held a 35% stake, and which was also accounted for using the equity method.\n\nThese disposals have not had significant impacts on the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n#### Acquisition of additional stake in companies accounted for using the equity method\n\nThe Group has increased its stake by 0.494% in the Owners' Association of Meliá Costa del Sol hotel through the purchase of three apartments. In addition, the stake in the Owners' Association of Meliá Castilla has increased by 0.417% hotel through the purchase of four apartments. These transactions have not had significant impacts on the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFor comparison purposes, changes in 2022 were as follows:\n\n#### Additions\n\nDuring the second half of 2022, 100% of the company Willet Reservations SLU was acquired, the corporate purpose of which is the provision of tourism intermediation services. This transaction did not have significant impacts on the Group's consolidated annual accounts, since it was acquired following the incorporation thereof by a third party and did not have relevant net assets on the date of the transaction.\n\nIn addition, the company Holazel, S.L. was incorporated by Melia group and a third party with a 50% stake each, being it considered a joint venture, and the corporate purpose of which is the development and growth of the hotel brand \"Zel\". This transaction did not have significant impacts on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Disposals\n\nDuring the year, the companies Infinity Vacations S.A. de C.V., Operadora Costarisol S.A and Inversiones Turísticas del Caribe, S.A., wholly owned by the Group, were liquidated. These transactions did not have significant impacts on the consolidated annual accounts.\n\nIn December, the company Markserv BV, wholly owned by Meliá Group, was liquidated, and the company Sistemas Ribey Cloud, in which the Group had a 50% stake, and which was accounted for using the equity method, was dissolved. These disposals did not have significant impacts on the Group.\n\n#### Acquisition of additional stake in companies accounted for using the equity method\n\nDuring the year, the Group increased its stake by 1.21% in the Owners' Association of Meliá Costa del Sol hotel through the purchase of several apartments. This transaction did not involve significant impacts on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nLikewise, the Group acquired an additional stake in the company Mosaico Hoteles S.A, increasing its stake by 15% and without significant impacts on the Group's consolidated annual accounts.\n\n{254}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 5.3. Name Changes\n\nIn 2023 the company Starmel Hoteles Op2, S.L. was renamed Hoteles Marmel, S.L.\n\nIn 2022, no name changes took place.\n\n## Note 6. Segment Reporting\n\nThe segments included below make up the organisational structure of the company and their results are reviewed by the key decisionmakers within the Group:\n\n- Hotel management: This relates to the fees received for operating hotels under management and franchise agreements. It also includes the intra-group charges to the Group's hotels that are under ownership or under lease, as well as other services, such as commissions.\n- Hotel business: The results obtained from the operation of hotel units owned or leased by the Group are included in this segment. Likewise, income generated by the food & beverage business is also included since this activity is considered to be fully integrated into the hotel business due to the majority sale of packages which price includes room and board, and therefore, a real segmentation of the associated assets and liabilities would be unfeasible.\n- Other business linked to hotel management: This segment includes additional income from the hotel business, such as casinos or tour-operator activities.\n- Real Estate: This segment includes the capital gains on asset rotation, and real estate development and operation. Likewise, it includes the income and expenses deriving from the change in fair value of investment property.\n- Vacation club: It includes the results deriving from the sale of rights of shared use of specific vacation complex units.\n- Corporate segments: These relate to structural costs, results linked to the intermediation and marketing of room and tourist service reservations, as well as corporate costs of the Group which cannot be assigned to any of the abovementioned three business divisions.\n\nThe segmentation of Meliá Hotels International is due to the diversification of operations existing in the Company based on hotel management, hotel operation, real estate and vacation club.\n\nCertain headings included in the business and geographical segmentation tables are presented in an aggregate manner, due to the impossibility of splitting them into the various specified segments.\n\nThe policies for the determination of transfer prices applied by the Company in transactions between Group companies are similar to those applied in transactions with third parties.\n\n{255}------------------------------------------------\n\n### 6.1.

These financial instruments are used to exchange interest rates, so that the Company receives variable interest from the bank in exchange for a fixed interest payment on the same face amount. The variable interest received from the derivative offsets interest payments on the financing hedged. The final result is a fixed interest payment on the financing hedged.\n\nIn 2023, the negative impact on equity of these derivative financial instruments, after taking the portion pertaining to the hedged item to the income statement and without considering the tax impact, amounted to EUR 3.7 million. In 2022, the impact was positive for the amount of EUR 8 million.\n\nLikewise, as at 31 December 2023, the notional value of the interest rate swaps that qualify as hedges amounted to EUR 114 million, and in 2022 such value amounted to EUR 141.5 million.\n\nHeading Trading portfolio derivatives assets in the short term includes the fair value for the amount of EUR 20.4 million (EUR 13.7 million as at 31 December 2022) of the derivative associated with the purchase option, with the date for its execution being extended by one year, on one hotel in Spain, which has increased its value according to the appraisal carried out during the year.\n\nThe other trading portfolio derivatives assets and liabilities at the end of 2023 relate to interest rate swaps contracted in the framework of the interest rate risk management performed by the Company (see Note 4.1). These interest rate swaps are not considered as accounting hedges because they do not meet the requirements for their application according to IFRS 9.\n\n{277}------------------------------------------------\n\n| As at 31 December 2023, except for the derivative associated with the purchase option, the notional value of these financial

In 2023, the estimated accrued amount was EUR 11.6 million, with an impact of EUR 1.7 million on the income statement for 2023. In 2022, the total amount accrued was EUR 11.6 million, with an impact of EUR 2.2 million on the income statement.\n\nThe assessment of these commitments undertaken by the Company has been conducted in accordance with the actuarial assumptions of the model which pertains to the Group, using the calculation method known as the Projected Unit Credit and the demographic assumptions established by the PER2020 tables, using a capitalisation rate of 3.70%, and a salary increase assumption of 3.04%.

In the said test, the activity recovery during the year and the expectation of activity recovery at the levels before the health crisis, which is included in the budget approved by the governing body of the Group for 2024 and in the projections for the years of the lease term, have led to a greater value in use of such cash-generating units and, therefore, to a reversal of impairment of the assets associated with the mentioned units.\n\nThe discount rates used in the said test have been determined for each lease contract on the basis of the weighted average cost of the capital (WACC) per country, adjusted to reflect the lower cost associated with the lease liabilities.

Tax Situation\n\nThe companies within the Group are subject to the tax legislation applicable in the countries in which they carry out their activities. Current tax regulations in some of these countries do not coincide with the Spanish regulations. As a consequence of the above, the information included in this Note should be construed in the light of the peculiarities of the applicable tax regulations for the benefit of legal entities, with reference to applicable tax bases, tax rates and deductions.\n\n#### \"Pillar 2\" Draft Legislation\n\nThe Government of Spain, where the parent company is incorporated, has published a draft legislation - pending parliamentary procedure - for the implementation in Spain of the 15% minimum taxation (EU) Directive (the \"Pillar 2 Draft Legislation\"), which provides for its application in respect of financial years beginning after 31 December 2023. Pursuant to this Pillar Two Draft Legislation, the parent company will be obliged to pay, in Spain, a supplementary tax on the profits of its subsidiaries that are taxed at an effective tax rate of less than 15%. In addition, some of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates have Pillar Two rules sufficiently implemented, which allow a domestic minimum tax to be levied on the tax shortfall up to 15%.\n\nThe Group has analysed the potential exposure to additional taxation arising from the Pillar 2 Draft Legislation, based on country-bycountry reports and financial statements of the Group companies. According to the analysis performed, the effective tax rate for Pillar Two purposes in most of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates is above 15%. However, the Group believes that the safe harbour rules may not apply in Cuba, where the effective rate could be less than 15%. Nevertheless, the Group does not expect exposure to additional taxation arising from Pillar 2 rules to be significant in any jurisdiction.\n\nThe Group continues to assess the impact of the future Supplementary Tax rule in Spain and the Pillar 2 rules in the jurisdictions in which it operates on its future financial performance.\n\n{288}------------------------------------------------\n\nUnconstitutionality and invalidity of Royal Decree-Law 3/2016, of 2 December, adopting tax measures aimed at consolidating public finances and other urgent social measures (\"RD-Law 3/2016\").\n\nThe Constitutional Court has considered RD-Law 3/2016 as unconstitutional and invalid in its ruling of 18 January 2024 (unconstitutionality issue 2577-2023).\n\nAmong others, the mentioned RD-law established greater restrictions on the offsetting of negative tax bases (BINS [according to its acronym in Spanish]) from previous years; the obligation to include a minimum annual reversal in the 2016-2020 financial years of impairment losses on holdings regardless of the evolution of the investee's equity and results; the establishment of greater limitations on the application of deductions to avoid double taxation; and a restriction on the deductibility of certain negative income deriving from the transfer of holdings.\n\nAs a result of this ruling, the Group has determined the following accounting treatment for income tax in Spain:\n\nRecognition of current tax liabilities and assets for the year 2023: The Group has determined the 2023 Income Tax in accordance with the applicable tax legislation, excluding the provisions declared as unconstitutional.\n\n### 19.1.

Status of the Main Tax Inspections and Litigation\n\nThe main inspections and litigation processes of a tax nature for the Group which could have a negative impact on the Group, take place in America; in particular, the following stand out:\n\n- Litigation in Mexico in relation to Income Tax assessments for 2012 issued against Corporación Hotelera Hispano Mexicana, S.A. de C.V. The purpose of the process is the adequacy of the documentary evidence to prove and apply certain tax losses. The figures under discussion amount to MXN 481 million (EUR 25.6 million).\n- Litigation in Mexico in relation to Income Tax assessments for 2015 issued against Operadora Mesol, S.A. de C.V. The purpose of the process is the adequacy of the documentary evidence to prove and apply certain consultancy costs. The figures under discussion amount to MXN 27 million (EUR 1.4 million).\n\nAt year end, the inspection to the tax group headed by Meliá Hotels International S.A. regarding the Corporate Income Tax from 2017 to 2019 and the Value Added Tax and withholdings and income on account for the period between November 2017 and December 2019 has been concluded.\n\nIn relation to Corporate Income Tax and as a result of valuation differences in certain transactions between Group companies, a tax assessment has been formalised with an agreement which resulted in a tax payable of EUR 2.7 million. This adjustment had no impact on the Group's income statement as the corresponding risk provision was applied.\n\nIn relation to Value Added Tax and Withholdings and Income on Account, tax assessments have been formalised without any adjustment and with no impact on the Group's income statement.\n\nIn accordance with the principles of the Group's Tax Strategy, as well as the recommendations of the Code of Good Tax Practices to which the Company adheres, the Company has proceeded to self-correct the income tax settlements for 2020 and 2021 in accordance with the assessment criteria arising from the tax audit procedure, without this self-correction having had an impact on the income statement.\n\nThe Group has adequately made provisions for any liabilities which may arise from the existing tax inspections and litigation. However, as a result, among others, of the different interpretations of the current legislation, additional liabilities may arise from an inspection. The Group assesses the uncertain tax treatments and reflects the effect of the uncertainty on the taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses or unused tax credits and the corresponding tax rates. On this account, the Group has recognised an amount of EUR 22.8 million under Other deferred tax liabilities (EUR 23.4 million in 2022).\n\n### Note 20.

On the other hand, the Group has arranged a civil liability policy (D&O) for the Group's directors and executives, under the terms and conditions that are common in insurance policies of this nature, with a premium for 2023 of EUR 298,440; EUR 297,275 in 2022. There are no share-based payments.\n\n## Note 21. Contingent Assets and Liabilities\n\nThe Group has commitments with third parties in respect of assets and liabilities not recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet given the remote probability that they give rise to an outflow of economic resources or because the commitments must not be recognised in accordance with current regulations. Such contingent assets and liabilities are detailed below by amount and item.\n\n### 21.1. Contingent Assets\n\nThe Group has claims brought against third parties for compensation for damages suffered as a result of hotel closures during the 2020 health pandemic, on which it considers there are reasonable technical grounds to obtain a favourable ruling in court. However, the Company's Directors, on the basis of prudence, do not consider that the requirements established in the applicable regulations for their recognition in the Consolidated Balance Sheet have been met for the time being.\n\n### 21.2. Guarantees and Deposits\n\nThe Group secures several operations through bank guarantees and for various items, for the amount of EUR 51.2 million as at 31 December 2023 (EUR 45.1 million in 2022).\n\nThe Group has granted collateral and bank guarantees for operations undertaken by associates and joint ventures for the amount of EUR 0.3 million (EUR 0.6 million in 2022).\n\n### 21.3. Contingent Liabilities\n\n{298}------------------------------------------------\n\nCorporación Hotelera Metor, S.A., a subsidiary which is 76% owned, is involved in a dispute with its minority shareholder, claiming that all agreements and transactions carried out with such shareholder be declared invalid. The Company has undertaken the necessary actions to ensure that the resolution of such dispute does not have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language\nversion prevails.\n\nTo the Shareholders of Meliá Hotels International, S.A.,\n\nIn accordance with Article 49 of the Spanish Commercial Code, we have performed the\nverification, with a scope of limited assurance, of the Non-Financial Information Statement\n(\"NFIS\") for the year ended 31 December 2023 of Meliá Hotels International, S.A. and subsidiaries\n(\"Meliá\" or \"the Group\"), which forms part of the Management' Report (\"MR\") of the Group.\n\nThe content of the Management' Report includes information, additional to that required by\ncurrent Spanish corporate legislation relating to non-financial reporting, that was not the subject\nmatter of our verification. In this regard, our work was limited solely to the verification of the\ninformation identified in the \"Requirements of Spanish Non-Financial Information and Diversity\nLaw 11/2018\" Appendix and the \"Report on EU Taxonomy Eligibility and Alignment\" Appendix to\nthe MR (\"the MR Appendices\").\n\nThe preparation and content of the Meliá Group's Management' Report are the responsibility of\nthe Board of Directors of Meliá Hotels International, S.A. The NFIS included in the Management'\nReport was prepared in accordance with the content specified in current Spanish corporate\nlegislation and with the criteria of the selected Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting\nStandards (GRI standards), as well as the criteria described as indicated for each matter in the\n\"Requirements of Spanish Non-Financial Information and Diversity Law 11/2018\" Appendix to the\nManagement' Report.\n\nThese responsibilities also include the design, implementation and maintenance of such internal\ncontrol as is determined to be necessary to enable the Management' Report and the NFIS to be\nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Meliá Hotels International, S.A. is also responsible for defining,\nimplementing, adapting and maintaining the management systems from which the information\nnecessary for the preparation of the Management' Report and the NFIS is obtained.\n\n{305}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International\nEthics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants\n(including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code), which is based on fundamental\nprinciples of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and\nprofessional behaviour.\n\nOur firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, which requires the\nfirm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or\nprocedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and\napplicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nOur engagement team consisted of professionals who are experts in reviews of non-financial\ninformation and, specifically, in information about economic, social and environmental\nperformance.\n\nOur responsibility is to express our conclusions in an independent limited assurance report based\non the work performed. We conducted our work in accordance with the requirements established\nin International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Revised, Assurance\nEngagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (ISAE 3000\nRevised), currently in force, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board\n(IAASB) of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), and with the guidelines published\nby the Spanish Institute of Certified Public Accountants on attestation engagements regarding\nnon-financial information statements.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from,\nand are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement and, consequently, the level\nof assurance obtained is substantially lower.\n\nOur work consisted of making inquiries of management and the various units of Meliá that\nparticipated in the preparation of the MR, reviewing the processes used to compile and validate\nthe information presented in the MR, and carrying out the following analytical procedures and\nsample-based review tests:\n\n- \n- \n\n{306}------------------------------------------------\n\n- \n- \n- \n- \n\nRegulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the\nestablishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, based on the Delegated Acts\nadopted in accordance with the provisions of that Regulation, establishes the obligation to disclose\ninformation on how and to what extent an undertaking's activities are associated with eligible\neconomic activities in relation to the environmental objectives of the sustainable use and\nprotection of water and marine resources, the transition to a circular economy, pollution\nprevention and control and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems (the\nother environmental objectives), and in respect of certain new activities included in the climate\nchange mitigation and climate change adaptation objectives, for the first time for 2023, in\naddition to the information referring to eligible and aligned activities required in 2022 in relation\nto the climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation objectives. Therefore, the\naccompanying NFIS does not include comparative information on eligibility in relation to the other\nenvironmental objectives indicated above or to the new activities included in the climate change\nmitigation and climate change adaptation objectives. Also, since the information relating to 2022\nwas not required with the same level of detail as in 2023, the information disclosed in the\naccompanying NFIS is not strictly comparable either. In addition, it should be noted that the\nBoard of Directors of Meliá Hotels International, S.A. has included information on the criteria\nwhich, in its opinion, best enable it to comply with the aforementioned obligations and which are\ndefined in the \"Report on EU Taxonomy Eligibility and Alignment\" Appendix to the accompanying\nMR. Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\n{307}------------------------------------------------\n\nBased on the procedures performed in our verification and the evidence obtained, nothing has\ncome to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFIS of Meliá Hotels International, S.A.\nand subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2023 was not prepared, in all material respects,\nin accordance with the content specified in current Spanish corporate legislation and with the\ncriteria of the selected GRI standards, as well as the criteria described as indicated in the\n\"Requirements of Spanish Non-Financial Information and Diversity Law 11/2018\" Appendix to the\nMR.\n\nThis report has been prepared in response to the requirement established in corporate legislation\nin force in Spain and, therefore, it might not be appropriate for other purposes or jurisdictions.\n\nDELOITTE, S.L.\n\ntlllu\n\nJosé Ricardo González Rosal\n\n29 February 2024\n\n{308}------------------------------------------------\n\nAuditor's report on the system of Internal\nControl over Financial Reporting (ICFR) of\nthe Meliá Hotels International Group for\n2023\n\nTranslation of a report originally issued in Spanish.

In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.\n\nTo the Directors of Meliá Hotels International, S.A.:\n\nAs requested by the Board of Directors of Meliá Hotels International, S.A. and Subsidiaries (\"the Meliá\nHotels International Group\") and in accordance with our proposal-letter of December 1, 2023, we have\napplied certain procedures to the information relating to the ICFR system included in section F of the\nAnnual Corporate Governance Report (\"ACGR\") of the Meliá Hotels International Group for 2023, which\nsummarises the internal control procedures of the Entity in relation to its annual financial reporting.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for adopting the appropriate measures in order to reasonably guarantee\nthe implementation, maintenance and supervision of an adequate internal control system and for\nmaking improvements to that system and for preparing and establishing the content of the information\nrelating to the ICFR system.\n\nIt should be noted in this regard, irrespective of the quality of the design and operating effectiveness of\nthe internal control system adopted by the Meliá Hotels International Group in relation to its annual\nfinancial reporting, that the system can only permit reasonable, but not absolute, assurance in\nconnection with the objectives pursued, due to the limitations inherent to any internal control system.\n\nIn the course of our audit work on the financial statements and pursuant to Technical Auditing Standards,\nthe sole purpose of our assessment of the internal control of the Meliá Hotels International Group was\nto enable us to establish the scope, nature and timing of the audit procedures to be applied to the Meliá\nHotels International Group's financial statements. Therefore, our assessment of internal control\nperformed for the purposes of the aforementioned audit of financial statements was not sufficiently\nextensive to enable us to express a specific opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control over the\nregulated annual financial reporting.\n\nFor the purpose of issuing this report, we applied exclusively the specific procedures described below\nand indicated in the Guidelines on the Auditors' Report on the Information relating to the System of\nInternal Control over Financial Reporting of Listed Companies, published by the Spanish National\nSecurities Market Commission (CNMV) on its website, which establishes the work to be performed, the\nminimum scope thereof and the content of this report. Since the work resulting from such procedures\nhas, in any case, a reduced scope that is significantly less extensive than that of an audit or a review of\nthe internal control system, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness thereof, or on its design\nor operating effectiveness, in relation to the Meliá Hotels International Group's annual financial\nreporting for 2023 described in the information relating to the ICFR system. Therefore, had we applied\nprocedures additional to those described below or performed an audit or a review of the internal control\nover the regulated annual financial reporting, other matters or aspects might have been disclosed which\nwould have been reported to you.\n\n{310}------------------------------------------------\n\nAlso, since this special engagement does not constitute an audit of financial statements and is not subject\nto the Consolidated Spanish Audit Law, we do not express an audit opinion in the terms provided for in\nthat Law.\n\nThe procedures applied were as follows:\n\n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n\nThe procedures applied to the information relating to the ICFR system did not disclose any\ninconsistencies or incidents that might affect the information.\n\nThis report has been prepared exclusively in the context of the requirements established by article 540\nof the consolidated text of the corporate enterprises act Corporate Enterprises Act, and by the\naforementioned CNMV Circulars, for the purposes of the description of the ICFR system in Annual\nCorporate Governance Reports.\n\nDELOITTE, S.L.\n\nPablo Hurtado March\n\n{311}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Preparation of the Consolidated Management Report and Consolidated Annual Accounts for 2023\n\nAt the meeting of the Board of Directors of Meliá Hotels International, S.A. held on 29 February 2024 (Thursday) at E-07009-Palma (Mallorca) and at the registered address, Calle de Gremio Toneleros nº 24; previously called timely and in due form and according to the provisions of Article 35 and related articles of the Company Bylaws and Article 17 and related articles of the Regulations of the Board of Directors, the Consolidated Annual Accounts and Consolidated Management Report (including the Non-Financial Information Statement) of Meliá Hotels International, S.A. for 2023 have been prepared and approved, which also incorporates by reference to a separate document the Annual Corporate Governance Report and the Annual Report on Remuneration of Directors, following the format and labelling requirements laid down by Delegated Regulation EU 2019/815 of the European Commission, unanimously by all the members of the Board of Directors.\n\nBy means of this Statement, all the members comprising the Board of Directors attending the meeting hereby prepare and unanimously approve the mentioned Consolidated Annual Accounts and Consolidated Management Report for 2023, for verification by the auditors and subsequent approval by the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nIn Palma (Mallorca) on 29 February 2024.\n\n| Signed Mr. Gabriel Escarrer Juliá                        | Signed Mr. Gabriel Escarrer Jaume                                                           |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Honorary Chairman                                        | Chairman and Chief Executive Officer                                                        |\n| Signed Mr. Alfredo Pastor Bodmer                         | Signed Ms Carina Szpilka Lázaro                                                             |\n| Director                                                 | Director                                                                                    |\n| Signed Mr. Fernando d'Ornellas Silva                     | Signed Mr. Francisco Javier Campo García                                                    |\n| Director                                                 | Director                                                                                    |\n| Signed Ms Cristina Aldamiz Echevarría González de Durana | Signed Hoteles Mallorquines Agrupados, S.L.
